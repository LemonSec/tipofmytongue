1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,240
foreign

2
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:06,960
thanks for coming to S4 Michael

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,000
appreciate it thank you thank you and

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,160
Emily Goldman and Richard harknett also

5
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:13,440
thank you Michael wrote and his

6
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,660
co-authors wrote what I found to be a

7
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:17,699
very important book called cyber

8
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:20,039
persistence Theory and the way I want to

9
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:22,320
structure this interview is we're going

10
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,720
to talk about the theory itself for 20

11
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:25,619
minutes

12
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:29,279
and then talk about how if States

13
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,380
implement this Theory like like they

14
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:33,360
seem to be doing how this will affect

15
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,280
the asset owners and critical

16
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,260
infrastructure owner operators in this

17
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:38,040
room

18
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:41,520
so maybe a good place to start

19
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,520
is that you treat cyber as a third

20
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:47,460
strategic realm there's nuclear

21
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:50,640
conventional and now cyber and one of

22
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,800
the things you write is that the Cyber

23
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,840
strategic environment is one of

24
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:58,320
exploitation not coercion can you

25
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,719
explain this difference to me yeah thank

26
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:02,879
you I you started off with one of our

27
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:06,020
major points so so I'm grateful for that

28
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:08,700
coercion if I were to describe it

29
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:12,360
comprises threats demands

30
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,659
commitment

31
00:01:14,659 --> 00:01:17,520
signaling and interaction

32
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,920
I think everybody probably who has

33
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,560
children has some sense of what coercion

34
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,159
may be on a minor scale

35
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:29,100
folks who have studied State behavior in

36
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:31,020
and through cyberspace and build data

37
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:34,140
sets of the same have found virtually no

38
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:35,700
evidence of this occurring over the past

39
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:38,400
two decades between states no coercive

40
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,500
behavior in and through cyberspace

41
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,079
cyber security scholars in the security

42
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:45,420
studies and IR Theory discipline have

43
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:49,200
made very strong arguments that cyber

44
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,540
operations themselves are very weak

45
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:54,180
coercive instruments right

46
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:56,460
we argue that the dominant behavior in

47
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:58,500
cyberspace is exploitation and

48
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:01,320
exploitation primarily takes the form of

49
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:04,140
what we call the Cyber feta complete I

50
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:06,000
would suggest that all of you have been

51
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,920
subject to one even though you may not

52
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,318
know that you have

53
00:02:09,318 --> 00:02:12,300
cyberfea complee is a limited gain at a

54
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,640
target's expense where the target is

55
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,800
either unaware unable or unwilling to

56
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,879
respond

57
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:21,540
this is important because states are

58
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:23,819
accumulating strategic gains in and

59
00:02:23,819 --> 00:02:27,200
through cyberspace via exploitative

60
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,300
campaigns not via coercive cyber

61
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:32,760
operations if you don't have a strategy

62
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,920
that aligns with the Strategic threat

63
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,620
your strategy is going to fail

64
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:39,840
well and you kind of touched on where I

65
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,840
wanted to go next if these exploitations

66
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:45,480
take place in their fate accomplice so

67
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,160
basically they happen without reaction

68
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:50,160
and page 25 you wrote in the Cyber

69
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,000
strategic environment states can advance

70
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,980
strategic level cumulative effects

71
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:59,160
without direct exchange without coercive

72
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,980
shaping or behavior and without War so

73
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:04,200
you're saying essentially that they can

74
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,840
have a strategic result

75
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,540
without ever entering war or anything

76
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:11,340
like that can you maybe give me an

77
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:13,500
example one example of where it's

78
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:16,080
happened and one example where it could

79
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,400
happen in the future

80
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:20,459
I'll give you two okay perfect of where

81
00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:22,739
it's happened and and a third way to

82
00:03:22,739 --> 00:03:24,900
think about where it might happen

83
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:27,480
North Korea is often cited as an example

84
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,760
in the last four years North Korea has

85
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,920
used cyber-enabled operations or

86
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,379
cyber-enabled operations too to

87
00:03:34,379 --> 00:03:36,120
undermine the Swift International

88
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,580
currency exchange system to exploit

89
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:41,000
International Banks to exploit

90
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,260
cryptocurrency exchanges to exploit the

91
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:45,360
bridges to those exchanges to the tune

92
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,640
of about two billion dollars over the

93
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,080
last four years if you compare that

94
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,760
historically to what they've done

95
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,980
through counterfeiting it took them 25

96
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:55,080
years of counterfeiting to accumulate

97
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,060
that same amount of wealth so in four

98
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:58,739
years they match it through cyberspace

99
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:00,780
and what do they do with those funds

100
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:03,540
they direct it toward resourcing their

101
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:06,659
ballistic missile and nuclear programs

102
00:04:06,659 --> 00:04:09,060
and we now have estimates from northern

103
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:10,860
command the folks who are shooting out

104
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:12,840
of the sky all those UFOs that are

105
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,340
flying around the U.S the United States

106
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:17,040
recently that our ground-based missile

107
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,620
defense system which

108
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:22,979
primarily was established in uh and set

109
00:04:22,979 --> 00:04:26,100
up in in Alaska for rogue States like

110
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,440
North Korea and Iran is now going to be

111
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,240
obsolete against this threat

112
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,820
so North Korea has changed the balance

113
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:34,620
of power because of their activities in

114
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:36,180
and through cyberspace

115
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:39,840
China has also maintained the balance of

116
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,220
power which is why I wanted to give you

117
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:44,220
two examples right some can can use

118
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:46,680
cyber to increase their power some use

119
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,600
it to maintain their power some use it

120
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,060
to take power away from others China in

121
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:52,979
2010 was concerned about falling into

122
00:04:52,979 --> 00:04:55,320
the middle income trap they were they

123
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,300
were an industrial economy they were

124
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,900
about to slide over into the edge of

125
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:02,220
stagnation they didn't want to lose

126
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:04,440
their great power status and so they

127
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,960
instantiated a massive campaign of

128
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,759
intellectual property threat the United

129
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:10,800
States was the primary target they

130
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,199
re-innovated a lot of that used that to

131
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:15,720
plus up their GDP and maintained a

132
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,979
growth of six percent so that they

133
00:05:16,979 --> 00:05:18,720
didn't fall into the middle income trap

134
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,940
so two really good examples of strategic

135
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:23,280
outcomes through cyber operations alone

136
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,080
independent

137
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,300
the way to think about how States might

138
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:29,940
do it in the future is to look at their

139
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:32,340
goals right states are pretty clear and

140
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:34,259
and public frankly a lot of Open Source

141
00:05:34,259 --> 00:05:37,020
material on what their strategies are

142
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:39,780
so we want to look at what their goals

143
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:41,460
and objectives are and then we have to

144
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:44,520
look back at what are our sources of

145
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,199
National Power and what are our

146
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:48,360
instruments of National Power and how

147
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,639
could they use cyber to Target those to

148
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:52,800
achieve their strategic objectives I'm

149
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,539
not going to pretend to be nearly as

150
00:05:54,539 --> 00:05:57,360
clever as cyber operators in the dens of

151
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,880
our adversaries but we've seen over time

152
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,400
that you know any given month they'll

153
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,039
come up with a new clever way to exploit

154
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:06,600
our sources of National Power or

155
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,520
instruments of National Power to reach

156
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:11,220
strategic aids for their own ends okay

157
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:12,860
so we have

158
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:15,479
exploitation happening over and over and

159
00:06:15,479 --> 00:06:16,500
again

160
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:19,259
and eventually accumulating to a

161
00:06:19,259 --> 00:06:22,500
strategic level change one of the

162
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,479
concepts that I had really difficulty

163
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:26,039
with in the book was

164
00:06:26,039 --> 00:06:28,020
you're telling us this Theory doesn't

165
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:31,020
really look at it in terms of offense or

166
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:32,220
defense

167
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:35,699
but the key term you use is initiative

168
00:06:35,699 --> 00:06:37,860
and you say initiative rather than

169
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:40,979
restraint is necessitated so maybe ex

170
00:06:40,979 --> 00:06:45,120
explain how defense can be initiative or

171
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,860
offense can be initiative or find some

172
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:48,720
way maybe to help me with this problem

173
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,840
I've had it yeah we um one of the things

174
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,000
that we emphasize is that when you have

175
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,100
a new Theory you have to have a new

176
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:58,919
lexicon new terms that go with it

177
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:01,560
because if you just adopt terms from

178
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,720
other theories your new theory is going

179
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:06,060
to get lost right so the terms offense

180
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:09,060
and defense in cyberspace in our view

181
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:11,400
are vastly overused because most of the

182
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:14,160
activity in cyberspace occurs in a

183
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,960
geopolitical condition of competition

184
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:19,440
right not crisis and not on conflict and

185
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,360
offense and defense doesn't really apply

186
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,280
well in competition

187
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,460
so what we say is that what matters in

188
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:28,919
cyberspace is you have to have

189
00:07:28,919 --> 00:07:32,160
initiative and if if I was to to Define

190
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,699
it as a noun initiative is a posture of

191
00:07:35,699 --> 00:07:37,020
anticipation

192
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:38,940
right and so what you have to do is

193
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:42,000
seize the initiative in cyberspace you

194
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,440
have to have that posture of

195
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,780
anticipation you have to take it away

196
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:47,759
from the adversary because if you have

197
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,220
the posture of anticipation they're on

198
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:52,319
the back foot and they're responding to

199
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:55,020
what you're doing if they have it you're

200
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:57,000
on the back foot so do you want to be

201
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,160
reacting or do you want to be acting in

202
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,139
cyberspace if you seize the initiative

203
00:08:01,139 --> 00:08:03,000
you're acting you're setting the tempo

204
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,039
you're driving the actions of the

205
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:06,900
adversary and that works to your

206
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:09,240
advantage well let's go back then to the

207
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:12,180
example you gave the China IP theft

208
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:15,479
example so they they would have the

209
00:08:15,479 --> 00:08:17,400
initiative as they're coming in trying

210
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:21,360
to steal the IP how would I understand

211
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,220
how we would defend

212
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:24,960
I could understand how we would react

213
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,400
and we've actually seen some of that

214
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,280
with sanctions and such but how would we

215
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,259
regain the initiative in a case like

216
00:08:31,259 --> 00:08:32,339
that

217
00:08:32,339 --> 00:08:34,740
it's a good question

218
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:35,520
um

219
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:39,539
so I I would say arguably we haven't at

220
00:08:39,539 --> 00:08:41,279
this point we tried to do so

221
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:43,799
diplomatically with President Obama's

222
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:46,339
agreement with President XI in 2015

223
00:08:46,339 --> 00:08:48,839
but if you've studied that case closely

224
00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:51,180
they say that there was a drop-off in IP

225
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:53,640
theft but then it it bumped up again

226
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,500
very quickly just a few months after so

227
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,180
that wasn't really successful

228
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:59,160
how could we do it in and through

229
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:02,220
cyberspace in this cyber strategic

230
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:04,140
environment yeah so what we what we

231
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:07,920
could do is we know where those data go

232
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,920
in in China we know what servers they

233
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,899
land on and we could corrupt those

234
00:09:12,899 --> 00:09:14,040
servers

235
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:16,320
right I'm not recommending that we do

236
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,019
that I'm not saying we have but that is

237
00:09:19,019 --> 00:09:22,560
taking the initiative back from China so

238
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,240
that what they took from us they no

239
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,640
longer can make use of we should add it

240
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,940
as a CTF Target

241
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:32,279
well again we have to be careful I don't

242
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:35,100
want to suggest I don't make policy I

243
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:37,380
write Theory but see this is where I had

244
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:39,959
trouble with the terminology because

245
00:09:39,959 --> 00:09:42,360
I can understand they're doing something

246
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,880
they're trying to steal IP you know

247
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,019
whether it be China or any country

248
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:49,680
there's trying trying to steal IP we can

249
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,360
defend to make it harder for them to

250
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,120
steal what you're talking about I would

251
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,620
consider that to be like a

252
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:57,959
counter-offensive

253
00:09:57,959 --> 00:10:00,540
you know yeah I don't I don't understand

254
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:02,279
the difference between like initiative

255
00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:04,440
and a counteroffensive it's I can

256
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,820
understand sometimes you're just trying

257
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:08,060
to protect sometimes you're trying to

258
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:11,279
degrade their ability I think or or

259
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:14,040
their benefit of it but I I still I'll

260
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,899
get off it in a second I want to try one

261
00:10:15,899 --> 00:10:19,320
more time yeah no that's okay the um

262
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:22,200
so it's not in my view counter-offensive

263
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,420
right it's again it's it's seizing the

264
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:25,920
initiative it's actually a defensive

265
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,180
action

266
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:30,660
right so so in in joint publication 3-12

267
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:33,720
which is the dod Pub that you know has a

268
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:36,420
taxonomy they talk about defensive

269
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:39,540
operations off the doden off the dod

270
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:41,100
Information Network so that's when you

271
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:42,300
are defending

272
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:45,000
outside conus basically outside the

273
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,040
United States so that's what that is for

274
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,920
me but that that's just one example of

275
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,500
of and and being initiative persistent

276
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:56,220
right another example is is adopting uh

277
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:58,680
from the defensive side

278
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:01,079
um zero trust architecture

279
00:11:01,079 --> 00:11:03,800
because zero trust

280
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:06,200
theoretically is supposed to be

281
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:09,720
constantly verifying and constantly

282
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:12,240
authenticating right that constant mess

283
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,060
to make up a word

284
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:17,279
is persistence right it's initiative

285
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:20,399
persistence so that also serves to deny

286
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:22,560
adversaries from taking advantage of

287
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,660
your vulnerabilities okay well I

288
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:26,760
promised I'd get off that day I would I

289
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:31,019
would just note that I wonder if

290
00:11:31,019 --> 00:11:33,720
uh United States or some entity going

291
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:36,120
back and attacking someone else's server

292
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,339
to destroy data they stole if they would

293
00:11:38,339 --> 00:11:39,959
view that as defense

294
00:11:39,959 --> 00:11:42,240
you know if you go into their system and

295
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,459
their servers they might they might not

296
00:11:44,459 --> 00:11:46,920
consider that defense but again maybe

297
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,540
that term doesn't exist maybe it's just

298
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:49,980
initially I would say they might not

299
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:52,320
consider it attacking attacking okay

300
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,680
right they they might consider it uh

301
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,320
grappling is the term we use in the book

302
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,720
right okay so this kind of ties in

303
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,480
though I wrote that I find this a little

304
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:06,480
bit terrifying so again you wrote

305
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,579
initiative rather than restraint is

306
00:12:08,579 --> 00:12:12,420
necessary necessitated and States face a

307
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:14,579
structural imperative to persist in

308
00:12:14,579 --> 00:12:16,380
seizing and maintaining the initiative

309
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:19,019
to set the conditions of security in and

310
00:12:19,019 --> 00:12:21,360
through cyberspace by exploiting

311
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,700
adversary vulnerabilities and reducing

312
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,220
the potential for exploitation

313
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:27,600
exploitation of Their Own

314
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,959
to me this this reminds me almost a

315
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:32,519
little bit like

316
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:34,800
The Cult of the offensive prior to World

317
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,260
War one where people said the only way

318
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:39,300
we're going to win is we got to be more

319
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,760
active we got to be out there taking the

320
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,339
initiative getting into their systems

321
00:12:44,339 --> 00:12:46,860
making sure they're not doing bad things

322
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:50,100
uh make me feel better why why should I

323
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:51,779
not be terrified that this means every

324
00:12:51,779 --> 00:12:53,220
State's going to be trying to get into

325
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:55,500
not only government systems but critical

326
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:58,920
infrastructure systems well well I would

327
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,660
suggest that Most states are always

328
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:02,519
trying to do that right that's that's

329
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:06,180
the nature of the competitive space uh

330
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:08,519
but it's not it's not like offense

331
00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:11,160
offense advantage in World War one uh

332
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:13,260
and it's really not terrifying so I'll

333
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:14,940
share an anecdote I promise to share an

334
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:17,459
anecdote when we presented this logic

335
00:13:17,459 --> 00:13:18,959
initially when Richard Hart that night

336
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:21,060
presented it to some colleagues they had

337
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:22,920
the exact same reaction

338
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:26,040
right they said this is uh well here's

339
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,660
what they said they said the logic is

340
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:31,019
absolutely compelling and and fallible I

341
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:33,420
just don't like what it suggests right

342
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:35,519
and which is which is I think where you

343
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:39,180
are and and my reaction to that was

344
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:40,860
I don't like the fact that nuclear

345
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:42,839
weapons have been pointing at me for my

346
00:13:42,839 --> 00:13:44,339
entire lifetime

347
00:13:44,339 --> 00:13:46,800
right and they point at other states and

348
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,100
yet the logic security logic of assured

349
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:52,019
second strike flows from the

350
00:13:52,019 --> 00:13:53,639
characteristics of nuclear technologies

351
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:55,560
this is the same thing for cyberspace

352
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,600
the security logic of initiative

353
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,060
persistence flows from the structural

354
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:02,279
characteristics of cyberspace for

355
00:14:02,279 --> 00:14:04,139
nuclear weapons it led to strategic

356
00:14:04,139 --> 00:14:06,660
stability or suggesting that the same

357
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:08,820
thing will happen in cyberspace the

358
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:11,639
logic flows from the technology itself

359
00:14:11,639 --> 00:14:14,399
and I think another key concept from the

360
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:17,160
book that I I picked up on was this

361
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,440
cyber agreed upon our cyber agreed

362
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,839
competition which to me sounded very

363
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:23,160
similar to what

364
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:26,279
a lot of us call cyber Norms that that

365
00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:28,860
there is a certain line that you can go

366
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:30,360
up to

367
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:33,420
where it's not going to trigger this

368
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:36,000
reaction it it the kind of your Theta

369
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,339
complete line if you do this you're not

370
00:14:38,339 --> 00:14:39,959
going to get punched back they might do

371
00:14:39,959 --> 00:14:41,459
something else but they're not going to

372
00:14:41,459 --> 00:14:43,500
respond directly and the lower line I

373
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:44,699
guess doesn't really matter because that

374
00:14:44,699 --> 00:14:46,920
can go down to zero

375
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:50,220
where are we today in cyber agree

376
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:51,480
competition

377
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,339
especially you know let's say we've got

378
00:14:53,339 --> 00:14:56,760
utilities pipelines is it agreed upon

379
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:59,279
competition that they can maintain a

380
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:02,399
presence in our grid or you know a large

381
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:05,459
pipeline or a demanufacturer it's a good

382
00:15:05,459 --> 00:15:06,720
question I'm glad you didn't ask me

383
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,279
about Norms because we'd be up here for

384
00:15:08,279 --> 00:15:10,160
hours

385
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,019
cyber agreed competition we refer to it

386
00:15:13,019 --> 00:15:15,240
as a phenomenon

387
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,740
um just like in international relations

388
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:18,839
balance of power is a phenomenon it's

389
00:15:18,839 --> 00:15:20,339
something that emerges from the

390
00:15:20,339 --> 00:15:22,680
activities of states right it's not

391
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,540
something you try to achieve it just

392
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:27,300
emerges same thing with cyber agree

393
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:30,240
competition states are competing

394
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,519
um in and through cyberspace and we say

395
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:34,980
that there is a tacit understanding of a

396
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:37,380
ceiling of use of force and armed attack

397
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:39,899
equivalence that if you breach that

398
00:15:39,899 --> 00:15:42,300
ceiling so if if you go after critical

399
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:45,839
infrastructure and you destroy it you

400
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:47,639
have breached the ceiling of agreed

401
00:15:47,639 --> 00:15:50,459
competition that changes the dynamic

402
00:15:50,459 --> 00:15:52,560
from a geopolitical condition of

403
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,019
competition to now at least militarize

404
00:15:55,019 --> 00:15:57,779
crisis and possibly arm conflict right

405
00:15:57,779 --> 00:16:00,959
so so we do think states recognize that

406
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:04,019
if you stay below that ceiling of agreed

407
00:16:04,019 --> 00:16:05,279
competition which is armed attack

408
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:08,100
equivalence or use of force you can

409
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:11,519
experiment a lot right in states are

410
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:13,440
experimenting a lot you see most again

411
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,480
most of what happens is below that

412
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:17,940
threshold now the substance we want to

413
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:19,320
be clear when we say agreed competition

414
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,000
that doesn't mean we agree with the

415
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,699
substance right normatively of what's

416
00:16:23,699 --> 00:16:25,920
going on in that space But what we're

417
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,899
suggesting is that states have agreed

418
00:16:27,899 --> 00:16:31,440
now that this is a competitive and it is

419
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,079
an active space and we are going to play

420
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:36,360
in this space and try to gain strategic

421
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:39,600
advantage in this space without having

422
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,759
to cross into militarized crisis without

423
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:45,360
having to provoke an armed conflict

424
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,300
I always think about this almost you

425
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:51,300
know going back to marketing days where

426
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:55,560
you have every company has a brand

427
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,240
whether they like it or not it's you

428
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,920
know the idea that pops into someone's

429
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,540
head and and the brand might be

430
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:02,160
different for certain groups of people

431
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,380
and other groups of people and I would

432
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:06,299
believe that this line that you talked

433
00:17:06,299 --> 00:17:07,380
about

434
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:09,660
organizations have an idea of what their

435
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:11,040
line is

436
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:14,819
but they might not disagree to to come

437
00:17:14,819 --> 00:17:17,400
countries in competition or non-state

438
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,500
actors in competition one thing that one

439
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:20,699
might think the lines here the other

440
00:17:20,699 --> 00:17:22,799
might think the lines there and even in

441
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:24,839
your book you write that

442
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:27,720
it's currently immature chances for

443
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,840
misjudgment abound

444
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,340
so what we currently say is that the

445
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:35,400
substance in that bounded space is

446
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:39,000
immature but the ceiling that threshold

447
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,200
of use of force and armed attack

448
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,660
equivalent is pretty pretty well

449
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:44,520
understood really right not not

450
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:47,520
explicitly but like I mean States states

451
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,520
are bound by if they want to be not not

452
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:51,780
all states act this way but they're

453
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:53,760
Bound by international law okay and

454
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,160
Article 2 4 and article 51 of the U.N

455
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,960
Charter say that you cannot threaten or

456
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:00,660
use use of force and that if you engage

457
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:02,700
in an armed attack equivalent a state

458
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:03,900
can respond with armed attack

459
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:06,600
equivalents as well States know this

460
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,760
right so if they're able to achieve

461
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:11,280
strategic AIMS in this competitive space

462
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:14,280
without Crossing that threshold why

463
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,299
wouldn't they

464
00:18:15,299 --> 00:18:18,000
right why would they risk Crossing it

465
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
and then bring into play all the

466
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,679
consequences and additional risks that

467
00:18:22,679 --> 00:18:24,720
come with armed conflict and crises

468
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,000
well I can see that taking place in two

469
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,440
different ways depending on who's in

470
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,520
charge

471
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,919
I could see saying I think the lines

472
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:34,200
here so I'm going to give myself a 10

473
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,419
buffer zone and not come close that line

474
00:18:36,419 --> 00:18:39,120
or I could see someone else saying lines

475
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,220
here can we move it up ten percent can

476
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:42,780
we just go over the line a little bit

477
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:45,419
and see what happens yeah so what you're

478
00:18:45,419 --> 00:18:47,520
describing is a risk accepted actor

479
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,140
right

480
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:51,419
that applies equally well to kinetic

481
00:18:51,419 --> 00:18:53,280
capability too all right I mean

482
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,620
President Putin has threatened to use

483
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:58,559
nuclear weapons in in Ukraine

484
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:01,140
we haven't heard that for decades right

485
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,299
but it's clearly a risk accepted actor

486
00:19:03,299 --> 00:19:04,440
when you're dealing with a risk

487
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,820
accepting actor whether it's in the

488
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:07,380
Cyber strategic environment in the

489
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:09,600
conventional or in the nuclear there's

490
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,820
not much you can do right they're going

491
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:13,320
to do what they want to do and they're

492
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:14,340
because they're willing to accept the

493
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:16,919
risks and consequences okay well I want

494
00:19:16,919 --> 00:19:19,400
to shift now because

495
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,780
in his book if you get a copy of his

496
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:23,220
book and again he'll be signing him at

497
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:25,020
the Cabana sessions

498
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:26,760
the forward is written by General

499
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,020
nakasone

500
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:30,780
and he talks about how Michael and his

501
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:32,760
co-authors played a big role in this so

502
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,860
you know he doesn't he doesn't go as far

503
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:36,600
as saying we believe everything in the

504
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:39,299
book he's very clear about that but I

505
00:19:39,299 --> 00:19:40,440
don't think he would have written the

506
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:43,080
forward if this wasn't influencing to

507
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:46,260
some degree the U.S thinking so whether

508
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:50,580
it's right or wrong the amount of I

509
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:53,460
guess mind share and following that this

510
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:55,020
has in the world would be really

511
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:57,000
important to anyone that might be

512
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,760
targeted what would you say right now

513
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,700
how widely is this theory in play is it

514
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:04,919
is it primarily a U.S

515
00:20:04,919 --> 00:20:07,620
action or do others think they're

516
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:10,820
playing the same game as well

517
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:13,679
so the uh the notion of initiative

518
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:15,480
persistence

519
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,580
was understood by Russia and China long

520
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:19,080
before the United States government

521
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:21,179
understood it right they started playing

522
00:20:21,179 --> 00:20:24,900
the game in cyberspace in 2008 2009

523
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:27,059
2010.

524
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:30,120
um but in 2018 when cybercom wrote its

525
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:32,039
strategic vision and then DOD came out

526
00:20:32,039 --> 00:20:34,740
with its uh cyber strategy of defend

527
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:37,039
forward and then cybercom

528
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:39,240
operationalized that as the Strategic

529
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:41,160
approach of persistent engagement that

530
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,780
was the big marker on the wall in the

531
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:45,660
U.S right that that is the dod's

532
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:47,160
manifestation of the concept of

533
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:49,980
initiative persistence since then and as

534
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:53,039
general nakasone says in his in his

535
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:55,320
forward he was curious to see how the

536
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,860
rest of the U.S government you know

537
00:20:57,860 --> 00:21:00,660
adopted this and we've seen adoption

538
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:03,419
right I think most aggressively we've

539
00:21:03,419 --> 00:21:06,900
seen it by the FBI in the doj so the FBI

540
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:09,299
now is being much more proactive they

541
00:21:09,299 --> 00:21:11,340
changed their strategy a year ago to

542
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:13,860
much more proactive posture where they

543
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:16,559
are taking down the infrastructure of

544
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:18,900
criminal gangs they just took down Hive

545
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:21,840
in in coordination with some of our

546
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:22,820
allies

547
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:25,799
cybercom also took down trickbot before

548
00:21:25,799 --> 00:21:29,220
the election actions you see sisa of

549
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:30,720
course is doing a lot much more

550
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,419
proactive their first new strategy in a

551
00:21:33,419 --> 00:21:35,460
couple of years came out it's very

552
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,860
proactively oriented so this is the idea

553
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:40,100
of initiative persistence

554
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:43,679
cesser what cesser does in terms of of

555
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:45,900
working with the National Laboratories

556
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:48,720
to look at asset owners equipment to see

557
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,220
if there are vulnerabilities that's

558
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:52,380
initiative persistence okay so the

559
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:54,360
concept manifests differently based on

560
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:56,100
what the responsibilities capacities and

561
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:58,260
functions are of organizations

562
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:01,080
so we're starting to see a wider spread

563
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:03,059
in the United States we're also starting

564
00:22:03,059 --> 00:22:06,179
to see a wider spread globally if you

565
00:22:06,179 --> 00:22:08,360
look at the the

566
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:13,020
Cyber strategies of the UK of Germany of

567
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:16,919
Spain of France of Italy of Australia of

568
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:19,320
Canada the Czech Republic

569
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:20,880
um you'll see a much more proactive

570
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,039
posture now they're saying we have to be

571
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:26,039
on not the offensive but we have to be

572
00:22:26,039 --> 00:22:28,860
on the front foot uh to stay ahead of

573
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:31,200
our adversaries in this space you'll see

574
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,059
it in how they are now trying to

575
00:22:33,059 --> 00:22:35,640
interpret international law right

576
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,260
they're rethinking how do we think of

577
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:40,200
cyber how do we think of sovereignty in

578
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,240
this initiative persistent strategic

579
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,100
environment of cyberspace it can't be

580
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:46,200
that everything stops at the border the

581
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,640
interconnectedness of cyber series

582
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,919
disallows that right so if that's not

583
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:51,480
the case how do we have to rethink about

584
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:52,980
sovereignty how do we have to rethink

585
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:55,140
about the rule of non-intervention right

586
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:57,299
we have to we a Department of State is

587
00:22:57,299 --> 00:22:59,220
taking a good lead in that and you see

588
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:03,179
the UK talking about that as well so you

589
00:23:03,179 --> 00:23:06,419
know when you introduce a new Theory

590
00:23:06,419 --> 00:23:09,120
that really challenges the existing

591
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,340
security Theory and the existing

592
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:13,679
security theory in the globe not just in

593
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:15,179
the United States for the last 70 years

594
00:23:15,179 --> 00:23:17,640
has been deterrents we are challenging

595
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:20,220
deterrents we are saying in this cyber

596
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:22,500
strategic environment where most of the

597
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,960
Strategic activity occurs short of use

598
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,419
of force and armed attack equivalence

599
00:23:26,419 --> 00:23:28,860
deterrence doesn't work

600
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:31,200
here's a new Theory

601
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:35,039
that troubles people right mentally it

602
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:36,480
is difficult when you've learned

603
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,640
something for three generations to

604
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,280
suggest now there's something new for

605
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:43,200
this new space this goes Paradigm Shift

606
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,240
those of you who know Thomas and

607
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:46,740
the structure of scientific revolutions

608
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:50,059
he talks about this it it happens slowly

609
00:23:50,059 --> 00:23:52,500
painfully and that's what we're seeing

610
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:55,020
we're seeing slow gradual change but

611
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:57,000
eventually the new paradigms of plants

612
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,059
the one that's no longer sufficient and

613
00:24:00,059 --> 00:24:02,240
we get uh

614
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,380
exponential growth that's what we're

615
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:05,280
hoping for

616
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:07,919
so you're saying that before the U.S did

617
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:09,840
it China and a few others were doing it

618
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,159
the ones that you mentioned you gave

619
00:24:11,159 --> 00:24:13,440
some examples of you mentioned a lot of

620
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,880
the

621
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,799
say countries that are friendly to the

622
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:20,220
United States are we should we expect to

623
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:22,260
see like Pakistan and India be doing

624
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:24,840
this in India and China and the you know

625
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:27,179
the kind of the other places where

626
00:24:27,179 --> 00:24:30,000
they've had not necessarily recent Wars

627
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,299
but long-standing competition

628
00:24:33,299 --> 00:24:35,820
yeah you expect this to you expect this

629
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:38,820
to be as like conventional strategic

630
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:40,620
environment eventually this environment

631
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:41,520
will

632
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,080
permeate the whole world without

633
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:46,320
question as States capacities increase

634
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,659
and and thank you for using the word

635
00:24:48,659 --> 00:24:51,179
competition so we we see a lot of it

636
00:24:51,179 --> 00:24:53,039
recently between India and China yeah

637
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:55,559
right China is going after uh Indian

638
00:24:55,559 --> 00:24:57,480
infrastructure because they're having a

639
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:00,480
kinetic Skirmish at the border right so

640
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,820
China is saying look I mean we can do it

641
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:05,159
this way where the risk of escalation

642
00:25:05,159 --> 00:25:07,740
are much greater or we can actually do

643
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:10,020
this in cyberspace so we can convey to

644
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:11,700
one another through tacit engagement

645
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:13,799
that we're dissatisfied with what you're

646
00:25:13,799 --> 00:25:15,780
doing over there so you know slow it

647
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:20,100
down so I guess then the big question is

648
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:21,539
I'm running

649
00:25:21,539 --> 00:25:24,779
a critical infrastructure system

650
00:25:24,779 --> 00:25:27,779
a power plant a water treatment plant

651
00:25:27,779 --> 00:25:30,299
even even Mining and some manufacturing

652
00:25:30,299 --> 00:25:32,220
and you know there's so many different

653
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:35,940
critical infrastructure in this

654
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:38,940
cyber persistent world

655
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:41,520
what should I be doing

656
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,799
so much

657
00:25:43,799 --> 00:25:45,000
but

658
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,679
if I were to offer one one

659
00:25:46,679 --> 00:25:49,380
recommendation and I I have to I have to

660
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:52,440
precede it with the comment

661
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:54,919
those of you who are asset owners

662
00:25:54,919 --> 00:25:56,700
whether or not they're critical

663
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:58,340
infrastructure

664
00:25:58,340 --> 00:26:01,919
drive the economy of this country you

665
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:04,559
are very important those of you who run

666
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:06,779
critical infrastructure you are very

667
00:26:06,779 --> 00:26:08,100
important from a national security

668
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:12,120
perspective right so what you have to

669
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:14,940
ensure is that if the United States gets

670
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:17,159
into a militarized crisis

671
00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:18,900
our credibility is on the line

672
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:20,640
credibility is supported by the

673
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:21,539
functioning of our critical

674
00:26:21,539 --> 00:26:24,059
infrastructure if the United States gets

675
00:26:24,059 --> 00:26:26,580
involved in armed conflict we need our

676
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:27,779
critical infrastructure to be

677
00:26:27,779 --> 00:26:30,240
functioning to support that effort so

678
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:33,000
critical really means critical for you

679
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:33,960
folks

680
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:36,900
so the one thing I would recommend and

681
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:39,240
ask that you all do is to focus on

682
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:42,480
developing a strategy of anticipatory

683
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,679
resilience

684
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:46,080
this is a term that we introduce in the

685
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:48,000
book where we talk about it a lot in

686
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,880
other places and the expectation it's

687
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,820
not unlike the expectations behind the

688
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:56,580
recommendation versus zero trust expect

689
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:58,440
that you're going to be exploited

690
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:00,360
expected

691
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:03,720
right plan for it and then plan to be

692
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,940
able to recover from it you need those

693
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:07,320
plans in place

694
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:10,320
don't just write them Implement them and

695
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:11,880
then share them with your

696
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:14,700
sector-specific companies that would be

697
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:16,799
my one recommendation

698
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:18,480
yeah I want to sneak in one last

699
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,620
question

700
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:20,820
there was

701
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:23,360
in your book you write States May

702
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:27,240
tacitly and or explicitly

703
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:29,100
or may seek to communicate that

704
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:31,559
compromising the confidentiality but not

705
00:27:31,559 --> 00:27:33,419
the Integrity or availability of certain

706
00:27:33,419 --> 00:27:35,820
critical infrastructure systems is

707
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:38,840
acceptable behavior

708
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:41,520
a lot of times if you have that

709
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,500
capability for most of the systems in

710
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:44,700
this room

711
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:46,500
it's a choice

712
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:49,380
not to take it out or damage equipment

713
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:50,880
or that if you if you have the ability

714
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:53,100
if you're in the system sitting there

715
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:55,500
with persistent communication to and

716
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:57,000
from the system you have the ability

717
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,299
anytime you want to flip that switch

718
00:28:00,299 --> 00:28:02,580
and and like they did in Ukraine years

719
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:04,380
ago they were in there for a while they

720
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:06,360
said okay today's the day we're shutting

721
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:09,260
down those substations

722
00:28:09,419 --> 00:28:11,760
to me that would seem to be above the

723
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,260
line

724
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:15,539
even if they don't take the action but

725
00:28:15,539 --> 00:28:17,760
just that they have the capability of

726
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,500
taking the action

727
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:21,659
but the book seemed to indicate that

728
00:28:21,659 --> 00:28:24,059
it's more what you do with it than the

729
00:28:24,059 --> 00:28:28,080
capability that determines this maximum

730
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:31,440
level for a fade accompli yeah yeah so

731
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,860
so I'll respond with two points one is

732
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:37,260
it's not as easy to hold something at

733
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:39,600
risk as people think it is

734
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:42,419
right so Russia was in was in Ukraine's

735
00:28:42,419 --> 00:28:45,900
critical infrastructure in 2016.

736
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:49,320
they tried to do it again last February

737
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:52,140
and failed at a lot of areas

738
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:55,620
right so because the defense its offense

739
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:57,720
defense fluidity right the defense can

740
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:01,320
come back and and deny you access but

741
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:03,059
let's say that they're in right China

742
00:29:03,059 --> 00:29:06,659
supposedly got into our natural gas in

743
00:29:06,659 --> 00:29:09,960
2012 and was in a position to do damage

744
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:12,059
I'll go back to an earlier Point what's

745
00:29:12,059 --> 00:29:14,340
the incentive for them to do it

746
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:16,140
right if they're already achieving

747
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:18,960
strategic gains without causing

748
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:21,179
destruction and when you cause

749
00:29:21,179 --> 00:29:23,340
destruction you invite additional risks

750
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:25,380
and consequences associated with crisis

751
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:27,720
and armed conflict if they don't have to

752
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,700
do that to achieve their strategic gains

753
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:31,980
why would they do it right so it's

754
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:35,520
incentive it comes down to incentives

755
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:38,520
still a little terrified I know but but

756
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:40,980
then again as you said uh you're

757
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:43,200
terrible I'm terrified by nuclear war as

758
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,600
well so you know yeah it might be a

759
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,840
reality system so so one more one more

760
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:51,480
comment on that look in addition to just

761
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:53,220
looking at State Behavior folks have

762
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:54,840
looked at the interaction between states

763
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:57,419
and cyberspace for over the last decade

764
00:29:57,419 --> 00:30:00,240
zero incidence of escalation

765
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,620
none

766
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:04,200
right none and think there are thousands

767
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,880
if not millions of interactions between

768
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,980
states and through cyberspace

769
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:10,740
and over that period we've seen no State

770
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:13,320
escalates out of that agreed competition

771
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:15,480
space and into militarized crisis or on

772
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,340
conflict so the notion that these

773
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:19,380
behaviors will lead to escalation is not

774
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:21,899
supported empirically it's just not I'm

775
00:30:21,899 --> 00:30:23,100
going to have to find you at the welcome

776
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:25,260
party but I I want to let people go to

777
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:26,880
the morning break I appreciate

778
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,799
everyone's staying through the whole

779
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:30,720
keynote block we're going to go to

780
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:33,539
morning brief but before we do remember

781
00:30:33,539 --> 00:30:35,520
that Mike will be signing copies of his

782
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:38,100
book at the Cabana sessions and you'll

783
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:40,799
be around today and tomorrow at least so

784
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:43,140
I'm sure he'd be anxious to learn more

785
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:44,880
about what we do and and thank you

786
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:47,340
Michael for coming and and signing some

787
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:48,779
books yeah thank you Dale thank you

788
00:30:48,779 --> 00:30:50,580
everybody

789
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:52,639
thank you
