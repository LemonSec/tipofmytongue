1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,240
foreign

2
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:06,960
good morning everybody and and push

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,059
thanks for push I'm sorry about that

4
00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:10,760
push thanks for coming down to Miami

5
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:14,340
thanks for having me well we've got 30

6
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:16,379
minutes and I've got a long long list of

7
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:18,060
questions so we're just going to dive in

8
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:19,020
but

9
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:21,300
um we had Bill Furman up on stage and I

10
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:22,560
talked to him about one of the more

11
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,240
successful programs I wanted to start

12
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,820
there with you as well we've seen in the

13
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:29,039
last couple of years a lot of work

14
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:32,040
between Department of energy and the

15
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:36,059
utilities in Sharing data and then

16
00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:38,219
analyzing and sharing intelligence from

17
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:40,500
that data I saw

18
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:46,700
I guess it was in 2021 you had

19
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:49,800
150 Electric utilities serving almost 90

20
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,899
million American Electric customers that

21
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:53,579
were part of this program

22
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:55,920
has that grown much since 21 do you have

23
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,920
any current numbers

24
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,300
so first and foremost thanks for having

25
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:03,480
me here this is just a great space and

26
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,400
it's an incredible space because you're

27
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,860
bringing together

28
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:10,439
subject matter experts on OT systems

29
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:12,119
which is just a huge gap that we

30
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:13,799
continue to have and so building this

31
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:16,200
community is amazing um now

32
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:19,320
uh before I jump into the specifics of

33
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,000
information sharing yeah and the work

34
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,580
we're doing it might help to set the

35
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:25,619
stage in terms of where we are as an

36
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:27,299
office if that's okay

37
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:29,820
um just broadly speaking my office the

38
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:31,560
office of cyber security energy security

39
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,080
and emergency response or the shorthand

40
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:37,320
is Caesar Caesar's really focused on

41
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,420
understanding all threats and Hazards to

42
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:41,759
the U.S energy sector that's part of our

43
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:43,500
mission it's to how do you buy down

44
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,380
these risks you do policies you do to

45
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:48,240
tools and Technologies like information

46
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,579
sharing and then when a really bad day

47
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:52,740
happens you respond so the colonial

48
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:55,259
pipeline ransomware attack my team led

49
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:56,820
the response for that on behalf of the

50
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:58,920
US government in partnership with

51
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,560
Colonial in partnership with our

52
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,479
interagency partners at DHS and other

53
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:06,840
agencies now to do that work we first

54
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,340
need to understand what is happening

55
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:10,318
what is what are the threats that are

56
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:13,040
actually targeting Energy Systems

57
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,480
we've had a program along those lines

58
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,640
for over 10 years in our cyber security

59
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:20,340
risk information sharing program for the

60
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,140
Chris program that you were alluding to

61
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:24,720
the reality is that program was started

62
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,540
10 years ago

63
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:29,160
threats have evolved that program has

64
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:32,040
also focused on I.T threats we know we

65
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,239
know that threats are in the OT

66
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:35,459
environment so

67
00:02:35,459 --> 00:02:37,200
it's it's still a really important

68
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,580
really important program because it

69
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:40,260
still gives us visibility of what's

70
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,000
happening on all of these electricity

71
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,739
sector and some oil and natural gas

72
00:02:43,739 --> 00:02:46,920
sector networks but we recognize that we

73
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,959
have to evolve as well and so where

74
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:51,540
we're headed in terms of we're moving

75
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:53,040
beyond just threat information sharing

76
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,620
it no longer has to be one way where we

77
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:57,660
believe we need to be is that joint

78
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:59,879
collaboration we need to have industry

79
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:01,319
experts sitting down with government

80
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:04,319
experts it needs to be Engineers working

81
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:07,080
with cyber experts to really understand

82
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,840
threats otherwise we're going to miss

83
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,940
stuff and that's something that is

84
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:13,680
really important to me as my background

85
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,900
is a Power Systems engineer working in

86
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,940
electric utility industry what I would

87
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:19,739
often see is you would hear about cyber

88
00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:21,959
threats and then my engineering brain

89
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:23,580
would come on and I'd be like well that

90
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:26,040
that seems like a big deal but

91
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,360
um I don't think it's going to take down

92
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,980
the grid that's not that big of a deal

93
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:31,379
now the reverse would also happen where

94
00:03:31,379 --> 00:03:33,599
I would hear about a cyber threat and

95
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:34,680
someone would be like oh it's not a big

96
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,200
deal for electricity systems and I'd

97
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,900
think about it and say no that specific

98
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:42,239
software or Hardware is so widely

99
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:44,459
deployed across the sector that if

100
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:46,700
impacted could have a significant

101
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:49,560
disruptive impact on Energy Systems

102
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:52,980
across the country so where would that

103
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:57,000
as a backup where are we today so we are

104
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,040
actually morphing the program in

105
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,560
expanding it to look at Cyber threats in

106
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,599
the OT environment so what we're doing

107
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:06,379
is last year we really focused on

108
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:08,700
encouraging the utilities to not only

109
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,200
have the I.T side of the house which is

110
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,959
great rate but we also need to look at

111
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:15,900
the operational side so go deploy

112
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:17,820
OT sensor Technologies let's start to

113
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:21,298
infuse it and OT data together with

114
00:04:21,298 --> 00:04:22,639
engineering information

115
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:25,139
and so where we are right now is we're

116
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:28,199
building a new environment that's going

117
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:30,540
to take the data from this from the I.T

118
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:33,120
side marry it up with the OT side we're

119
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,320
still in the beginning phases because

120
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,620
that's incredibly difficult to do as

121
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:39,540
this community knows OT data is very

122
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:41,820
complex and it's different than it data

123
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:43,680
and so what we're starting with right

124
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,320
now is developing an OT data taxonomy

125
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,840
how do we look at OT data and then

126
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:51,240
correlate it with it data just look for

127
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,639
anomalous activities so we're still

128
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:55,740
building that platform but there's going

129
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:57,180
to be a lot more to come in this space

130
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:00,540
as we start to expand things like sensor

131
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:02,120
technology detection

132
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:05,880
methodologies going forward so you said

133
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:08,360
it's been going for 10 years

134
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,800
I've heard from Bill and a lot of other

135
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,199
people that seem to you know is going

136
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:15,919
going and then really activity level

137
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:17,940
ramped up in the last couple of years

138
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:19,740
probably a little bit as a result of

139
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:21,740
colonial that you mentioned

140
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:24,600
has this effort

141
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,240
stopped attacks on the grid you know

142
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,940
broadly speaking the generate if this

143
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:32,039
program did not exist would we have had

144
00:05:32,039 --> 00:05:34,259
outages in the generation or

145
00:05:34,259 --> 00:05:36,240
transmission of power

146
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,639
you know much like with any cyber

147
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,160
detection tool or technology you know

148
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,240
you're you're looking at a lot of

149
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,880
different

150
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:47,100
events that are happening you know any

151
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:50,160
one tool is you really have to take a

152
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,080
look at it more broadly

153
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,060
um can you say any one tool has stopped

154
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:56,039
anything big we're stopping things

155
00:05:56,039 --> 00:05:57,960
constantly all of our tools and

156
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,100
Technologies are stopping things

157
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:01,440
constantly including the Chris program

158
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,060
it is observing activity it is

159
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:05,280
correlating information with our

160
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,380
intelligence Holdings and we're getting

161
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:09,539
information out to the sector in a

162
00:06:09,539 --> 00:06:12,300
timely and actionable manner now that is

163
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:15,060
one tool in the toolbox so I would say

164
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:16,919
it has had an impact

165
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:19,740
um a fairly significant impact on the

166
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:21,660
sector but I think the biggest thing

167
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:23,819
it's been able to do that other Tools 10

168
00:06:23,819 --> 00:06:27,060
years ago were not doing was if let's

169
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:28,740
say one utility on the west coast was

170
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:30,840
seeing some type of cyber activity it

171
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:33,300
was able to immediately say entire

172
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:34,620
Electric utilities that are

173
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:36,440
participating in the program

174
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:38,759
you need to be observing what this other

175
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:40,680
utility is doing so we were able to

176
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:44,819
build a a network of data across the

177
00:06:44,819 --> 00:06:46,500
country so we're not just individually

178
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,360
all looking at different pieces of

179
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,100
events that are happening we were able

180
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:52,020
to look at it all in the distribute it

181
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:54,240
broadly now the data got distributed not

182
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,580
to the utilities just participating but

183
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:58,800
to all energy sector companies across

184
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,080
the country through our partnership with

185
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:04,800
the electricity ISAC so one of our goals

186
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,360
in doing this work is certainly it

187
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:09,180
benefits us seeing what's happening but

188
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:11,400
the ultimate benefit need to go off to

189
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,860
the entire community so it has done that

190
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:16,979
we have seen threats fairly significant

191
00:07:16,979 --> 00:07:19,560
ones that we've been able to get out to

192
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,880
the community and say you need to be

193
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,860
looking out for these ttps these

194
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:24,840
indicators and so

195
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:27,960
um I would say it has had an impact

196
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:31,199
downward early on I could see

197
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:33,840
some of your measurement would be

198
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,240
are we getting information are we

199
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,280
passing information for back and forth

200
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,199
how many people are participating how

201
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:41,880
many even if they're not sending us

202
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,020
information how many people are

203
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:45,240
receiving information kind of an

204
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:48,900
activity metric but now that it's it's

205
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:51,180
much more broadly spread how is you know

206
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:53,340
as director Caesar how are you going to

207
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:55,080
measure success what is the metric that

208
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,220
says

209
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:58,139
this program because you're investing a

210
00:07:58,139 --> 00:07:59,699
lot in this and you're talking about it

211
00:07:59,699 --> 00:08:02,220
growing this program is worthy of

212
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:04,259
continued resources how are you going to

213
00:08:04,259 --> 00:08:07,319
measure that you know uh the metrics

214
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:09,240
question is always a hard one you know

215
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,039
how do you define metrics is that

216
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:13,020
something that you're

217
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:15,180
um what have you avoided you know what

218
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:17,400
incident could have connected conducted

219
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:20,340
an operational impact is it a

220
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:23,099
theoretical number is it an academic

221
00:08:23,099 --> 00:08:27,000
number so metrics in the cyberspace

222
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,220
are hard they're not easy and

223
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:31,020
particularly on the OT space even harder

224
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:32,760
you know there's a lot of metrics that a

225
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,559
lot of companies will use at a high

226
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:37,799
level in terms of how had an adversary

227
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:39,779
or intrusion gotten through your trust

228
00:08:39,779 --> 00:08:42,539
levels what your bit site score is

229
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:44,700
there's measures that we still are using

230
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:47,580
on the I.T side to say how good did we

231
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:50,459
do I think that's an actual area that is

232
00:08:50,459 --> 00:08:54,120
right for more discussion to really get

233
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:57,600
into better metrics of what's the cost

234
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,779
avoided by having a system or a tool

235
00:09:00,779 --> 00:09:01,980
like this and I would say that for all

236
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:03,899
cyber tools it's not just for our tool

237
00:09:03,899 --> 00:09:05,580
right I think that's a gap we have in

238
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:06,899
the community and I think that's an

239
00:09:06,899 --> 00:09:08,580
important Gap we need to fill and the

240
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:10,740
reason I say this is because when you

241
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:14,100
actually talk to senior Executives at

242
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,660
utilities or oil and natural gas

243
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:17,519
companies a lot of what they're thinking

244
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:19,620
about is cost right so they're thinking

245
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:21,300
about what technology do I need to

246
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,920
invest in and will it actually buy down

247
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:26,160
risk and I don't think we've done enough

248
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:29,580
work in this space to really start to

249
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:33,120
quantify value of programs like this but

250
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,600
also quantify the impact of cyber events

251
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,480
so how do we quantify cyber so that we

252
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:42,660
can make a better case to Executives

253
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:44,820
across the country to say you got to buy

254
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:46,620
down this cyber risk much like we buy

255
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:49,019
down Wildfire risk at West Hurricane

256
00:09:49,019 --> 00:09:52,140
risk in the Southeast I think this is an

257
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:54,000
area that's right for this community to

258
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,399
come together and say let's quantify and

259
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:58,800
develop better metrics so that we can

260
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,339
make the business case to use tools like

261
00:10:02,339 --> 00:10:05,160
this and and others that are out there

262
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:08,160
okay now that that program was one that

263
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,300
I think is

264
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:11,399
got a bit of a glow seems to be a

265
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:12,380
success

266
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:14,880
the theme of this conference here this

267
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,700
year is explore and when you explore you

268
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,500
don't always succeed sometimes you you

269
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:22,080
know you fall short you fail

270
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:25,019
what has the your group

271
00:10:25,019 --> 00:10:26,700
tried and said we thought this would be

272
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:29,279
a really good idea we went at it with

273
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:31,500
you know the best of intentions and we

274
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,540
just decided it didn't work or we needed

275
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:35,880
to do it differently

276
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,980
do you have an example of that

277
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:40,980
oh geez um

278
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:44,040
uh that that's a good question in terms

279
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,540
of what is work what you know what what

280
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:47,820
Pro what hasn't worked yeah because I I

281
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:49,320
would hope some things didn't work or

282
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,579
we're probably not trying hard enough

283
00:10:50,579 --> 00:10:52,920
right wasn't I I couldn't agree more so

284
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:55,380
again as an engineer you want to test

285
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:57,000
things you want to break things and you

286
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,680
want to see what works and sometimes

287
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,000
things don't work and that's okay

288
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,560
because then you get to think about the

289
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,360
next thing and you've learned from what

290
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,040
you've done and that's that's it's very

291
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,480
important

292
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,279
um you know you know on the government

293
00:11:08,279 --> 00:11:09,600
side

294
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,660
we don't always do it that well and you

295
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:14,760
know and the thing is it's okay because

296
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,440
we're actually trying to invest in new

297
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:19,320
technologies right so so

298
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,779
I'll talk about a specific example that

299
00:11:21,779 --> 00:11:25,260
where I think we we learned a lot

300
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:27,839
um in the sector and then I I'd like to

301
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:30,540
share a potential

302
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:32,640
um failure that we could have in the on

303
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,920
the horizon if you're okay with that um

304
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:37,040
so it's for the first one specifically

305
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:40,260
we have this this amazing program called

306
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:42,420
our cyber testing for resilient

307
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:44,820
industrial Control Systems side tricks

308
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:47,579
Citrix the goal of Citrix is to bring

309
00:11:47,579 --> 00:11:48,380
together

310
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:51,300
manufacturers with cyber researchers to

311
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:54,180
really identify software Hardware

312
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:56,880
vulnerabilities before adversaries

313
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,980
exploit them right that's that makes

314
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:02,820
sense now we have amazing capabilities

315
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:04,680
at the National Laboratories to help us

316
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,420
with the testing let me step back so

317
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:07,800
there's three pieces there's governance

318
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,660
of a program like this there's the

319
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:11,579
testing and then there's the analytics

320
00:12:11,579 --> 00:12:13,500
of all the data that you get

321
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,240
the National Laboratories Davies

322
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,560
National Laboratory some of which are in

323
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,940
the room today and I'd encourage you to

324
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:20,459
talk to them are doing amazing work on

325
00:12:20,459 --> 00:12:22,860
testing they're doing amazing work on

326
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:24,720
the data analytics piece of correlating

327
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,000
this information how the governance

328
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,279
piece which you would think would be

329
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:31,459
something we could solve fairly easily

330
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:34,200
we've struggled in terms of the legal

331
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,060
contracts because this we're we're

332
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:38,100
charting new ground of industry and

333
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:40,500
government working together on testing

334
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,420
critical components on software that is

335
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:45,480
used across the energy sector and while

336
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,800
we have all the expertise on the

337
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,500
technical side what we realized was the

338
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,660
legal pieces of doing this testing and

339
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:53,880
who owns the risk of the testing when do

340
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:56,459
you disclose vulnerabilities so that an

341
00:12:56,459 --> 00:12:57,959
adversary doesn't necessarily exploit

342
00:12:57,959 --> 00:12:59,639
them but at the same time you need to

343
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:01,079
get it out to the community as quickly

344
00:13:01,079 --> 00:13:03,779
as possible those are very hairy issues

345
00:13:03,779 --> 00:13:06,540
and the reality with the program was it

346
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:08,639
took us a long time to figure out the

347
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:11,040
legal pieces to even get the program off

348
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,560
the ground so it took us a long time now

349
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,180
it took a lot of really smart lawyers

350
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:17,220
both from industry and government coming

351
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:19,320
together to really think through listen

352
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:22,800
we have to at some point agree that we

353
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,660
have risk even on the government side we

354
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:26,459
have risk with a program like this we're

355
00:13:26,459 --> 00:13:28,139
going to be breaking things we're going

356
00:13:28,139 --> 00:13:30,000
to be really testing things in a way

357
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,100
that maybe the manufacturer never

358
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:34,860
thought they would be tested before but

359
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:36,600
we got to do it in the in the National

360
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,899
interest in the company's interest

361
00:13:38,899 --> 00:13:42,360
so why I actually I had some question on

362
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:45,300
Citrix why does the company need the

363
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:47,639
government to do the testing they have

364
00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:49,740
very strong teams they have Deep Pockets

365
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:51,779
I was looking some of the two of the

366
00:13:51,779 --> 00:13:54,480
first ones are GE and Hitachi they're

367
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,399
certainly big enough to be able to hire

368
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:59,480
people to do this testing themselves

369
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,620
that's a great question so one of the

370
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:04,980
things with scitrix says we started this

371
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:07,079
program when there wasn't as much

372
00:14:07,079 --> 00:14:09,959
testing going on in in the sector both

373
00:14:09,959 --> 00:14:11,700
hardware and software down to the chip

374
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,800
level down to the firmware level

375
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:16,440
um what we hope to do with this program

376
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,000
is the reality is we on the government

377
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,980
side we'll never be able to test all of

378
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:21,660
it but what we'd like to do is a couple

379
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:24,000
things one we want to develop a culture

380
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,279
of OT vulnerability disclosure and I

381
00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:27,420
think we're getting there so we've

382
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:28,560
actually disclosed vulnerabilities

383
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,800
through cisa on cis's vulnerability site

384
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:35,040
to disclose testing now a lot of our

385
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,560
testing where we are focused on is its

386
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,600
intelligence informed so if we learn

387
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,420
about something from intelligence and it

388
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:44,279
directs us to say we need to prioritize

389
00:14:44,279 --> 00:14:46,740
testing this component versus that it

390
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:49,440
will help us prioritize now where we

391
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,720
want to head with the program is we have

392
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:54,240
to get tools out to the industry we want

393
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,279
other folks to be able to do the testing

394
00:14:56,279 --> 00:14:58,019
we want to publish things like

395
00:14:58,019 --> 00:14:59,760
methodology to do this testing on your

396
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,800
own and for my advantage point I think

397
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,180
we have three tiers for testing in the

398
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:05,160
future potentially I'd love to get your

399
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,360
thoughts give it given your background

400
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:09,120
now one is some of the utilities are

401
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,500
doing their own testing whether it's

402
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:11,940
vulnerability scanning or some other

403
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:14,760
work that's tier one tier two is

404
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:15,959
possibly bringing in a third party

405
00:15:15,959 --> 00:15:17,820
company much like you would bring in a

406
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:19,440
pen tester to do testing because it's

407
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:22,500
higher risk now the third tier is maybe

408
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,660
National Security threats that's the

409
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:27,360
piece that I think where we live but the

410
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,579
work we do at Citrix the goal is to get

411
00:15:29,579 --> 00:15:31,440
it out to the community the testing

412
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,899
procedures the tools that we develop so

413
00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:36,480
you all can do it yourselves as well

414
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,120
I I'm just wondering and maybe this is

415
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,459
part of the legal issues because I I did

416
00:15:41,459 --> 00:15:42,480
look

417
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,600
like the the initial testing on geur

418
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,420
family of relays they found old versions

419
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:50,720
of SSH HTTP for management

420
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,160
unauthenticated firmware upload Hardware

421
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:56,459
coded credentials uh insecure Factory

422
00:15:56,459 --> 00:15:59,699
support mode and Hitachi hard car plane

423
00:15:59,699 --> 00:16:01,680
tax on the device and then the backup

424
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,660
files and things like that I mean that's

425
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:07,260
that's really basic stuff that's you

426
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:08,459
know that's that's the kind of thing

427
00:16:08,459 --> 00:16:10,380
that probably half the audience could do

428
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:12,600
in in a couple of days on one of these

429
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:15,540
devices is there is a real juicy stuff

430
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:17,940
is that still hidden behind all these

431
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:20,459
lawyers and it's like yeah you can put

432
00:16:20,459 --> 00:16:22,680
that stuff out but I'm hoping there's a

433
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,360
big treasure cache that we don't know

434
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:27,180
about yet so we're constantly disclosing

435
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:29,100
vulnerabilities I won't get into any

436
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:31,800
specific vulnerabilities but I will say

437
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,540
um I think this has created a cultural

438
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:34,920
shift even with the manufacturers

439
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:37,380
because I mean these These are companies

440
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:39,139
that are really large they've been doing

441
00:16:39,139 --> 00:16:41,579
their work in terms of engineering these

442
00:16:41,579 --> 00:16:43,860
types of devices and components for a

443
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:46,560
lot of years and a lot of the Cyber

444
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:47,940
Folks at some of these big companies

445
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:50,040
also have to get the engineers to

446
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:51,839
rethink how they engineer some of these

447
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:54,480
devices with cyber in mind and so that

448
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,160
actually leads me me to something that

449
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,779
we're really focused on is a concept

450
00:16:57,779 --> 00:17:00,180
called cyber informed engineering

451
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:02,160
perfect transition that was where I was

452
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,380
going oh perfect okay so so cyber

453
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:06,419
informed engineering the idea is how do

454
00:17:06,419 --> 00:17:09,299
we get the engineering side of the house

455
00:17:09,299 --> 00:17:11,880
to really design these things with cyber

456
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:14,040
and mind I think that's important as a

457
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:16,020
former engineer and working on designing

458
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:19,699
grid equipment and and systems because

459
00:17:19,699 --> 00:17:22,619
we have to think about how we think

460
00:17:22,619 --> 00:17:24,299
about the grid you know from a utility

461
00:17:24,299 --> 00:17:26,099
perspective is we want it to be reliable

462
00:17:26,099 --> 00:17:27,660
we want to be safe

463
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:30,600
super important but what I'd offer is

464
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,820
you cannot be reliable or safe if you're

465
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:35,299
not also secure and so we have to

466
00:17:35,299 --> 00:17:38,280
include that in the equation that is not

467
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:41,520
a an option it is a requirement for

468
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,799
these systems to operate safely I mean

469
00:17:43,799 --> 00:17:45,960
where we're seeing a lot of cyber

470
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:48,539
threats is no longer just getting data

471
00:17:48,539 --> 00:17:51,360
and being able to you know use data by

472
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,220
cyber adversaries we're seeing

473
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:55,200
capabilities out there that are that

474
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,179
could have destructive capabilities

475
00:17:57,179 --> 00:17:59,520
safety impacts you think Triton tries

476
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,860
this you think pipe dream these are real

477
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:03,780
threats that could actually have

478
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:05,640
operational impacts so I think we're

479
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,440
seeing a shift we're seeing a shift in

480
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,900
the in the community to say we got to

481
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:12,000
make sure that these things are designed

482
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,120
with security in mind and and so to to

483
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,200
the comments in terms of the

484
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,660
manufacturers we've had agreements in

485
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:20,760
place for side tricks with Hitachi

486
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:23,520
energy Schweitzer and Schneider and I'm

487
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,820
really excited that we just signed a

488
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:29,780
brand new agreement with GE gas power

489
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:32,700
and it was really exciting to get GE gas

490
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:34,980
power on board as well and what I'd say

491
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:36,600
about these vendors is they're coming to

492
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,880
the table because they recognize they

493
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,380
want to ensure the security of their

494
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:42,840
products they want to make sure that

495
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:45,299
they're applying the best techniques to

496
00:18:45,299 --> 00:18:47,100
secure them in the future and I had

497
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:48,780
applaud them for being partners with us

498
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:52,320
so um you know again I think cyber

499
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,880
informed engineering is where we need to

500
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,860
be and would be happy to talk more about

501
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:57,480
that if you had any specifics on it I

502
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:58,740
don't know I don't know that I'm on the

503
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:00,660
same page with you on side tricks but I

504
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:02,520
think the Cyber informed engineering is

505
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,920
is interesting and how is that different

506
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,299
[Music]

507
00:19:06,299 --> 00:19:08,160
would you say that's different by than

508
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,559
secure by Design or is that are they

509
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:12,240
kind of just different names for the

510
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,260
same thing

511
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:15,419
I think there's there's certainly

512
00:19:15,419 --> 00:19:18,240
um uh similar Concepts I mean even cyber

513
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,860
informed engineering secure by Design is

514
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:21,419
one of those those terms that have been

515
00:19:21,419 --> 00:19:24,120
around yeah for a very long time

516
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:26,640
um where what we've done now is we've

517
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,740
built a strategy around it to say here

518
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:30,600
are specific things that we need to do

519
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,820
as a community and so one of the next

520
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:34,740
steps is the strategies on our website I

521
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:36,480
encourage you to look at it is we want

522
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,160
to work with the community to say what

523
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,080
are specific activities that we can do

524
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:43,440
together to buy down that cyber risk in

525
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,120
our engineering designs going forward

526
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,520
for for example one of the things we've

527
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,320
been thinking about is how do we better

528
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:52,020
work with the IEEE community in terms of

529
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:55,220
their standards so if you control F

530
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:58,860
substation standard out there you don't

531
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:01,080
see cyber in that substation standard

532
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:03,600
it's all design standards so how do we

533
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,120
better work with engineering communities

534
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:09,059
and standards organizations to ensure

535
00:20:09,059 --> 00:20:10,860
that we can look at their standards and

536
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:12,840
say you can change this by doing this

537
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:15,480
this and this to build in some of the

538
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,820
security requirements that's just one

539
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:19,200
example of what we need to be doing but

540
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,820
there's a lot more we can do with

541
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:23,220
Academia engineering schools out there

542
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:25,799
to embed cyber into the curriculum going

543
00:20:25,799 --> 00:20:28,080
forward and

544
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,120
I think it's acknowledged in the

545
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:31,799
document which is quite a good document

546
00:20:31,799 --> 00:20:34,080
I'd encourage people to look at it this

547
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,580
is a long process

548
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:37,620
and we got to start it sometime right

549
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:39,539
and it probably should have started 10

550
00:20:39,539 --> 00:20:42,120
15 20 years ago but we have to start

551
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:44,400
sometime so that's good you can you can

552
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,740
only do what you can do today right

553
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:50,100
but what does some of the early winds

554
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:53,340
look like like sometimes in these 10 15

555
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:55,799
year projects

556
00:20:55,799 --> 00:20:57,660
you just don't know if you're making any

557
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:59,160
progress for the first couple years but

558
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:01,500
like two years from now how would we

559
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:04,799
know if we have started down that path

560
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:07,020
in our succeeding

561
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:10,620
you know there's a lot to work on when

562
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:12,000
it comes to the concept like cyber

563
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,340
informed engineering

564
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:15,419
we've been talking about that a lot with

565
00:21:15,419 --> 00:21:17,100
my team in terms of where can we

566
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:19,500
actually have an impact and so one of

567
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,299
the first areas we'd like to focus on is

568
00:21:21,299 --> 00:21:22,640
standards

569
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:26,039
again as someone who is designing this

570
00:21:26,039 --> 00:21:28,620
equipment I'd be pulling up IEEE Sanders

571
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:30,900
design it why don't we as a cyber

572
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:33,419
community go to them and go into their

573
00:21:33,419 --> 00:21:35,400
space to say instead of trying to create

574
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,500
a whole new standard you have to follow

575
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:40,559
can we partner with you and help update

576
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:42,120
your standard with some of these I think

577
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:43,440
we can do that I think it's low hanging

578
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,280
fruit

579
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,840
we can do that

580
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:49,260
ASAP it will take two different

581
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:51,780
communities coming together the

582
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:53,940
engineers and the Cyber folks unlike

583
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:57,059
ever before I think this conference is

584
00:21:57,059 --> 00:21:58,679
where you're actually seeing those

585
00:21:58,679 --> 00:22:00,360
communities come together but we need

586
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,860
this to we need to take this back to

587
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:03,659
some of the organizations out there but

588
00:22:03,659 --> 00:22:05,280
I think that's an area that is right for

589
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,200
us to in two years if we haven't done

590
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,880
something in this space to change

591
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,880
standards I don't think we'll have

592
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,559
succeeded in the way I'd like to succeed

593
00:22:13,559 --> 00:22:16,559
you know one thing I noticed I think it

594
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:19,740
was on page nine you had four bulleted

595
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:22,500
examples you said these are examples

596
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,299
where cyber informed engineering will

597
00:22:24,299 --> 00:22:25,559
make a difference

598
00:22:25,559 --> 00:22:29,340
and three of the examples were

599
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:32,100
maintaining a manual capability

600
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:34,740
manual operations capability and the

601
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:36,780
fourth example was having the safety

602
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:37,860
system

603
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:41,100
separated from the control system

604
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:44,580
so to me all those are saying you need

605
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:47,580
to be able to continue to operate

606
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:49,500
in a certain time period you know you

607
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,059
might have an RTO a recovery time

608
00:22:51,059 --> 00:22:52,559
objective but you need to be able to

609
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:55,740
operate your critical infrastructure if

610
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:58,440
your ICS is hit

611
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:00,539
um why not I mean especially since there

612
00:23:00,539 --> 00:23:02,280
were only four examples and all all four

613
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:04,620
were like that why not just say that

614
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:06,780
so those are just examples of things

615
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:08,520
that we should be thinking about

616
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,659
um certainly we need to do a lot more

617
00:23:09,659 --> 00:23:11,460
than that okay um you know when we think

618
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:13,860
of the the cyber security framework of

619
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:15,659
identify protect detect yeah respond and

620
00:23:15,659 --> 00:23:18,179
recover we have to have plans along all

621
00:23:18,179 --> 00:23:21,120
of those areas they can't just be all

622
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:21,840
um

623
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,760
um protect we have to be doing more

624
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:26,640
detection we have to be prepared for a

625
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,700
day when you have to have some type of

626
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:32,100
manual operations the reality is with

627
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:34,159
the energy sector electricity sector

628
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:36,900
every other sector depends on it being

629
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:40,440
up we cannot function in terms of our

630
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:42,059
Economic Security our national security

631
00:23:42,059 --> 00:23:44,400
without electricity it's one of those

632
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,840
critical sectors in fact a super

633
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:48,000
critical sector so we have to be

634
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,980
thinking about some of those manual

635
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:52,620
operations and other ways to ensure that

636
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:55,080
we have that but those are examples we

637
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:56,460
need to think more broadly than that as

638
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:58,260
well yeah I do think you're right I

639
00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:00,659
think I think that that could be like a

640
00:24:00,659 --> 00:24:02,100
short-term win

641
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:03,780
you know because someone can do that

642
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:06,600
pretty quickly but the idea of working

643
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:08,880
with maybe SEI or someone else on the

644
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,220
coding side and the engineering side I I

645
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:13,020
think that's really a worthy effort I'm

646
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:14,520
hoping

647
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,020
you know it's been taught as you said

648
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:17,760
it's been it's the concept has been

649
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,679
around but now you've got this great

650
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:21,720
paper out you've got some mind share

651
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:24,480
behind it we have uh inl here with their

652
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,820
CCE which is kind of related and I'm

653
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:29,039
really excited to see if we can move

654
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:30,480
that forward

655
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,880
well I I I'd love to do that would love

656
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,340
to partner with this community here so

657
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:38,700
we're going to be doing Outreach to the

658
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:41,039
OT cyber security Community to the

659
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:43,140
traditional engineers and we're going to

660
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:44,700
need all of you coming to the table to

661
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:47,159
actually put forth their ideas on how we

662
00:24:47,159 --> 00:24:48,840
can move the ball forward so we would

663
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:50,220
look forward to doing that

664
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:53,460
and to me that it was going to Pivot to

665
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:55,280
this clean energy cyber security

666
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:57,720
accelerator that might be an excellent

667
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:59,760
project for your accelerator to try to

668
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,919
get some of the

669
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:03,900
OT vendors and maybe asset owners

670
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:05,280
because there's parts of it to both

671
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,140
involved in that

672
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:09,360
yeah so that's a that's a really

673
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:12,780
exciting um effort that we just launched

674
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:14,940
um it's called the clean energy cyber

675
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:16,620
accelerator

676
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:19,320
um so my office Caesar is certainly

677
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:21,179
focused on Cyber threats I would say

678
00:25:21,179 --> 00:25:22,919
more than half of our budget is focused

679
00:25:22,919 --> 00:25:24,900
on Cyber addressing cyber

680
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:26,940
um but we are in all hazards office I'm

681
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:29,220
looking at threats such as climate-based

682
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:31,559
risks physical security incidents like

683
00:25:31,559 --> 00:25:33,419
the ones we saw in Moore County we're

684
00:25:33,419 --> 00:25:35,760
looking at an electromagnetic pulse or

685
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,980
an EMP we're looking at geomagnetic

686
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:40,080
disturbances any risk or threat that can

687
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,480
impact the energy sector so in that vein

688
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,940
we are thinking of climate risks and so

689
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:47,220
we know that with these climate risks

690
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:50,279
that are upon us that are causing these

691
00:25:50,279 --> 00:25:51,960
hundred year every 100 Year storms to be

692
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,659
every couple of years now

693
00:25:53,659 --> 00:25:56,460
we have to address that risk we have to

694
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:59,220
address that by evolving Technologies by

695
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:01,100
integrating new sources of generation

696
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:04,380
wind solar batteries electric vehicles

697
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:06,840
all of this needs to come online as we

698
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:09,360
start to battle the climate-based risks

699
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:12,000
that are out there now as we do that

700
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,159
we're adding more connectivity more

701
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:16,380
sources of generation more comps

702
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:19,320
Pathways new architectures onto an

703
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:23,039
already very complex electric grid so we

704
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:24,360
need to ensure we're getting ahead of

705
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:26,580
this you know I like to say we have an

706
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:28,380
opportunity right now in the in the

707
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:32,039
energy sector globally to ensure that we

708
00:26:32,039 --> 00:26:34,559
are building back to cyber cyber

709
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:37,020
informed Engineering in the past we had

710
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:38,760
a grid of the past that we were bolting

711
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:41,279
on security onto how do we re really

712
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:43,140
ensure that as we're designing the grid

713
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:45,000
of the future that is not just

714
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,640
theoretical anymore the the government

715
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:50,159
is spending trillions of dollars private

716
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:52,440
Equity is spending trillions of dollars

717
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:54,840
in the Grid in the next five to ten

718
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:57,600
years doe alone will be spending 62

719
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,179
billion dollars to advance the clean

720
00:27:00,179 --> 00:27:01,340
energy

721
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:04,919
grid of the future just alone that

722
00:27:04,919 --> 00:27:06,120
doesn't even include in the private

723
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:08,220
investment so we're seeing all this big

724
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:10,140
shift in change happening in the energy

725
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:13,559
sector and so we need to find novel ways

726
00:27:13,559 --> 00:27:14,940
of getting together a cyber community

727
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:17,640
with the clean energy community and

728
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:18,840
again there's a very different community

729
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:21,779
so this accelerator is one such way we

730
00:27:21,779 --> 00:27:24,360
get to do that we have a at our national

731
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:26,760
renewable energy laboratory and some of

732
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:28,679
those folks I believe are in the room we

733
00:27:28,679 --> 00:27:31,620
have a a test ground we have a cyber

734
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:34,500
range where they've actually set up a

735
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:37,380
wind solar EVS batteries all in a

736
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:39,659
connected grid environment disconnected

737
00:27:39,659 --> 00:27:41,880
from the live grid because it can

738
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:44,640
generate its own energy but the cool

739
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,440
thing we can do is bring in cyber

740
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:48,539
security technology vendors to come in

741
00:27:48,539 --> 00:27:50,820
and test their tools and products in

742
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:53,100
that environment before it gets deployed

743
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:55,559
into the broader energy sector and so we

744
00:27:55,559 --> 00:27:57,120
started with the First Technology the

745
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,039
first cohort was multi-factor

746
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:01,400
multi-factor authentication Technologies

747
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:03,179
there's a group of subject matter

748
00:28:03,179 --> 00:28:04,919
experts that review Technologies they

749
00:28:04,919 --> 00:28:06,659
picked a couple that they're going to

750
00:28:06,659 --> 00:28:09,000
test in this environment to see do they

751
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,940
apply in this new grid of the future and

752
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:13,380
we're going to continue doing that type

753
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:15,659
of testing on different types of

754
00:28:15,659 --> 00:28:18,960
security measures and Technologies using

755
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,520
the accelerator site I'd encourage you

756
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:23,400
to look at it we just closed cohort 2 of

757
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:27,179
a new of to Discovery in an OT

758
00:28:27,179 --> 00:28:28,380
environment or in clean energy

759
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:30,360
environment we're going to be continuing

760
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:32,159
to do more cohorts and I encourage folks

761
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:33,600
to look at it yeah I had a question on

762
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:36,360
that but just to let people know and uh

763
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:39,659
nrel National National renewable energy

764
00:28:39,659 --> 00:28:41,940
laboratory they are outside they're one

765
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:43,620
of the worthy causes today so if you

766
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:45,120
want to learn more they're they're right

767
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,940
outside the doors there

768
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:49,500
it's funny I had Marty Edwards up here

769
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:51,779
years ago and I had like a table and I

770
00:28:51,779 --> 00:28:53,640
had like a spotlight on them like I was

771
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,200
interrogating him but one of the

772
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,900
questions I asked him back then and I've

773
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:00,240
asked a few government people is your

774
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,400
job is so hard you've got you talked at

775
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,559
the beginning about the scope of it so

776
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:06,840
I'm always a little bit surprised when

777
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:09,900
you do things that

778
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:12,539
the commercial world is already doing so

779
00:29:12,539 --> 00:29:14,760
for like you mentioned cohort cohort 2

780
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:16,020
they said

781
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:18,659
they are seeking applicants with

782
00:29:18,659 --> 00:29:21,539
solutions that actively identify all ICS

783
00:29:21,539 --> 00:29:23,220
assets connected to a utilities

784
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:25,620
infrastructure well I mean dragons

785
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:28,380
Clarity no Zone mealtoria I mean skate

786
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:30,840
offense I mean that's that's

787
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:33,360
you know the largest number of our

788
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:36,000
sponsors do that that's that's kind of

789
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,159
proven

790
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:41,159
um why would you repeat something that

791
00:29:41,159 --> 00:29:43,200
the industry has already shown

792
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,140
so when you have so much to do already

793
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:48,600
so the the different thing here is this

794
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:51,360
is a different evolving grid this isn't

795
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,860
the grid of the past that we've been

796
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:55,260
using these Technologies on these These

797
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:57,419
are newcom's Pathways these are new

798
00:29:57,419 --> 00:29:59,520
connection points that we have not seen

799
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,380
before in a grid environment so you're

800
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:03,539
seeing different sensor requirements out

801
00:30:03,539 --> 00:30:05,039
there you might see different sensor

802
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:06,720
apartments different places to put this

803
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:09,840
asset Discovery and in some cases some

804
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,039
of the Technologies you just mentioned

805
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:14,340
are great tools out there and they will

806
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:15,899
work fantastically in this new

807
00:30:15,899 --> 00:30:17,580
environment in other cases they might

808
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:21,179
not but the energy Community you know

809
00:30:21,179 --> 00:30:23,880
generally traditional utilities want to

810
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:25,320
play it safe for good reason right they

811
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:27,480
don't want to add latency they don't

812
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:29,399
want to break things right and so

813
00:30:29,399 --> 00:30:31,380
there's always that concern of if I go

814
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:33,600
deploy this new technology will it

815
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,340
create an impact on my system and have

816
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:38,220
unnecessary consequences and so giving

817
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:41,159
the both the manufacturers and the

818
00:30:41,159 --> 00:30:43,860
utility Community a space to something

819
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:46,260
and then deploy it broadly now we might

820
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:47,820
be able to test it quickly right yeah

821
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:50,159
and say cool this works but in other

822
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:52,380
cases if it does cause an impact we

823
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:54,539
might need to work with the manufacturer

824
00:30:54,539 --> 00:30:56,520
to say how do you change it so that it

825
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:58,200
doesn't have that impact yeah that's

826
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,520
what I was thinking so are you actually

827
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:02,039
seeing sometimes where the vendors come

828
00:31:02,039 --> 00:31:04,559
in with one product and then based on

829
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:06,720
what they learn change their products to

830
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,940
to better suit this environment that

831
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:10,740
they're testing so so we just went

832
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:13,679
through cohort one okay uh this is still

833
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:16,440
um this effort is in its infancy you

834
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:18,500
just launched cohort 2 and asked for

835
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:22,260
folks to apply to it and even with

836
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:24,120
cohort one there have been just great

837
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:25,980
conversations with the experts at the

838
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:28,020
National Lab and the Cyber technologies

839
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:30,779
that we're chosen to say how do we think

840
00:31:30,779 --> 00:31:32,279
of this differently where could this be

841
00:31:32,279 --> 00:31:33,779
placed instead of here versus there so

842
00:31:33,779 --> 00:31:36,419
so there actually is fueling really

843
00:31:36,419 --> 00:31:39,240
great conversations between experts both

844
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:41,760
at the technology developers so yes we

845
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:42,600
are seeing some of those great

846
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:45,179
conversations well it's as an incredibly

847
00:31:45,179 --> 00:31:47,880
broad scope incredibly hard job I mean

848
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:50,520
these these are not easy problems and I

849
