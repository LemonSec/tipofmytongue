[Music]

3
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:08,240
good morning everybody

4
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:11,940
and Bill thank you for flying down to be

5
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:13,740
interviewed at S4 I'd really appreciate

6
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:15,960
it absolutely happy to happy to be here

7
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18,300
and was uh very humbled to be asked and

8
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:21,359
uh good to be in front of this group who

9
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:24,779
actually do all the critical stuff even

10
00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:26,580
though I do stay awake at night I'm glad

11
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:28,920
you're all here and working yeah Bill

12
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,260
asked me who usually attends and I told

13
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:33,000
them it's a wide variety of people but I

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,399
said it tends to be the people that he

15
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:37,500
would ask what's going on you know the

16
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,600
kind of the the experts that the

17
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,760
executives say what's going on but let's

18
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,579
start with something positive

19
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:47,100
I've heard nothing but good news I've

20
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:49,500
heard in some of your interviews and

21
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,360
from almost every person that there's

22
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,280
been great progress in the information

23
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,280
sharing of threat intelligence two-way

24
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,660
information sharing between the

25
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:59,820
utilities and the government I think I

26
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:02,160
wrote it down here puesh of Caesar

27
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,879
called it extreme collaboration

28
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,040
maybe talk a little bit about what's

29
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:11,939
happened and what was the trigger you

30
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:13,560
know two years ago that gave it that big

31
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,119
jump start

32
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:18,020
so all the credit for where we sit today

33
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:20,840
was really built on a foundation

34
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:24,420
that Tom Fanning started a number of

35
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:26,880
years ago when he was one of the first

36
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,040
ones into the electric sector

37
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,600
coordinating Council

38
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:34,280
he took it to a point and then

39
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:39,140
when this the new Administration came in

40
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:41,400
Pierce kumara who I think you're going

41
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,680
to have tomorrow

42
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:45,780
was really one of the fundamental

43
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:48,960
drivers to opening up the door to get

44
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,200
communication going and

45
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:56,100
as far as what really prompted it it was

46
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:59,840
really the concern around events and

47
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,399
of course we've had a few Colonial

48
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:04,259
Pipeline and others that have happened

49
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:06,780
but there's also been a number of events

50
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:08,098
that

51
00:02:08,098 --> 00:02:08,758
um

52
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:10,560
occurred which

53
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,000
really began to drive the need to open

54
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,860
up the communication paths with the

55
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:18,379
intelligence community

56
00:02:18,379 --> 00:02:22,500
and for my perspective I've been in this

57
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,480
business a long time

58
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,420
I've never had such an Open Door

59
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:30,840
opportunity as we do today to go talk to

60
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:33,980
and work with the intelligence community

61
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:37,140
and that's really fundamental to our

62
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:39,780
success in what we're trying to do

63
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:41,700
it's been ongoing now for a couple years

64
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,800
at this heightened level and and the

65
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,360
two-way so not just feeding them

66
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,739
information but them sending you

67
00:02:46,739 --> 00:02:48,480
information back

68
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,360
has this information stopped a tax or

69
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,180
reduced the impact of anything like if

70
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:56,099
this didn't exist would we have seen

71
00:02:56,099 --> 00:02:58,019
something bad happen

72
00:02:58,019 --> 00:03:00,300
well I don't know if I could

73
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:03,180
prognosticate on what may or may not

74
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:04,319
have happened

75
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:06,660
um in in this Arena

76
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:09,180
but at least in our case for instance

77
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:11,280
we're hit with about three and a half

78
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,360
billion

79
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:15,000
strikes a day against our networks of

80
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,099
which you know 10 percent of that is

81
00:03:17,099 --> 00:03:21,019
really legitimate actual traffic and

82
00:03:21,019 --> 00:03:25,500
my view of this is that the fact that we

83
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:28,260
have such a strong relationship now with

84
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:29,900
the intelligence community

85
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:33,379
is a strong deterrent to

86
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:36,480
what an adversary may want to do or

87
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:40,200
think about doing from this and the fact

88
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,819
that we're standing

89
00:03:41,819 --> 00:03:44,420
shoulder to shoulder with each other

90
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:48,900
is to me a very strong foundation for

91
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,239
the future

92
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:53,159
versus where we were in the past which

93
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:56,220
was admittedly quite frustrating where

94
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:58,200
we were asked to send an inordinate

95
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,420
amount of information in right and we

96
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:04,140
got zero back yeah and that was

97
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:06,360
extremely frustrating and so the fact

98
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,220
that we're now actually collaborating

99
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:09,980
and getting

100
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:12,659
actionable information coming back to us

101
00:04:12,659 --> 00:04:16,139
that we can actually use to increase our

102
00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:20,399
defense posture is is really helpful

103
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:23,100
I the audience might be tired but I'm

104
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:26,340
really hung up on metrics

105
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:29,280
apparently uh

106
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,900
how are you going to measure this how

107
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,400
are you going to because you can keep

108
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,320
you could invest more and more money in

109
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,820
this right you could

110
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:37,800
increase so you could put more sensors

111
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,199
in you could hire more analysis analysts

112
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:42,240
and you can spend money in a lot of

113
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,639
different places too so how do you say

114
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:47,100
this program is worth our expenditure

115
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:49,199
today or we should be doubling and

116
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:51,840
tripling down on it yeah so Jeff

117
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,060
Baumgartner who's the Vice President in

118
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,979
our organization who I work most closely

119
00:04:55,979 --> 00:04:58,280
with and he's here

120
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:00,720
he'll tell you there's there hasn't been

121
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,540
a defensive posture software program

122
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:05,400
that I haven't fallen in love with and

123
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,440
said let's go put this one in then let's

124
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,820
go put this one in as we're walking

125
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:10,680
around this morning it's like what's

126
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,940
that one do like what's that one do

127
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:13,139
what's that one do

128
00:05:13,139 --> 00:05:14,580
um you know I

129
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:17,580
this is one of those things where at

130
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:19,860
least at our companies there's a

131
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:22,860
fundamental belief that if you can't

132
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:25,620
afford to protect

133
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:28,860
your employees your customers and the

134
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:30,360
company and the company's reputation

135
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,820
then you shouldn't be in business now

136
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:35,160
that doesn't mean there's unlimited

137
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:38,940
funding unlimited resources and such and

138
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:41,400
I get asked a lot around how do we look

139
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,900
at

140
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:45,660
what's our success factor on all of this

141
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:49,500
and and clearly for us it's that we're

142
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,419
continuing to build our defense in depth

143
00:05:51,419 --> 00:05:54,660
we're be we're continuing to make sure

144
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:57,240
that if we do have an event and that's

145
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,940
our assumption always that something is

146
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:01,800
going to get through

147
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,139
uh can we first

148
00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:05,699
stranded

149
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:08,900
in a place that isn't as a

150
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:13,320
negatively impactful for us and if it is

151
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,360
do we have the capabilities to quickly

152
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,000
respond and restore and that's again a

153
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,419
fundamental for us and the way I look at

154
00:06:21,419 --> 00:06:26,039
it is have we had to use any of those

155
00:06:26,039 --> 00:06:29,039
strategies and if not then we're

156
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:31,919
successful okay

157
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:33,539
you know when you were talking about all

158
00:06:33,539 --> 00:06:35,400
those programs you were liking I think

159
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,960
you probably

160
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,340
the people out there were saying oh

161
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:39,900
maybe I'll go work for bill because

162
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,660
that's that's not a very common thing to

163
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:45,120
hear a CEO say I fall in love with a lot

164
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,520
of technology and I'm always looking to

165
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,100
do that oftentimes it's a little harder

166
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:53,819
sell to get them involved we do have a

167
00:06:53,819 --> 00:06:55,259
couple of organizations here that are

168
00:06:55,259 --> 00:06:58,139
involved with Rural Electric and you

169
00:06:58,139 --> 00:06:59,940
know you come from Nebraska you've seen

170
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:01,979
some rural some Farmland in your in

171
00:07:01,979 --> 00:07:04,580
small Utilities in your time

172
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:07,020
how do they play here how big of an

173
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:09,419
investment do they need to make to to

174
00:07:09,419 --> 00:07:11,160
play in this game to get some of that

175
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:14,160
information and and be able to use it

176
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,580
so I think that's where the the ISAC

177
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:19,080
comes into play

178
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,699
um

179
00:07:20,699 --> 00:07:23,220
I fully understand that not every

180
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:25,139
Municipal not every

181
00:07:25,139 --> 00:07:28,740
Co-op or even a small investor on

182
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:31,380
utility may have the resources

183
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:33,300
to do what

184
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:37,620
others do and the beauty of the E ISAC

185
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:39,840
frankly is that everything that we do

186
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,180
everything that we learn every strategy

187
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:44,639
that we can deploy

188
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,560
goes into there and it can get pushed

189
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,120
out so that everybody can see it

190
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,580
everybody can understand it

191
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:53,880
um it's it's a little bit akin to

192
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:57,120
um back in my in my Nuclear days where I

193
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,520
always talked about were hostages of

194
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,400
each other I I think that that same

195
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:06,900
philosophy is in this world that we're

196
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:10,139
all in this together and that we have to

197
00:08:10,139 --> 00:08:13,440
help each other in fact at our companies

198
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,319
we have a very aggressive uh fishing

199
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:18,780
test program that we do

200
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:21,900
and when we first started it it was sort

201
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:24,180
of every person for themselves if if

202
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:25,979
someone saw the phishing test come out

203
00:08:25,979 --> 00:08:28,860
they would like Silo up not click on it

204
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:33,120
and and move on and we've now

205
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,520
through a lot of communication a lot of

206
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:38,279
training we've now turned it into it's a

207
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:41,279
team sport so if a phishing test if a

208
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:43,559
fish test is coming out and you see it

209
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:46,080
now it's yelling through the hallways

210
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,760
you know don't click on the free Apple

211
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:52,080
coupon you know it's a bad thing and so

212
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,200
we've turned it into a team sport which

213
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:59,220
again is culturally where I want this to

214
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:01,620
head for us okay

215
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:03,959
Let's uh switch a little bit and talk

216
00:09:03,959 --> 00:09:05,700
about recovery

217
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,980
how do you think the industry as a whole

218
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:10,560
and Berkshire Hathaway energy in

219
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,680
particular our position to recover from

220
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,420
a significant

221
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:19,260
cyber caused outage yeah well I think in

222
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:21,240
our case we

223
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:24,240
we drill on this constantly we've we've

224
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,660
put in Investments with an assumption

225
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:30,720
that we're going to be hit and that we

226
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,660
have to be able to recover quickly and

227
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:35,760
as we're going through

228
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:41,700
design of new systems they all have to

229
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:44,220
start with the thought up front that we

230
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:45,959
have to be able to recover from this so

231
00:09:45,959 --> 00:09:48,019
does that mean we're running ghost

232
00:09:48,019 --> 00:09:50,959
systems with it and we have to invest in

233
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:53,120
additional

234
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,899
components and that's what we're going

235
00:09:54,899 --> 00:09:57,839
to do where everybody else sits I think

236
00:09:57,839 --> 00:09:59,880
that again it's it's a little bit

237
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:02,339
varying as you go down through bigger

238
00:10:02,339 --> 00:10:05,399
companies to smaller companies but I

239
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:07,820
think it's it's a collective defense

240
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:11,940
such that if most of the grid is

241
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:14,839
protected then if we do have an event

242
00:10:14,839 --> 00:10:20,339
that occurs at a smaller utility then we

243
00:10:20,339 --> 00:10:22,860
can surround that with help and support

244
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:25,320
which is really where the SEC comes in

245
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:28,200
that we have that mechanism to get

246
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,940
coordination between the industry and

247
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:33,480
government to go jump in we also have

248
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,760
the Cyber Mutual assistance program that

249
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:39,480
is now in place which we developed a

250
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:42,000
number of years ago we haven't actually

251
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,760
had to deploy it but maybe one or two

252
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:47,279
times but it has been deployed it has

253
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:50,160
been deployed not in a big way but we

254
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:53,459
have uh offer assistance to a couple

255
00:10:53,459 --> 00:10:58,019
folks and much like Mutual assistance

256
00:10:58,019 --> 00:11:00,180
for line workers right

257
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:03,060
um and and admittedly that that

258
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:05,399
assistance program isn't it isn't

259
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:07,140
perfect because everybody's computer

260
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:09,000
programs and systems are different and

261
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,160
networks are different but a lot of

262
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,720
times you just need folks who can come

263
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,060
in and and restart computers and get

264
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:17,339
them get them going and really anybody

265
00:11:17,339 --> 00:11:20,399
can who's in that world can go do that

266
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:21,959
type of work while the the more

267
00:11:21,959 --> 00:11:23,700
technical work is getting done by the

268
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:26,399
folks who know it and so I think we've

269
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:27,779
done and

270
00:11:27,779 --> 00:11:31,260
a good effort in that regard to put in

271
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:33,500
mutual assistance and

272
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,640
hopefully we'll never have to use it but

273
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,680
I think we're ready if we do yeah and I

274
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,680
think um I'm sure Megan Samford is here

275
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:42,779
and some people from Isa there's a kind

276
00:11:42,779 --> 00:11:45,420
of a parallel exercise it's called ics

277
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:48,120
for ICS incident

278
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:50,459
command system for ICS where they're

279
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:53,040
actually trying to credential people to

280
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,140
say oh this person is capable of doing

281
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:57,540
these sorts of things kind of kind of

282
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:58,860
like they've done it with the linemen

283
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:00,360
where you have different credentials

284
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,339
okay it's still very early but I think

285
00:12:02,339 --> 00:12:03,779
you know there's and I believe there's

286
00:12:03,779 --> 00:12:05,760
some crosstalk between those two okay

287
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,740
excellent the the other area that I've

288
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:10,079
heard you talk about and is really in

289
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:12,240
the news lately is Transformers and

290
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,339
other physical equipment and sparing

291
00:12:14,339 --> 00:12:17,399
programs because I mean still it's one

292
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:18,720
of those things where we're seeing more

293
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,420
actual incidents from physical right

294
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:23,700
right so far we haven't

295
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,680
at least it hasn't been public knowledge

296
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,540
of Transformers exploding because of

297
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:29,100
cyber attacks

298
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:31,740
um you know maybe coming someday I have

299
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:33,360
seen a Transformer

300
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,579
explode I think in New Jersey because

301
00:12:35,579 --> 00:12:38,160
someone made a database error no but it

302
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,740
wasn't malicious it was just a different

303
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:43,260
kind of Silence accident but how do you

304
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:45,360
see these you I've heard them called

305
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,760
spare Transformer program strategic

306
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,920
Transformer Reserve do you think that's

307
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:53,040
important and if if so or if not that's

308
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,779
fine but if so how would you see that

309
00:12:54,779 --> 00:12:56,339
best implemented so I think it's

310
00:12:56,339 --> 00:12:58,320
critically important we're a founding

311
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,420
member of a couple of those programs

312
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:03,540
where we're sparing Transformers and and

313
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:05,899
working with government to

314
00:13:05,899 --> 00:13:09,300
ensure that we have access to the

315
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:12,360
Transformers that that we need I would

316
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,820
say that we were pretty disappointed

317
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:19,620
when the iija came out and there was not

318
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:23,399
money in there for support of domestic

319
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:24,839
Transformer development and

320
00:13:24,839 --> 00:13:26,180
Manufacturing

321
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:30,180
even though doe recognizes that it's

322
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:32,120
it's a clear issue for us

323
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:35,339
that we have to figure out how to get

324
00:13:35,339 --> 00:13:39,079
that manufacturing into the into the U.S

325
00:13:39,079 --> 00:13:41,459
do we have enough Transformers out there

326
00:13:41,459 --> 00:13:43,800
absolutely not especially these days

327
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:46,139
especially these days and and I would

328
00:13:46,139 --> 00:13:48,480
say that uh sometimes you're better

329
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,579
lucky than good but the fact that we had

330
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:53,279
a relatively light hurricane season

331
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,959
storm season

332
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,420
was very helpful because we didn't burn

333
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:59,540
through the inventory that we do have

334
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:02,300
and and again that's an area where

335
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,920
there's good Mutual assistance if people

336
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:07,700
need components there's good sharing but

337
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:11,880
in these times it's a little more

338
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:14,240
stressful to give up Transformers

339
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,920
because now you don't know when you're

340
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:20,279
going to get them back and so it is it's

341
00:14:20,279 --> 00:14:23,760
a stress point I think that the

342
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,980
leadership of doe fully understand it's

343
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:29,220
a stress point and we're working on some

344
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:31,760
solutions with them and through the escc

345
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,680
but that's all going to take time to get

346
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,839
manufacturing stood up in this country

347
00:14:36,839 --> 00:14:38,579
and and help

348
00:14:38,579 --> 00:14:41,940
give them volume so that they have the

349
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:44,040
confidence to start building

350
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,320
Transformers here at a rate that we need

351
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,720
well and you could have I mean this is

352
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,399
we're more of an ICS crowd than an

353
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:52,880
engineering crowd you could have some

354
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,079
relays and other things that could be

355
00:14:55,079 --> 00:14:56,459
you know you could have all your relays

356
00:14:56,459 --> 00:14:58,139
bricked or something like that and so

357
00:14:58,139 --> 00:15:00,420
there's a this whole concept of having

358
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:03,180
enough spares to deal with this

359
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:04,980
who pays for that or who do you think

360
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:07,440
should pay for that increased level of

361
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,060
sparing if that's something we should be

362
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:10,920
doing so it's going to it's ultimately

363
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:14,279
going to be the customers and for the

364
00:15:14,279 --> 00:15:17,000
for the regulated utilities

365
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,620
we've been talking with

366
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:22,320
nehruk which is the the group of all the

367
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,579
Regulators in the country where

368
00:15:25,579 --> 00:15:28,560
over the over the years it's always been

369
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:32,160
lowest cost option uh well now what

370
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,440
we're talking with them about is lowest

371
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:37,699
risk option which may actually cost more

372
00:15:37,699 --> 00:15:40,880
and doing an assessment around

373
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,160
components that

374
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:46,800
are significantly lower risk which may

375
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,000
cost more

376
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,420
but that's what we're going to be

377
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:55,500
pushing forward for approval and I was

378
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:58,079
at a neighbor conference a few months

379
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:00,959
ago with Chris English actually from the

380
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:04,740
national cyber office and that's what we

381
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:06,240
were actually talking to The Regulators

382
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,360
about is we have to change the mindset

383
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,620
that

384
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:13,079
it's no longer going to be the lowest

385
00:16:13,079 --> 00:16:15,959
cost because generally that could relate

386
00:16:15,959 --> 00:16:18,060
to being the highest risk

387
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:20,699
that's a state by state or jurisdiction

388
00:16:20,699 --> 00:16:23,459
by jurisdiction battle right it is yeah

389
00:16:23,459 --> 00:16:25,920
okay yeah but that that might be an area

390
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,779
where doe or someone else was showing

391
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:30,180
some leadership saying it is okay to do

392
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:32,399
this or that it is encouraged yep and

393
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:35,300
and one of the things that we have been

394
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:38,399
talking to doe about is

395
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:42,139
is that manufacturing cost Gap so that

396
00:16:42,139 --> 00:16:45,360
perhaps there can be Government funding

397
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,839
to step into that Gap from where we're

398
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:51,480
buying components today to U.S

399
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,860
Manufacturing

400
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:56,339
to allow that manufacturing to get their

401
00:16:56,339 --> 00:16:58,440
feet under them and get moving and bring

402
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,180
their costs down over time

403
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:03,300
with the government buying down that Gap

404
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:06,240
so to speak and we'll see where all that

405
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,359
heads it certainly is not an issue

406
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:11,400
with companies wanting to order

407
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,619
components you know there's there's

408
00:17:13,619 --> 00:17:14,819
plenty of

409
00:17:14,819 --> 00:17:19,439
of demand okay it's really getting that

410
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:22,140
into the hands of the manufacturers and

411
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:25,020
being willing to sign up for five years

412
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:26,880
worth of Transformers which we would

413
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,380
certainly could our companies we would

414
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,540
certainly be ready to do that okay

415
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:32,220
I want to talk a little bit more about

416
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:34,140
your company before we move to economics

417
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:36,360
you said something I found fascinating

418
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:38,340
when you Kim zetter interviewed you a

419
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:40,820
little bit ago and and you said you

420
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:43,679
Berkshire Hathaway energy takes recovery

421
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:46,679
planning using a drilling down approach

422
00:17:46,679 --> 00:17:49,140
taking automation technology the next

423
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:51,900
tool away and being able to deliver your

424
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:52,919
power

425
00:17:52,919 --> 00:17:55,559
So you you're constantly saying well

426
00:17:55,559 --> 00:17:57,539
what if we didn't have this what if we

427
00:17:57,539 --> 00:17:59,220
didn't have this

428
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:01,679
how does that report up or how do you

429
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:03,960
again how do you measure that how does

430
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,820
you're in the executive office someone

431
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:07,740
says we're doing this how do you track

432
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:10,200
that and decide whether enough is being

433
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:13,140
done or you need to do more on that well

434
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:14,880
again I can't speak for other companies

435
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,160
but in my case I'm actually personally

436
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:20,820
in uh in the control room area that

437
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:23,700
we're running these drills and talking

438
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:26,039
with the teams and

439
00:18:26,039 --> 00:18:29,600
challenging them on

440
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:32,640
the lack of Technology as we're going

441
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,100
through these

442
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:38,340
drills and these assessments and we're

443
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:40,799
very focused on

444
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:43,740
OT on these sort of like I don't care if

445
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:45,780
we lose email that's you know it's

446
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:47,700
really OT focused

447
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:52,280
and as we go through this

448
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:56,220
and we start stripping away technology

449
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:58,559
and we get down to a point where I sort

450
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:00,179
of laugh it's we're left with ham radio

451
00:19:00,179 --> 00:19:02,900
operators and cockroaches you know um

452
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:06,559
that are left standing on this thing and

453
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:10,320
uh and then we essentially look at what

454
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,179
the gaps are through that and then

455
00:19:12,179 --> 00:19:13,260
decide

456
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:14,700
is there

457
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:16,620
an alternate technology that we can

458
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:18,559
deploy is there

459
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:20,700
some sort of

460
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:21,620
um

461
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:24,059
communication process that we can put in

462
00:19:24,059 --> 00:19:26,640
place you know sort of go back find find

463
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,100
the retirees from 30 years ago who ran

464
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:32,039
the system on index cards you know can

465
00:19:32,039 --> 00:19:33,200
we do that

466
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,780
we do have a inventory across our

467
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:38,820
company on ham radio operators and we've

468
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:42,299
set up ham radio base because they'll be

469
00:19:42,299 --> 00:19:45,120
able to communicate to the very end

470
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:48,179
uh and so it's it's really peeling back

471
00:19:48,179 --> 00:19:51,600
every tool that our teams think they

472
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,960
have until they have nothing and then

473
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,320
rebuilding it back up to to say okay we

474
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,120
need to fill this Gap we have to figure

475
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,020
out

476
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:03,240
how we're going to go do that and

477
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,280
yeah some having access to some of those

478
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,799
retirees is important I know I don't

479
00:20:07,799 --> 00:20:09,539
know but I was told that Colonial

480
00:20:09,539 --> 00:20:11,760
pipeline actually had to call in some of

481
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:15,240
the old-timers to restart their pipeline

482
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,340
yeah yeah just because that had never

483
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:19,320
been experienced before and they did

484
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:19,980
that

485
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:22,679
okay let's switch to economics okay uh

486
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:25,140
you said something and I'll bring this

487
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,640
back to security but you said something

488
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,100
at the TCU Global energy event that just

489
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:31,559
blew me away you said if climate change

490
00:20:31,559 --> 00:20:33,600
is important to our customer then it

491
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,340
becomes important to us

492
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:37,380
I don't wake up every morning morning

493
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:39,480
personally worrying about climate change

494
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:42,480
I wake up wondering who's in my OT

495
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:45,720
networks that's right so in that sense I

496
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,820
I'd get the sense that you're going to

497
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:49,380
invest in climate change if your

498
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:53,100
customers think it's important but

499
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:55,799
Berkshire Hathaway energy has invested

500
00:20:55,799 --> 00:20:58,799
tremendously in renewable energy

501
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:01,919
so why would you are your customers

502
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:04,260
asking you to make that investment or

503
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:06,179
why would you make that large investment

504
00:21:06,179 --> 00:21:08,460
after saying something like that yeah

505
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:12,360
well it's really it's it's a risk-based

506
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:14,520
issue for me

507
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:15,179
um

508
00:21:15,179 --> 00:21:17,160
having

509
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:20,280
OT networks that are running not only in

510
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,700
this country but in Canada and the UK

511
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:26,880
and know that if we have issues with

512
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,400
that then there's immediate impacts to

513
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,260
customers there's immediate impacts to

514
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:32,760
our reputation

515
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,919
I sort of put that in a different column

516
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:37,380
than I put climate change I don't wake

517
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:40,100
up every morning

518
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:44,100
deathly afraid of of climate change

519
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:46,860
because we're making the Investments and

520
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:48,900
we've made the commitment to transition

521
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:52,500
Away by 2050 and those plans are in

522
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,299
place and the money is there and we have

523
00:21:54,299 --> 00:21:57,720
the resources to do it our customers are

524
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,640
asking for it um

525
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:01,700
a number of our customers

526
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:05,460
are tech companies and others who want

527
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:09,000
to have 24 7 Renewables and and

528
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,360
obviously in Iowa for instance Senator

529
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:15,900
Grassley was the was the father of the

530
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:20,640
production tax credit and so Iowa is I

531
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,980
would say the the poster child for

532
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:25,080
Renewables for our company we're going

533
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:28,460
to be essentially 100 over 100 percent

534
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:31,200
renewable in a couple years if you take

535
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:35,640
how much energy our customers use in and

536
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,679
factor that in how much we generate not

537
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:39,740
minute to minute but on an annual basis

538
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:43,559
so I sort of set that that's over here

539
00:22:43,559 --> 00:22:45,780
we've got the plans going forward we're

540
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:48,539
we're doing it

541
00:22:48,539 --> 00:22:51,480
OT networks is to me it's millisecond by

542
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,580
millisecond by millisecond like what is

543
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:56,280
happening and what are we doing to

544
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:59,880
prepare ourselves uh for that event that

545
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:02,220
will eventually occur and are we ready

546
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:03,419
yeah

547
00:23:03,419 --> 00:23:05,580
and related to that this is how it kind

548
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:07,620
of comes back you were talking in this

549
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:09,900
case about climate change but I think

550
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:11,580
the same

551
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:14,940
idea might apply to secure you said you

552
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:17,159
said how does this reasonably economic

553
00:23:17,159 --> 00:23:18,960
not hit the customer in terms of

554
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:21,539
increased energies costs

555
00:23:21,539 --> 00:23:23,700
and how does that apply to cyber

556
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:26,039
security so are we at a point where

557
00:23:26,039 --> 00:23:28,140
we're going to have to ask customers you

558
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:29,640
kind of touched on this earlier but

559
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,260
we're going to have to say look rates

560
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:33,840
are going up because we need to have a

561
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:36,360
more reliable secure grid are you

562
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:39,620
expecting that I am I I think that

563
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:42,320
as we

564
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,940
onshore

565
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:47,940
Transformers as we continue to really

566
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:50,840
have to invest in Technologies

567
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:53,820
to thwart the the various adversaries

568
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:55,679
that we have

569
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:57,780
um some of that can be absorbed within

570
00:23:57,780 --> 00:24:01,580
our operations But ultimately

571
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:04,559
to do it at a level that I think is

572
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:07,200
going to be expected particularly coming

573
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,600
out of the national cyber strategy

574
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,940
those are going to be costs that are

575
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:14,280
going to be above and beyond what most

576
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:16,080
companies are going to be able to absorb

577
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,840
and so I think there will be increased

578
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:20,900
costs because of security

579
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:24,120
but it's a cost of doing business again

580
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:27,120
I think it's one of these things where

581
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:29,220
um if you can't if you can't afford to

582
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:30,299
do this

583
00:24:30,299 --> 00:24:32,880
and do it right and keep your costs

584
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,460
reasonable for your customers then you

585
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:38,159
probably shouldn't be doing it

586
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:40,980
related to that ferc has been putting

587
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:44,580
out some rfis in that about carrots

588
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:46,559
about what I'm sorry carrots instead of

589
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:48,480
using sticks instead of lyric sip

590
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,159
they've been saying can we provide

591
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:53,340
incentives to utilities to spend money

592
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:55,799
on this and they've been asking for

593
00:24:55,799 --> 00:24:58,020
suggestions and they've put out saying

594
00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:00,659
hey we're thinking about doing this do

595
00:25:00,659 --> 00:25:02,700
you like the approach or do you think I

596
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:04,320
guess like isn't as important as do you

597
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,600
think it will be effective if the

598
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,520
government offers that or is it worth at

599
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:10,140
least experimenting with you know I

600
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:12,120
think again anything that the government

601
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:14,340
can provide if it's provided in the

602
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:18,539
spirit of of moving the industry forward

603
00:25:18,539 --> 00:25:20,700
um and keeping what we need to do

604
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:23,880
aspirational and keep and keep pushing

605
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:28,440
for something that is futuristic uh to

606
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:31,559
me is where we need to go most

607
00:25:31,559 --> 00:25:34,919
regulation if not all regulation is

608
00:25:34,919 --> 00:25:37,919
generally backward looking and by the

609
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:40,039
time it gets put in place it's too late

610
00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:44,539
and so what we've been advocating is

611
00:25:44,539 --> 00:25:47,600
really aspirational

612
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:50,700
incentives aspirational regulation if

613
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:53,940
you will that continues to push the

614
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:58,320
industry to go further faster

615
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:01,440
because you can't you can't regulate

616
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:04,140
what we're what we're up against

617
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:06,480
um and and not just in the energy sector

618
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,220
I would say that's across all sectors

619
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:11,820
that have critical uh critical uh

620
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:13,740
control systems

621
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:15,840
you know I really appreciate I'm sure

622
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,820
the audience says how you've kind of

623
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:19,980
stepped up to this Tom Fanning

624
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:21,900
it used to be any time we heard about a

625
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:24,120
large government or industry effort

626
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:27,000
you'd see Tom's name there yep and now

627
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,460
Tom is he's still involved but stepping

628
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:31,140
back a little bit and now you're kind of

629
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:32,700
stepping into some of the things he's

630
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:34,260
done

631
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:37,559
I'm wondering is this by design that we

632
00:26:37,559 --> 00:26:40,200
tend to see one person from the industry

633
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:43,500
or should we be seeing you know 10

634
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:46,620
people 10 people in your role maybe not

635
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:49,440
all CEOs but high level Executives in in

636
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,299
the industry being out there being the

637
00:26:51,299 --> 00:26:53,100
faces or do you think it's more

638
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:54,900
effective to have kind of an industry

639
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:57,120
go-to like we've had the last few years

640
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,720
I I think at this stage

641
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:03,539
that is more helpful to have a point of

642
00:27:03,539 --> 00:27:09,600
contact okay and I'm not by myself I do

643
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:10,460
have

644
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:14,100
comparable co-chairs uh

645
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:16,799
in the public power world in the co-op

646
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:20,059
World Dwayne highly from Tri-State and

647
00:27:20,059 --> 00:27:23,179
Kevin Wells from Lincoln Electric System

648
00:27:23,179 --> 00:27:26,220
sort of covers the those sides of the

649
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:27,480
industry and we work very

650
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:30,020
collaboratively together we talk a lot

651
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:33,720
around these issues but I think you

652
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:35,520
still need someone who's going to

653
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,840
continue to put the foot on the

654
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:39,720
accelerator and and and keep pushing to

655
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:42,960
get this done the the speed of

656
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,539
industry and the speed of government are

657
00:27:45,539 --> 00:27:48,000
not the same

658
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,080
but we need to get them closer okay and

659
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:54,659
I will the perfect example of this is

660
00:27:54,659 --> 00:27:57,539
the etac the the energy threat analysis

661
00:27:57,539 --> 00:28:00,120
Center that Doe is trying to set up

662
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:03,360
we have to get that moving and moving

663
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:04,940
faster together

664
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:08,520
because that's where for the uh the

665
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,620
electric industry we're going to be

666
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:12,179
standing shoulder to shoulder with the

667
00:28:12,179 --> 00:28:14,940
intelligence community and that

668
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:18,059
criticality of sharing we're on the

669
00:28:18,059 --> 00:28:20,220
front lines we're Gathering all the data

670
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:22,980
we don't know what to do with it

671
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:24,840
we can hand it off right to the

672
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:26,640
intelligence Community they know what to

673

676
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:37,799
much faster transfer of information so

677
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:41,880
