1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,240
foreign

2
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:09,369
[Applause]

3
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:13,920
thank you for attending the session

4
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,960
um so most of you are here uh today

5
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,580
you're probably having interest to be

6
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:19,020
able to deploy a private sailor in your

7
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:20,640
environment or we're probably in the

8
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,980
middle of a journey for deployment or

9
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:24,779
already deployed it and continue to

10
00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:28,080
scale in your environment so it's a high

11
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:29,279
level we're going to discuss the Purdue

12
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:30,720
model touch base is on it for a little

13
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,320
bit then we'll dig into our journey some

14
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,600
of the lessons learned and then some of

15
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,399
the education involves some of the

16
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:40,500
Curious that we discovered in private

17
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,300
cellular and then how we were able to

18
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:46,040
address that to wrap up the session

19
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:48,239
um so

20
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:50,219
the Purdue model as we all know has been

21
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:52,440
around since the 1990s it's a way to be

22
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,059
able to kind of have a framework to be

23
00:00:54,059 --> 00:00:56,280
able to segment our networks between our

24
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,500
business and our process and then just

25
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,120
having a DMZ in the middle to be able to

26
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:01,620
kind of have a stop Gap and then just

27
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:04,140
allow different Communications to

28
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:06,000
Traverse so most of we have a lot of

29
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,159
common applications that sit there we

30
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:09,540
have on the business network of course

31
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:11,180
our web servers

32
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:13,619
DNS servers and then the process what

33
00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:15,240
controls what we call the our crown

34
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:18,840
jewels we have our plcs qcs and DCS

35
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:19,939
systems

36
00:01:19,939 --> 00:01:22,920
and then as far as traffic is concerned

37
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:26,520
in the itot environments

38
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,200
communication goes through multiple

39
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,119
switches a different course to be able

40
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:32,939
to relay up to where it needs to go but

41
00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:34,259
when we deployed our private cellular

42
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:35,880
environment which is about a little over

43
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,460
a year and a half ago we realized that

44
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:40,140
everything kind of sat in the same

45
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:42,119
network right so there's lateral

46
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:44,100
Movement we don't have any visibility of

47
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:45,860
what's taking place in that environment

48
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:48,060
as well as

49
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:49,979
having just one Common Core where all

50
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:51,840
the traffic is uh

51
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,020
basically the traffic through and so we

52
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:56,939
saw that there was a gap there that the

53
00:01:56,939 --> 00:01:58,259
Purdue model was not able to be

54
00:01:58,259 --> 00:01:59,579
implemented in the private sailing

55
00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:01,939
environment

56
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:04,860
and one of the Lessons Learned we were

57
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:06,240
excited about deploying private seller

58
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,259
and it's something that we didn't think

59
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:09,119
about initially early on was being able

60
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:10,800
to think about security so we were

61
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,879
excited to get into the private sailor

62
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:13,379
environment up and running but after the

63
00:02:13,379 --> 00:02:14,760
fact it was more so not be able to have

64
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,560
visibility

65
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,420
in a purdue-like model of what was

66
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:21,200
taking place in the environment

67
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,000
so touching both races on the Purdue

68
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,739
model we're all very familiar this is a

69
00:02:25,739 --> 00:02:27,420
nice diagram to select some of the

70
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:28,640
segmentation

71
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:32,760
so we use actually uh for the DMZ to be

72
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,440
able to segment our

73
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,599
two different networks for processing

74
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:39,360
business we use the fournet firewall and

75
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,920
through the firewall we're able to just

76
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,840
create certain policies for you know to

77
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,340
allow the common Communications that are

78
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:45,780
needed to be able just to get the data

79
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:47,700
so everything's locked down and then to

80
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,379
reinforce that the firewall policies

81
00:02:49,379 --> 00:02:51,540
also have security profiles that are

82
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:53,040
provided through the before the

83
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,319
firewalls

84
00:02:55,319 --> 00:02:57,300
um and you can see how that having this

85
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:59,700
nice architecture and deployment it's

86
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,680
not the same in the private sailor

87
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,480
environment and why that could be

88
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,739
challenging so it's something that we

89
00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:06,360
wanted to make sure we're able to also

90
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:09,420
find a solution for

91
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:11,760
so starting off with our education

92
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,319
Journey

93
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:14,819
um why we wanted to pursue private

94
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:16,860
failure as technology continues to grow

95
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:18,319
same thing with our businesses

96
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:21,300
continuing to evolve we wanted to make

97
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,760
sure that we have a way to not just kind

98
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,819
of depend on one form of networking so

99
00:03:26,819 --> 00:03:28,620
Wi-Fi to be able to have connectivity

100
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:30,420
for our systems so we all have remote

101
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:32,640
locations or locations where it might be

102
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,400
hard to run infrastructure for Wi-Fi so

103
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,080
some of the new technologies you want to

104
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:39,780
pursue include a private cellular and as

105
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:42,480
well as maybe even lever satellites

106
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,640
but one thing we wanted to make sure

107
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,560
after the fact of deploying our private

108
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,900
seller from the business aspect and

109
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,340
Viewpoint was to be able to make sure

110
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:51,720
that we have a way to be able to secure

111
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:55,379
it that it performed well and we have

112
00:03:55,379 --> 00:03:57,180
visibility for what was taking place in

113
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:58,980
our environment as well

114
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:01,260
so our use case initially started off we

115
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:04,379
have warehouses uh basically managed uh

116
00:04:04,379 --> 00:04:07,140
with very little human reaction so we

117
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:09,420
have agvs automatic guided vehicles and

118
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:11,879
lgbts Laser guided Vehicles so you don't

119
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:13,560
have humans in those environments the

120
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,299
vehicles run on their own it's very rare

121
00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:17,279
that they go down if they do then you

122
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:18,500
can basically

123
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,880
drive it off to a certain location and

124
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,620
kind of maintain and fix the issue that

125
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:24,020
it's having

126
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:26,220
start off with that and we went through

127
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:28,080
a phase approach be able to for our

128
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,139
deployments and phase two was basically

129
00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:33,060
adding on more additional devices on the

130
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:34,740
private sailor Network which included

131
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:36,479
you know is you have your cell phones

132
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:40,259
tablets and laptops but one lessons we

133
00:04:40,259 --> 00:04:41,699
learned as well the environment today

134
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:43,979
for the ecosystem doesn't natively

135
00:04:43,979 --> 00:04:45,660
support private Sailors so you're having

136
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:48,300
to use routers or third-party devices to

137
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:51,259
be able to get that connectivity

138
00:04:51,259 --> 00:04:53,400
and with that now you have another

139
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,080
additional asset that you have to

140
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,479
support and outside of the assets

141
00:04:57,479 --> 00:04:59,400
themselves the private seller vendor

142
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,919
this pretty much are we have to highly

143
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:03,780
dependent on right we rely on them to

144
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:04,979
make sure their infrastructure is up and

145
00:05:04,979 --> 00:05:06,960
running if we have any issues we've got

146
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,400
to rely on them to be able to tell us

147
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,080
what they found from the logs and what

148
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,480
to be able to help resolve that issue

149
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,800
[Music]

150
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:18,000
so doing through those lessons we wanted

151
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,800
to make sure we found something a way to

152
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,960
be able to resolve that we've got to

153
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:24,960
build that knowledge within our group of

154
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,080
people our networks and our teams as

155
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,400
well as

156
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:32,280
being able to have uh knowledge shares

157
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,080
right so what we're doing today as many

158
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,860
of you are in this room

159
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:39,960
same thing that kind of touch spaces on

160
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:42,060
for the security concerns right not

161
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:43,500
having the visibility not able to

162
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,820
prevent the device from communicating

163
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:46,620
with each other not knowing the

164
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:48,539
performance for what's taking place with

165
00:05:48,539 --> 00:05:51,060
the devices so a lot of the stuff that

166
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:54,919
we heavily rely on today we don't have

167
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,380
so as we progress through these slides

168
00:05:58,380 --> 00:05:59,520
here you might see your name out here

169
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,560
but like many new technologies early on

170
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:04,860
it takes time to adopt right people have

171
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:07,460
to have forums knowledge shares

172
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:09,660
conferences to be able to kind of learn

173
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:13,020
more about that particular technology as

174
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:15,780
time goes on uh more and more people

175
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:18,240
we're leveraging private sailor in their

176
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,800
environments and it's not just

177
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,180
concentrated like where we come from

178
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:23,720
from Pulp and Paper the energy industry

179
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:26,520
you have oil and gas

180
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,919
and it continues to grow and in the last

181
00:06:28,919 --> 00:06:31,020
couple of years you can see a lot of key

182
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:33,419
names are on here leveraging private

183
00:06:33,419 --> 00:06:34,680
cellular

184
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,780
so digging through our research we're

185
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:38,100
able to figure out how they're living

186
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:39,419
your private sailor and some of the use

187
00:06:39,419 --> 00:06:41,759
cases to help kind of grow our knowledge

188
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:44,600
in-house as well

189
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,880
so starting off we look to see what the

190
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:50,220
U.S industry was doing so we kind of saw

191
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:52,680
product sale are being deployed in the

192
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:56,660
manufacturing area for uh for cars

193
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:58,620
and what they were doing is basically

194
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:01,080
using common applications and emphasis

195
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,780
on machine learning similar to what we

196
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:05,580
saw in our environment there were issues

197
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:07,560
with the same security right you have

198
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,759
this deployed but you don't have

199
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:10,560
visibility to your devices the

200
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,840
performance any anomalies that might be

201
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:15,560
taking place as well

202
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,120
and then being GP so we're under the

203
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,580
coke umbrella company of company so we

204
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:24,599
have a lot of fellow other sister

205
00:07:24,599 --> 00:07:26,699
companies around the world so we want to

206
00:07:26,699 --> 00:07:28,560
see from a global aspect what was taking

207
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,860
place in Europe as well they primarily

208
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:34,680
use this for remote operations with the

209
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:37,319
cranes they're similar to common theme

210
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:40,199
along with the US the visibility aspect

211
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:44,759
of their devices and performance was

212
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:47,340
common and the segmentation being a key

213
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:48,900
aspect of what was missing in the

214
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:51,318
solution

215
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:55,139
so a little dig more into the our

216
00:07:55,139 --> 00:07:56,940
journey as well as our proof of concept

217
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:59,660
uh so we initially were approached about

218
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:03,240
uh hey what can we do to kind of get a

219
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,400
a foothold in what might be the new

220
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,080
technology that is emerging currently

221
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,840
today with private cellular so the

222
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,460
business is besides just you know the

223
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:13,560
cold paper under Coke we're looking to

224
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,000
see where there's a way we can deploy a

225
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,099
new technology for connectivity of our

226
00:08:17,099 --> 00:08:19,680
devices and our infrastructure that was

227
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,340
cost effective didn't take as much time

228
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:25,199
and then also see if there was a way to

229
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,419
better perform than Wi-Fi

230
00:08:27,419 --> 00:08:28,199
yeah

231
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:30,360
so as I mentioned included Wi-Fi

232
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:33,419
satellite and even private sailor to me

233
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:34,919
initially Early Learning on about

234
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:36,599
private seller I thought it would be

235
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:38,339
like our telephone providers you know

236
00:08:38,339 --> 00:08:40,380
like you know the att's the Verizon's

237
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:42,899
and the T-Mobiles where basically

238
00:08:42,899 --> 00:08:44,219
there's a tower and it's just

239
00:08:44,219 --> 00:08:46,080
broadcasting the signals for your

240
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,660
connectivity with your sim card so I

241
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:49,920
assumed that there was this particular

242
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,720
vendor was going to you know drop a

243
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,880
tower in the particular area and kind of

244
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,440
just broadcast the coverage for what we

245
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,480
needed to within our facility but that

246
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,519
wasn't the case so today it still kind

247
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:01,140
of relies on our infrastructure so you

248
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,820
still have your IDF cabinets you still

249
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:05,220
have your switches it kind of relies on

250
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:06,720
our back hall of our infrastructure to

251
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,940
have connectivity but where we saw an

252
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:10,680
advantage was reducing the number of

253
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:13,200
access points so in Wi-Fi if you pretty

254
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,820
much do a survey then you place the

255
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,320
access points to be able to know what

256
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,519
coverage you needed in that particular

257
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:20,100
area handoffs are you know seamless and

258
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:22,100
you have connectivity with no downtime

259
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:25,440
what we saw was a great performance was

260
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,200
we went from having about 20 access

261
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,360
points in this particular Warehouse down

262
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:33,000
to two radios for a private sailor so we

263
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,339
stuck one on each wall and got it hooked

264
00:09:35,339 --> 00:09:37,620
up and we did a hybrid model where we

265
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:40,380
deployed we had on-prem server that ran

266
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:42,779
the VMS for the infrastructure and then

267
00:09:42,779 --> 00:09:45,660
the actual core was in the cloud

268
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:47,339
um so with that and then tying that in I

269
00:09:47,339 --> 00:09:49,019
have an interface on our firewall to

270
00:09:49,019 --> 00:09:51,420
allow the connectivity uh out to you

271
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:53,220
know beyond our Network to reach out the

272
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:56,279
vendor's private cellular environment

273
00:09:56,279 --> 00:09:59,640
um so GPU being a leading company a lot

274
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,080
of people look to us from our sister

275
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,300
companies to do proof of Concepts and

276
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:04,860
then kind of waiting on us to kind of do

277
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:06,180
Lessons Learned right what did you guys

278
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:08,880
learn what could we do to basically kind

279
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,680
of on the tail coat do the same thing in

280
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:13,200
our environments

281
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,660
um so in our particular lab we start off

282
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:19,200
with agv we had a fleet of three uh agvs

283
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,540
and we got them connected uh those agvs

284
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:23,100
don't natively have connectivity with

285
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:26,220
cellular so we had to leverage uh

286
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:28,500
routers and leverage the SIM cards that

287
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,300
are provided to us by the private seller

288
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:32,880
vendor first thing was can the vehicle

289
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,519
still run and then we did basically a

290
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:38,040
timeline of how the vehicles ran on

291
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:40,320
Wi-Fi compared to private Cellular

292
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,959
battery life mission times did it have

293
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:46,380
any performers with being able to run

294
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:48,000
its missions as well as delivering

295
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,180
product then phase two was all right we

296
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:53,220
can poke a hole into our firewall allow

297
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:56,040
connectivity from RIT OT Network so it

298
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,660
was in the DMZ we had a fleet manager to

299
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:58,860
be able to manage the fleet of vehicles

300
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:01,140
and see if it could Traverse into the

301
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:03,420
private seller Network so with some

302
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:05,459
modifications with routing we're able to

303
00:11:05,459 --> 00:11:07,740
prove that that was actually feasible as

304
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:11,279
well and we ran that for about about a

305
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:12,740
month just to see

306
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:15,240
there was any performance issues we

307
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,040
played around with taking down a radio

308
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,079
seeing how much coverage the vehicle had

309
00:11:19,079 --> 00:11:21,660
before it stopped to be able to run this

310
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:23,519
mission

311
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:26,519
and likewise just seeing if there was

312
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,800
any connectivity issues what what those

313
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,060
problems were so having to work with our

314
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:32,640
private sailor again we didn't have the

315
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,100
same tools that we do in our itot

316
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:37,200
environments to be able to just log in

317
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,880
ourselves or put a ticket in to just

318
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:42,180
view what's needed for the data we had

319
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:43,980
to rely heavily on the vendor

320
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:46,620
and as a third phase we decided to add

321
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:48,420
an additional router and then connect

322
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:52,200
vibration sensors to be able to see be

323
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,880
able to broadcast from the router the

324
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,800
cellular coverage to the vibration

325
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,600
sensors had those on the vehicles as

326
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,839
well had some temperature sensors just

327
00:12:00,839 --> 00:12:03,600
seeing how those were accommodating to

328
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,060
the private sailor environment

329
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:08,180
uh but the main thing that we got

330
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:10,680
feedback from our Business Leaders was

331
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,720
to make sure the performance wasn't an

332
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,820
issue and then finding a way to address

333
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:16,320
the security concerns that we came

334
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,839
across after the fact again having a

335
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:20,040
heavily rely on the vendor we wanted to

336
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:20,820
be able to take some of that stuff

337
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:22,200
in-house similar to what you're doing

338
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:25,940
our I2 and OT networks today

339
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:28,380
um so now we're going to kind of discuss

340
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:30,060
from the research so we did the proof of

341
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:33,120
concept and now we wanted to also tie in

342
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,980
what our other companies doing and what

343
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:36,420
were the risks for using private

344
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:38,719
cellular

345
00:12:39,779 --> 00:12:42,420
um so starting off so an environment

346
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:43,860
sort of following the Brew model we're

347
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:47,040
able to segment our our assets uh being

348
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,600
able to kind of view what's taking place

349
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,920
so these are kind of fundamental

350
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,380
building blocks uh for you know we have

351
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:53,940
the framework and then kind of tweaking

352
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:56,220
it to our own advantage and our risk

353
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:58,380
tolerance to how we deploy our assets

354
00:12:58,380 --> 00:12:59,240
today

355
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:01,680
we're able to have security teams in

356
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,019
place from the Enterprise level to kind

357
00:13:04,019 --> 00:13:06,000
of monitor if there's any attacks that

358
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,440
are trying to take place on our networks

359
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,180
anything's talking out that shouldn't be

360
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:10,620
talking out and then you know reaching

361
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:12,180
out to our customers and addressing

362
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:15,480
those issues in-house we're able to see

363
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,220
our assets where they are where they're

364
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:18,779
located because you know one thing you

365
00:13:18,779 --> 00:13:20,279
want to do you know being a large

366
00:13:20,279 --> 00:13:21,620
organization

367
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:24,060
you have access deployed out there but

368
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:25,980
then if you don't know where they are or

369
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:27,420
where they're located you can't protect

370
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:28,860
them

371
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:31,380
uh when it came to the private cellular

372
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:33,120
environment that was building blocks

373
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,399
were missing just to kind of give you a

374
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:37,740
visual of what was what was the Gap that

375
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:39,060
we had and we wanted to make sure we

376
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:41,220
addressed before we did any more uh

377
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:44,540
proof Concepts or scaling

378
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,040
um so including the risks that are

379
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,500
already available in the itoch networks

380
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,360
private sailor also included some more

381
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:55,079
additional risks and so some of those

382
00:13:55,079 --> 00:13:58,220
common ones include signal storms

383
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:01,860
particular IP attacks on the private

384
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:03,660
sailor

385
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:06,420
devices DNS hijacking so some of those

386
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:07,980
are common in our iTunes environments

387
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:09,600
but they're also expanded on in our

388
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,360
private seller so that ecosystem that

389
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,740
you have everything's talking to each

390
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:16,980
other and you can't prevent it right we

391
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:18,480
didn't have any way to know the

392
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,519
performance of those assets

393
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:22,800
so we were in the market now to find a

394
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,699
way to address those

395
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,579
some of the common ones that we saw

396
00:14:29,579 --> 00:14:32,880
across the board for

397
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:36,380
customers and the other Enterprise level

398
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:39,180
companies for having issues with private

399
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:42,060
cellular included these mqtt hijacking

400
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:44,699
IP attacks signal storms DNS hijacking

401
00:14:44,699 --> 00:14:48,240
APN attacks the most common one that I'm

402
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,519
you know I'm used to is DNS hijacking

403
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:52,380
just the fact that

404
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:54,959
yeah this you have this uh let's say a

405
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:55,740
cell phone that we had in our

406
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:57,240
environment uh if it has internet

407
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,040
connectivity it can go to any website

408
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,079
right and so let's say it was

409
00:15:01,079 --> 00:15:03,540
compromised and now this cell phone went

410
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:05,040
to it now our other assets are

411
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,959
compromised as well and we had no way to

412
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:08,399
see that

413
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:10,440
um same thing with the DNS server uh

414
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:12,300
being compromised and we've heard

415
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:14,399
stories uh over the years for different

416
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:16,920
large companies that we use or leverage

417
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:20,959
their services for I'm experiencing this

418
00:15:21,959 --> 00:15:24,060
all right and then now dig it into

419
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:26,940
basically our venture out to find a

420
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:28,440
vendor or a solution to be able to

421
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:31,699
address those security gaps

422
00:15:32,699 --> 00:15:34,320
uh the common things that we were

423
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,260
looking for uh being with our warehouses

424
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:39,360
having a fleet of vehicles was Geo

425
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,800
tracking so being able to kind of know

426
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,560
and locate where our vehicles uh what

427
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:44,579
they were doing within the warehouse

428
00:15:44,579 --> 00:15:46,680
remotely uh we wanted to be able to

429
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:49,920
segment additional devices we have if we

430
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,540
have any humans that are on site their

431
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:53,579
laptops have connectivity to sailor as

432
00:15:53,579 --> 00:15:56,639
well and their cell phones I'm going to

433
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:57,959
build a kind of segment those and they

434
00:15:57,959 --> 00:15:59,519
also have visibility on what's connected

435
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:00,720
it's something else that we didn't

436
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,360
expect to be on there uh but the unique

437
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,660
thing about private sailor is depending

438
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:08,279
on the vendor that you go with the SIM

439
00:16:08,279 --> 00:16:10,380
cards are provisioned ahead of time so

440
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:12,300
when they deliver to you only you have

441
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:13,740
access to that particular private

442
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:15,000
Network

443
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,680
anyone else that walked by and try to

444
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,600
have connectivity wouldn't be able to so

445
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,920
that was one way to be able to have

446
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,899
Security in your private cellular

447
00:16:21,899 --> 00:16:23,519
environment and so it's a lot different

448
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:25,320
from what we have with our Telecom

449
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,860
providers

450
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,720
so the company that we came across uh

451
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,399
you know from knowledge sharing our

452
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:34,500
proof of concept uh some of their sister

453
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:35,940
companies are doing research I came

454
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:39,120
across one layer and

455
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,980
we were able to have a conversation to

456
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:42,360
be able to see what their solution

457
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:45,839
provided so after having some internal

458
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:48,120
discussions as well as uh just

459
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,860
discussing with one layer we're able to

460
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:51,480
decide to do a proof of concept to be

461
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,220
able to deploy their Solution on top of

462
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,660
what we have in our private seller

463
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:56,459
environment today

464
00:16:56,459 --> 00:16:58,500
um and so that was the the key pitch

465
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,000
there was be able to have the same

466
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,800
Purdue model visibility in our private

467
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,300
selling environment

468
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:05,819
so we were able to decide on a proof of

469
00:17:05,819 --> 00:17:07,679
concept and then kind of get an

470
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:09,660
environment set up so it just included

471
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:11,640
two additional servers and they were

472
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:14,160
able to remotely configure those and we

473
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,540
also integrated with our Fortinet

474
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:17,220
firewall so the interface that we had

475
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:18,839
our private cellular network connected

476
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:21,419
to they're able to just listen listen to

477
00:17:21,419 --> 00:17:23,579
those that particular interface and

478
00:17:23,579 --> 00:17:24,959
Basics kind of monitor some of the

479
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:27,059
traffic for early detection of what was

480
00:17:27,059 --> 00:17:28,439
taking place in our environment before

481
00:17:28,439 --> 00:17:30,660
even coming on site so that was that was

482
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:31,860
key to be able to kind of see a benefit

483
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:33,960
in that so they're like hey you have

484
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:36,480
three devices connected today and that

485
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,919
was the case we happened to have a town

486
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:39,419
hall that day we're doing show and tell

487
00:17:39,419 --> 00:17:41,520
and we had three vehicles running so

488
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,980
they're able to detect it ahead of time

489
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:45,240
and they're able to track also the

490
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,740
vehicles where they were located in our

491
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:48,840
warehouses so it was about three

492
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,460
segments uh sections of the warehouse

493
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:51,960
that we have in our particular facility

494
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,460
that we did the proof of concept and

495
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:54,720
they're able to see each vehicle

496
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,880
remotely where it was located

497
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,580
so now we had that segmentation uh the

498
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:01,919
visibility and the geofencing that we

499
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:05,480
were looking for for location tracking

500
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,820
um then we the next phase was uh being

501
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:11,100
able to kind of set a date where they

502
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:12,900
can come on site uh so they brought

503
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:15,539
their team uh we were able to add

504
00:18:15,539 --> 00:18:16,919
additional devices on the network just

505
00:18:16,919 --> 00:18:19,260
to kind of prove out the solution

506
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:20,880
um so initially the first part was the

507
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:24,000
discovery phase so we had tablets we had

508
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,940
cell phones we had PCS we had routers

509
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:30,120
and the vehicles so that was a range of

510
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:31,860
Fleet of devices and various forms of

511
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:34,679
cell phones and iPhones Samsung we had

512
00:18:34,679 --> 00:18:35,880
different routers to be able to know

513
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:38,220
different manufacturers so the first

514
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:40,080
thing that we discovered in that

515
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:43,500
Discovery phase was their database they

516
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:46,020
have about 300 000 plus devices that was

517
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:48,419
classified so the ones that we had were

518
00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:49,980
automatically detected so they were able

519
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:52,020
to pull that in through a dashboard once

520
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:53,400
they showed us a dashboard we're able to

521
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,980
see those devices there and so that was

522
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:57,240
a pretty cool part because we didn't

523
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:59,400
have it visibility before all we knew is

524
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,080
we put these SIM cards in these devices

525
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,340
and

526
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:04,260
by labeling it that's the only way we

527
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:06,660
had to track and to be able to know what

528
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:08,580
was tied to what

529
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:10,440
um the net and following after that the

530
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,760
classification so there's a different

531
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,320
screen where it allowed you to be able

532
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:16,500
to see uh by the manufacturer what it

533
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,600
was a router it could be a Beck it could

534
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,160
be blink

535
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,799
um and then anything tied behind those

536
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:24,660
you can drill in deeper to be able to

537
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:26,160
see those devices as well so all those

538
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,600
sensors that we had tied behind the

539
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,360
routers was also detectable we could

540
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:32,039
create policies so the policies we

541
00:19:32,039 --> 00:19:33,780
played with was the fleet manager and

542
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:36,539
our it to OT Network to talk into the

543
00:19:36,539 --> 00:19:39,720
the vehicles themselves we wanted no

544
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,000
communication from the sound the cell

545
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,980
phones that had internet access to the

546
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:45,720
vehicles so if there was anything like

547
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,160
that uh

548
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:49,620
that was seen it was alerting and then

549
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:51,600
being able to reinforce enforce policies

550
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,820
to block that to be able to stop that

551
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:55,620
traffic so we did a lot of playing

552
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:57,900
around during that week of you know them

553
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:59,580
being on site and then kind of seeing

554
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:00,720
hey everything that we were looking for

555
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,340
that we had the Gap in it was now

556
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:05,840
basically being resolved

557
00:20:06,299 --> 00:20:09,120
so this is a picture of uh basically in

558
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,280
real time what we saw when we deployed

559
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,140
our private seller environment um the

560
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:15,419
top section so we had these devices they

561
00:20:15,419 --> 00:20:17,700
had the SIM cards right but it was a

562
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:20,400
blind spot so we don't if you swept if

563
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,480
you went in and swapped the SIM card

564
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,460
from a vehicle that was connected to a

565
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:25,380
router if you swap those SIM cards

566
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:27,419
you'll know that that particular SIM

567
00:20:27,419 --> 00:20:30,000
card IP address is tied to that asset

568
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,679
but we wouldn't know that the same

569
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:34,380
policy was being enforced and then so

570
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:36,179
leveraging their technology we're able

571
00:20:36,179 --> 00:20:38,400
to know from a dashboard once you unplug

572
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,660
a SIM card and plug into a different

573
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:41,580
device it'll say hey this came from a

574
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:43,380
cell phone this particular cell phone

575
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:45,360
had internet access but now it's on this

576
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,640
router but with their policy and their

577
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,440
technology it's not just tied to the SIM

578
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,880
card it's tied to the actual device

579
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,799
profile so it makes it unique where

580
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:54,660
beforehand it's just we know that this

581
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:56,280
particular IP address is coming into the

582
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:58,020
firewall and we wouldn't be able to

583
00:20:58,020 --> 00:20:59,460
enforce if it was swapped by someone

584
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:01,860
physically on site so that was an

585
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:03,600
additional layer of security there

586
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,640
we had a segmentation with the policies

587
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,559
we had the learning so everything that

588
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:10,260
we were looking to solve for was

589
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:12,600
basically addressed so it was some good

590
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:15,179
Lessons Learned and now we're looking at

591
00:21:15,179 --> 00:21:17,580
the scale to a different facility uh to

592
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:20,820
enforce that same technology so a bigger

593
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:24,000
Warehouse it's about 30 30 or so radios

594
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,760
now and then having a mass Fleet of

595
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:29,460
vehicle so versus the three or four that

596
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:31,500
we had on site now there's a fleet of 30

597
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:32,340
plus

598
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:34,080
so we're going to have additional

599
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,659
devices on there include sensors we're

600
00:21:36,659 --> 00:21:38,520
going to have cameras and then we're

601
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:40,140
going to see how this next phase plays

602
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:42,059
out as well

603
00:21:42,059 --> 00:21:45,600
outside the visibility we're able to now

604
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,419
also have performance monitoring of

605
00:21:48,419 --> 00:21:49,880
those assets

606
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:52,500
and then prevent that cross-lateral

607
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,600
movement that will the key thing that we

608
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,220
were looking to solve for

609
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:58,440
so earlier I mentioned the attack common

610
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,299
attacks that we came across from our

611
00:22:00,299 --> 00:22:01,500
research in the private selling

612
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,960
environment and with being able to

613
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,880
leverage technology all these items were

614
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:08,299
addressed

615
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:15,240
so to wrap up the building blocks that

616
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:17,840
was detected early on being able to

617
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,799
apply that in the private selling

618
00:22:19,799 --> 00:22:22,080
environment now you can see was covered

619
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:25,140
from deploying the solution so that

620
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:26,400
security Gap that we're looking to cover

621
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,679
the visibility the cross segmentation

622
00:22:28,679 --> 00:22:30,720
the lateral movement all that was

623
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:34,740
addressed and then being a large

624
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:36,539
corporation under the coke umbrella too

625
00:22:36,539 --> 00:22:37,799
and our sister company is looking to

626
00:22:37,799 --> 00:22:39,900
deploy private cellular the particular

627
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,760
cellular private seller vendor we use

628
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,740
necessarily doesn't have to be used by

629
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:45,659
them as well so one layer is able to

630
00:22:45,659 --> 00:22:47,039
integrate with many different private

631
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:48,360
cores so

632
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:49,919
we were happy about that from a Coke

633
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:51,780
level you know being out knowing that we

634
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:53,159
don't have to be tied down to one

635
00:22:53,159 --> 00:22:55,260
particular uh private cellular provider

636
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:58,740
so that's key because we have our we

637
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:00,240
across the industry We Touch many

638
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,500
different things so outside of open

639
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:04,559
paper oil and gas Etc et cetera so that

640
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:06,659
was a a big win there

641
00:23:06,659 --> 00:23:08,640
so

642
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:11,100
I think that about ties it up so

643
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:12,659
definitely thank you for your time I

644
00:23:12,659 --> 00:23:14,740
know I finished a little early but

645
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:17,000
[Applause]

646
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,059
thank you
