1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,240
foreign

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:07,799
this is a hot new game show my favorite

3
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:09,360
metric we're going to have five

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,880
contestants come on and tell you they

5
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:14,400
get three minutes to tell you what their

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,039
favorite metric is and why one slide

7
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:18,840
three minutes the winner gets a ticket

8
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:21,840
to next year's S4 and to help me judge

9
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,779
this I have two celebrity judges Maggie

10
00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:27,420
morgante and Derek harp please welcome

11
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:29,779
them

12
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,700
thank you both for agreeing to judge

13
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:41,100
did you coordinate this yeah the answer

14
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:44,300
is will be TLP red and TLP yellow

15
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:46,739
and we left green back in the in the

16
00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:47,879
Green Room yeah the Green's in the green

17
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:50,579
room he couldn't hack it okay and now I

18
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:51,780
just want to tell you the judging

19
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:54,180
criteria is completely your own

20
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:57,180
it can be fashion sense it can be Poise

21
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:59,699
it can be any anything you want it can

22
00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:01,860
be mathematics statistics relevance

23
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:03,539
whatever you want okay

24
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:04,979
then they're going to judge on a scale

25
00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:07,020
of one to ten but let's bring out our

26
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:10,580
first contestant Debbie Gordon

27
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:15,840
okay let's let's put Debbie's slide on

28
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,720
the on the monitor here and up top let's

29
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,700
put it up top so they can see it okay

30
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:23,520
slide three minutes you're up good luck

31
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,280
I thought this was karaoke hi everyone

32
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,799
so I would like everyone to think about

33
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:31,020
all of the major breaches that you've

34
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:32,820
seen and heard about in the world

35
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:35,640
every single one of them the companies

36
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,560
that they occurred in had Millions if

37
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,180
not 10 millions of dollars worth of

38
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:40,799
technology that were supposed to make

39
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:43,979
that not happen but the people who were

40
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:45,720
supposed to detect and respond to those

41
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,220
attacks simply didn't know what they

42
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:49,259
were looking at or looking for

43
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:51,720
most risk metrics if you think about

44
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:54,479
people processing technology are focused

45
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:56,759
only on process and technology and

46
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:59,460
compliance but people are never measured

47
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:01,560
in terms of

48
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,360
cyber risk

49
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,560
so

50
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,639
we look at the talent Gap risk metrics

51
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,258
and how many of you are familiar with

52
00:02:10,258 --> 00:02:12,180
the fact that there is a talent shortage

53
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:14,340
in cyber security

54
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:18,420
yes even more so in OT and so we have to

55
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:20,340
be able to measure risk as it pertains

56
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,020
to those people that are sitting in

57
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:24,540
those seats what they know what they're

58
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:28,500
capable of so we've taken the nist nice

59
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,360
framework for cyber security education

60
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,520
as well as the miter attack Frameworks

61
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,860
as well as other Frameworks and we're

62
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:38,340
able to measure the different knowledge

63
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:41,599
skills abilities that people have

64
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:44,819
against what they should have based on a

65
00:02:44,819 --> 00:02:47,340
defined work role and look at the Delta

66
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:49,800
between those we also look at the

67
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,540
different elements of the different

68
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:53,160
Frameworks such as a miter attack

69
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,480
Frameworks

70
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,420
uh and we can also look at how many

71
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:59,940
different types of ttps people are

72
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:02,700
prepared to respond to and what they've

73
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:04,980
practiced on so without giving a whole

74
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:08,160
bunch of algorithm algorithms and ipoa

75
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,860
we can look at a risk score and measure

76
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:14,940
risk specifically by person by team and

77
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:18,900
by Department in terms of what skills

78
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:21,840
and competencies people have versus what

79
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,140
they need to be successful and risk

80
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:27,000
scores obviously have to be actionable

81
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,580
and so when you get that risk score then

82
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:31,260
you can see what type of training and

83
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:33,420
education those people need to true it

84
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:36,420
up and minimize the risk of a breach

85
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:40,159
thank you very much all right

86
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:43,019
that was great keep the mic do we might

87
00:03:43,019 --> 00:03:45,360
talk to you so I'm going to start this

88
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,760
time Maggie why don't you uh we give her

89
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,379
a score on one to ten but you're welcome

90
00:03:49,379 --> 00:03:51,659
to opine on what you thought as well my

91
00:03:51,659 --> 00:03:53,819
scoring pedal under the chair or am I

92
00:03:53,819 --> 00:03:54,959
doing this with my hand you have to do

93
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:56,760
it like with your body interpretive

94
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:59,099
dance you know like no I I would give

95
00:03:59,099 --> 00:04:02,280
this a solid seven I think that you know

96
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,379
our our talent Gap is a very real

97
00:04:04,379 --> 00:04:05,819
problem

98
00:04:05,819 --> 00:04:07,200
um and I think that you know the the

99
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,640
points you bring up about making sure

100
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,739
that we have you know solid skills and

101
00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:13,920
competencies for the roles is is very

102
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,480
important I would have liked to see more

103
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,160
buzzwords

104
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,199
um the the 3D rating I I didn't hear

105
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:23,400
anything about uh you know Sans and

106
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,259
being able to help us solve the talent

107
00:04:25,259 --> 00:04:27,960
shortage completely so you know Sans and

108
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,840
buzzwords I I think were the only

109
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,880
the Down ratings for me and we didn't

110
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,280
hear S4 either so that yes yeah yeah

111
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,800
well and there was no no on-ramp

112
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,940
mentioned there

113
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:41,340
okay so seven

114
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:43,919
and your score so I I wanted to give her

115
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:46,919
I came out to 7.6832 and you said I

116
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:49,080
couldn't uh so I'm gonna round up to

117
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,360
eight uh the people problem is big and

118
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,560
you know that's sort of near and dear to

119
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,199
my heart so you had an advantage as soon

120
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:56,160
as you started talking about the people

121
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,440
problem it's so I like it the talent cap

122
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,940
risk metric I think we should be looking

123
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:02,940
at that it's pretty solid okay and since

124
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:04,320
the

125
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,479
woman with the green shirt didn't make

126
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:09,840
it today I'm the third judge and

127
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,540
I get to you always need one nasty judge

128
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:14,340
in the group right and I'm so well

129
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:16,860
qualified to do that so I'm gonna give

130
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:19,560
you do it I'm gonna give you a six

131
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:22,800
I I really like this

132
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,100
but to me it's a measure again of the

133
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:28,919
implementation of something it's not the

134
00:05:28,919 --> 00:05:31,380
measure of how good it is so you have

135
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:33,360
created this each role should create

136
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,639
have these things and then this will

137
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:37,560
test I think very well

138
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:40,380
are do do our people actually know what

139
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:42,720
we think they should know but that's

140
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,039
what they think they should it's what

141
00:05:44,039 --> 00:05:45,419
the organization thinks their people

142
00:05:45,419 --> 00:05:47,160
should yeah what the organization thinks

143
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,360
they should know but it's not actually

144
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,100
measuring so it's measuring more the

145
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,139
implementation of training but I think

146
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:54,360
it's a solid metric I do like it so we

147
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,400
have a six a seven and an eight so if my

148
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,979
math is right you scored a seven and you

149
00:05:58,979 --> 00:06:01,320
are in first place so thank you very

150
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,340
much

151
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:03,500
thank you

152
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,820
[Applause]

153
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:08,100
no just go off

154
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:12,300
okay our next contestant is Jesus Molina

155
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:14,340
so we'll put three minutes on the clock

156
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:16,560
and let's wait till your slides up all

157
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,000
right that's your slide right perfect

158
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,060
yes okay go for it all right first thank

159
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:22,919
you obscura for yesterday give me a

160
00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:25,080
super hungover today

161
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,840
um my risk uh my metric is about uh

162
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,600
inbound information all right so the

163
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:34,440
risk of inbound information

164
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:38,220
um this is a very interesting uh metric

165
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:42,060
because like everything in OT cyber

166
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:45,060
security is about the risk of protecting

167
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:47,819
from data not the risk of protecting the

168
00:06:47,819 --> 00:06:50,880
data but the risk of editing from data

169
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:55,440
imagine these two extreme examples one

170
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,720
it's a relief valve right it's not

171
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:00,000
connected to anything nothing receives

172
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,860
no information from anywhere is what we

173
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:04,800
call an a unhackable safe word cannot be

174
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,160
hacked it's perfect cyber security

175
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,840
imagine the other

176
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:10,800
um

177
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,020
part like the same relief valve

178
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:14,880
connected to the open internet anything

179
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,580
can be sent information this buff will

180
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:18,900
be hacked this is the worst case

181
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:21,840
scenario so now how we can measure this

182
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,180
and there is like four things that are

183
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:27,000
critical to understand how we can get

184
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,699
this information it's the quantity and

185
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:31,380
quality of information

186
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:34,259
the controls that we can use to discard

187
00:07:34,259 --> 00:07:37,080
the data that comes into your system and

188
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:40,440
that has worthiness of the source it is

189
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:43,620
from the OT guy is from the I.T guys

190
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:45,780
I have like a simple example there and

191
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:48,120
again this metric is used by idss all

192
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,560
the time this is not a new metric I'm

193
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:52,440
here to demystify it right so in this

194
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,120
quick example I put there imagine three

195
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,639
trains the first train can only receive

196
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:59,160
information from OT guys it's not

197
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,919
connected to it nothing the second train

198
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:04,380
because of SLA requires to have a SIM

199
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:06,419
card to connect to the vendor the train

200
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:09,060
manufacturer the third train can receive

201
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:10,740
any information they want from it to

202
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,840
send video to the train to send you know

203
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,300
like anything as you can see you know I

204
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:17,639
put some numbers there and the numbers

205
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:19,379
are consisted consistent with our

206
00:08:19,379 --> 00:08:21,319
intuition the first train will be

207
00:08:21,319 --> 00:08:24,180
absolutely that's really quite secure

208
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:26,280
the second not so much and the third

209
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,440
it will be a mess right so this is

210
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,240
consistent with our intuition but

211
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,520
actually you can make these functions as

212
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,380
complex as you want you can use entropy

213
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:36,299
to understand the complexity of the data

214
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:38,940
and actually most ABS vendors if you see

215
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:42,120
all these risk things that they use like

216
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,520
the complexity of OT protocols Etc

217
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:47,040
now this equation has something that is

218
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,080
a little bit more profound imagine we

219
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,660
can rebuild the internet from scratch we

220
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:54,420
will get rid of TCP all these machines

221
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:56,339
don't care about acts machines we don't

222
00:08:56,339 --> 00:08:57,839
care about anything they care about

223
00:08:57,839 --> 00:08:59,580
information that goes outside the

224
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:02,040
machine which is ID

225
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,320
and information coming to the machine

226
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,500
which is OT operations we care about

227
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,899
and if we can divide the the internet in

228
00:09:09,899 --> 00:09:12,300
this we'll create this like only two

229
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:14,399
flows of information one product by it

230
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:16,800
information and the second one we

231
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,320
protected by us by operations protecting

232
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,899
from the data wow right on the mark

233
00:09:21,899 --> 00:09:23,640
three minutes exactly oh please keep

234
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:26,399
that keep that okay so Derek let's start

235
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,019
with you this time

236
00:09:28,019 --> 00:09:30,720
one to ten what do you think this is

237
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,880
tough I went back to college calculus

238
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:36,240
and I was having questions there but uh

239
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,740
I do like the Greek you know having a

240
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:39,300
sort of a Greek number or symbol in

241
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:40,800
there that was pretty good

242
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,880
um

243
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:45,660
yeah that's uh that's involved so um

244
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:47,040
I'm still sort of figuring out the

245
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,660
formula myself and the waiting and

246
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:50,820
figure time you know I'm just going to

247
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:53,779
go with um

248
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:55,800
you know for me I'm gonna go with a six

249
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,720
I'm still trying to process on it I'm

250
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,040
still trying to figure it figure out all

251
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,019
the pieces yeah

252
00:10:01,019 --> 00:10:03,000
it would be it would be a little hard to

253
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,040
explain to an executive well that's I

254
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,779
think there's a lot and I need more time

255
00:10:06,779 --> 00:10:08,339
with it and you didn't there's no beer

256
00:10:08,339 --> 00:10:10,620
ISAC quotient in there um which I think

257
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:12,060
would have you know would have been

258
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:13,860
worth one more Point okay so six yeah

259
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:16,320
Maggie I I'm gonna agree with you on a

260
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,140
base score of six but I think for any if

261
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:21,480
we have any of the illustrious DOD

262
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,600
members from that panel in the audience

263
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,459
uh I think for DOD this would be

264
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:30,060
upgraded to an eight I am impressed by

265
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:32,399
the ability to fit DOD level Death by

266
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:35,959
PowerPoint onto one slide here

267
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:52,320
I would

268
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,420
you know that I think my favorite thing

269
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:57,360
about this is your adjective you called

270
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,420
your statistic profound and very rarely

271
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:02,640
do I find a profound statistic so I like

272
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,980
that but I'm I'm actually going to be a

273
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:06,180
little nicer this time I'm going to give

274
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:07,560
it a seven

275
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,839
but I think that's still that maybe is

276
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:11,760
like six and a third so I think Debbie

277
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,380
is still in the lead but thank you very

278
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:15,300
much for playing and take go ahead take

279
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,959
that off with you

280
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:22,320
okay our next contestant is Ron fabella

281
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,839
Ron come on stage please give a hand for

282
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:25,510
Ron

283
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:28,140
[Music]

284
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:30,480
can we put Ron slide up

285
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,220
and we got three minutes that's you

286
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:35,640
you're on awesome good morning quality

287
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,260
PowerPoint I'm looking this is obviously

288
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:39,420
super serious but uh last year I

289
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:41,760
challenged everyone and myself to look

290
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,680
for the great people in the community to

291
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,079
amplify and to to Really Elevate those

292
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:47,760
but I did a bad thing I didn't give you

293
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,440
any way to quantify that so this year

294
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,019
here's how we quantify our own actions

295
00:11:52,019 --> 00:11:54,240
our organization's actions or even the

296
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,459
community actions in a one through ten

297
00:11:56,459 --> 00:11:58,320
goat system so we're familiar with the

298
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,300
common vulnerability scoring system this

299
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:03,000
is the common goat scoring system so I

300
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,680
like to take the most generous

301
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,000
assumptions about actions which is

302
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,700
sometimes difficult when you hear about

303
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:10,200
buzzwords and beer eye sack and making

304
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,839
fun of DOD slides so really we should

305
00:12:12,839 --> 00:12:15,420
all start in the four to six go area so

306
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:16,980
if you hear about buzzwords like zero

307
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:19,380
trust or someone has a death database or

308
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:20,820
I discovered malware that could destroy

309
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:22,920
the world you know what let's let's just

310
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,720
tone it down let's just make the most a

311
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,040
generous assumption that they're trying

312
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:28,140
to help the community and let's evaluate

313
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:29,519
that let's look for the Excellence and

314
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:31,140
maybe look for opportunities to like

315
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:33,180
really Elevate and support those groups

316
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:35,220
now on the other hand though we can't

317
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:37,500
just all be happy Bob Ross happy little

318
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:40,140
accidents right there are some instances

319
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:42,240
where we could do better so let me give

320
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,279
a few examples right so if you do have a

321
00:12:44,279 --> 00:12:46,200
database of events that are tied to

322
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:49,139
cyber attacks that have a loss of human

323
00:12:49,139 --> 00:12:49,920
life

324
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,320
and you have that you use that and maybe

325
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,060
you're not giving it away for free or

326
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:55,560
not really like really putting out but

327
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,779
you know what that's that's okay now

328
00:12:57,779 --> 00:12:59,279
maybe you know you found some malware

329
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:00,839
you can't give out the samples but you

330
00:13:00,839 --> 00:13:02,399
know give out the information do the

331
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:04,800
best you can the example's gone on but

332
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,360
you know what a four to six goat rating

333
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,100
that's all right now there are some

334
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:09,480
instances where

335
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:12,240
maybe the dirty marketing gets in or you

336
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,100
know uh you know I have this database so

337
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,000
I'm not going to give it to anyone

338
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,920
because it's mine and in fact if you ask

339
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,540
for it you're wrong and there's all

340
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:21,240
these things that we can recognize the

341
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,940
Tendencies of no bad goats there are no

342
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:25,740
bad goats by the way in the world but

343
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:27,480
maybe they're just misled maybe they

344
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,700
don't have a good shepherd to herd them

345
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:31,740
through this process

346
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:33,480
um so to recognize that maybe reach out

347
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:36,240
to that person and be like hey what if

348
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,040
you took this approach how can I help

349
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:40,380
you this isn't an evaluation of either

350
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:42,720
yourself or others to to demean but to

351
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,639
actually go out and reach and assist

352
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:47,700
those goats in being great goats or

353
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:50,220
outstanding goats so recognize reach out

354
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:52,680
maybe if this is yourself rethink your

355
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,779
approach have a different Focus either

356
00:13:54,779 --> 00:13:56,700
not on yourself or your organization or

357
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:58,920
even your circle you know broaden out

358
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,839
outside of industrial reach out and

359
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:02,579
Elevate I talked about the four to six

360
00:14:02,579 --> 00:14:04,560
goats you want to start there everyone

361
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,540
wants to be good goats but really you

362
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:08,399
want to be outstanding goats and here is

363
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:10,380
a picture of my go votes they're

364
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:11,760
outstanding in their field and I hope

365
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,320
for this year that you are also

366
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,660
outstanding in your field uh like my

367
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:19,200
goats puzzle pieces in Salem but really

368
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,540
the goal here is we all want to do

369
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:23,700
better not just for ourselves not just

370
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:25,740
for our community but for everyone

371
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:28,260
everyone outside of this room now that

372
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:30,480
we're a thousand plus reach out to the

373
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,060
community be great goats and thank you

374
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:35,899
all right

375
00:14:38,579 --> 00:14:40,680
I didn't see this one this is a last

376
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,540
minute change because before I think

377
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:44,579
before I thought it was like the number

378
00:14:44,579 --> 00:14:46,740
of incidents in this private database

379
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:49,139
that no one had ever seen before but

380
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:51,420
that you change but this is very good

381
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:53,519
this is very nice and go engineering so

382
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:54,540
you really shouldn't talk about that

383
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:56,430
okay okay so

384
00:14:56,430 --> 00:14:59,519
[Laughter]

385
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:01,019
the room's like what are they talking

386
00:15:01,019 --> 00:15:03,800
about again Maggie let's start with you

387
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:06,480
uh you know for me as a fellow

388
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,300
Tennessean we had we had goats we had

389
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:11,579
community building we had puns for me

390
00:15:11,579 --> 00:15:16,860
it's a 10. wow thank you holy cow we we

391
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:18,839
did not collude we have not discussed

392
00:15:18,839 --> 00:15:21,300
any of these in advance and um you know

393
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:24,060
I grew up in the midwest in farm country

394
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:26,639
um I uh the joke of outstanding in their

395
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:28,320
field we applied that to cows but there

396
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,000
wasn't a drive we ever took without

397
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,820
using that joke this is also a 10 for me

398
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:35,519
I think you're going to Las Vegas thank

399
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:37,860
you oh yeah thank you

400
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:39,959
oh well

401
00:15:39,959 --> 00:15:43,500
the shoes were a big part of you know he

402
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,180
came out the shoes I thought I thought

403
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:47,760
it was going to be a 10. but on my

404
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:48,560
Island

405
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:51,600
there's a lot of goats my Island it's my

406
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,519
Island where I live on the island I live

407
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,800
yeah I don't own all of Maui yet

408
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:59,160
um but but my neighbors have goats yeah

409
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:01,019
and they're always getting in my yard so

410
00:16:01,019 --> 00:16:02,820
I am not liking those goats so I'm going

411
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:05,600
to give you a four

412
00:16:06,199 --> 00:16:11,399
wow so 24 divided by three I think

413
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:13,620
that's eight can we take it you're in

414
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:16,180
the lead congratulations thank you

415
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:19,440
[Applause]

416
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,540
okay our next contestant is Craig

417
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:23,639
Duckworth come on out Craig

418
00:16:23,639 --> 00:16:26,839
little Applause for Craig

419
00:16:28,199 --> 00:16:30,420
thank you that's your slide right okay

420
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:32,940
take it away start the clock

421
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:34,620
hi thank you

422
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:35,880
um I want to talk to you a little bit

423
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:38,639
about a connected device vulnerability

424
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:42,540
index study and why that is my favorite

425
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:45,180
OT cyber security metric what we do is

426
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:47,759
we look at all of the Assets in the OT

427
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:50,459
environment and we score those against

428
00:16:50,459 --> 00:16:53,540
the published cves that are there today

429
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:57,779
then we evaluate them against any of the

430
00:16:57,779 --> 00:17:01,560
known exploits that are ran against

431
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:05,699
those to determine a importance of that

432
00:17:05,699 --> 00:17:08,760
inside the environment then we look at

433
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:12,839
where they fit in the process of the

434
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:16,559
control systems and the levels of the

435
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:19,439
Purdue model in the organization and

436
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:21,780
what there are actually doing from an

437
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:25,740
asset standpoint for that process

438
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:28,140
secondly we take each of those devices

439
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:30,419
and we're trying to determine the

440
00:17:30,419 --> 00:17:34,080
visibility into the environment how much

441
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:38,039
of that control sample or entire process

442
00:17:38,039 --> 00:17:40,440
area that we are seeing so that we know

443
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:44,340
how much we are seeing from a visibility

444
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:46,320
standpoint

445
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:49,740
finally what we do is we take that and

446
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:54,360
we are trying to determine the age and

447
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:57,240
vulnerabilities of those assets so that

448
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:00,120
we can provide that data back into the

449
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:02,840
organization so they can make decisions

450
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:06,380
from their process control areas

451
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:09,320
determine how they can transfer the risk

452
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:13,559
and evaluate their environment so think

453
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:18,179
of a FICO score in the OT environment as

454
00:18:18,179 --> 00:18:21,120
FICO has done for financial it's a real

455
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,299
life breathing

456
00:18:23,299 --> 00:18:27,059
metric that the organizations can use to

457
00:18:27,059 --> 00:18:30,360
track are they getting better are they

458
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,820
staying stagnant or are they actually

459
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:36,320
getting worse from their cyber hygiene

460
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:40,140
within that environment this can be

461
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:43,620
attributed across a fleet or one process

462
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:47,820
area to start or an entire organization

463
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:51,320
great thank you

464
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:54,120
thank you

465
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:55,919
well I'll go first this time and we'll

466
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:57,600
go down this way um

467
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,179
excellent use of the stock photo I think

468
00:19:00,179 --> 00:19:02,900
that's really nice

469
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:06,480
I what I liked most about this was the

470
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,700
PLC percentage visibility

471
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:11,700
you know I think since you know I'm I'm

472
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:14,160
hung up on insecure by Design I think

473
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,620
the visibility to get to these things is

474
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:18,539
like is a really important part of your

475
00:19:18,539 --> 00:19:21,000
index or your or your statistic there

476
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,419
your metric so I'm going to give you

477
00:19:23,419 --> 00:19:25,799
tough this is where I want to follow you

478
00:19:25,799 --> 00:19:27,660
I want to give them a 7.5 so I don't

479
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:28,740
know what I should see the decimal

480
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:30,120
points are really good

481
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:32,760
um I'm going to round up and give you an

482
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:33,960
eight

483
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:36,660
Derek you know I think your your

484
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:38,340
previous contestant um that you're

485
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:40,260
competing against Jesus his was you know

486
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:43,080
very elegant and potentially profound

487
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:45,660
formula but I do like the Simplicity of

488
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:47,640
this formula maybe less profound but

489
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,500
maybe it's easy to digest the FICO

490
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,600
analogy is pretty strong

491
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,720
um I'm inclined to go with a an 8.3 but

492
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,700
I'll go with eight since I can't yeah

493
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:59,100
and Maggie are you going to be the tough

494
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:01,380
one this time worried you

495
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:04,080
I I mean it's it's vulnerability

496
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,299
management contextualized so you know

497
00:20:06,299 --> 00:20:08,460
it's a soft spot in my heart so I think

498
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:11,220
for me it's innate as well and eight

499
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:13,740
congratulations we have a tie for first

500
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:17,000
place two eights

501
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:21,960
and our last contestant come on out

502
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:24,960
Kenneth Kenneth Crowther

503
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,820
[Applause]

504
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:28,740
let me put his slide up

505
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:31,380
that is your slide right yes okay three

506
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:33,120
minutes let's go

507
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,520
all right when I was first asked to be

508
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,020
the product security leader for GE

509
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:39,600
research I had over a thousand projects

510
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,600
and I needed a metric that that met

511
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,880
these criteria I needed to make sure I

512
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,860
could communicate that security wasn't

513
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:48,419
everything it was part of this bigger

514
00:20:48,419 --> 00:20:50,820
hole of delivering rapidly delivering

515
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:53,400
secure products I needed to incorporate

516
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,740
uncertainty I needed to be explicit in

517
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:57,000
the metric

518
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,440
because I have to make decisions under

519
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00,360
uncertainty I needed to make sure I

520
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,799
didn't accidentally communicate that

521
00:21:01,799 --> 00:21:04,020
security as a destination because it's a

522
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:05,340
journey I'm going to ask them to do more

523
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:07,080
in the future and I need to be able to

524
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,580
start with little data and be able to

525
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:10,980
build so this is how I do it now at as a

526
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:12,960
product security leader at xylem three

527
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,240
questions for each product line how much

528
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,039
digital right how much of my product

529
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:18,660
line has programmable logic or

530
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:21,480
configurable network connections I model

531
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:24,000
this as a triangular distribution

532
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,880
then what do I know is good or bad the

533
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,320
good are the things that I've approved

534
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,059
because they've gone through some kind

535
00:21:30,059 --> 00:21:32,220
of rigorous product security program the

536
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:33,419
bads are things that I know that there

537
00:21:33,419 --> 00:21:34,559
are weaknesses and I haven't yet

538
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:36,720
determined the exploitability and then I

539
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:39,120
need a 90 confidence interval for the

540
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,640
revenue for that product line you put

541
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:44,159
these in Excel you download sit math a

542
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:45,900
free simulation tool

543
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:48,000
you run the simulation and you end up

544
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,919
with these two outcome metrics one is

545
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:51,720
the survival function that describes the

546
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,520
probability that the revenue at risk

547
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,500
will exceed some amount in the beginning

548
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:58,500
it's layers of judgment so there's a lot

549
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,780
of uncertainty kind of magnifying the

550
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:02,640
frequency and consequence and then you

551
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,559
also get these priorities right the dots

552
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:06,360
represent the average contribution of

553
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:09,780
product ABC or whatever that and their

554
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:12,360
rank right one two three the lines then

555
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:13,919
represent the uncertainty so you make

556
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:15,419
sure you're not accidentally focusing on

557
00:22:15,419 --> 00:22:17,159
something that just has a high average

558
00:22:17,159 --> 00:22:19,460
so here's an example down at the bottom

559
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:22,799
for some commercial HVAC back products

560
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:24,240
you'll see that

561
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,799
some of these products I have no idea

562
00:22:25,799 --> 00:22:27,120
how much digital because they're

563
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,740
constantly putting stuff they're taking

564
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:30,360
out electric circuit boards and they're

565
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:32,520
putting in chips with firmware and I

566
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:34,260
don't necessarily know in some cases I

567
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:35,820
have no products that I know about yet

568
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:39,240
but there is some Revenue

569
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:41,820
um you simulate these in Excel you end

570
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:43,380
up with some Revenue at risk here's an

571
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:45,659
example for that commercial HVAC and in

572
00:22:45,659 --> 00:22:46,559
this case

573
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:49,080
I ended up coming up with some good

574
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:51,059
priorities because I found out that they

575
00:22:51,059 --> 00:22:53,820
were putting Bluetooth connectivity on

576
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:55,980
safety controllers for boilers so that

577
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:58,620
they could go and do diagnostics I found

578
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:01,440
out that they were starting to do put

579
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,960
gateways in these circulators for big

580
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:06,480
buildings so that they could have remote

581
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,000
control and Diagnostics and we were able

582
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,679
to take these through a secure

583
00:23:10,679 --> 00:23:12,840
development process and after I knew

584
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:14,880
they actually disappeared from the top

585
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:15,900
of the list

586
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:19,679
so it uh it fulfills these uh criteria

587
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:21,900
it doesn't does require some making of

588
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:24,780
judgments and some Excel simulation

589
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:28,140
using sip math but ladies and gentlemen

590
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:30,360
Revenue at risk

591
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:33,080
thank you

592
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,740
so Maggie let's start with you this time

593
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:40,320
I mean I think the idea is solid the the

594
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,900
slide's not too busy for me it was well

595
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:46,140
presented I think for me it's solid

596
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:47,340
seven

597
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:50,159
okay I'll let you go last this time I'm

598
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:51,900
gonna go nice you you I get the deciding

599
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:52,919
pool okay

600
00:23:52,919 --> 00:23:54,000
um

601
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,179
I like the title Revenue at risk I mean

602
00:23:57,179 --> 00:23:59,159
that is going to resonate with some

603
00:23:59,159 --> 00:24:00,559
decision makers

604
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:03,299
what I worry a little bit about is all

605
00:24:03,299 --> 00:24:05,159
the Judgment underneath it you know it

606
00:24:05,159 --> 00:24:06,960
seems like it's judgment on top of

607
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,940
judgment on top of judgment and

608
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:11,400
I think Doug Hubbard the how to measure

609
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,200
anything in cyber security risk keeps

610
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,760
telling me I shouldn't worry about that

611
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:16,740
but I'm still not past that in my mind

612
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:18,659
so

613
00:24:18,659 --> 00:24:20,820
a lot I like a couple things I don't

614
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:22,140
like I guess I'm going to give it a

615
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:24,140
seven

616
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:27,240
you you mentioned Excel I love Excel so

617
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:29,039
I was sort of if you had me in Excel but

618
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:31,799
uh you're the one yeah so you know the

619
00:24:31,799 --> 00:24:34,860
truth is I like it and I like I like the

620
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:36,720
bringing business metrics into it you

621
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:37,799
know not cyber security for cyber

622
00:24:37,799 --> 00:24:39,419
Security's sake but what's the full

623
00:24:39,419 --> 00:24:42,000
picture so that to me I was I was headed

624
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,440
towards somewhere between eight and nine

625
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,240
and sort of you know since I'm going

626
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:47,159
last I'm going to give you the nine

627
00:24:47,159 --> 00:24:50,159
okay so what did you give him seven

628
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:54,360
seven nine oh man don't make me so not

629
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:55,380
quite

630
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:57,840
you're a little short of the eight I'm

631
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,100
sorry I guess you're seven and

632
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:02,600
two-thirds but thank you very much

633
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:07,080
making me do division on stage oh boy

634
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:09,900
okay so let's bring Craig and Ron both

635
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:11,400
on stage

636
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,840
so you're gonna have to help me out here

637
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:15,419
audience 90 second lightning round no so

638
00:25:15,419 --> 00:25:17,580
we've got two people with the same score

639
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:20,460
so we're gonna let you decide based on

640
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:21,720
Applause

641
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:24,840
and noise so we're going to start with

642
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:28,610
Ron who think Ron won

643
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:31,740
[Applause]

644
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:34,520
they're pretty strong

645
00:25:34,679 --> 00:25:37,440
go to my life

646
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:40,600
okay how about Craig

647
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:43,719
[Applause]

648
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:48,419
okay I'm sorry that was too close one

649
00:25:48,419 --> 00:25:53,240
more time oh ghost run run

650
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:55,799
you lost something there Ron I'm sorry

651
00:25:55,799 --> 00:25:58,460
Craig

652
00:26:01,159 --> 00:26:04,860
congratulations thank you but you will

653
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:06,900
both get a free ticket to next year's S4

654
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:08,520
so you're both winners thank you very

655
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:09,960
much thank you very much and thank you

656
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,760
all for your patience with our technical

657
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,799
difficulties and we'll see you at the

658
00:26:13,799 --> 00:26:15,539
next break after the next break thank

659
00:26:15,539 --> 00:26:16,740
you

660
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:19,740
foreign
