1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,240
foreign

2
00:00:05,299 --> 00:00:08,099
thanks for coming down really appreciate

3
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:10,860
it my pleasure you know I every every

4
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:12,840
year I ask a couple of people that I

5
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:15,299
really respect I respect you all but a

6
00:00:15,299 --> 00:00:17,760
few a few that I know really well I said

7
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,160
who would you really like to see on

8
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,779
stage who would you like to see me

9
00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:24,000
interview and you were one of the

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,619
requests a few years ago and I've tried

11
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:26,939
a couple of times but I'm really

12
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:28,500
thrilled to have you down especially

13
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,779
since you have a new book out too

14
00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:32,820
I think maybe a good place to start we

15
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:35,520
just had a speaker Marianne belotti on

16
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,500
stage and she was talking about Legacy

17
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:40,320
systems and how to deal with them and

18
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,239
upgrade them and secure them and you

19
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:45,300
have a kind of a famous quote securing

20
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:47,700
Legacy systems is like trying to put

21
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:50,520
rebar into Jello without changing its

22
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,399
appearance or flavor

23
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:54,899
so this audience has a huge amount of

24
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:56,760
Legacy systems I mean that's that's the

25
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:58,020
world we deal with they're supposed to

26
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:00,840
last 10 20 30 years

27
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,879
what have you learned or what should we

28
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:04,500
be thinking about

29
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:07,439
to to put that rebar in the jello or or

30
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:10,680
to solve the problem without doing that

31
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,860
it's one where we have to get away from

32
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:15,600
the idea of trying to

33
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,680
change what's there but maybe to wrap it

34
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,659
or to put something around it that we

35
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:23,420
can secure better

36
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:26,580
and certainly to be thinking ahead as to

37
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:28,140
what the Next Generation should be

38
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:30,479
because

39
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:33,720
much of that that's in place is Legacy

40
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:36,420
that is not supported anymore by vendors

41
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:39,360
and so we can't really make changes to

42
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,079
it

43
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:41,820
we have to start thinking about going

44
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:44,759
forward that the second lesson I or or

45
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:48,060
aspect of this is we shouldn't worry

46
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:50,280
about replacing it all at once

47
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:53,159
that we should leverage opportunities to

48
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:55,740
replace things appropriately as the

49
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,780
opportunities present themselves and do

50
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:59,820
it incrementally

51
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:03,540
then that also will give us some

52
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:06,299
observable benefit that we can then use

53
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:09,860
to justify making other changes okay

54
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:12,840
well we've got you've had a very long

55
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,700
and productive career so we've got a

56
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:16,860
little bit of ground to cover right one

57
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:18,540
part as I was looking what you did one

58
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:21,420
period it was like three years 1990 to

59
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:25,319
93. it was amazingly productive for you

60
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:28,860
and your team I I noted uh you with Dan

61
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:31,379
farmer you developed cops which was the

62
00:02:31,379 --> 00:02:33,959
first scanner you know almost like the

63
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:35,640
first version of a nessus or something

64
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:38,760
like that you and Gene Kim developed the

65
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,319
first IDs

66
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:43,800
I was cleverly named idiot intrusion

67
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,680
detection in our time that was signature

68
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:49,560
based and actually had a couple others

69
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,900
there but these were just gigantic huge

70
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:54,120
firsts that have ended up being very

71
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,940
important what do you attribute that

72
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:01,800
time of such productivity and output to

73
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:06,180
uh in part it was driven by my

74
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:08,000
observation of need

75
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,819
we were targeted quite a bit at that

76
00:03:11,819 --> 00:03:13,739
time the University was targeted the

77
00:03:13,739 --> 00:03:16,260
university and me in particular okay uh

78
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:19,080
after the the internet worm a lot of

79
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,340
people

80
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:22,860
became aware that I was out there and

81
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:25,620
they were trying to get into my system I

82
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:28,080
also developed at that time the first

83
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,720
Honeypot system although I didn't

84
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,220
publish about it because a government

85
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:35,840
agency was uh using it

86
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,879
as a product so a lot of it was driven

87
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:40,620
by actual need and I just turned that

88
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,900
into projects with students or things

89
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:45,000
that we experimented with at the time

90
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,099
but there's also a really great benefit

91
00:03:47,099 --> 00:03:48,620
to being first

92
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:51,360
if there's nothing else there that we

93
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,760
are worried about

94
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,459
uh stepping on anybody's toes or getting

95
00:03:56,459 --> 00:03:58,739
into the same area it's a lot easier to

96
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:00,840
be productive than be the the first one

97
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,700
to develop it

98
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,500
but you have to think of it right I mean

99
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:07,019
there that same opportunity was there

100
00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:10,439
for everyone else was did you have like

101
00:04:10,439 --> 00:04:11,700
a

102
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:14,819
a great core team or

103
00:04:14,819 --> 00:04:17,100
I'm just kind of when we're trying to

104
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,660
think about how do we create new ideas

105
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:21,660
how do we generate new ideas that to me

106
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:23,580
that's one of the most in our field in

107
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:25,380
information security cyber security

108
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:26,639
whatever you want to call it that's

109
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:28,800
really an amazing

110
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,740
set of discoveries in a short time that

111
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:33,199
have become

112
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:36,540
Staples in the industry well most of my

113
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:39,000
students were undergrads so they were

114
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,320
very good and they've gone on to do

115
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,840
wonderful things

116
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:45,960
I really think at that time part of what

117
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:49,500
happened was looking at how people were

118
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,060
currently addressing the same problems

119
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:52,979
and saying

120
00:04:52,979 --> 00:04:55,440
let's do something different how are we

121
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:59,060
going to do this differently and the

122
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:02,400
sort of what was common at the time were

123
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,740
two approaches one was formal

124
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:07,560
verification of systems and you've been

125
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,639
in the field long enough you remember

126
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:11,460
back to those days

127
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:13,560
um which was not practical and still to

128
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:16,259
this day is practical for some limited

129
00:05:16,259 --> 00:05:18,360
circumstances but not generally

130
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:21,419
and then the second was a great deal of

131
00:05:21,419 --> 00:05:23,880
effort was put into

132
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,880
um

133
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:29,160
confidentiality encryption similar kinds

134
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:33,720
of uh of effort so what we did is we

135
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,300
looked at the problem and said okay

136
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:37,979
confidentiality great but what do we do

137
00:05:37,979 --> 00:05:40,199
for availability what do you do for

138
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:43,740
integrity what do we do if we're able to

139
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:46,320
make an attacker

140
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,699
um

141
00:05:47,699 --> 00:05:51,600
expose themselves by putting a false

142
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,720
system in place and so we asked a lot of

143
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,580
those what-if questions about how do we

144
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:57,840
do something differently than what

145
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,580
others are and that's where the

146
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:02,039
inspiration really came from okay

147
00:06:02,039 --> 00:06:04,919
you I in one of it it's been a while ago

148
00:06:04,919 --> 00:06:06,660
so I'm curious if you still feel this

149
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:09,300
way but you said a computer science

150
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:10,979
degree should include a course in

151
00:06:10,979 --> 00:06:13,740
Psychology do you still believe that and

152
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:15,300
if so why

153
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:19,560
yes I do and in in fact uh our

154
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,600
interdisciplinary information security

155
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,360
degree now includes psychology as an

156
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:27,479
option and I just recently have created

157
00:06:27,479 --> 00:06:29,039
and I'm teaching a course that includes

158
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:31,740
some of this and the book has some uh

159
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:34,380
psychology in it about innate biases and

160
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:35,639
misconceptions

161
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:37,740
and that's why is

162
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:40,440
we have a lot of people who focus on

163
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,840
the hardware with an understanding of

164
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:45,479
what the hardware does but if we're

165
00:06:45,479 --> 00:06:47,100
really going to understand security we

166
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,660
also have to understand the people

167
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:50,699
because it's the people who buy it

168
00:06:50,699 --> 00:06:53,520
configure it set the policy use and

169
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:57,120
misuse the systems and if we

170
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,880
try to put all of the honest on the

171
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:02,160
hardware and the software

172
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,380
and leave the humans out of the equation

173
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:08,340
we're not addressing the full problem

174
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:10,139
you have a

175
00:07:10,139 --> 00:07:13,039
important anniversary coming up

176
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:16,319
the center for Education and Research in

177
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:18,419
information and assurance and security

178
00:07:18,419 --> 00:07:21,840
serious at Purdue University uh

179
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,720
started in May of 1998 so you're coming

180
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,259
up on a 25th anniversary of this serious

181
00:07:28,259 --> 00:07:30,419
organization that you you know were

182
00:07:30,419 --> 00:07:32,220
really the founder of and have been

183
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:35,160
involved with for 25 years

184
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:38,460
how did um I guess maybe two questions

185
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:40,560
here what do you think was one of the

186
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,139
best accomplishments of Sirius

187
00:07:43,139 --> 00:07:45,900
and secondly

188
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:48,300
what's happened over that 25 years how

189
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,979
has that differed from what you expected

190
00:07:49,979 --> 00:07:52,319
to happen over 25 years

191
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:55,199
oh those are interesting questions

192
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:56,699
um

193
00:07:56,699 --> 00:07:59,699
when I when I started the center it

194
00:07:59,699 --> 00:08:01,800
actually had that aspect in mind I

195
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,720
mentioned about psychology it was

196
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,220
founded specifically as a

197
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:07,099
multi-disciplinary center

198
00:08:07,099 --> 00:08:09,960
and basically there were

199
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:12,539
five faculty who were involved at the

200
00:08:12,539 --> 00:08:14,400
time

201
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,860
um we've since grown to over 160 faculty

202
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:19,199
who are involved we have about 25

203
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:21,360
companies and government agencies that

204
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,039
are Partners

205
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,000
um

206
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,460
I wish I could say we did more in OT but

207
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:30,780
those companies we have had a disconnect

208
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:32,820
um

209
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:35,219
so the the accomplishment there I think

210
00:08:35,219 --> 00:08:38,640
has been in not only broadening the

211
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,979
field because we've looked at it in this

212
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:42,839
large way but we spent a lot of time

213
00:08:42,839 --> 00:08:45,120
working with other universities to help

214
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,100
them get their program started they did

215
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:48,720
that by hiring our students and taking

216
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,820
some of the curriculum because we we

217
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:52,680
weren't interested in just doing it by

218
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:53,820
ourselves

219
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:56,100
and I won't name names but there are a

220
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,779
number of major universities now that

221
00:08:57,779 --> 00:08:59,459
have their own Security Programs and

222
00:08:59,459 --> 00:09:02,220
centers that were spin-offs of of what

223
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:04,320
we did so that's one of the things that

224
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,480
I'm really proudest about and I noted

225
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,880
that you when it started in 1998 there

226
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,060
were only three phds in cyber security

227
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:13,380
so we were talking about the really

228
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:15,660
early days where there weren't programs

229
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:17,519
there was nothing around so that is a

230
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:19,440
huge accomplishment to be able to not

231
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,779
only do it at serious but then to

232
00:09:21,779 --> 00:09:25,140
migrated across other universities yeah

233
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:26,700
when we looked at that

234
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:29,459
um that uh what you're quoting from was

235
00:09:29,459 --> 00:09:31,860
a testimony I gave to Congress at the

236
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:34,380
time that nationally we were producing

237
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:36,480
three phds a year and two of them

238
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,700
weren't U.S citizens oh that's right

239
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:41,279
yeah yeah so that was a real problem

240
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:43,320
looking at it from a national or

241
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,899
International perspective and we've

242
00:09:45,899 --> 00:09:47,279
changed that and so that's one of the

243
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:49,500
things that I'm happiest about

244
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,220
um

245
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:52,560
what turned out differently than what I

246
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,019
anticipated first of all I never really

247
00:09:55,019 --> 00:09:56,459
thought at the time that it would go

248
00:09:56,459 --> 00:09:59,040
this long okay yeah so that's a pleasant

249
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,779
surprise

250
00:10:00,779 --> 00:10:02,700
um sometimes when I wake up in the

251
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,440
morning I'm pleasantly surprised I've

252
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,180
gone on this long so that's that's

253
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:08,100
another aspect

254
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:10,019
um but

255
00:10:10,019 --> 00:10:12,300
when I had started that I had really

256
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:15,480
hoped that we would be able to get

257
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:18,000
a greater awareness in the more general

258
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,399
computing population and and general

259
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:22,620
population about the importance of

260
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:24,420
building Security in rather than

261
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:27,000
worrying about it as an afterthought

262
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,640
and we still haven't gotten there so so

263
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:32,100
that's the one part that's disappointing

264
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:35,040
uh that we're continuing to try to work

265
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,620
on is security shouldn't be an

266
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:40,019
afterthought or maintainability or

267
00:10:40,019 --> 00:10:42,480
usability yeah yeah I mean we're just

268
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,980
seeing in our sector we're just seeing

269
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:47,220
doe and others put out papers saying

270
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:49,019
that security has to be part of the

271
00:10:49,019 --> 00:10:51,120
development process which

272
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,640
is good right it's good to get people

273
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:56,160
singing that song but it's been taken

274
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:59,160
quite a long time to get there now I

275
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:02,100
want to shift to can we put up the slide

276
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:03,240
for a minute

277
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:06,000
uh you have a new book out yes and

278
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,040
certainly not your first book I didn't I

279
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,180
didn't write down how many you've had

280
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:10,440
but you've written quite a few books

281
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,880
it's cyber security myths and

282
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,579
misconceptions and he will be signing

283
00:11:14,579 --> 00:11:16,200
copies Gene will be signing copies of

284
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,660
that at the Cabana sessions today

285
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:20,399
um so please do that but I also want to

286
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:22,380
know that you probably can't see on

287
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:24,540
there but in in small text illustrations

288
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:28,260
by Patty spafford so there's two doctors

289
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:32,700
in the uh in the spafford clan Patty is

290
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:35,399
a doctor of art education and I have a

291
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:37,140
few of the illustrations here they're

292
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:38,880
really fun and maybe if we can show

293
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:42,120
Patty in the audience if you can do that

294
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:45,200
there she is

295
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:51,899
but the book is full of them I had a

296
00:11:51,899 --> 00:11:53,640
hard time just picking three they're

297
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,860
really good the only thing I can tell

298
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:58,320
you Patty is that having been down here

299
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,380
in Miami Beach when it's cold for the

300
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:03,120
second edition you should have lizards

301
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,980
falling off of those palm trees because

302
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:07,320
we've been down here in January where

303
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,300
that's happened but it's it's a great

304
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:11,700
book so I do encourage I believe he's

305
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,260
starting to sign the books at two

306
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:15,000
o'clock I believe there's three book

307
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,100
signings today but I think Patty will be

308
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:19,440
there with you yes okay okay you can

309
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,660
take the slides down

310
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:23,940
um but this book is really interesting

311
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:27,360
there's a 175 myths biases and

312
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,240
misconceptions so he goes through these

313
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,980
you and your co-authors go through these

314
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:33,899
and knock them down and some of them I

315
00:12:33,899 --> 00:12:35,459
thought were very interesting for this

316
00:12:35,459 --> 00:12:38,519
audience uh for example you had one myth

317
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:42,839
cyber offense is easier than defense

318
00:12:42,839 --> 00:12:44,639
you still believe well you must you just

319
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:46,320
publish a book so you still think that's

320
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,200
that's a myth it is it is and maybe

321
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,060
explain why you think that

322
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:52,019
um

323
00:12:52,019 --> 00:12:54,660
cyber offense if if you're certainly

324
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:57,240
going against a naive and unprotected

325
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:00,839
Target is simple but for to do it well

326
00:13:00,839 --> 00:13:03,720
and not be discovered and and Achieve

327
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,940
goals particularly with the

328
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:07,279
um the elements that are available

329
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:09,360
requires a lot of expertise and

330
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,519
investment and time and effort and from

331
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:13,320
The Defenders the defender's point of

332
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,180
view we're thinking oh we have to defend

333
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:19,500
everything and the per the people the

334
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,839
entities working offense only have to

335
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:24,300
find a problem and we have to defend

336
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:25,980
against all of them it doesn't really

337
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:27,600
work quite that way because whoever's

338
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,579
doing the offense needs to know where to

339
00:13:29,579 --> 00:13:31,620
look for that one problem that's not

340
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:34,139
simple and if you do a good job

341
00:13:34,139 --> 00:13:36,800
defending most things

342
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,779
the um whoever's doing the offense is

343
00:13:39,779 --> 00:13:41,700
going to have to put in a lot of effort

344
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:44,160
now it's it's true that there are some

345
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,019
entities that have the resources to put

346
00:13:46,019 --> 00:13:48,720
in lots of effort uh nation states some

347
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,120
organized crime

348
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:54,300
cartels but as a Defender it

349
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,459
it's a tough job but it's not

350
00:13:56,459 --> 00:13:57,839
necessarily that much more difficult

351
00:13:57,839 --> 00:13:59,459
than offense

352
00:13:59,459 --> 00:14:02,459
related to this and maybe a little a

353
00:14:02,459 --> 00:14:04,380
little tougher for me to get my mind

354
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:07,019
around but you see that you have a quote

355
00:14:07,019 --> 00:14:08,339
you've said I think it was in the book

356
00:14:08,339 --> 00:14:10,019
and other plays you say there are a lot

357
00:14:10,019 --> 00:14:11,760
of people who believe that the only way

358
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,980
you can protect a system is to know how

359
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:16,800
to break into it and I really firmly

360
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,200
reject that

361
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,240
you say that but you've spent a lot of

362
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,980
time understanding how people break

363
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:25,440
systems right you know with your

364
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,540
forensics work for example on the Morris

365
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:30,300
worm and many many times since that do

366
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:31,560
you

367
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,420
do you still think that you can protect

368
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:35,639
a system without

369
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:38,399
knowing how it could be broken and if so

370
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:39,959
why spend so much time trying to

371
00:14:39,959 --> 00:14:42,959
understand how people break things

372
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:46,019
I believe that for many of the things

373
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:48,300
that need to be done for protection you

374
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:49,980
don't really need to know exactly how

375
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:52,199
someone's going to try to break in for

376
00:14:52,199 --> 00:14:54,600
the simple reason that we we are

377
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,980
constantly seeing new attacks we're

378
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:57,600
seeing new kinds of misconfigurations

379
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,880
and new other kinds of problems and

380
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:04,620
so if you understand the basic skills

381
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:06,240
that are involved in protection and

382
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,440
detection

383
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,680
system configuration you can do an

384
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:13,260
outstanding job of defense against the

385
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:15,240
majority of kinds of problems that may

386
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,500
occur

387
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:17,639
but

388
00:15:17,639 --> 00:15:20,940
I know ways of getting an assistance for

389
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:23,699
instance insiders supply chain attacks

390
00:15:23,699 --> 00:15:26,279
deception attacks that are really kind

391
00:15:26,279 --> 00:15:27,959
of esoteric

392
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:30,540
the people who defend many of them have

393
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:33,300
no idea what those attacks are but they

394
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:34,740
can still defend against them because

395
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:37,139
the basic defenses the basic ideas

396
00:15:37,139 --> 00:15:40,680
behind managing Integrity looking for

397
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:42,420
anomalous Behavior setting permissions

398
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:44,880
correctly having patches in place those

399
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,040
don't require understanding how to break

400
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,680
into the system I see so and this is

401
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,360
probably my

402
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:54,300
my kind of one of my biases you write a

403
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:56,100
lot about there's a lot of good sections

404
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:57,779
on different types of biases in the book

405
00:15:57,779 --> 00:16:00,000
but I was thinking of it from the

406
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,279
standpoint of the world I live in and a

407
00:16:02,279 --> 00:16:03,779
lot of the people in this room do where

408
00:16:03,779 --> 00:16:06,120
they're trying to figure out what

409
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:08,699
defense to use not not necessarily I

410
00:16:08,699 --> 00:16:09,839
think what you're talking about is like

411
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:11,639
a company that is trying to defend

412
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:14,040
itself doesn't necessarily need to know

413
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,480
all this but if you were trying to

414
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:17,959
develop some new defensive technology or

415
00:16:17,959 --> 00:16:20,940
defensive approach knowing how they're

416
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:22,260
going to attack you might be a little

417
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:23,459
more helpful

418
00:16:23,459 --> 00:16:27,240
it can be more helpful but if to move it

419
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:30,300
into an analogous kind of situation if

420
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:32,160
if you're trying to protect your home

421
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,500
again somebody breaking in you don't

422
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,480
need to understand all the ways that

423
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,279
somebody can pick a lock or open the

424
00:16:38,279 --> 00:16:40,740
door you simply need to know to lock the

425
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:42,899
door have good locks have an alarm

426
00:16:42,899 --> 00:16:46,920
system makes sense and you can do a 90 a

427
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:48,959
98 job with that without having to

428
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:51,240
understand okay

429
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:54,480
you you and your co-authors start each

430
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,339
chapter with a little quote or most of

431
00:16:56,339 --> 00:16:58,440
the chapters one of them I found

432
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,660
interesting in Chapter 13 Peter Drucker

433
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:02,820
quote the greatest danger in times of

434
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:05,760
turbulence is not turbulence itself but

435
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,699
to act with yesterday's logic

436
00:17:08,699 --> 00:17:10,500
where are we doing that today where are

437
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:13,079
we reacting with yesterday's logic in

438
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:14,339
the security world

439
00:17:14,339 --> 00:17:16,619
I would say we're still doing it by

440
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:20,160
putting most of our attention into

441
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,179
um

442
00:17:21,179 --> 00:17:23,819
building walls with software

443
00:17:23,819 --> 00:17:26,880
rather than in doing systems level

444
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,079
thinking

445
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:29,340
uh

446
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:31,440
a lot of what I've seen in the security

447
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:35,400
Arena certainly with tools has been will

448
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,679
build up walls we'll build up scanners

449
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:40,380
to look for problems rather than going

450
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:43,020
to the heart of well let's engineer it

451
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:45,840
securely in the first place let's think

452
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:49,380
about the the potential targets the

453
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:51,600
incentives and the structures that we

454
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:55,500
put around to disincentivize attacks

455
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:59,940
so thinking at that kind of we're going

456
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:01,500
to build more walls we're going to build

457
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:04,799
better alarm systems as the way to

458
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:07,320
approach security of a complex system

459
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,360
that involves people that involves

460
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:13,980
organizations I think an example of this

461
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:15,900
for those who heard Josh corman's talk

462
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:17,700
yesterday where he was talking about the

463
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:20,000
interrelationship of critical sectors

464
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,160
that stovepipe thinking is not going to

465
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,020
get us where we need to be we're going

466
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:26,700
to have to start thinking on a broader

467
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:28,799
more integrated scale

468
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:31,679
is you don't get quite the immediate

469
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:34,140
Sugar Rush you get if you like buy or

470
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:36,000
deploy or put up another wall or another

471
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,520
sensor right that's that's very and you

472
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,620
can go and you can say I did this but

473
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,240
systematic is

474
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:46,320
is a longer term approach yeah I saw a

475
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,960
uh a survey that was done by one of the

476
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,820
Consulting organizations like Forester

477
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:53,160
or otherwise that said the average large

478
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:55,980
corporation has 56 different security

479
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:59,760
vendor tools deployed and yet these

480
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,080
organizations are still being broken

481
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:03,840
into they're still being compromised it

482
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,660
adding another tool isn't the way to fix

483
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:09,299
this we have to think differently about

484
00:19:09,299 --> 00:19:11,160
how we approach the problem if we're

485
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,780
actually going to make a difference

486
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:16,620
well maybe related to that is a myth and

487
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:19,140
this is funny I it would be nice if Bill

488
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:21,960
Furman was sitting right next to me here

489
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:24,000
um he was with Berkshire Hathaway energy

490
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,880
he was up on stage earlier myth sharing

491
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,559
more threat Intel will make things

492
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:30,539
better

493
00:19:30,539 --> 00:19:32,820
that's a myth but there's a tremendous

494
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:35,760
amount of effort right now I mean if if

495
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,860
I was to point at one thing that is

496
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:39,780
getting the most attention

497
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:42,419
and the most money from a government and

498
00:19:42,419 --> 00:19:44,520
Industry perspective it would be this

499
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:47,700
put in sensor share threat Intel so why

500
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:51,120
is that a myth it's a myth that sharing

501
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,160
more will always be better

502
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:56,640
sharing some makes things better and we

503
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,100
have done a poor job in many sectors

504
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:01,860
with sharing useful information to allow

505
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:04,860
us to anticipate and recognize threats

506
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:07,080
but simply increasing the flow of

507
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,280
information

508
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:11,100
the more threat information we share is

509
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:13,440
overwhelming and we can spend all our

510
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,960
time processing that and again that's

511
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:18,240
down at the detail level rather than

512
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,400
stepping back and thinking systemically

513
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,740
about how we protect against whole

514
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:24,419
classes of threats

515
00:20:24,419 --> 00:20:27,600
so in any kind and I think for for

516
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,460
people here who work in the in the area

517
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:32,520
if you have too much sensor data too

518
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:35,880
many logs you become overwhelmed and

519
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,919
same thing with threat data

520
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:40,440
um it's too much data of any kind is a

521
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,340
problem

522
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:43,260
it's turning it into operational

523
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:45,960
actionable knowledge that's the key

524
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:48,780
issue and so we're again we're focusing

525
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:50,400
at two granular level rather than

526
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,039
stepping back

527
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:55,260
that flies a little bit if you talk to

528
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:57,840
most analysts they want more right their

529
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,460
their initial reaction is give me all

530
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:01,320
your data give me all your data and all

531
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:02,880
decide what I want

532
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,280
in

533
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,919
and so how do we fight back against that

534
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:09,120
tendency

535
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,640
to just because that seems to be the way

536
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,380
we're going now is more sensors more

537
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:15,120
data and then we'll pull out the

538
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,280
actionable intelligence out of that data

539
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,380
once we have it in this gigantic data

540
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:21,840
Lake and we apply our of course our Ai

541
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,419
and everything else to it to do this

542
00:21:23,419 --> 00:21:26,880
should we be pushing back on that or is

543
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,020
that

544
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:31,200
the way we should be going

545
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,840
getting the right data is more important

546
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:37,380
than getting more of it and I don't see

547
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:40,620
enough attention being paid there to

548
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:43,080
thinking about what are the key elements

549
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:45,059
that we really need to have and how do

550
00:21:45,059 --> 00:21:47,580
we reduce that into something actionable

551
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:51,799
so uh as an example a typical Enterprise

552
00:21:51,799 --> 00:21:55,320
may be getting potentially megabytes

553
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:58,380
possibly much more of sensor data every

554
00:21:58,380 --> 00:21:59,760
day

555
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:03,240
but until there is an incident

556
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:05,760
that's just extra data that isn't needed

557
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,280
and then if an incident occurs being

558
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:10,020
able to pick out the right things is

559
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:12,960
very important so simply more data isn't

560
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,299
the solution it's understanding what's

561
00:22:15,299 --> 00:22:17,520
the right data and getting it into the

562
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:21,480
right hands that's probably where I

563
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:23,580
think one of the next areas of Industry

564
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:26,220
development is going to be

565
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:28,500
um if if we step back and we look at uh

566
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:30,240
for instance what uh intelligence

567
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,580
agencies do they collect huge amounts of

568
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:34,380
information but they have a lot of

569
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:36,659
analysts who do the sifting or they have

570
00:22:36,659 --> 00:22:38,760
a lot of tools that do the sifting the

571
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,559
people who make the decisions about what

572
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:42,720
to have happen generally have that boil

573
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:46,440
down to just a dozen Pages at most uh as

574
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:49,260
to what's actually significant we have

575
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:50,940
to have that kind of mindset if we're

576
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:52,740
going to succeed here because there's

577
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:55,679
just too much going on and too much data

578
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:58,440
this as I mentioned there's 175 of these

579
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:00,059
I have a couple more on my list but do

580
00:23:00,059 --> 00:23:02,039
you have a favorite one or two like that

581
00:23:02,039 --> 00:23:03,299
you might think might be applicable

582
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:04,860
you've talked to some of these people

583
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:07,200
it's a audience of people that are

584
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,179
running or helping secure Control

585
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:11,460
Systems what's do you have a favorite

586
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:14,100
myth or something well I have I have two

587
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:17,100
and and one sort of goes to some of my

588
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:19,200
earlier comments which is that the the

589
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,080
user is the weakest link and and that is

590
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,240
really wrong

591
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:27,900
um it's convenient to blame it on the

592
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:29,179
end users

593
00:23:29,179 --> 00:23:31,679
and many and many of us who work in

594
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:33,240
security

595
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:35,520
um feel very protective about our

596
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,620
hardware and software defenses and so it

597
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:40,500
must be somebody else is screwed up but

598
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:43,320
if we turn that around and say well why

599
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:44,760
are people a problem in some

600
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,740
circumstances usually it's a matter of

601
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:48,539
Education or we've given them bad things

602
00:23:48,539 --> 00:23:49,860
to work with

603
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:51,539
people go to work every day to get their

604
00:23:51,539 --> 00:23:54,360
job done not necessarily to get in the

605
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:57,659
way of security if we give them good

606
00:23:57,659 --> 00:24:00,480
interfaces good tools and appropriate

607
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:03,539
support they can actually be part of the

608
00:24:03,539 --> 00:24:07,520
security rather than the weakest link

609
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:10,220
again it requires a mindset difference

610
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:13,620
in how we approach the totality of what

611
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:15,659
we're trying to do with security if we

612
00:24:15,659 --> 00:24:18,480
think in terms of being a team rather

613
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,580
than us against them

614
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:22,400
we're more likely to have good results

615
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,960
and and the second one before you get to

616
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,280
that okay sure just answer your question

617
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:28,620
on that I do want to hear the second one

618
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:31,620
we're finding in our field now that as

619
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:33,840
we're becoming more security aware again

620
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:36,240
you know it used to just be this little

621
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,340
thing hidden behind that no one talked

622
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:40,740
about and no one touched but now we're

623
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:42,419
realizing it's all interconnected so

624
00:24:42,419 --> 00:24:45,000
we're getting more involved and we're

625
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,460
starting to ask all sorts of different

626
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:50,400
roles to do more in security so as as

627
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,900
things come up we're saying oh now

628
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:53,340
operators need to know this and

629
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:55,500
Engineers need to know that and every

630
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:58,580
role is getting these things

631
00:24:58,679 --> 00:25:01,679
can that succeed should we be asking

632
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:03,600
them to do more or should we be trying

633
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,720
to reduce what we're asking them to do

634
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:09,419
we need to we need to focus more and we

635
00:25:09,419 --> 00:25:13,440
perhaps need to stratify uh some and not

636
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,820
everyone needs to be an expert in

637
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:17,280
everything now that's driven currently

638
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:19,140
by the fact that most

639
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:20,940
commercial organizations and some

640
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:22,919
government organizations aren't willing

641
00:25:22,919 --> 00:25:25,740
to capitalize security and personnel and

642
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:27,179
we don't have enough Personnel to go

643
00:25:27,179 --> 00:25:30,539
around but trying to have every person

644
00:25:30,539 --> 00:25:33,080
be an expert in every protocol every

645
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:36,299
defensive mechanism is not going to be

646
00:25:36,299 --> 00:25:38,039
sustainable and it's one of the reasons

647
00:25:38,039 --> 00:25:40,620
we have a shortage of people who can do

648
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:44,100
that if we better stratify and and

649
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:46,580
segregate the kinds of knowledge and

650
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:49,380
work that people do I think we'll be

651
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:52,100
able to bring more people into the field

652
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:54,779
some don't have to have the depth of

653
00:25:54,779 --> 00:25:56,580
Technology background that we're

654
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:57,659
expecting

655
00:25:57,659 --> 00:25:59,640
and we'll probably have better outcomes

656
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:02,520
again because we're not trying to take

657
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:05,039
in everything all the time okay and

658
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:07,020
what's that second myth sorry oh no

659
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:09,960
problem um the second one is

660
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:14,820
that vendors uh have your best interests

661
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:16,380
in mind

662
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:17,820
and

663
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:20,760
that's not intended to be necessarily

664
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:23,400
pejorative for any vendor here but if

665
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,779
you think about it

666
00:26:24,779 --> 00:26:26,880
the vendors the companies are in

667
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,039
business to make money

668
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:31,080
they're not in business to protect the

669
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,100
world

670
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:35,159
their products are intended to make

671
00:26:35,159 --> 00:26:37,620
money and that's how they sell them

672
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:39,620
and that means that

673
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:42,659
vendors taken as a whole again not to

674
00:26:42,659 --> 00:26:44,880
pick on any particular one are not

675
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,799
always as forthright about the

676
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:49,559
limitations of their products the

677
00:26:49,559 --> 00:26:51,600
configurations that they put into the

678
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,000
products that are put out are not

679
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,799
necessarily the best to run in your

680
00:26:55,799 --> 00:26:56,640
system

681
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,279
they're the best so that they don't have

682
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:02,100
to feel lots of tech support calls so

683
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:03,840
it's the most General that's why so many

684
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:06,360
products for instance go in with uh

685
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:08,100
administrator privileges because that

686
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:09,360
way you don't have to worry about what

687
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,220
the settings are

688
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:12,779
there are a lot of good products on the

689
00:27:12,779 --> 00:27:13,620
market

690
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:16,620
but if you approach it with the idea

691
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:19,080
that it's shrink wrapped I can put it in

692
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:21,299
place it has the right configurations

693
00:27:21,299 --> 00:27:23,700
and features that's why companies have

694
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:26,820
56 different products is because it

695
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:28,980
simply doesn't uh

696
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:32,460
um protect everything and so that's part

697
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:35,760
of the mindset again of what we assume

698
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:38,880
versus what we're actually deploying

699
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,460
okay I have or I have something I want

700
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:42,779
to follow up there but I want to get to

701
00:27:42,779 --> 00:27:44,460
one there's so many things in your book

702
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:46,980
I want to get to one last one uh you had

703
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:49,860
one myth everyone should solve a given

704
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:53,039
cyber security problem in the same way

705
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:54,779
but I want to want you to talk about

706
00:27:54,779 --> 00:27:57,779
that related to regulation or an

707
00:27:57,779 --> 00:27:59,520
insurance company because we're seeing

708
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:02,159
now with regulation a sense being very

709
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:04,799
prescriptive you must do this and

710
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:06,480
insurance companies are starting to

711
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,700
create these questionnaires to say we'll

712
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:10,140
give you this questionnaire and this

713
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:11,700
will help us determine if we want to

714
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:14,039
cover you and what your rate will be

715
00:28:14,039 --> 00:28:16,080
how

716
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:19,860
how do those fields that tend to force

717
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:23,159
you into these do it the same way

718
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:25,020
how are they going to succeed

719
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:27,059
what's their path to success for a

720
00:28:27,059 --> 00:28:28,919
successful regulation or a successful

721
00:28:28,919 --> 00:28:30,059
insurance

722
00:28:30,059 --> 00:28:32,880
let's say risk analysis

723
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,400
so this is typical of

724
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:39,240
an emerging area where you don't have

725
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:41,279
enough standardized knowledge or

726
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:42,539
capability

727
00:28:42,539 --> 00:28:45,240
where we build these prescriptive lists

728
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:48,059
of things that you need to do so best

729
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:50,880
practices another example you have to

730
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,440
meet best practices you have to meet the

731
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,299
PCI standard you have to meet these

732
00:28:54,299 --> 00:28:55,559
other things

733
00:28:55,559 --> 00:28:58,620
that's because it isn't accepted

734
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:01,200
practice how to do something correctly

735
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:06,600
so we prescribe a particular approach

736
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,940
as the field matures and we discover

737
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:14,880
that that inhibits better Solutions

738
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,299
we're likely to see that change to more

739
00:29:17,299 --> 00:29:18,860
goal-oriented

740
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:22,860
kinds of regulations or or questioners

741
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:24,419
the insurance companies have it

742
00:29:24,419 --> 00:29:26,460
particularly difficult because we don't

743
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:28,260
have good metrics we don't have good

744
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:30,600
Actuarial information and insurance

745
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,580
companies aren't in the business to lose

746
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:35,520
money they want to be sure that they are

747
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:38,159
covering the risk and able to make some

748
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:40,799
profit from the insurance they offer

749
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:42,779
so that's why they set those

750
00:29:42,779 --> 00:29:44,940
requirements is to try to limit their

751
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:48,000
risk not necessarily in what's going to

752
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,340
be best for you to respond but what's

753
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:52,340
going to be again what's best for them

754
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:56,460
and as when we think about that

755
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:59,399
um we we need to think in terms of what

756
00:29:59,399 --> 00:30:01,860
is it they're really optimizing for and

757
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:03,779
how do we how do we change the

758
00:30:03,779 --> 00:30:05,640
environment so that it's optimized for

759
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,740
Mutual benefit

760
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:09,720
well I really appreciate you coming down

761
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:12,059
I I encourage all of you to I mean

762
00:30:12,059 --> 00:30:13,559
you're not all going to get a book but

763
00:30:13,559 --> 00:30:17,220
but I think we have like 100 100 or 150

764
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:19,620
books so he'll be signing as many as he

765
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:21,720
can today at the Cabana sessions and

766
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:24,120
even if you don't get a signed book take

767
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:26,279
the opportunity to meet this legend in

768
00:30:26,279 --> 00:30:28,620
the field of information security and

769
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:30,480
thank you very much for coming down and

770
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:33,500
my pleasure thank you

771
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:37,260
