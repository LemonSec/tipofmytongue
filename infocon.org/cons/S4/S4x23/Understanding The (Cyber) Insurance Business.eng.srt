1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,240
foreign

2
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:08,340
have you ever wondered why you know so

3
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:10,980
little about the insurance industry

4
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:13,380
what happens when you transfer risk to

5
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:15,599
an insurance company

6
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:18,539
how do insurance companies manage all

7
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:21,300
those risks that they accumulate

8
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:23,660
and what in the world is cyber insurance

9
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:26,279
and why should you be more involved in

10
00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:28,619
sourcing or placing it

11
00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:30,960
now these are hard questions

12
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,200
but we have to start somewhere

13
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,120
cyber insurance has been around for over

14
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,860
25 years

15
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:41,280
and yet ensures regulators and many

16
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,739
organizations still have existential

17
00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:45,600
questions about the Cyber Insurance

18
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,879
Marketplace

19
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:50,579
but let's think about it

20
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:53,640
data and technology has underpinned our

21
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:56,879
society's wealth and aspirations

22
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:59,699
technology has improved our way of life

23
00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:01,440
our businesses

24
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,300
and it has given us hope that we can

25
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:06,920
solve the world's biggest challenges

26
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:09,360
but securing this technology isn't

27
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,700
itself a problem

28
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:13,979
and that's for two reasons

29
00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:16,799
on one hand everything is more or less

30
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:18,060
connected

31
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:20,340
and on the other hand

32
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:25,259
human error is omnipresent in cyber risk

33
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:27,659
so these two reasons make it very hard

34
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:29,759
to predict cyber risk

35
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:31,560
so what can we do about it

36
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,900
how do we solve this

37
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:36,659
well we could lean into our human

38
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:38,220
superpower

39
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:40,860
our communication skills

40
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:43,200
we need to be able to engage and share

41
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,320
knowledge opinions efforts

42
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,840
so that we can better understand

43
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,479
and be better prepared for cyber risk

44
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:52,920
management

45
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,960
it's what I would like to call our

46
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,180
collective intelligence

47
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:59,040
so today

48
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,320
we are going to build up our collective

49
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,960
intelligence around the topic of cyber

50
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,079
insurance

51
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:09,119
so not too long ago I was at a dinner

52
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:11,879
party on a Friday night great times

53
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:14,840
surrounded by new friends

54
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:17,220
and friends that I've known for a few

55
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,640
decades

56
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,900
just before dessert

57
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:24,959
I heard my name and allowed gasp across

58
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:26,700
the dinner table something probably

59
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:28,319
don't want to hear

60
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:32,000
Monica Works in cyber insurance

61
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:35,520
now I really wish I had the Epiphany to

62
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,200
say no no really I don't work in

63
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,120
insurance I'm a piano player at a jazz

64
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,300
bar or a professional dessert taster

65
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,459
because I love dessert

66
00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:48,420
but alas I had to respond and say I am

67
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:52,319
an underwriter a taker of risk

68
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:55,200
I've spent the last 12 years working

69
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,540
alongside different Professionals in the

70
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:59,459
insurance industry

71
00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:01,140
I've seen how insurance companies

72
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:04,080
evaluate and assume risk I've seen how

73
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,879
Brokers influence the Cyber Insurance

74
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:07,800
Marketplace

75
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,180
and I've also seen how many

76
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:10,680
organizations still struggle with

77
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:14,000
understanding cyber risk management

78
00:03:14,099 --> 00:03:15,659
so today

79
00:03:15,659 --> 00:03:17,819
it's my pleasure to be your Sherpa of

80
00:03:17,819 --> 00:03:21,000
insurance and take you or guide you on a

81
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,620
journey about what is insurance

82
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,000
so we will start off by understanding

83
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,400
what is Insurance what is cyber

84
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,599
insurance

85
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:34,019
how do insurance companies operate how

86
00:03:34,019 --> 00:03:36,920
do they risk manage

87
00:03:37,379 --> 00:03:41,000
and why does it all matter

88
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:48,299
so risk does come from not knowing what

89
00:03:48,299 --> 00:03:51,480
you're doing and insurance is there

90
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:54,599
to protect you from the inevitable from

91
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:56,760
from when life decides to throw you a

92
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:59,120
curveball

93
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:02,280
you put a little bit of money aside each

94
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,739
month or year and the insurance company

95
00:04:04,739 --> 00:04:08,420
promises to pay you back

96
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:12,180
it's really an instrument that you use

97
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:15,060
when you're trying to explore or you're

98
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:16,918
experimenting with something

99
00:04:16,918 --> 00:04:18,660
and that's because you really don't know

100
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:19,978
what you're doing

101
00:04:19,978 --> 00:04:22,860
in the process of innovation you need a

102
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:25,080
partner in crime to have your back when

103
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,419
something goes wrong

104
00:04:27,419 --> 00:04:29,759
but then insurance is also there to

105
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:31,740
protect you from yourself when you think

106
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:33,900
you know too much and you are too

107
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,880
certain about something

108
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,919
because there is always going to be the

109
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:40,440
unexpected the things that can go wrong

110
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:44,600
without you even anticipating

111
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:49,320
so the story of insurance dates back to

112
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,419
ancient civilization in Greece and

113
00:04:51,419 --> 00:04:52,800
Babylon

114
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,960
where people understood this very

115
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,020
concept of protecting one another from a

116
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:59,280
bad day

117
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,220
and they invested in putting money aside

118
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:06,180
when a family death happened or sickness

119
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:10,320
and then in the 14th century in Genoa

120
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,660
a place in Italy

121
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:15,720
the first insurance contract was drafted

122
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:18,180
and it didn't really look like an

123
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:20,460
insurance contract that you see today it

124
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:22,680
was more like a loan

125
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:25,139
so let's pretend you're the ship owner

126
00:05:25,139 --> 00:05:28,080
and I am the bank you borrow money from

127
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:28,860
me

128
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:31,919
to cover the cost of your voyage

129
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:34,560
and then in return I will ask for the

130
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,900
ship to secure the loan

131
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:39,660
if the ship is damaged or lost

132
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:40,500
Etsy

133
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:43,080
you don't need to pay me back

134
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,780
sounds like a pretty good deal right

135
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:48,419
well I get a higher interest rate in

136
00:05:48,419 --> 00:05:50,759
return for giving you the privilege of

137
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:52,560
not returning the ship

138
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,240
so it doesn't really sound like the

139
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,500
banks were getting a really good deal

140
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:56,880
does it

141
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,100
so they decided to separate these

142
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:03,199
insurance contracts from the loan itself

143
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:08,280
fast forward a few centuries

144
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,979
we have the rise of cyber Insurance in

145
00:06:10,979 --> 00:06:12,780
the 1990s

146
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:15,780
it was really off the back of the

147
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:17,880
Millennium where we saw introduction of

148
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,979
data and Technology

149
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:23,039
that cyber insurance policies became a

150
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:24,240
thing

151
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,000
the name cyber Insurance in fact

152
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,720
is has a nice story behind it because we

153
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,400
have to thank somebody in the AIG

154
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,139
marketing machine

155
00:06:34,139 --> 00:06:35,819
for that name

156
00:06:35,819 --> 00:06:39,479
it's a pretty sexy way but confusing way

157
00:06:39,479 --> 00:06:42,000
of naming internet liability or

158
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,160
information security policies

159
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,919
but alas it really did sell more

160
00:06:46,919 --> 00:06:48,600
insurance

161
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:51,240
one of my favorite things is about the

162
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,919
Cyber Insurance name is that I think

163
00:06:52,919 --> 00:06:55,080
secretly at AIG somebody was a William

164
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,780
Gibson fan the gentleman who coined the

165
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:59,699
term cyberspace

166
00:06:59,699 --> 00:07:01,979
and uh

167
00:07:01,979 --> 00:07:04,740
one of his quotes was that when he

168
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:07,979
looked at this term cyberspace

169
00:07:07,979 --> 00:07:09,440
he said

170
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:12,000
it meant something or it might mean

171
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,080
something

172
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,960
but as I stared at it my whole Delight

173
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:18,900
is that it meant nothing

174
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:21,720
well cyber Insurance certainly means

175
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,220
something today

176
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:25,560
and it was not always the case because

177
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:28,139
in the first decade of cyber insurance

178
00:07:28,139 --> 00:07:30,840
no organization really was interested in

179
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:33,120
purchasing it and that's because they

180
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,560
thought it was only going to be

181
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,240
technology companies that have to deal

182
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,120
with cyber risk or it's only really if a

183
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,000
contract required it

184
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,880
but from 2014 onwards the Cyber

185
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,500
Insurance Market started to develop

186
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,819
pretty quickly

187
00:07:47,819 --> 00:07:50,099
and that was to do with more privacy

188
00:07:50,099 --> 00:07:52,800
regulations being implemented but also

189
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,660
we saw some of the first cyber losses

190
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:57,259
occurring

191
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:59,900
Lloyd's of London during that time

192
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:03,539
introduced a mutation of coverage called

193
00:08:03,539 --> 00:08:05,880
first party coverage or what you will

194
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,860
know as your own costs and expenses

195
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:09,180
being covered

196
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:11,039
prior to Lloyds of London introducing

197
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:12,599
this you had only third party

198
00:08:12,599 --> 00:08:14,880
liabilities covered and we will learn

199
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,919
more about these Concepts in the next

200
00:08:16,919 --> 00:08:18,780
few slides

201
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:20,940
but this mutation of coverage really

202
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:23,039
changed the game in terms of how loss is

203
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,240
developed in the Cyber insurance

204
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:28,039
industry and what we see today

205
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:31,379
so let's backtrack to the Genesis of

206
00:08:31,379 --> 00:08:34,320
cyber insurance and please bear with me

207
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,120
as we go through this fabulous Insurance

208
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,740
treat

209
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:42,299
you have two type of Insurance life

210
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:45,420
insurance and non-life insurance

211
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:47,370
now life insurance is

212
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:48,480
[Music]

213
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,880
pretty easy I would say but quite morbid

214
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,760
it pays if you die

215
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,980
non-life Insurance however is a bit more

216
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:58,980
complex but basically it protects your

217
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:01,140
physical possessions or your

218
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:04,279
non-physical possessions

219
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,140
non-life insurance is then split again

220
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:08,399
into two

221
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:10,200
Casualty Insurance

222
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,660
and property insurance

223
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:15,600
now Casualty Insurance is there to

224
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,760
protect you from claims from third

225
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:21,360
parties because you've had an injury to

226
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,180
another person or an injury to their

227
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:26,160
property

228
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,839
these are what we call third-party

229
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:29,940
liabilities

230
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:32,580
property insurance is there to cover

231
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:34,860
your loss of property or damage to your

232
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:37,560
property so this is called first party

233
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:40,140
your own costs and expenses so this

234
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:41,700
could be your home your personal

235
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:44,360
belongings

236
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,420
to go deeper down the rabbit hole

237
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:50,940
casualty is split into three

238
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:53,640
you have specialty insurance

239
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,920
general liability insurance

240
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,160
and auto insurance

241
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,019
in the category of specialty insurance

242
00:10:01,019 --> 00:10:03,540
you have all these wonderful products

243
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:06,540
that you can see above me

244
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:10,560
one of which is cyber insurance

245
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,540
now all of these products that you can

246
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:14,820
see up there

247
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:17,040
including directors and officers

248
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,940
insurance dno or crime insurance

249
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:24,120
all work together to cover losses

250
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:27,240
arising from a cyber event

251
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,820
so this name cyber Insurance in fact

252
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:32,459
does not cover all the other insurance

253
00:10:32,459 --> 00:10:34,680
products that are actually needed to

254
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:37,440
cover you from a cyber event

255
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,080
in fact if you want to get coverage for

256
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,839
property damage or bodily injury you

257
00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:46,440
need to purchase property insurance or

258
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,660
general liability insurance

259
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:51,540
and that's because at the moment the

260
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:53,760
Cyber Insurance Market is not developed

261
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,800
enough from a capital perspective to

262
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:58,079
really cover the exposures that a bodily

263
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:01,440
injury claim can give or a property

264
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,540
damage loss

265
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:06,360
so you may be wondering

266
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,760
how big is the Cyber Insurance market

267
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:11,060
then

268
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,820
well

269
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:17,519
here are some estimates

270
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:20,100
these numbers represent the gross

271
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:22,380
written premiums so the amount of money

272
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:25,380
collected by the insurance industry as a

273
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:28,380
whole and then it narrows it down to the

274
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:31,279
Cyber Insurance Market

275
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:34,019
as you can see

276
00:11:34,019 --> 00:11:36,420
seven trillion of insurance in terms of

277
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:39,300
gwp growth written premium

278
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:42,360
is much much bigger than the 10 billion

279
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,160
that the Cyber Insurance Market

280
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,540
currently has in play

281
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:51,420
now why is this the case

282
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:53,339
well

283
00:11:53,339 --> 00:11:55,320
the Cyber Insurance Market has gone

284
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,000
through a growth spurt in the last few

285
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,540
years and to give you some context about

286
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:03,000
five years ago the market was half the

287
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,040
size it is today

288
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,500
in five years from now the market is

289
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:11,100
estimated to double to 20 billion

290
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:14,339
but this ambitious growth spurt is

291
00:12:14,339 --> 00:12:17,040
pretty unique because the insurance or

292
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,620
cyber insurance is not mandated or

293
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:22,079
regulated yet

294
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:25,380
so take Auto liability for example

295
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:27,680
you have a 400 billion dollar market

296
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,019
because drivers are required to purchase

297
00:12:31,019 --> 00:12:35,100
insurance to be legally allowed to drive

298
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:37,380
and then you have directors and officers

299
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:39,540
insurance which is not represented up

300
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:41,640
there but to give you a context because

301
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,860
it is one of the most favorite types of

302
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:45,720
specialty Insurance being bought because

303
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,880
it protects individual officers and

304
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:50,220
directors from their liabilities

305
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:52,500
that's 20 billion

306
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,480
in today's terms

307
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,459
but the origins of the dno insurance

308
00:12:56,459 --> 00:12:59,279
product was from the 1930s

309
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:02,760
and during the 1960s and 70s that's when

310
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:05,339
you saw the biggest increase in dno

311
00:13:05,339 --> 00:13:09,260
insurance so that's about 60 years ago

312
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:15,420
so how do insurance companies operate

313
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:18,680
how do they make money

314
00:13:19,079 --> 00:13:21,300
for this I would like to introduce you

315
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:24,660
to our Motley Crew of characters

316
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:28,320
first up we have the policyholder

317
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,800
this is the main star the star of our

318
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,120
show today

319
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,980
the reason for this is that it's

320
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,899
actually a combination of characters

321
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:39,779
that make up the policy holder it's all

322
00:13:39,779 --> 00:13:40,800
of you

323
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,920
trying to risk manage cyber every single

324
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,440
day and so it's either

325
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,180
that you benefit from cyber insurance

326
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:50,399
coverage or that you help

327
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:53,940
procure the information to place it

328
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:56,100
the policyholder is also known as the

329
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:58,920
first party because they are the most

330
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,720
important party to the contract of

331
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,940
insurance

332
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:05,399
then we have the brokers

333
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:08,420
these Troopers ensure that everything

334
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:10,440
runs smoothly

335
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:13,500
they're like the operations managers the

336
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:16,079
information ambassadors they run back

337
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:17,940
and forth from the insurance company to

338
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,980
the policyholder to try to transmit

339
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:22,680
information and get the best deal

340
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:26,100
they can either clarify things or they

341
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:28,500
can add to the confusion of what is

342
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:31,200
cyber risk management

343
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,420
the insurance company

344
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:37,200
is really where the magic happens these

345
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:40,019
are the underwriters

346
00:14:40,019 --> 00:14:41,940
the insurance company is considered to

347
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:44,940
be the second party to the contract

348
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:47,040
now you may wonder who was the third

349
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,980
party then we did cover it briefly to

350
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:52,620
say that a third party could be a

351
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:54,540
shareholder a customer or any other

352
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:57,000
third party that can claim against the

353
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,779
policy holder

354
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:02,880
and then we have The Regulators who are

355
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,399
a very important player

356
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:07,260
but we consider them to be background

357
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:09,180
cast at most times

358
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:11,160
and that's because they're there to keep

359
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,019
an eye on things

360
00:15:13,019 --> 00:15:15,720
to make sure that if there are any

361
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,339
standards or guidance that needs to be

362
00:15:17,339 --> 00:15:20,399
provided they're there to help

363
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:23,940
and then last but certainly not least we

364
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:26,820
have the reinsurance companies the

365
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:28,079
reinsurers

366
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:31,139
these are the Batmans who are Superman's

367
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:33,180
they are the Bruce Wayne money

368
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:36,600
if something bad happens if there's many

369
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:39,420
different losses if there is risky

370
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:41,220
business being taken on by insurance

371
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:42,480
companies

372
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:46,639
they step in and Save the Day

373
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:52,220
so how do insurance companies make money

374
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:53,880
well

375
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:56,480
in three simple steps

376
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,139
they

377
00:15:58,139 --> 00:16:01,920
number one they accept premiums

378
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:05,100
they accept premiums

379
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:07,500
because they accept the risk that goes

380
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:10,339
along with it

381
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,899
once they accept the premiums they're

382
00:16:12,899 --> 00:16:14,760
able to invest them

383
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:18,000
and that is a secondary source of income

384
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,820
what we call the investment income

385
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:23,040
so between the time that you pay your

386
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,839
premium for your insurance policy and

387
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:26,940
the time that you go and claim against

388
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:29,519
it that amount of money needs to be put

389
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:30,480
to work

390
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,240
and I'll explain why

391
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:35,820
so it's really what we call the float

392
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:39,120
the time between you pay the money and

393
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:42,540
you claim against the policy

394
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:45,000
and step number three is that they have

395
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,800
to pay out losses

396
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,300
and they also have to pay their own

397
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:50,639
expenses

398
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:53,160
these expenses could be of course

399
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,540
salaries

400
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:57,480
but there's also Brokers commissions

401
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,699
there's reinsurance costs

402
00:16:59,699 --> 00:17:03,800
and of course all the travel expenses

403
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:07,319
in a good year you make a net profit or

404
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:08,699
a margin

405
00:17:08,699 --> 00:17:11,520
what that means is that you have more

406
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,679
premiums collected than the amount of

407
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:15,540
losses or expenses that you have to pay

408
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:17,099
out

409
00:17:17,099 --> 00:17:19,980
that is an underwriting profit

410
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:23,699
if you don't have enough premiums and

411
00:17:23,699 --> 00:17:25,679
therefore you have more losses and

412
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:27,839
expenses to pay for you're making an

413
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:29,940
underwriting loss

414
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:33,000
but it could still be a good day if your

415
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,860
investment income is greater than your

416
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:37,140
underwriting loss

417
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:40,520
and that's what you would hope for

418
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:45,000
now for the million dollar question

419
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,780
how do insurance companies price risk

420
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:51,000
how do they know how much to charge me

421
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,020
for my cyber insurance premium

422
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:56,580
I wish we could play Who Wants To Be A

423
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:58,320
Millionaire and pick some of these

424
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,539
answers

425
00:17:59,539 --> 00:18:01,440
but

426
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,539
most of you may actually be thinking

427
00:18:03,539 --> 00:18:05,400
that it's a crystal ball

428
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,440
or that there's some sort of magic that

429
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,360
happens behind the scenes and I really

430
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,460
wish that it was like that it would seem

431
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:12,900
more fun

432
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:16,860
but what really happens is that you look

433
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:22,080
at a prediction of future cost of losses

434
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:25,320
and you use statistical analysis based

435
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:28,320
on past loss experience

436
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:31,200
you use the underwriter's knowledge

437
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,299
about what risk they're taking why

438
00:18:33,299 --> 00:18:36,299
they're taking them and the actuaries

439
00:18:36,299 --> 00:18:39,539
knowledge the Actuarial analysis now

440
00:18:39,539 --> 00:18:41,220
actuaries if you haven't heard about

441
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:44,220
them before they're like mathematicians

442
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:47,580
the Wizards of the insurance companies

443
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:49,679
they help price things and they help

444
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:52,200
anticipate and manage claims

445
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:55,080
and the way they do that is they look at

446
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:58,679
two types of analysis they look at pure

447
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:00,960
premium costing

448
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:04,080
and they look at loss ratio basis

449
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,700
costing

450
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:08,039
sounds like pretty esotherical Concepts

451
00:19:08,039 --> 00:19:10,980
but pure premium is the cost that you

452
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:13,679
have to charge per unit of exposure

453
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:16,080
an exposure is the information that you

454
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,820
get by having conversations with the

455
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:20,580
policy holder about

456
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:23,220
how many assets do you have

457
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:25,740
where do you operate what sort of

458
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:29,039
revenues do you generate at those assets

459
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:31,919
the other methodology that actuaries use

460
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:34,039
called loss ratio basis

461
00:19:34,039 --> 00:19:38,160
is a base rate that changes with the

462
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:41,100
amount of exposure that you take on

463
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:44,039
sounds simple right

464
00:19:44,039 --> 00:19:46,440
well cyber insurance

465
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,840
takes both of these Concepts and blends

466
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:51,960
them together to come up with pricing

467
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:54,900
if you start a new insurance line you

468
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:56,820
may not have the luxury of using these

469
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:58,080
methodologies

470
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,240
so what you end up doing is you actually

471
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,940
pull together risks based on common

472
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:06,419
standards and conditions and then you

473
00:20:06,419 --> 00:20:09,539
see what happens you adjust your limits

474
00:20:09,539 --> 00:20:11,940
your retentions your deductibles as you

475
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:14,460
may want to call them to be able to see

476
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:17,780
what your profitability is like

477
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:22,620
so if pricing does sound like an art

478
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:24,720
it's partially an art

479
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,400
but the science tells us something

480
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,760
different

481
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:31,879
the numbers say

482
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:35,640
that the rate changes that most

483
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:38,780
that occurred most recently from

484
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:42,240
2019 onto 2021

485
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,340
were really necessary to correct the

486
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:45,660
profitability of the Cyber Insurance

487
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:47,520
Market

488
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,980
so what you see here is almost

489
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:52,919
immaterial changes before 2020 in

490
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:54,840
respect of the rate changes in the Cyber

491
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:57,179
insurance industry and in some cases you

492
00:20:57,179 --> 00:20:59,580
saw reductions

493
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:03,120
but suddenly you saw a nine percent rate

494
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,919
change

495
00:21:04,919 --> 00:21:08,340
that led to an 18 rate change and then

496
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:10,860
70 and above

497
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:12,480
bear in mind that these numbers are

498
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,340
averages so some books of business

499
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:16,740
actually saw greater than 70 rate

500
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:18,299
changes

501
00:21:18,299 --> 00:21:22,799
and some folks of business so much less

502
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:24,720
but the reason why I'm showing you this

503
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:27,780
is that it's important to understand how

504
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:30,840
sudden price changes could occur

505
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,700
in a market that is certainly still

506
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:35,240
maturing

507
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,440
but let's dig deeper into the loss

508
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,960
ratios because we saw the pure premium

509
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:43,260
and then the loss ratio basis

510
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:46,260
if we zoom out we realize that actually

511
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:49,980
the most impact on profitability comes

512
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:52,440
from improved underwriting or risk

513
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:55,200
selection criteria

514
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,539
when Underwriters were trying to correct

515
00:21:57,539 --> 00:21:59,580
their decisions that they made prior to

516
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:01,679
2018 on what type of risk they were

517
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:03,000
selecting

518
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,799
they introduce more rigorous

519
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:06,900
underwriting around cyber security

520
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:08,580
controls

521
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:10,140
and that had

522
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:12,419
the most impact

523
00:22:12,419 --> 00:22:15,120
but it also meant that one in four

524
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,980
clients

525
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:19,919
did not renew their policy

526
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:23,280
or simply were denied coverage

527
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,620
and that's not really bad news it just

528
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:28,500
means that there was a lot of clearing

529
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:32,179
up of risk that needed to happen

530
00:22:33,419 --> 00:22:37,260
so if loss ratios are driven by improved

531
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:38,880
underwriting

532
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,520
what happens in risk assessment

533
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:44,460
how do Underwriters

534
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:47,280
price for that exposure

535
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:50,179
well Underwriters look at various

536
00:22:50,179 --> 00:22:52,980
exposure metrics and those are the most

537
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:56,000
important when driving price things like

538
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,679
personal identifiable information let's

539
00:22:58,679 --> 00:23:02,220
say the Quantum of that or the revenues

540
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:06,380
or your geographic location

541
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:09,240
your operations model

542
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:11,220
those are all things that they take into

543
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:12,720
consideration from an exposure

544
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,880
standpoint

545
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,740
and then they dig deeper into the

546
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:19,620
governance of a company

547
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:22,260
who is in charge what sort of budget do

548
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:24,600
you have in place do you have a

549
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,280
dedicated governance for operational

550
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,320
technology or is it just embedded into

551
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,419
your I.T

552
00:23:30,419 --> 00:23:32,520
they want to know who is in charge and

553
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:34,799
who's managing the decision at the end

554
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:37,220
of the day

555
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,480
most importantly they take a look at

556
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:41,159
resilience

557
00:23:41,159 --> 00:23:43,679
and that's conversations around your

558
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:46,140
incident response plan your backup

559
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:48,000
recovery strategy

560
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,919
and how you plan on doing your business

561
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:52,860
impact analysis

562
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:55,080
and one of the areas that never really

563
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:57,360
gets discussed in terms of underwriting

564
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,940
at least publicly is that Underwriters

565
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:01,620
take a look at the character of the

566
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:04,500
organization that they're ensuring

567
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:07,500
so what is your lost history how did you

568
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:08,880
remediate

569
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,919
how often do you engage in conversations

570
00:24:10,919 --> 00:24:12,720
with your insurance company about what

571
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,340
you're doing and how you're doing it

572
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:16,620
giving them context about why you're

573
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:19,820
making the decisions you're making

574
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:27,299
so once the risk assessment is done

575
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:29,340
you will get a price

576
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:32,039
and your broker will have a conversation

577
00:24:32,039 --> 00:24:34,799
with you around what is covered what is

578
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:36,360
not covered

579
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:38,640
and what needs to happen next

580
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:42,720
if you decide to accept the premium

581
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:45,299
you will have

582
00:24:45,299 --> 00:24:48,360
a New Journey to go on but

583
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:50,340
when I say you it's now the insurance

584
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:53,280
company that has to risk manage all the

585
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:56,299
risk that they've accepted

586
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:58,260
so how do they do that

587
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:00,900
well they have to ask some existential

588
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:02,400
questions about the risk that they've

589
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,679
accepted and how cyber risk manifests

590
00:25:04,679 --> 00:25:06,980
itself

591
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:09,299
are there going to be multiple events in

592
00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:11,520
any one year are they going to occur in

593
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:14,700
the same industry in the same geography

594
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:17,640
how big could those losses be

595
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,860
can there be a systemic loss that

596
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:21,600
happens

597
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:25,320
they do have let's say conversations but

598
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:27,299
the more practical area where they spend

599
00:25:27,299 --> 00:25:29,340
a lot of time is the realistic disaster

600
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:30,779
scenarios

601
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:33,240
where they look at how an event can

602
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,100
manifest across

603
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:37,260
the whole industry things like Cloud

604
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:38,640
outages

605
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:43,140
or a large-scale data breach

606
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:46,559
and so when they realize that there's a

607
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:49,500
lot of risk management to do

608
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:51,900
they fall back on two risk management

609
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:54,419
techniques

610
00:25:54,419 --> 00:25:57,539
one of them is reserving

611
00:25:57,539 --> 00:26:01,100
and the other one is reinsurance

612
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:09,679
my my slides have not cooperated but

613
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:15,000
reserving to take it as a first topic

614
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,700
means that you are anticipating or

615
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:20,100
managing the claims

616
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:22,500
so that means that a policyholder will

617
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:24,480
call you up and say I've experienced a

618
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,340
cyber event and therefore I have a loss

619
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:29,279
to report but they have no idea how big

620
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:30,960
that loss is going to be

621
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,460
well it doesn't really matter because

622
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:34,500
the insurance company has to set aside

623
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:37,559
some money to account for it

624
00:26:37,559 --> 00:26:39,900
and then you have the losses that the

625
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:41,340
policyholder does not even know that

626
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:43,980
they have experienced yet

627
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:46,500
in that case the insurance company has

628
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:48,960
to make a best case scenario assumption

629
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,000
and put aside some money for unexpected

630
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,480
losses

631
00:26:56,039 --> 00:26:59,940
next thing you have is reinsurance as a

632
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:02,400
risk management tool and actually this

633
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,260
is the most important

634
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:05,880
part of risk management for most

635
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:08,720
insurance companies

636
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:11,279
reinsurance is there just like

637
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:13,380
insurances for policyholders it's

638
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:14,880
basically insurance for insurance

639
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,799
companies

640
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:20,039
you have to be able to reduce your risk

641
00:27:20,039 --> 00:27:22,320
of mispricing because it's such a

642
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,700
complex

643
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:25,159
feat

644
00:27:25,159 --> 00:27:28,740
and also it has to reduce your risk of

645
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:31,080
under reserving because it's never a

646
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:33,240
perfect science

647
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:37,020
and reinsures generally have been there

648
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:39,659
to support the insurance Market but in

649
00:27:39,659 --> 00:27:41,460
the last couple of years

650
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:44,940
they've experienced some unusual loss

651
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:46,860
years

652
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:50,340
you've had a doubling of losses

653
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:53,700
over the course of five year period

654
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:56,880
from something like 45 billion to about

655
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,440
a hundred billion

656
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:01,860
and then in 2022 we've seen about 130

657
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:04,380
billion of losses in the reinsurance

658
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:05,760
industry

659
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,100
now this is on the backdrop of the

660
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:10,799
market now only having about 260 billion

661
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:13,679
of capital to share

662
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:16,200
so why is this a big problem

663
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,000
or at least a challenge for the Cyber

664
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,700
Insurance Market well if there is a

665
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:22,580
capital crunch in the reinsurance market

666
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:26,640
there is less ability to spread the risk

667
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,860
investors are also choosing to put their

668
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:30,840
money somewhere else and not in the

669
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:32,760
reinsurance market

670
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:34,740
the reinsurance market is the only

671
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:37,380
reason why insurance companies can take

672
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:40,260
on systemic risks for now

673
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:42,059
and through the realistic disaster

674
00:28:42,059 --> 00:28:44,400
scenarios that you plan

675
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,140
you may find out that there's things

676
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:47,820
that cannot be covered because there's

677
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:49,679
not enough capital in the market things

678
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:51,419
like cyber War

679
00:28:51,419 --> 00:28:52,559
and we can have a whole other

680
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:55,140
presentation on the controversy around

681
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:57,840
those policy limitations

682
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:00,480
but the idea behind it is that there are

683
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:03,000
uninsurable risks out there considering

684
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,480
the size of the insurance market and the

685
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,279
reinsurance market

686
00:29:08,279 --> 00:29:10,080
so when there isn't enough capital in

687
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,480
the reinsurance market it stifles the

688
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:15,539
growth of the Cyber Insurance Market

689
00:29:15,539 --> 00:29:18,059
most organizations are looking for quite

690
00:29:18,059 --> 00:29:19,919
a significant amount of capital when

691
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:22,380
you're looking at the values that are at

692
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:24,659
risk or things that you want insured and

693
00:29:24,659 --> 00:29:26,520
when I say significant I mean hundreds

694
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:29,820
of millions versus or sometimes billions

695
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:31,919
versus what the insurance company can

696
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:34,620
offer on a one individual risk

697
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:36,899
most insurance companies have about 25

698
00:29:36,899 --> 00:29:40,440
million maximum to offer on any one risk

699
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:43,440
and organizations want a hundred plus

700
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,659
million from that insurance company and

701
00:29:45,659 --> 00:29:47,340
the only way to get there is to have

702
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:50,340
more capital in the reinsurance market

703
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:52,440
so that you have a way to spread the

704
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:53,340
risk

705
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:55,500
but how do you then attract Capital to

706
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:57,600
the reinsurance market

707
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:02,418
well you need to be able to simplify

708
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:07,260
you need to be able to simplify

709
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:10,100
the coverages

710
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:12,179
these are some opportunities but I will

711
00:30:12,179 --> 00:30:14,580
focus on two main ones which are

712
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:18,240
coverage and the amount of information

713
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:21,659
so to simplify coverage what we would

714
00:30:21,659 --> 00:30:23,940
like to see in the insurance industry

715
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:26,820
are reasons why you want to buy that

716
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:28,740
specific type of insurance whether

717
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:29,880
you're looking to cover your business

718
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:32,159
Interruption costs or you're looking for

719
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:34,740
ensuring let's say your incident

720
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:37,200
response costs if those insurance

721
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,240
policies are more fit for purpose you

722
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:41,460
don't need to hold capital for things

723
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:43,500
that you don't really need

724
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:45,779
so we can grow the reinsurance market

725
00:30:45,779 --> 00:30:48,120
with more Simplicity around the coverage

726
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:49,440
that we provide

727
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,779
that also gives you more certainty when

728
00:30:51,779 --> 00:30:53,159
you claim something against your

729
00:30:53,159 --> 00:30:55,740
insurance policy if you tend to ensure

730
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:58,919
all everything and anything then you may

731
00:30:58,919 --> 00:31:00,960
get a situation where you weren't clear

732
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,880
on what is actually covered and what is

733
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,440
not covered

734
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:07,559
from an information standpoint

735
00:31:07,559 --> 00:31:10,260
the the reasons why you make the

736
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:13,020
decisions you make around controls and

737
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:14,340
processes

738
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:16,140
needs to get to your insurance company

739
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:18,360
somehow and that's the only way that

740
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:20,460
they can provide you with better

741
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:23,340
premiums better deductibles and better

742
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:25,919
Risk Management Services a lot of the

743
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:28,740
times there is no real challenge back to

744
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:30,720
the insurance companies on why they're

745
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,039
asking the questions that they're asking

746
00:31:32,039 --> 00:31:35,658
or how they should be asking them better

747
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:39,720
now the role of cyber insurance

748
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:41,520
is there

749
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:44,580
to complement all of your plans and risk

750
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:47,840
management and reinforce your resilience

751
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:50,399
it is not there

752
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:54,419
to protect you necessarily it's not

753
00:31:54,419 --> 00:31:56,700
there to replace security

754
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:59,580
it's there as an additional tool

755
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:01,679
and that's one of the biggest myths that

756
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:03,840
we see in the marketplace is when there

757
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:06,120
are no controls in place you still have

758
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:07,980
organizations that come

759
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:10,320
to the insurance market and ask for that

760
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:13,340
risk transfer to happen

761
00:32:15,179 --> 00:32:16,919
so you've come with me on this journey

762
00:32:16,919 --> 00:32:19,799
through the trials and tribulations of

763
00:32:19,799 --> 00:32:21,059
PowerPoint

764
00:32:21,059 --> 00:32:22,679
and

765
00:32:22,679 --> 00:32:25,620
I just wanted to really enforce what is

766
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:27,240
currently happening in the Cyber

767
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:30,120
Insurance Market to give you

768
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:32,580
the ability to anticipate and to respond

769
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:33,659
to this

770
00:32:33,659 --> 00:32:36,419
so prior to 2021

771
00:32:36,419 --> 00:32:39,899
we were on this pink side of the

772
00:32:39,899 --> 00:32:42,659
insurance cycle where rates were Rising

773
00:32:42,659 --> 00:32:45,299
strongly and risk election was top of

774
00:32:45,299 --> 00:32:47,100
mind

775
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:50,640
now as profitability has improved you

776
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,380
have new competition coming to the

777
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:55,860
market or existing players that have

778
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:57,779
seen that they may have an ability to

779
00:32:57,779 --> 00:33:00,059
reduce cost or relax their risk

780
00:33:00,059 --> 00:33:02,340
selection criteria

781
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:05,100
that's never a good sign

782
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:08,159
if the risk reduction was actually

783
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:10,860
palatable and we could point to those

784
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:13,620
controls and processes that led to that

785
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:16,200
risk reducing that would be great

786
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:18,299
but what we're afraid of is that they're

787
00:33:18,299 --> 00:33:20,700
simply just a market Dynamic of more

788
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:21,840
Supply

789
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:24,480
that is pushing down the rates

790
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,820
and so what I would like to ask of all

791
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:29,519
of you is to hold the stakeholders

792
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:31,380
involved in the insurance process

793
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:33,779
accountable to respond to your questions

794
00:33:33,779 --> 00:33:36,419
about why are my insurance premiums

795
00:33:36,419 --> 00:33:38,940
suddenly coming down why did they go up

796
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:40,559
so much last year

797
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:42,720
what sort of controls are having an

798
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,460
impact on those decisions

799
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:47,100
and why are you bringing more coverage

800
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:48,899
into the market when I've not asked for

801
00:33:48,899 --> 00:33:50,159
it

802
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:52,080
and that's because we really don't want

803
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:55,980
to go through the cycle too quickly

804
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:57,960
the truth is that cyber Insurance

805
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:00,720
pricing will be more volatile than your

806
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,760
auto insurance your home insurance any

807
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:04,260
other type of insurance and that's

808
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:06,720
because it is evolving it is adapting

809
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,480
with the losses that we see

810
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,339
but the decisions that people make

811
00:34:11,339 --> 00:34:13,980
around those premiums coming up or down

812
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:15,899
are important for you to understand and

813
00:34:15,899 --> 00:34:17,520
to incorporate into your cyber risk

814
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:19,639
management

815
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:23,879
so cyber

816
00:34:23,879 --> 00:34:26,280
um insurance or cyber risk has many

817
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:29,099
participants as we've talked about today

818
00:34:29,099 --> 00:34:31,020
and they're all sharing their expertise

819
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:34,619
on how to improve and to prepare for an

820
00:34:34,619 --> 00:34:36,800
event

821
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:41,399
what we really need is more conversation

822
00:34:41,399 --> 00:34:43,139
and more dialogue

823
00:34:43,139 --> 00:34:46,199
one of the fundamental features of cyber

824
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:48,300
risk or cyberspace is that it's all in

825
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:49,859
constant contact

826
00:34:49,859 --> 00:34:53,339
and yet we have not really been inspired

827
00:34:53,339 --> 00:34:55,918
by that Constant Contact to develop more

828
00:34:55,918 --> 00:34:58,320
conversation around topics like cyber

829
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,480
insurance

830
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,460
so why shouldn't we

831
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:05,520
keep engaged and keep discussing these

832
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,140
important topics

833
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:09,300
well I'm hoping that today will serve as

834
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:11,640
that impetus to build our collective

835
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:13,280
intelligence around cyber Insurance

836
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:17,160
thank you very much for your time

837
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:20,160
foreign
