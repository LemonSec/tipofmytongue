1
00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:03,179
foreign

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,860
question

3
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:09,240
[Music]

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:11,040
can I use a bomb

5
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:14,160
bill of materials or a series of bombs

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,020
to threat model

7
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:19,619
a system I think we've all heard a lot

8
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:21,779
about software building materials here

9
00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:23,400
at this event in the s-bomb Pavilion

10
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:24,660
there's a bunch of vendors up there

11
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:26,820
talking about this it's been all over

12
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:30,480
the news but what what is a bill of

13
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,739
materials so s-bomb okay describes the

14
00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:36,600
software what are the ingredients in the

15
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:37,640
software

16
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:40,440
helps us identify if it's going to be

17
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,300
dangerous for us but the topic of a bill

18
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:44,219
of materials is much bigger than just

19
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:46,739
s-bombs we've been using bombs for years

20
00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:50,219
in manufacturing we use bombs many times

21
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:52,079
in a site construction projects to

22
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:53,940
identify everything that goes into the

23
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:56,399
site from a hardware standpoint we can

24
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:59,100
use bombs to link objects together we're

25
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,120
going to talk a little bit more about

26
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:01,739
the linkage of these different kinds of

27
00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:04,220
bombs as we as we explore this topic

28
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:07,619
firmware Hardware software and there's a

29
00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:09,320
bunch of value that comes out of this

30
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:11,580
obviously the vulnerability use case is

31
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:13,380
what we hear about the most but we're

32
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:15,119
here to talk about a lot more than just

33
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:17,400
vulnerability abilities

34
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,799
okay so first off I want to talk about

35
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:22,439
system what is the system how do I

36
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:25,500
Define a system so I asked in the Hoover

37
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:28,979
app a question prior to uh prior to this

38
00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:30,299
talk

39
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:32,520
um what is a system how do you define a

40
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:36,000
system is it what the system is

41
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,740
the components all the pieces that go

42
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:39,840
into it is it what a system does is it

43
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,220
the behaviors of the system the network

44
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:43,200
connections the services that it

45
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,000
consumes or is it the value of the

46
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,860
system the business value of the system

47
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:49,259
what I overwhelmingly received a

48
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:50,820
response on from almost everybody

49
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:52,740
probably 60 to 70 percent of the

50
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:55,860
respondents was what the system does

51
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:58,680
however we look at build materials the

52
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,659
way we think of it today is what is the

53
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:03,659
system what goes into it so let's kind

54
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:04,920
of pull on that thread a little bit as

55
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,780
we go through this and talk a little bit

56
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:10,560
more about what a system does okay so

57
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,500
this talk specifically around building

58
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,760
materials Concepts that we're going to

59
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:17,160
explore today are predicated upon the

60
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,840
assumption that we're talking about the

61
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,959
Cyclone DX bill of materials standard

62
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:24,420
now all this stuff started from a

63
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:26,160
software Builder material standpoint but

64
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:30,599
Cyclone DX has blown Way Beyond the use

65
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:32,819
cases of s-bomb I tend to think of it as

66
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:35,700
a system descriptor language because

67
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:38,099
Cyclone DX incorporates things like

68
00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:39,560
Hardware

69
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:42,360
Hardware specifications uh Hardware

70
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:45,360
billing materials fccid radio

71
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,700
identification

72
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:50,519
gtin tags upcs like all this stuff

73
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:53,340
that's kind of typically seen in a

74
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:56,700
hardware specification along with that

75
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:59,099
correlation with the software I describe

76
00:02:59,099 --> 00:03:01,800
Services it describes assembly so maybe

77
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:04,379
I don't have uh visibility into the

78
00:03:04,379 --> 00:03:06,420
unique component but I have an assembly

79
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:08,400
of components it's very common in

80
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,819
manufacturing by an assembly of parts I

81
00:03:11,819 --> 00:03:13,080
don't know all the parts that are in it

82
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,700
but I know that I bought an assembly of

83
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:17,700
parts from upstream and Cyclone index

84
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:20,280
really kind of moved Way Beyond even the

85
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,800
description of this thing uh that

86
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,239
there's we're going to talk about future

87
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:25,860
State we're going to talk about what's

88
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:28,080
coming as well within the Cyclone DX

89
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,000
specification

90
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,140
okay

91
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:33,060
I'm going to talk very briefly about

92
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:34,980
consequences driven cyber-informed

93
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:36,540
engineering many of you may know that

94
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:37,800
I'm a strong advocate of the

95
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,080
cyber-informed engineering approach but

96
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:44,159
I want to laser in on step two of uh CCE

97
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:47,580
uh cie approaches that's really about

98
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:50,280
systems of system mapping and that's

99
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,379
really what we're diving into today is

100
00:03:52,379 --> 00:03:53,659
an understanding of the system

101
00:03:53,659 --> 00:03:55,860
understanding the dependencies the

102
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,780
security defenses all the relationships

103
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:59,940
that make up that system and how does

104
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:02,400
the system function and interoperate so

105
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,500
this winds up being very core to this

106
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:07,319
and it also Maps uh to the digital asset

107
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:10,560
awareness domain or principle of cie as

108
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,459
well

109
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:14,280
okay so here's a generic attack tree

110
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:17,459
right I I have an objective I want to

111
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:19,738
compromise an end system

112
00:04:19,738 --> 00:04:21,839
um again this very generic look at

113
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:24,360
things like tax trees are very useful to

114
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,680
kind of understand alternate attack

115
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,259
paths to get to an end targeted

116
00:04:28,259 --> 00:04:31,139
objective very useful to understand what

117
00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:32,699
is the most likely approach that an

118
00:04:32,699 --> 00:04:34,199
adversary is going to take what's the

119
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:36,240
easiest way there's there's an economics

120
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,120
Factor uh to attacks against our systems

121
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,220
the adversaries aren't going to blow a

122
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:43,800
zero a day if they don't have to if you

123
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,300
have a missing patch if there's a trust

124
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,940
relationship that is in place that can

125
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:49,800
facilitate this attack they're always

126
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,660
going to take the easiest path available

127
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:54,600
to them and you know whether they're

128
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,040
trying to remain undetected or just

129
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,540
trying to get to the end system quickest

130
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:59,100
and easiest that's the path they're

131
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:01,020
going to take all right so how does a

132
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:02,400
bomb help me do this

133
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,699
well first off the concept of a SAS bomb

134
00:05:05,699 --> 00:05:07,800
or a software as a Services bomb and I'm

135
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,199
going to get deeper into the concept of

136
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:12,419
a SAS bomb later but this winds up being

137
00:05:12,419 --> 00:05:16,199
the bomb type that is most useful when

138
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:18,479
we use in-threat modeling like typically

139
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:21,180
when I think about uh a threat modeling

140
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:23,460
exercise I'm identifying all the

141
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:25,259
interaction points how can I interact

142
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:27,419
with the system where where's the

143
00:05:27,419 --> 00:05:29,699
where's the attack surface what is the

144
00:05:29,699 --> 00:05:31,620
exposure how's the attacker going to

145
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:33,440
achieve certain objectives

146
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:36,360
and really interesting things about a

147
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,100
SAS bomb is a SAS bomb a lot of people

148
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:41,520
think that it describes a software as a

149
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,940
service application it doesn't it is not

150
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:47,460
the software stack for your SAS

151
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:49,860
application but what it does describe is

152
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:53,100
Services API endpoints right so how does

153
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:55,080
traffic move back and forth well that

154
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,580
also lets us do things like establish

155
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:59,400
and Define a trust relationship so if

156
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,960
the jump post is the only way to get

157
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,660
past the firewall into my system a SAS

158
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:06,060
bomb can help me understand that

159
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:08,280
well then I also want to end my attack

160
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:12,479
flow okay I understand I have a path to

161
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,820
get to my end system well how do I

162
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:16,919
compromise the targets along that path

163
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:19,500
the s-bomb as we all know very good at

164
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,180
identifying vulnerabilities that can

165
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:23,460
help us understand where we have an

166
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:27,060
issue with uh you know a dependency or a

167
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:29,180
component that has a known vulnerability

168
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:31,500
and we can pull on that thread to

169
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,419
understand okay how do I you know how do

170
00:06:33,419 --> 00:06:35,039
I compromise this jump post and

171
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:38,039
ultimately get to my target

172
00:06:38,039 --> 00:06:41,100
and for a non for a non-digital based

173
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,440
attack we can use this approach for

174
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,199
physical attacks as well so if I have an

175
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:48,360
end system uh that has physical

176
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,520
characteristics a lock that can be

177
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,380
bypassed if I can achieve my objective

178
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:55,020
by going to go break into the substation

179
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:58,199
and bypass the lock and knock out the

180
00:06:58,199 --> 00:06:59,400
piece of Hardware that's ultimately

181
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,720
going to cause the consequence that I'm

182
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,240
trying to accomplish then maybe the

183
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,979
h-bomb gives me the visibility to know

184
00:07:04,979 --> 00:07:06,780
hey I know that I have a defect in this

185
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:08,340
particular locking mechanism that's very

186
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:10,319
easy for an adversary to bypass

187
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:12,539
forget all this digital stuff

188
00:07:12,539 --> 00:07:14,580
I'm going to go the old school route

189
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:16,199
and I'm going to go attack things

190
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:18,539
physically so the bomb has given me a

191
00:07:18,539 --> 00:07:20,599
lot of visibility into understanding

192
00:07:20,599 --> 00:07:24,479
what can I do to achieve my end State

193
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:25,620
objective

194
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:28,380
so again software Bill and materials

195
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:30,240
here's an example of a software bill of

196
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,520
materials these are all Json

197
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,560
representations of software building

198
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,319
materials information uh I think a lot

199
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:38,460
of us have seen some of this information

200
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:39,960
there's a bunch of great tools out there

201
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:42,360
both commercial and open source

202
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,520
capabilities

203
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,319
to capture information about a software

204
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:47,580
bill of materials there's a lot of

205
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:48,840
really good data Beyond just the

206
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:51,180
vulnerability we can get hashes and

207
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:52,620
other information that can be used to

208
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:54,900
map to indicators of compromise I may

209
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:56,220
take a hash of a component and look it

210
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:58,259
up in a malware database and say oh wow

211
00:07:58,259 --> 00:08:00,419
you know I don't need a compromise this

212
00:08:00,419 --> 00:08:03,380
thing my software is already compromised

213
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:05,960
along with other trust characteristics

214
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:08,160
and once we start stitching this

215
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,599
together with these other bomb types it

216
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:12,900
gets really really interesting okay uh

217
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:15,120
the uh from a horror bill of materials

218
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,979
as well as I as I mentioned earlier

219
00:08:16,979 --> 00:08:19,500
here's an example of a hardware billing

220
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,599
materials as defined in the Cyclone DX

221
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:23,400
specification

222
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,240
um

223
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,000
on its own if we're just looking at the

224
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,620
hardware it's very interesting and we

225
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:29,400
can look at some physical

226
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,139
characteristics of it there's some other

227
00:08:31,139 --> 00:08:32,580
interesting things that we can do here

228
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:34,620
with like an FCC ID I can go look up an

229
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:37,200
fccid on the FCC website that comes from

230
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,059
from a hardware bill of materials and I

231
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:40,919
can start to identify through a

232
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:44,099
documentation based exercise some of the

233
00:08:44,099 --> 00:08:46,440
likely characteristics to carry out I

234
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,519
can get things like frequency

235
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:49,380
information that I might use with like

236
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:51,720
an SDR style attack if I'm looking to

237
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:54,240
attack the system again I haven't even

238
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,860
I'm not even talking about the software

239
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:57,360
I just got some information about the

240
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,700
hardware that I can use to facilitate an

241
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,800
attack with some other research in open

242
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,880
source intelligence mechanisms

243
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,800
the SAS bomb as I mentioned

244
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:08,640
um

245
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:09,720
service

246
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,360
apis

247
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:15,540
we can Define any endpoint in a SAS bomb

248
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:17,940
well any endpoint that has a

249
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:20,399
socket-based connection right so it's a

250
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:22,560
little more challenging to model things

251
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,940
like serial based connections and things

252
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:25,860
like that but if it's running an IP it's

253
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:27,899
pretty easy to Define that in a SAS bomb

254
00:09:27,899 --> 00:09:29,580
the thing that gets really interesting

255
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:31,620
and and I kind of neglected the server

256
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:33,000
when I talked about the definition of a

257
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,140
system the one thing that was probably

258
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:35,760
missing in my definition of a system is

259
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,640
data right data is important but this

260
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:42,360
but this actually helps us identify the

261
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:45,360
directionality of a data flow is it you

262
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,680
know as we start talking about like

263
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:49,260
unidirectional gateways and and how

264
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:51,240
traffic moves across the network what

265
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,980
traffic is moving across the network is

266
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:55,200
it Telemetry data is it pii is it

267
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,300
something else that's interesting to an

268
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,339
attacker right all that can be defined

269
00:09:59,339 --> 00:10:00,899
here in this model we can look at

270
00:10:00,899 --> 00:10:03,620
authentication we can look at encryption

271
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:06,720
all these attributes of how all are

272
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,399
different pieces of software are

273
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:09,720
connected together

274
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:13,080
can be defined in a software as a

275
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,300
service bill of materials

276
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:16,860
okay

277
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:19,860
one area that is really interesting and

278
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:21,540
I think uh you know the Advent of

279
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:24,620
chapter gbt and Ai and all these things

280
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:28,380
we start thinking about well how does

281
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:30,480
this change our world and how does the

282
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,820
introduction of logic

283
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:35,220
uh contribute to the definition of

284
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:37,620
behavior right so one of the things that

285
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:39,959
is coming it is not here yet I believe

286
00:10:39,959 --> 00:10:42,300
it is coming uh probably in the next few

287
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:45,180
months from the Cyclone DX team is a

288
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:48,420
concept of an ml bomb not a logic bomb

289
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:50,160
like things are gonna bad things are

290
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,320
gonna happen but more the concept of

291
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,019
machine learning logic understanding and

292
00:10:55,019 --> 00:10:57,300
how those decisions are made and what

293
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:59,880
kinds of models are in place inside your

294
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:02,579
software that can give a lot more depth

295
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:04,860
to the understanding of how our software

296
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:06,720
works the other thing that I think is

297
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,160
really really interesting and we haven't

298
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,320
really pulled on this thread yet but can

299
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,180
we also look at things like the logic in

300
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:15,120
a POC to give us some indications of

301
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,579
what is the system Behavior going to

302
00:11:17,579 --> 00:11:18,740
look like

303
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:21,839
as we go uh you know and explore the

304
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:24,540
logic represented representative in a

305
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:25,380
system

306
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:27,680
okay we have some other opportunities

307
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:31,200
IBM recently released a thing called a

308
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,660
c-bomb now all these bombs get really

309
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,459
really confusing from the acronyms

310
00:11:35,459 --> 00:11:37,260
because at one point in time c-bomb

311
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:41,100
meant a cyber bomb which is cyber bomb

312
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,140
at one point meant

313
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:45,720
that it was a h bombing s bomb put

314
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:48,720
together that was a that was a c-bomb

315
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,240
um uh even when we talk about uh s-bombs

316
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,740
like before people were talking about

317
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:54,180
software building materials people were

318
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:55,920
talking about sales build materials

319
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,959
right so uh it can be a little

320
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:00,000
challenging as these acronyms get thrown

321
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,260
out by the industry understanding what

322
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:03,540
we're talking about so definitely apply

323
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:05,399
some context as you're exploring the

324
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:08,940
conversation uh but the c-bomb as IBM

325
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:10,920
defined it as a cryptographic bomb so

326
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,420
think about

327
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:13,860
um you know Heartbleed and some of the

328
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:16,740
other uh like SSL based attacks like

329
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:18,720
what if we could Define and understand

330
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,500
the implementation of crypto

331
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,420
um as Nest to sell crypto not like

332
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:27,720
blockchain stuff uh on a system as a

333
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:30,480
results and a bomb maybe I don't need

334
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,779
much more detail on the system other

335
00:12:33,779 --> 00:12:37,079
than to just know how which ciphers are

336
00:12:37,079 --> 00:12:39,720
implemented and uh what what's my what's

337
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,279
my vulnerability to to those style

338
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:43,980
attacks that can be very useful from a

339
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:46,860
c-bomb standpoint okay the other areas

340
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:49,260
that are kind of being expanded on um

341
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:51,180
with the Advent of like no Code and low

342
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:53,399
code based applications

343
00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:55,320
um be really nice to be able to identify

344
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,660
what is going into my software it's a

345
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:59,459
black box it's all drag and drop and

346
00:12:59,459 --> 00:13:01,320
pull the things together and I don't

347
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,459
really know what that means like what

348
00:13:02,459 --> 00:13:03,899
components are actually in my software

349
00:13:03,899 --> 00:13:06,720
when I use a you know a bubble or a Xeno

350
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,660
or something like that

351
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:11,700
this is another challenge that is being

352
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:15,180
solved for uh in in the very very near

353
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:17,240
future to start to

354
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:19,260
gain better understanding of these

355
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:22,320
things okay now

356
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,600
that's cool that we have all these bomb

357
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:27,540
types but what do we do with them right

358
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:29,760
like how how do I gain any kind of

359
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,700
aggregate understanding of what's going

360
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:34,560
on with all these bill of materials well

361
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,019
there's a concept and spdx has a concept

362
00:13:37,019 --> 00:13:40,560
of bomb linking as well but uh it does

363
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,720
not include a lot of the other bomb

364
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,000
types that we're talking about spdx is

365
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,180
largely a software bill of materials

366
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:50,700
approach but the concept of a bomb link

367
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:53,100
allows us to create some connective

368
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,600
tissue between these bombs and create

369
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:58,500
relationships between components now uh

370
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:01,200
the the the model and approach in

371
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:04,200
Cyclone DX is in existence today to link

372
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:07,440
these bombs together uh through these

373
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,820
urn

374
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:11,339
um uh addresses uh and creating these

375
00:14:11,339 --> 00:14:13,560
reference models between bomb the bomb

376
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:16,680
uh it's also very useful to link bombs

377
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:19,740
to other artifacts so I may have an

378
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:21,600
artifact from my build system that I

379
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,399
want to link with my s-bomb as well not

380
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:25,980
everything is about bombs right so I may

381
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:28,860
have a build artifact that says hey the

382
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:31,079
build system that was used to compile my

383
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:33,300
code was

384
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:35,700
done so on an image that was staked

385
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:38,339
right so I have a good configuration

386
00:14:38,339 --> 00:14:41,699
management information that is uh useful

387
00:14:41,699 --> 00:14:43,320
to be able to understand the security

388
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,839
environment that my my code was was

389
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:48,540
built on and we can also have other

390
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:50,820
supply chain artifacts everything in the

391
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:53,339
pipeline there are other tools in the

392
00:14:53,339 --> 00:14:54,959
industry that are used things like in

393
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:56,519
Toto and there's some good vendors out

394
00:14:56,519 --> 00:14:58,019
there that are looking at these

395
00:14:58,019 --> 00:14:59,880
attestation pipelines to help understand

396
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:02,639
how these things work but part of the

397
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:03,959
challenge

398
00:15:03,959 --> 00:15:06,360
as we do this and we link these bombs

399
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,519
together

400
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,779
sometimes the data gets a little messy

401
00:15:09,779 --> 00:15:11,100
there are some tools out there to do

402
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:13,500
this the Cyclone DX CLI tool will do

403
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,480
this but right now a lot of the

404
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,279
aggregation tools are doing almost like

405
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:19,260
a diff side-by-side comparison of two

406
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:20,100
things

407
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:22,260
uh and if it makes sense as it goes down

408
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:24,060
the tree of all the objects it'll Stitch

409
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:25,620
it together sometimes you'll get

410
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:27,959
duplicates sometimes you'll lose

411
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:30,899
dependencies uh I've seen in recent

412
00:15:30,899 --> 00:15:32,820
versions of some of this tooling does a

413
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:34,620
really good job of aggregating and and

414
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:36,480
deduplicating you know the information

415
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,540
from bomb 1 to bomb two but then we had

416
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:41,880
a dependency tree a dependency graph

417
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:44,100
in both bombs but once we stitched

418
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:45,899
together we lost our dependency mapping

419
00:15:45,899 --> 00:15:48,540
information and that's not ideal we're

420
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:50,399
working on some tooling to solve that

421
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:52,320
problem unfortunately I did not get that

422
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,480
ready in time for this presentation I

423
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,760
was hoping to release that this week but

424
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,860
that that will be forthcoming okay but

425
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:01,019
right now this uh it's this is requiring

426
00:16:01,019 --> 00:16:02,880
some manual analysis to get at this

427
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:03,959
information

428
00:16:03,959 --> 00:16:05,820
uh and last thing I really want to

429
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:08,100
mention is if we're trying to do this

430
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:10,079
work and do some threat modeling in code

431
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:11,940
using all this information obviously

432
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:13,820
aggregating the data is step one

433
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:15,839
processing the information is kind of

434
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:17,699
step two so there's an oauth project

435
00:16:17,699 --> 00:16:20,339
called Pi TM which is a python-based

436
00:16:20,339 --> 00:16:22,199
library to essentially do threat

437
00:16:22,199 --> 00:16:23,940
modeling as code there are other folks

438
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:25,380
that have come up with approaches

439
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:26,959
serious risk is a commercial product

440
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:28,920
that's done this and they've open

441
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:31,500
sourced their open threat model threat

442
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:34,500
modeling document standard that they use

443
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,540
to provide some capabilities here to do

444
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:38,399
threat modeling as code but it's really

445
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,019
interesting when we can take advantage

446
00:16:40,019 --> 00:16:43,019
of other existing capabilities like the

447
00:16:43,019 --> 00:16:46,440
full kpec attack pattern support and

448
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:49,259
pulling in all the cwe information that

449
00:16:49,259 --> 00:16:51,839
is very helpful to us their ongoing

450
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:54,660
efforts in Industry to align cwe closer

451
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:57,079
to the industrial control system space

452
00:16:57,079 --> 00:17:00,120
and start to look at cwes that are more

453
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:03,000
meaningful for all of our industrial

454
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,559
operators out there

455
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:06,000
well the other thing I wanted to mention

456
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
uh Beyond Pi TM and you go download this

457
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,880
off of GitHub or go to oasp and and get

458
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,439
get a hold of this thing and play with

459
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:16,559
it we also have other capabilities

460
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:19,679
things like like graphis which is a DOT

461
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:22,020
language based graphing Library I've

462
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:23,400
used it quite a bit to do lots of

463
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,959
different things and we can create data

464
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:26,160
flow diagrams with it we can create

465
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,439
attack trees with it pretty much any

466
00:17:28,439 --> 00:17:29,700
kind of diagramming that you can think

467
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:31,140
of that might be useful in your threat

468
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:34,679
modeling process can be used here I went

469
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:37,260
through an exercise a few weeks ago just

470
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:39,900
to ask Chad gbt hey Chad gbt can you

471
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:41,640
generate me a threat model for x and

472
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,280
then spit that out in a DOT language

473
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:46,020
kind of model so we could theoretically

474
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:47,640
take all this information about the

475
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,380
bombs and turn that translate that into

476
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:50,940
information that we could ask generative

477
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:53,760
AI systems to then translate that into a

478
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,559
DOT language graph and then translate

479
00:17:55,559 --> 00:17:57,660
that through graphis and get some nice

480
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:01,020
pretty diagrams Okay so

481
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:03,360
I kind of close it up with like another

482
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:06,840
question like wouldn't it be great if we

483
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:10,080
could just get the data to do all this I

484
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,039
mean there's some really cool things

485
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:12,740
that we can do here

486
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:15,660
but our current obstacle right now in

487
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:17,400
Industry let's be clear is where do

488
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,500
these bombs come from how do we get them

489
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:22,260
uh again we have some great vendors here

490
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:23,820
that are trying to solve those problems

491
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:26,039
I think ideally we would like to get

492
00:18:26,039 --> 00:18:28,440
them from the suppliers themselves and

493
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,880
this is going to require that all of you

494
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:33,240
asset owners start communicating these

495
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:35,460
requests to your suppliers start

496
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:37,020
building this into your Contracting

497
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:38,760
language ultimately that's what's going

498
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:42,480
to drive this industry forward and then

499
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,760
obviously in the meantime we have all

500
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,320
these fine folks that are doing reverse

501
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,360
engineering and other techniques to

502
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:51,299
produce bomb information from a hardware

503
00:18:51,299 --> 00:18:53,340
standpoint lots of folks we have people

504
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:54,960
that are doing like Hardware teardowns

505
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,360
we have other software software Security

506
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,400
Solutions out there like the interactive

507
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:02,100
security testing tools that are mining

508
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,900
those API calls inside your application

509
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:05,880
is running so there's lots of ways to

510
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:08,760
get at this information but I I think

511
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,140
we're at a point of maturity in Industry

512
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:12,600
there where we're not quite there yet

513
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,520
but this is where things are headed or

514
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,020
this is my vision of kind of where

515
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:17,520
things are headed so

516
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,790
any questions

517
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:24,990
