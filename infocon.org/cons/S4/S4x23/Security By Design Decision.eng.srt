1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,240
foreign

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:07,919
I have good news for you today

3
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:10,200
there are two kinds of security

4
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,420
decisions

5
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:14,160
and probably you're only paying

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,100
attention to one of them

7
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:20,279
now why is this good news

8
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:22,560
this is good news because it means you

9
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,320
have a huge potential for improvement

10
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:28,260
if you start also paying attention

11
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:32,480
to making security by Design decisions

12
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:35,640
now before we start

13
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:38,100
I would like you to reflect for a moment

14
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:43,379
on your ICS security priorities for 2023

15
00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:44,940
where are you going to spend your

16
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:47,280
security dollars on

17
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,320
what others tools and services you're

18
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:51,860
going to buy

19
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,020
well because unfortunately I can't get

20
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:57,300
the answers from each of you here today

21
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:59,160
Sans took care of that a couple of

22
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:01,260
months ago and they asked approximately

23
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:03,000
the same question

24
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,920
and here are the top three answers they

25
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,159
got

26
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,080
now if you look at those

27
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:16,399
what do they have in common

28
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:21,439
these are all things that help you

29
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:23,580
to see what you have

30
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:25,619
to monitor what's wrong to decide what

31
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:27,840
you do about that that could all be

32
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,540
summarized as security operations

33
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:33,240
decisions right so these are all things

34
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:37,759
that help you to defend your systems

35
00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:40,079
and probably a lot of tools that you're

36
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:41,939
already using also fall into this

37
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:44,360
category

38
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,740
now I'm not saying security operations

39
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,180
decisions are unimportant to the

40
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:50,100
contrary I would even say they are so

41
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:52,320
important they could be called one half

42
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,180
of the yin and yang of security decision

43
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:56,100
making

44
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:58,200
but there's another half

45
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,860
and this other half is often neglected

46
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:04,619
security design decisions

47
00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:08,459
so why security operations decisions are

48
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:11,280
about defending your system

49
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,200
security design decisions are about

50
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,239
building a system that is defensible in

51
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:17,340
the first place

52
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:19,920
and I will spend all this money we have

53
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,720
all these Advanced tools even to the

54
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,180
point of using AI for making informed

55
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:26,220
security operations decisions

56
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:30,360
for security design decisions we have

57
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:34,160
security controls checklists

58
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:36,360
so

59
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,459
in an ideal word these checklist would

60
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:40,200
be great right so you could just take

61
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,760
any of the checklist take each of the

62
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,179
lists off

63
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:46,200
tick off each of the

64
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,060
each of the controls on the checklist

65
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:50,640
and then you're good

66
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,700
but in reality of course

67
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,620
you have restrictions

68
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:57,480
your budget is limited your time is

69
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,040
limited not everything is technically

70
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,420
feasible

71
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:03,120
so you cannot take just every measure on

72
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,400
the list the real challenge is not to

73
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,200
have a big list of security measures

74
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,420
that you should could take but the real

75
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:10,739
challenge is

76
00:03:10,739 --> 00:03:14,340
to decide which security measures not to

77
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:16,519
take

78
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,140
compare that to security operations

79
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:20,879
and real challenge is not to get a

80
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:22,620
million alerts for everything they could

81
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:24,599
potentially be relevant the real

82
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:27,480
challenge is to decide which incidents

83
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,879
not to react to

84
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:33,480
so this is what tells security control

85
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,280
checklists apart from True security

86
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,000
engineering

87
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:39,840
it is

88
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,239
security engineering helps you to decide

89
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:44,400
which security measures you should not

90
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,799
be taking

91
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:48,959
so you should invest into doing security

92
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:50,400
engineering

93
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,319
not although

94
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:54,239
but because you have a limited security

95
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:56,840
budget

96
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:00,420
now even if you now understand and you

97
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:01,980
say okay let's do some security

98
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:04,319
engineering you probably run into

99
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:07,140
different problems practical problems

100
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:09,659
we've been doing research on

101
00:04:09,659 --> 00:04:12,239
security by design for the last two

102
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:13,739
years and we've got two industry

103
00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:16,380
Partners in years and hemart which is an

104
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:19,019
asset owner and a control and components

105
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:20,459
manufacturer for functional safety

106
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:21,899
components

107
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:23,940
and

108
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:26,520
we've asked them why it is so hard for

109
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,440
them to consider security during the

110
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:31,500
design of the ICS systems

111
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,720
and what they said was

112
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,940
well it's simple

113
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:38,100
our icis Engineers don't have the time

114
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:39,479
and they don't have the security

115
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:40,860
expertise

116
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:42,419
and probably this applies to your

117
00:04:42,419 --> 00:04:45,000
organization as well and also this is

118
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,380
something that we're not going to change

119
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:49,259
anytime soon because we won't turn on

120
00:04:49,259 --> 00:04:51,419
ICS Engineers into full-blown Security

121
00:04:51,419 --> 00:04:53,460
Experts and to be honest I'm not sure we

122
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,560
would even want that

123
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:58,020
so instead what we've done in the last

124
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:59,699
two years about what I want to share

125
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:00,720
with you today

126
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,199
is to create simplifiers for security

127
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:07,139
engineering so a way that enables your

128
00:05:07,139 --> 00:05:10,080
ICS Engineers which have no time and no

129
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,600
security expertise

130
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:15,000
to make well-informed security design

131
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,620
decisions anyway

132
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:20,120
and the resulting decisions

133
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,800
should be such that managers with

134
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,020
limited security budgets are still kept

135
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:25,860
happy

136
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:26,940
right

137
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:29,340
so these are the four simplifiers

138
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:30,900
um and we Dive Right In

139
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:34,940
the first one is called filters

140
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:40,080
filters mean you they help you focus on

141
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,720
what's important and what's matters most

142
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,560
and when we asked our industry partners

143
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,020
what's most important or what what we

144
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:52,020
could do to help them in order to

145
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:54,479
make security engineering doing the

146
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:57,060
design of the ICS easier for them

147
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:59,280
what they said was

148
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,080
tell us what matters

149
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:03,660
tell us where we need to look at

150
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:05,280
because the problem is to understand

151
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,380
that need you need to understand that

152
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:10,139
the ICS Engineering Process even without

153
00:06:10,139 --> 00:06:12,720
security is utterly complex and

154
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,160
interdisciplinary

155
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,800
so ICS Engineers tend to complain that

156
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,240
they're always late to the secure to the

157
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,220
engineering party right when they come

158
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:21,960
come in for the control system

159
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:24,180
Engineering in a plant

160
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:25,979
a lot of decisions have already been

161
00:06:25,979 --> 00:06:28,080
made there was electrical engineering

162
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,240
mechanical engineering maybe functional

163
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,880
safety process engineering you name it

164
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,280
and all these disciplines created a huge

165
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,539
Haystack

166
00:06:36,539 --> 00:06:38,880
of engineering information

167
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,220
and if ICS Engineers are late to the to

168
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:43,139
the engineering party security Engineers

169
00:06:43,139 --> 00:06:45,720
are like super late so when we come in

170
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,639
the big Haystack of engineering

171
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:49,139
information that could potentially be

172
00:06:49,139 --> 00:06:53,240
relevant has become even bigger

173
00:06:53,699 --> 00:06:56,940
so to illustrate that I brought a simple

174
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:59,100
OT network with me today

175
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:01,139
don't need to understand the details but

176
00:07:01,139 --> 00:07:03,000
if you consider that the problem is what

177
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,380
makes things worse is for security

178
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:06,780
potentially anything in there could be

179
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:08,280
relevant because anything could be

180
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:10,259
subject to an attack or be used by an

181
00:07:10,259 --> 00:07:11,460
attacker

182
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:14,039
so it could be some remote printer in

183
00:07:14,039 --> 00:07:16,259
the remote corner of your network it

184
00:07:16,259 --> 00:07:17,400
could be some little configuration

185
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:20,220
detail so what we did is we said okay

186
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:22,740
we introduced a concept called security

187
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:24,780
parameters

188
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:26,580
yes other little wheels that you

189
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:29,220
see here so security parameters are a

190
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:30,539
little wheels that you can adjust

191
00:07:30,539 --> 00:07:32,580
somewhere in your systems and every

192
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:34,500
adjustment has an impact on your

193
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,419
security posture

194
00:07:36,419 --> 00:07:40,800
now these security parameters

195
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,620
make security decisions visible

196
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:45,720
and explicit

197
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:49,319
and then can be very different in nature

198
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:52,380
for example some of them

199
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:54,300
are clearly security so for

200
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:55,919
authentication I probably don't have to

201
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:57,419
tell anyone of you that authentication

202
00:07:57,419 --> 00:07:59,940
is securely related but there are others

203
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:01,919
for example

204
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:05,220
the design of a safety shutdown

205
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:07,259
if that's electronic or mechanical may

206
00:08:07,259 --> 00:08:08,819
not seem security relevant at First

207
00:08:08,819 --> 00:08:11,340
Sight but of course it is because a

208
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:12,960
mechanical shutdown cannot be hacked

209
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,240
remotely at least not that easily

210
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:18,199
or not at all

211
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,139
and then there are also

212
00:08:22,139 --> 00:08:25,080
insecure by design features

213
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:27,000
probably have heard of them so there's

214
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,620
legitimate features that are built into

215
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:30,840
your ICS

216
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:33,000
for legitimate reasons but they do have

217
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,979
a security impact anyway

218
00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:36,419
and the third group of security

219
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:38,520
parameters makes features like that

220
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,919
explicit and visible for example the

221
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:42,958
fact that you can update your PSE logic

222
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:45,540
during operations of your systems that

223
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:46,980
may be needed from a functional

224
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:48,720
perspective but of course it does have a

225
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,820
security implication

226
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:54,779
so security parameters really are the

227
00:08:54,779 --> 00:08:56,519
little Wheels in your big Haze deck

228
00:08:56,519 --> 00:08:58,200
of engineering information

229
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,940
they help you focus on the security

230
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:03,019
decisions that matter

231
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,920
our second filter

232
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:07,320
it's probably not news to you

233
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,360
it's high consequence events and you may

234
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,580
know that for example from Iron Out CCE

235
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:12,899
method

236
00:09:12,899 --> 00:09:15,000
it's explained really quickly as the

237
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,860
answer to the question but we'll make a

238
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:18,779
real good day in your plant

239
00:09:18,779 --> 00:09:21,839
and your engineers are probably good at

240
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:26,040
answering that one and it's not always

241
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:29,339
but sometimes functional safety related

242
00:09:29,339 --> 00:09:33,720
so I used to work for a

243
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:37,380
co-service mind company and a project

244
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:39,000
and they used to tell us our worst

245
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,940
nightmare is or would be if our call

246
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:43,860
excavator would fall over

247
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:45,779
because these things have about the size

248
00:09:45,779 --> 00:09:47,399
of an Eiffel Tower and as you can

249
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:48,839
imagine no one has a spare Eiffel Tower

250
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:50,940
somewhere and it's closer so

251
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:52,980
this would make prime high consequence

252
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:55,140
event in this case or in our example in

253
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:56,760
a high consequence event could also be

254
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,500
the explosion of a reactor

255
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,240
you probably get the point but the

256
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,920
important Point here is

257
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,899
the definition of high consequence

258
00:10:03,899 --> 00:10:06,060
events

259
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:08,040
should absolutely be a management

260
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,740
decision management should decide which

261
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:12,660
high consequence events Engineers should

262
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:15,959
focus on in security decision making

263
00:10:15,959 --> 00:10:17,940
because they are the why behind your

264
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:20,040
security engineering you could imagine

265
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:22,980
them as kind of your North Stars right

266
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:24,899
they are shine shine bright and they

267
00:10:24,899 --> 00:10:26,640
keep your engineers on track when making

268
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,640
their security design decisions

269
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,320
they also make security by Design

270
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,300
decision making easier

271
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,519
so let's try this out I just put the

272
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:36,779
North Star here and you've got the

273
00:10:36,779 --> 00:10:39,420
security parameters all in your network

274
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:42,800
you see it's easy right

275
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:47,279
you're not seeing it's easy right

276
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:49,200
it's because it still isn't there's

277
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,540
still something missing we've got these

278
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:53,579
very high level high consequence events

279
00:10:53,579 --> 00:10:55,380
up there and then we've got this tiny

280
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:56,880
little configuration options in the

281
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,200
security parameters and in between

282
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,940
there's a large gap

283
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:01,860
so we need something to fill that Gap

284
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:04,920
and that's something as our third filter

285
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:08,220
and that's functions

286
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:09,360
now

287
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,180
functions are magical

288
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:14,519
functions have the power to turn a big

289
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:16,200
pile of Technology into something

290
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,740
meaningful

291
00:11:19,019 --> 00:11:22,380
they add humans interactions and a

292
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:25,440
purpose which is important so let's try

293
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,480
and do some magic that's our pile of

294
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:30,779
Technology we've looked at that before

295
00:11:30,779 --> 00:11:33,060
and that's a function

296
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:35,880
and a function example for update of PSE

297
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,800
logic so even if you're not knee-deep

298
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:42,060
into ICS technology and by no means your

299
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:43,920
knee-deep into the example Network I've

300
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,600
shown here you can probably understand

301
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,279
pretty quickly that one of the things

302
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:48,899
that Engineers do with that pile of

303
00:11:48,899 --> 00:11:51,060
technology is updating PRC logic and you

304
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:52,560
can also see how that works and you can

305
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,260
also see who does it

306
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:58,920
now apply that to our other filters that

307
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:01,680
we already have used

308
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,480
this was our overwhelming picture from

309
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,660
before

310
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:08,399
and this is it now

311
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:11,040
so now what the security design question

312
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,620
boils down to and that is way easier to

313
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:16,380
answer is the question

314
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:18,540
which of these security parameters that

315
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:21,540
you see here you need to adjust

316
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:23,579
in order to make sure the function that

317
00:12:23,579 --> 00:12:26,100
you see here cannot cause that high

318
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:27,779
consequence event

319
00:12:27,779 --> 00:12:29,760
so if you go through your entire system

320
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,560
high consequence event by high

321
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:32,940
consequence event and function by

322
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:35,160
function your security design decisions

323
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:38,579
become way less overwhelming

324
00:12:38,579 --> 00:12:40,860
and then there's last one last cool fact

325
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,600
about functions

326
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,399
actually they are the only information

327
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:47,399
that you need in order to time your

328
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:49,620
decisions within your ICS Engineering

329
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:50,639
Process

330
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:52,620
you don't need any new any fancy new

331
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:54,779
security by Design workflow the only

332
00:12:54,779 --> 00:12:56,399
thing that you need to know is and your

333
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:58,560
engineers do know that

334
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,200
when in your ICS Engineering Process do

335
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,480
you decide how updating of POC logic

336
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,380
works

337
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:06,120
because that's the time when you also

338
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,200
need to decide about the security

339
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,380
parameters attached to that one

340
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:12,600
so

341
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,220
to wrap things up

342
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:17,760
our first simplifier was filters

343
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:20,220
security parameters help you to focus on

344
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:22,200
decisions that matter

345
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,480
High consequence events help you to

346
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,279
focus on risks that matter

347
00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:28,740
and functions help you to focus on

348
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:31,019
systems that matter and to help you to

349
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:33,000
time your security design decisions

350
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,380
within your Engineering Process

351
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,660
well

352
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:41,940
that may look easy now or at least

353
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:44,820
easier on my pretty slides but I've

354
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:46,320
cheated

355
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,579
because

356
00:13:47,579 --> 00:13:49,560
I haven't told you where all these

357
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:50,760
colorful functions and security

358
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:53,160
parameters come from

359
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:55,260
and your security engineers

360
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:56,940
won't have the time to create them

361
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:59,700
obviously

362
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:02,579
so that's why our second simplifier

363
00:14:02,579 --> 00:14:03,899
comes in

364
00:14:03,899 --> 00:14:05,880
which is libraries

365
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:08,459
in our research we did create libraries

366
00:14:08,459 --> 00:14:10,260
and they make all the difference because

367
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:12,660
having libraries for functions and

368
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:15,420
security parameters means your engineers

369
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:18,240
don't have to make up functions and

370
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,920
security parameters they simply have to

371
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,720
choose them from a library

372
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,760
so for example this is an example I

373
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,860
believe they can browse and say oh for

374
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:27,420
automatic control this is a function

375
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:29,940
that we also use and for engineering

376
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:32,459
this is a function that we also use

377
00:14:32,459 --> 00:14:34,260
and that makes things easier and then

378
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:36,839
also to every function

379
00:14:36,839 --> 00:14:40,019
the security parameters are attached

380
00:14:40,019 --> 00:14:41,100
now

381
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:43,740
are there any ICS vendors in the room

382
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:45,980
here

383
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,760
one and a half

384
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:54,079
talk about the half one later

385
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:55,920
because this is where you need to sit up

386
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,199
straight and take notes so in case you

387
00:14:58,199 --> 00:14:59,519
haven't remembered to put out your arm

388
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:03,540
doesn't matter but take notes now

389
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:05,279
these functions

390
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,320
and the parameters and the libraries

391
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,519
attached

392
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:10,139
other solution to one of your major

393
00:15:10,139 --> 00:15:12,240
problems because you probably know the

394
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,920
situations like these here as a router

395
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,260
and use it around a table and you ask

396
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:17,940
them what do you want security Wise from

397
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:19,800
all components and the asset owners like

398
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,740
well what do you have what can you offer

399
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:24,959
that's a deadlock situation

400
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:27,360
the libraries can help you because they

401
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,740
can help you really efficiently

402
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:32,220
communicate your security philosophy

403
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:34,019
because you can imagine functions like

404
00:15:34,019 --> 00:15:35,339
these

405
00:15:35,339 --> 00:15:37,100
can have variance that can be different

406
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:40,260
depending on the ICS vendor so if you're

407
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:42,000
ABB for example

408
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,220
and also the security parameters they

409
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:46,079
can defer for different vendors so if

410
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:48,959
you're ABB you could say okay see if you

411
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:50,940
have an ABB system this is how we want

412
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:54,060
you to be engineering to updating POC

413
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:55,860
logic this is how it works look at that

414
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:57,300
function and if you want to do it

415
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:59,160
securely these are the parameters that

416
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,720
you need to pay attention to and also

417
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,760
these other values that we recommend

418
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,740
sending the parameters to setting the

419
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:06,660
parameters to

420
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:08,760
and soon you're going to need to do

421
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,440
something like this anyway because for

422
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,240
Conformity assessments regulation is

423
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,920
just around the corner at least in

424
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:18,019
Europe with the Cyber resilience Act

425
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:20,100
so

426
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:21,899
again here

427
00:16:21,899 --> 00:16:23,699
to wrap things up for the libraries

428
00:16:23,699 --> 00:16:25,560
libraries are really important because

429
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:28,620
they encapsulate knowledge

430
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:30,959
and notice that people or your engineers

431
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:33,120
sometimes will not have

432
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,459
and also they make that knowledge

433
00:16:35,459 --> 00:16:37,320
available for reuse so they don't have

434
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:40,860
to reinvent the wheel all the time

435
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:42,959
now our first two simplifiers we're

436
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:45,360
focusing on how to identify security

437
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,100
design decisions

438
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,540
next

439
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:50,699
we're going to focus on how to make and

440
00:16:50,699 --> 00:16:52,920
document these decisions

441
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:55,079
and remember your engineers are no

442
00:16:55,079 --> 00:16:56,519
Security Experts and your managers

443
00:16:56,519 --> 00:16:58,199
probably on your engine engineering

444
00:16:58,199 --> 00:17:01,320
experts and there's one tool that's most

445
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:04,199
efficient for communicating information

446
00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:08,780
to non-experts and that's diagrams

447
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,559
you've actually seen proof of that

448
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:12,059
before when you've been looking at the

449
00:17:12,059 --> 00:17:14,280
function diagram

450
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,439
even if you were not knee-deep into the

451
00:17:16,439 --> 00:17:19,079
technology that was behind this this

452
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:20,699
diagram you could pretty well understand

453
00:17:20,699 --> 00:17:22,500
what was behind the function that I've

454
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,839
shown you

455
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:27,959
imagine this instead through reading a

456
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:30,960
text or through an exiled table

457
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:35,179
trust me we've tried doesn't work at all

458
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:37,500
so

459
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:41,039
we'd created four kinds of diagrams that

460
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:43,020
help your engineers make security design

461
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,460
decisions

462
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:46,380
by only showing them the information

463
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:48,240
they need in a certain decision making

464
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,000
step you've already seen two of them

465
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,940
but I want to spend a bit of time at the

466
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:56,160
security decision diagram down below

467
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,539
because we haven't looked at that one

468
00:17:57,539 --> 00:17:58,260
yet

469
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:00,840
so let's imagine a few decisions have

470
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:03,120
been made for them

471
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,280
are here and three have been made that

472
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,080
these are the gray ones on the picture

473
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,940
here

474
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:11,220
and let's now imagine you want to

475
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:13,020
understand why they've been made that

476
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:14,460
way

477
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:17,280
let's start with that one in the middle

478
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,960
updating logic during operations

479
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,179
remember that was the security insecured

480
00:18:21,179 --> 00:18:22,740
by Design feature

481
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:25,919
and that has been enabled

482
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:28,740
strange right because that sounds

483
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:31,140
detrimental to security

484
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:32,820
and if you click on it

485
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:36,600
you can see that you know what it is but

486
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:39,539
security simply had no say in this it

487
00:18:39,539 --> 00:18:41,039
was a decision made based on a

488
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:42,780
functional requirement and we have so

489
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:45,660
many decisions made that way but there

490
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:47,880
are security relevant anyway so it's

491
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,679
important to know that and to document

492
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:52,140
it that way

493
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:53,460
next up

494
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:54,900
the one on the right Integrity

495
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:58,500
protection for PRC logic

496
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:01,679
now this has been set to Hash in our

497
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:02,760
example

498
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:05,400
and maybe there are some top 20 PSE

499
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,260
coding practices fans in here so you

500
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:08,880
know this is a hassle this may not be

501
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,580
technically feasible to implement

502
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:13,260
at least one fan

503
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:15,000
and

504
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,640
so you better have a damn good reason to

505
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,980
to require something like that so if you

506
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:21,299
click on that you can see what your

507
00:19:21,299 --> 00:19:22,620
engineers have done they've said okay

508
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:25,020
this is a risk-based decision and this

509
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:26,700
is tied to one of your high consequence

510
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:28,919
events and luckily for them to one of

511
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:30,299
the high consequence events that you

512
00:19:30,299 --> 00:19:32,340
deemed important in the first part and

513
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:33,780
your engineers have even attacked

514
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:36,539
attached an attack scenario detailing

515
00:19:36,539 --> 00:19:38,400
how this security parameter could be

516
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,520
used in order to cause the directory

517
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,080
explosion and if you've been talking

518
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:45,419
about earlier

519
00:19:45,419 --> 00:19:48,059
display with the details

520
00:19:48,059 --> 00:19:50,340
last decision

521
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:53,100
whoa patching

522
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:55,140
we all know patching an ICS is a

523
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:57,299
nightmare so there was a decision made

524
00:19:57,299 --> 00:19:59,640
to patch this vulnerability and you're

525
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,440
pretty sure I want to know why because

526
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,120
they better have a pretty good risk for

527
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,260
that one

528
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:07,620
clicking on that you see no risk

529
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:09,900
because that's what wasn't a risk-based

530
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:11,640
decision it was a compliance based

531
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,860
distribution so for example because you

532
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:15,240
are subject to critical infrastructure

533
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:18,660
regulation you have to patch full stop

534
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:20,520
if you look at these three decisions

535
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,500
that we've made in comparison

536
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:26,120
we can see two things here

537
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:29,400
first it's tremendously important to be

538
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,260
able to trace decisions to be able to

539
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:32,700
trace back why you made a certain

540
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:33,900
decision

541
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:36,059
it's important

542
00:20:36,059 --> 00:20:38,039
because you have to explain them may

543
00:20:38,039 --> 00:20:39,299
have to explain them to external

544
00:20:39,299 --> 00:20:41,280
Auditors it's important because during

545
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,480
operations you're doing change

546
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,100
management you want to make changes and

547
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:46,020
you want to make want to know why you

548
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:47,760
made certain decisions and why you

549
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,200
didn't

550
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,020
and it's vitally important remember what

551
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:54,840
security engineering is all about not

552
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:58,740
taking certain security measures so if

553
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:00,660
you're not taking if you're deciding

554
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:02,760
against certain security measures

555
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:05,340
you want to know why and you want to

556
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:08,000
document why

557
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,020
the second point that you're seeing here

558
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:12,900
is that there are different legitimate

559
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:14,760
reasons for making security design

560
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,559
decisions

561
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:19,919
and risk is only one of them

562
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:22,740
we as a security bubble tend to

563
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:24,840
stress that all decisions should be

564
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,400
risk-based

565
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,140
and we see here that this may not always

566
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:29,340
be accurate

567
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:30,539
so

568
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:32,520
I would like to recommend that instead

569
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:33,600
of

570
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,240
requiring all decisions to be risk-based

571
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,340
we should maybe require that all

572
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:42,799
decisions are traceable instead

573
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:48,659
wrapping around the diagram portion

574
00:21:48,659 --> 00:21:51,059
diagrams are important because

575
00:21:51,059 --> 00:21:52,740
they guide your engineers in their

576
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:54,600
decision making by only showing them the

577
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,280
information relevant in a certain

578
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,840
decision-making step

579
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,159
they are very efficient for

580
00:21:59,159 --> 00:22:01,140
communication of decisions for example

581
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:02,520
to management

582
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,919
and they are very efficient in

583
00:22:04,919 --> 00:22:07,080
communicating the traceability of

584
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,460
decisions

585
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:11,039
a reason why decisions are made

586
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:14,159
so if you want precise

587
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:16,740
decision making and you want what you

588
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:18,720
want to have the decisions communicated

589
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:21,299
precisely you should request diagrams

590
00:22:21,299 --> 00:22:24,260
from your engineers

591
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:28,140
now if you do if you do request diagrams

592
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:29,340
from your engineers

593
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:31,740
you're probably going to get strange

594
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:33,720
looks saying well

595
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:37,140
I don't have time for pretty pictures

596
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:38,700
that's right because I don't have time

597
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:40,740
for pretty pictures either right I

598
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:41,940
haven't drawn any of these pictures

599
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:43,260
myself

600
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:48,000
it's the 21st century right so we have

601
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,580
four socks for Security operation

602
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:52,559
centers no one would get to the idea to

603
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:54,480
put your people in there for making

604
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,280
security operations decisions in front

605
00:22:56,280 --> 00:23:00,659
of a sock without any electronic tool

606
00:23:00,659 --> 00:23:02,039
why do we do that for security

607
00:23:02,039 --> 00:23:03,539
engineering

608
00:23:03,539 --> 00:23:05,400
now I'm not saying

609
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:08,340
you should get any security engineering

610
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:10,799
tool or get any electronic tool support

611
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:13,020
for security engineering just because

612
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:15,539
but there are three purposes

613
00:23:15,539 --> 00:23:17,039
where they are really important that

614
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:18,960
they can really make a difference the

615
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:21,120
first is a single source of Truth

616
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,039
you want to have a single source of

617
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:24,539
Truth where all your security design

618
00:23:24,539 --> 00:23:26,880
decisions are documented you want to

619
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,500
have a single source of Truth where all

620
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:29,940
your high consequences and security

621
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:31,799
parameters the decisions that you made

622
00:23:31,799 --> 00:23:34,020
and why you made them are documented you

623
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:36,600
want to have a possibility for your

624
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:39,299
libraries for example the ones that you

625
00:23:39,299 --> 00:23:41,100
vendor provided to exchange them

626
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:43,140
digitally so you can put them to direct

627
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:44,220
use

628
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:46,159
and then the last one don't

629
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:50,280
underestimate the power of a tool if it

630
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:52,200
even if it's really simple to guide

631
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,120
Engineers through a workflow that are

632
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:56,640
not familiar with that's not there

633
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,539
Daily Business

634
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,919
Okay so

635
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:04,140
you've seen these four simplifiers now

636
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:06,659
and with that knowledge in mind

637
00:24:06,659 --> 00:24:09,299
I'd like you to come back to this

638
00:24:09,299 --> 00:24:10,860
science study we've looked at the

639
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:12,179
beginning and I'd like to reveal the

640
00:24:12,179 --> 00:24:13,919
fourth item on the list that's yellow

641
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:16,280
here

642
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:19,020
now you can see here look

643
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:21,179
security design decisions

644
00:24:21,179 --> 00:24:23,100
awesome

645
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:25,520
but

646
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:28,919
by Consultants

647
00:24:28,919 --> 00:24:31,320
well

648
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:33,539
Ivy qualified to comment alert on that

649
00:24:33,539 --> 00:24:35,460
one because I am a consultant myself I

650
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:38,100
know the pain right

651
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:41,640
I think twice about that one

652
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:44,640
because a consultant or any external

653
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,620
party for that matter who doesn't know

654
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:47,940
your filters who doesn't know your

655
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:49,500
security parameters who doesn't know

656
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:51,840
your high consequence events who doesn't

657
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,520
know your functions

658
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:56,580
can most likely only come up with the

659
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:59,840
security controls checklist

660
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:02,460
and you know by now what a waste of time

661
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:04,500
and money it would be so just try and

662
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:06,480
tick off any any measure on that

663
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,900
checklist

664
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:13,380
anyone really everyone

665
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:16,020
can come up with a large checklist of

666
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:17,820
security controls that you would need to

667
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:19,440
take

668
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:22,260
but only you

669
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:24,960
can decide which which security measures

670
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:28,220
you are not going to take

671
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:30,659
so

672
00:25:30,659 --> 00:25:33,679
instead of this one

673
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:35,880
consider investing into your own

674
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,080
decision making

675
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:40,080
consider investing into deciding which

676
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,419
security measures you don't take

677
00:25:42,419 --> 00:25:44,460
it can be done

678
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:46,200
find your filters

679
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,480
leverage your libraries draw some

680
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,659
diagrams maybe try out some two support

681
00:25:51,659 --> 00:25:53,940
Empower your engineers to do some

682
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:56,460
serious engine security engineering

683
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:59,840
and to make these decisions

684
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:02,220
I know

685
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:04,320
we in the ICS security Community are a

686
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,880
strange Bunch right some people keep

687
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,500
talking about senders others keep

688
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:09,179
talking about data diodes and I keep

689
00:26:09,179 --> 00:26:10,799
waiving my giant ball talking about

690
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:13,620
security engineering

691
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:15,720
and you know what

692
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:18,240
I hope that four years from now I don't

693
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,820
have to be that person anymore

694
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:23,640
because four years from now

695
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:27,799
doing serious security engineering

696
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:30,000
professionalizing your security design

697
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,679
decisions

698
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:34,380
will have become a total no-brainer

699
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:36,179
just as professionalizing your security

700
00:26:36,179 --> 00:26:39,419
operations decisions already is

701
00:26:39,419 --> 00:26:43,080
so I hope that if you return from S4 get

702
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:44,580
back into your offices review your

703
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:46,919
priorities for 2023

704
00:26:46,919 --> 00:26:48,539
you sneak some serious security

705
00:26:48,539 --> 00:26:51,000
Engineering in

706
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,930
thank you

707
00:26:52,930 --> 00:26:57,959
[Applause]
