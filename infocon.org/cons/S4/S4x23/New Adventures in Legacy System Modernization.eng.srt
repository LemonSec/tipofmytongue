1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,240
foreign

2
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:10,139
how are we doing today

3
00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:13,160
so how are we doing today

4
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:15,120
I know it's a little early in the

5
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,520
morning but still all right so as you've

6
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,440
already heard my name is Marianne

7
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:22,020
belotti I work on really old computer

8
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:24,720
systems and I I really really love it

9
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,420
I've spent about 20 years of my life as

10
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:29,820
a professional software engineer

11
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:31,940
um I do Legacy modernization

12
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:34,559
architecture and system rescue I gave

13
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:36,719
progressively more into a field called

14
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:38,820
formal verification which is basically

15
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:42,180
math for computers and I'm here to talk

16
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:45,780
to you about what makes it so hard

17
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:49,320
to modernize old technology because it

18
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:52,320
is really hard right

19
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,960
close to 80 percent of Legacy

20
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,699
modernization projects are just gonna

21
00:00:56,699 --> 00:00:58,800
fail that's not me saying that that's

22
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,539
red hat saying it they're just not going

23
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:01,800
to get off the ground and they're not

24
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:04,379
going to accomplish their goals and of

25
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:07,380
all Legacy modernization projects

26
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:11,340
27 completely overrun their budget like

27
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:13,860
orders of magnitude more expensive than

28
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:15,960
people thought it was going to be when

29
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,180
they started and a lot of what I do is

30
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:20,340
work with people on how do we make these

31
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:23,040
projects successful and how do we avoid

32
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,439
common pitfalls with them

33
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:28,680
so if you don't if you remember nothing

34
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,240
else from this talk this is the most

35
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,040
important thing I'm going to say it's

36
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,720
where I start with all the people and

37
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,880
the teams that I work with it's my

38
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:39,360
guiding North Star Legacy Tech is

39
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,979
successful Tech

40
00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:43,259
because what trips people up a lot is

41
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:45,240
when they come into Legacy modernization

42
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:48,479
they kind of go oh this old growth

43
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,520
system they devalue it they don't

44
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,380
appreciate it they don't have empathy

45
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:54,299
for the people who came before them and

46
00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:56,579
built it and maintained it and that kind

47
00:01:56,579 --> 00:01:58,799
of sets the whole project on the wrong

48
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:01,740
tone right away so what do I mean by

49
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:03,780
this idea of like Legacy Tech is

50
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:06,540
successful Tech well if it wasn't

51
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:09,720
successful Tech we'd have the easiest

52
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:12,300
Legacy modernization project in the

53
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,160
world we just shut the damn thing off

54
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,900
and then it's like all right great going

55
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:18,959
home that's great problem solved so we

56
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:20,459
can't do that with a lot of these

57
00:02:20,459 --> 00:02:21,480
systems

58
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,220
because they're being used they're

59
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:26,340
active people are using them and often

60
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:27,840
people are using them in really critical

61
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,800
places they're essential functionality a

62
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,060
lot of these systems particularly the

63
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:36,239
ones that are like 30 40 years old or

64
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:38,520
older were the the first time people

65
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,560
tried to do a particular thing and the

66
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,519
first time they tried to do it with

67
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:43,080
computers and so they've been judging

68
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,239
along for decades providing this really

69
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:47,640
critical functionality and because of

70
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,860
that they're also foundational we've had

71
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:52,140
them around for a while so we've built

72
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:54,239
other systems on top of them and then

73
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:56,400
we've built other systems on top of

74
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,160
those other systems and so making any

75
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,379
changes at all is not just about that

76
00:03:01,379 --> 00:03:03,239
one system its performance it's now

77
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:06,120
about a whole ecosystem of other systems

78
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,760
and their performance and so if you find

79
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,680
yourself in a situation with like really

80
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,659
old technology that you're not sure how

81
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:14,760
to get rid of is congratulations you

82
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,680
have a successful system that people are

83
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,080
using and there's perform providing a

84
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:22,040
critical functionality

85
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:25,860
I'm going to start us off with a set of

86
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:27,120
myths that people believe about

87
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,760
modernization that tend to trip projects

88
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,040
up before they even get started

89
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,720
and the first one

90
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,940
I hear all the time is people start off

91
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:37,560
their conversation about like what they

92
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,060
want to do with their system by saying

93
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:41,400
well this technology is too old

94
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,440
I'm like well all right cool why do we

95
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,760
have to get rid of it because it's too

96
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,379
old Marianne we have to get rid of it

97
00:03:46,379 --> 00:03:48,720
it's too old a lot of times this comes

98
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,280
up when we're dealing with mainframes

99
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,799
and Cobalt and that feels like a fair

100
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,500
point but the problem with this argument

101
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,780
of technology is too old it's

102
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:59,580
multifaceted first

103
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:01,920
most technologists are incorrect about

104
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,500
the actual age of their technology

105
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:07,080
one of the fun experiences for me is

106
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,519
lately I've been dealing with a lot of

107
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:10,140
people who have really old Java

108
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:12,420
applications that's their legacy and

109
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:14,519
they'll they'll call me up I can hear

110
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:16,380
that some people also have old Java

111
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:18,238
applications flying around somewhere in

112
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:19,620
their infrastructure

113
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:20,820
and so they'll call me up and they'll

114
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:23,880
say like we've got this old Java thing

115
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:26,580
it's gross we want to get rid of it and

116
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:29,220
update it with a new modern programming

117
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:31,919
language like Python and this always

118
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:34,199
brings a smile to my face because if you

119
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:35,820
know a bit about programming language

120
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:37,500
history then you know that python is

121
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:41,400
actually older than Java right so we're

122
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,040
kind of wrong about the age of things

123
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,660
most of the things that we associate as

124
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,880
new particularly in the language uh

125
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:50,880
fields are 10 years old and if you think

126
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,860
about it no one ever complains about how

127
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:54,600
the design of a light bulb hasn't really

128
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,460
fundamentally changed in a really long

129
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:59,160
time or how like a fork or a knife

130
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,199
hasn't changed in a really long time we

131
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:03,300
never really complain about the age of

132
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:05,040
our technology when we're talking about

133
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:09,360
other forms of technology so for me

134
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,639
age isn't an important factor I don't

135
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:14,340
really care how old your technology is I

136
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:16,500
care about your ability to run it I care

137
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,940
about your ability to maintain it

138
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:20,340
maintenance is most important to me so

139
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:21,660
when someone comes up to me and says

140
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:23,340
like our technology is too old that's

141
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:25,139
why we need to do Legacy modernization

142
00:05:25,139 --> 00:05:27,060
the things I want to know is like okay

143
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:28,979
are we on a language or a framework

144
00:05:28,979 --> 00:05:30,840
that's still being actively developed

145
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:33,720
right or is this abandoned and it's just

146
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,220
sitting and no one is maintaining it

147
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:36,120
right

148
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,580
if it is being actively developed are we

149
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:40,979
capable of keeping up to date with its

150
00:05:40,979 --> 00:05:42,780
current builds right can we do security

151
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:44,940
patches can we do updates or is there

152
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:47,460
some reason why we're blocked and we

153
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:49,199
can't keep track with like the most

154
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:50,940
current version of it

155
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:53,639
and then like as technology changes our

156
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:55,500
perspective on like what protocols we're

157
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:56,759
using and how we're configuring

158
00:05:56,759 --> 00:05:58,500
everything and how we Orient everything

159
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:02,340
tends to shift over time and so are we

160
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:04,919
able to sort of integrate with those

161
00:06:04,919 --> 00:06:06,840
newer products those newer Services we

162
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:09,720
want to take advantage of a lot of times

163
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,820
when we have an outage on a Mainframe

164
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:13,800
it's almost never the Mainframe that is

165
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,740
actually the problem it is the 17 layers

166
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:18,900
of java middleware that has been put in

167
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,699
front of the Mainframe in order for it

168
00:06:20,699 --> 00:06:23,819
to talk to the internet right so this

169
00:06:23,819 --> 00:06:25,740
idea of like can we take this old

170
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:27,300
technology and actually get it to

171
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,100
communicate with this new technology is

172
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:31,500
not insignificant and it is a factor

173
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,539
that comes into play when we talk about

174
00:06:33,539 --> 00:06:36,780
why we want to modernize technology

175
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:39,240
okay so some takeaways from this this

176
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:43,139
concept first beware of shiny object

177
00:06:43,139 --> 00:06:46,380
syndrome like we're all very fattish in

178
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:48,360
what technologies we get really excited

179
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,340
about just because something is being

180
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:52,560
chattered about a lot on like the forums

181
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,120
and a hacker news or what have you

182
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,220
doesn't mean that it's the right fit for

183
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:59,280
what your organization is trying to do

184
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,500
I see a lot of systems where when I look

185
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,000
at their architectural diagram I think

186
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,620
to myself

187
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:06,900
how does that even work like how does

188
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:08,580
this thing even operate there's no way

189
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:10,500
that works and then I'm always surprised

190
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:11,940
to find out no in fact it does work

191
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:15,000
right a lot of systems can work but they

192
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,259
can have a lot of hidden costs

193
00:07:16,259 --> 00:07:19,020
associated with getting them to work and

194
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:21,660
something working once doesn't mean that

195
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:24,360
it works at scale right

196
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:28,620
so when we decide to undergo a

197
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:30,599
modernization effort really to be very

198
00:07:30,599 --> 00:07:32,759
clear about why we're moving to the new

199
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:34,440
thing what is the value of the new thing

200
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,840
what are we hoping to get out of it

201
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:39,720
so myth number two

202
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,280
let's just rip it out and replace it

203
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,740
wholesale a lot of times since I work

204
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:45,180
really heavily in software a lot of

205
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:46,199
times we're talking about like full

206
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:49,500
rewrites but there this is also like a

207
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,000
hardware thing let's just pull it out

208
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,440
and just replace it with something new

209
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,300
and this seems like a really great idea

210
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:57,840
right but the thing to think about is

211
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,240
those kind of modernization efforts

212
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,740
typically involve what's called A Hard

213
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:03,479
cut off you turn on the new system you

214
00:08:03,479 --> 00:08:05,520
turn off the old system and then you

215
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,319
pray that everything goes exactly the

216
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:10,979
way you want it to and that can be an

217
00:08:10,979 --> 00:08:14,340
extremely risky migration plan so you

218
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:15,479
have to be able to answer this question

219
00:08:15,479 --> 00:08:17,460
of like all right if we turn on the new

220
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:19,620
thing and we turn off the old thing and

221
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:21,599
it turns out when you have live data

222
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:23,160
coming across the new thing it doesn't

223
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,379
work or there's some sort of bug or some

224
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:27,840
sort of complication can you turn the

225
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,879
old thing back on like what happens then

226
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:32,159
right what's the strategy after that

227
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,020
point

228
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:35,820
and so if you have an answer to that

229
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:37,380
question this might be the right

230
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:38,700
approach for you if you don't have an

231
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:39,779
answer to this question or you haven't

232
00:08:39,779 --> 00:08:42,779
even thought of that question then this

233
00:08:42,779 --> 00:08:44,339
is probably not a thing that's going to

234
00:08:44,339 --> 00:08:46,500
go really well

235
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,480
the big thing about rewrites and

236
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,480
replaces is that you have to think about

237
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:54,540
how the modernization effort is

238
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:56,339
communicating its value to people who

239
00:08:56,339 --> 00:08:58,980
are not technologists and for whom this

240
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:01,800
isn't really all that important right so

241
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,480
what happens a lot with rewrites

242
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:06,120
especially is that you end up spending a

243
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,880
lot of time and a lot of effort getting

244
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,860
back up to the same level of

245
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:12,360
functionality that from the business

246
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:15,240
perspective you already had and so the

247
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,980
business side looks at these kind of

248
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:19,200
modernization efforts as well what are

249
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,720
you giving me that's new and that causes

250
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,600
your MVP and your roadmap to expand its

251
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,480
scope beyond what is feasible to do and

252
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,459
tends to tank modernization projects

253
00:09:29,459 --> 00:09:31,860
right away so we want to really focus on

254
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:33,839
on value and be able to communicate

255
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:35,519
value we want to be aware that these

256
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:37,860
ribbon replaces tend to allow us to

257
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:40,140
drift into adding new functionality on

258
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:43,220
top of modernization

259
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:47,220
so takeaways here once the software is

260
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:49,560
written it can be a long slow process to

261
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,839
migrate off of the old system and so

262
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:53,820
understand what that migration looks

263
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:56,160
like right and then don't forget that

264
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:59,580
rewriting or ripping something out also

265
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:01,320
means retraining it also means

266
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,660
onboarding the users onto something new

267
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:05,279
and make sure that you're accounting for

268
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:07,320
that as well

269
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,600
and maintain discipline around what your

270
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,519
MVP is don't overload it with new

271
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:14,279
functionality trying to to get the most

272
00:10:14,279 --> 00:10:17,040
value to the stakeholders

273
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,660
so

274
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,040
if you're on this concept of value

275
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:23,339
because value for technical people and

276
00:10:23,339 --> 00:10:25,800
value for non-technical people are often

277
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,540
very different things and there are four

278
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:29,880
areas where you can provide value that

279
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,740
is easy to understand for non-technical

280
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:34,260
people they're they're not really in a

281
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:36,120
ranked order I just put them in an order

282
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,700
that felt right at the time so the first

283
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,140
one I'm going to talk about is

284
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,880
performance if you improve the

285
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,860
performance of the system it is faster

286
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:46,620
it scales better that is a value that

287
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:48,720
people understand but

288
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,820
it has to be at a level that is

289
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:53,220
noticeable to non-engineers if the only

290
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:54,660
reason why I know there's a performance

291
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:56,220
increase in the system is because I

292
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:57,660
looked at a dashboard that told me

293
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:59,880
there's a performance increase and

294
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,740
otherwise I have exactly the same

295
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:03,720
situation and the experience that I had

296
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,399
before that's not really going to

297
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:07,079
communicate a lot of value to

298
00:11:07,079 --> 00:11:08,940
non-technical stakeholders so it has to

299
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:10,860
be noticeable to non-engineers it has to

300
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:12,120
be significant

301
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:15,300
second area is user experience if when I

302
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,820
log on to use your system I have a

303
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:19,980
better experience I understand what's

304
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:21,720
going on I don't have confusion about

305
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:24,360
like what I do next I have a nicer

306
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,100
prettier experience that's the thing

307
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:28,140
that I'm going to value

308
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:30,480
third area is stability

309
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,600
bugs up time things like that this can

310
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,300
also include security but again it has

311
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:38,339
to be noticeable to a non-technical

312
00:11:38,339 --> 00:11:41,279
person I have met very few business

313
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:43,740
people who really care how many critical

314
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:45,540
vulnerabilities there are in the backlog

315
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:47,459
I know it breaks a lot of people's heart

316
00:11:47,459 --> 00:11:49,440
to hear that but like generally speaking

317
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,000
they don't really care very much about

318
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,920
that until it comes time for an audit

319
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,899
but when they have to send out a press

320
00:11:54,899 --> 00:11:56,459
release because something terrible has

321
00:11:56,459 --> 00:11:58,620
happened they care about that so you can

322
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:00,660
put Security in this third bucket but it

323
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:03,180
has to be something that's noticeable uh

324
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:05,519
to your non-technical stakeholders and

325
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:07,680
then the last is new features new

326
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,480
functionality people get very excited

327
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,339
about those sort of things so

328
00:12:11,339 --> 00:12:13,079
understanding how people perceive value

329
00:12:13,079 --> 00:12:15,839
and where that value is about what

330
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:17,040
you're going to build and what you're

331
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,300
what you're going to do with your

332
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:20,160
modernization project is pretty

333
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,480
important

334
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,519
so then the last myth I'm going to cover

335
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:25,200
is

336
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,339
all right fine we're just going to

337
00:12:26,339 --> 00:12:28,019
migrate to this other thing we're going

338
00:12:28,019 --> 00:12:29,940
to use this software as a service we're

339
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:32,760
gonna ship it out to a third party we're

340
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,019
just going to move it off to somebody

341
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:35,640
else they've already done all the

342
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:36,779
building they've already done all of

343
00:12:36,779 --> 00:12:39,000
this it'll be fine

344
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,100
so we're going to put this into

345
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:43,740
three different categories right we have

346
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:45,839
our our cots and our software as a

347
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:46,680
service

348
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,660
and these things are great if you have a

349
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:50,220
generic business problem that lots of

350
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:52,380
other businesses have by all means ship

351
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:54,120
it off software as a service have a

352
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:57,060
lovely day but the more unique your

353
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:59,160
particular problem is the more

354
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:01,800
customization you use the more edge

355
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,959
cases you're introducing the more

356
00:13:03,959 --> 00:13:05,940
problems you're potentially opening up

357
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:07,860
the less stable the software is going to

358
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:09,600
be over time so you have to be really

359
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,519
honest with yourself about like how

360
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:13,620
great of a fit is Salesforce for this

361
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:15,779
issue that I have because Salesforce is

362
00:13:15,779 --> 00:13:17,760
a wonderful product with lots of

363
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:20,220
customization options but I've also seen

364
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:22,680
people do some pretty weird things with

365
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,959
it right and that does not always go

366
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:27,300
well for the organization

367
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:28,980
the same with managed infrastructure

368
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:32,760
like the cloud right cloud is great if

369
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,740
you don't have economies of scale and

370
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:36,720
you're fine with using managed services

371
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,779
that you can't move to another Cloud if

372
00:13:39,779 --> 00:13:42,779
you change your mind later on but if you

373
00:13:42,779 --> 00:13:44,220
are sensitive to things like that

374
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:46,019
there's a lot of vendor lock-in that

375
00:13:46,019 --> 00:13:47,760
comes with Cloud there's a lot of hidden

376
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,800
costs that come with Cloud it may not be

377
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:52,440
the right approach necessarily

378
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,060
and then the last one is one that's

379
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:55,800
super popular right now in modernization

380
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,360
efforts and like breaks my heart a

381
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,800
little bit they just go all right we're

382
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,839
gonna just do this low no code no thing

383
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:02,279
we won't have to worry about engineering

384
00:14:02,279 --> 00:14:04,560
teams at all we got this lovely drag and

385
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,959
drop interface we're gonna just arrange

386
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:08,700
everything exactly they want it and then

387
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:10,079
we're gonna click the button and it's

388
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:11,399
going to generate all our Java

389
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:12,779
applications for us it's gonna be

390
00:14:12,779 --> 00:14:13,860
amazing

391
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:16,560
Maybe right

392
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,600
low code no code Solutions are really

393
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,980
great if you're dealing with internal

394
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:22,860
Services where you have a finite number

395
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:24,899
of users and you have a general idea of

396
00:14:24,899 --> 00:14:26,100
how many there are so like maybe you

397
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:27,839
have 200 people that will ever use this

398
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:30,360
system and you know approximately when

399
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,500
they're going to be working on this

400
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,360
system and you know what they're going

401
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,820
to be doing on them they get a little

402
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:37,500
bit more complicated when you're talking

403
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:41,279
about like public facing Services where

404
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:43,260
you could potentially have millions of

405
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:45,480
users using it and they could use it in

406
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,220
wild and unexpected ways because they

407
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,560
don't work for you so like YOLO they can

408
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:50,760
just do whatever they want with like

409
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,380
what's on the public internet

410
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:55,380
and so these kind of solutions because

411
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:57,540
they're automatically generated they

412
00:14:57,540 --> 00:15:00,320
they don't have the the the

413
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,399
brains of a software engineer are

414
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:03,839
standing behind them figuring out the

415
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:05,639
best way to optimize everything so they

416
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:07,560
produce a lot of junk code they have

417
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:08,880
performance issues they can have

418
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,639
security issues and if you put it out in

419
00:15:11,639 --> 00:15:13,079
a place where it's got a scale really

420
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:17,820
fast it can go down really fast as well

421
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:19,139
take a little bit more into the cloud

422
00:15:19,139 --> 00:15:20,279
because this is the thing that comes up

423
00:15:20,279 --> 00:15:22,800
quite a lot these days these are some

424
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,320
problems that people don't consider when

425
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:28,320
they think about shifting some or all of

426
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,180
their infrastructure into the cloud in

427
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:32,940
order to take advantage of the scale

428
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:34,500
that Amazon and Microsoft can bring to

429
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,660
the table I had an organization that was

430
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:38,220
working with quite recently kind of dig

431
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:40,260
into like why their AWS bills were so

432
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:41,459
high and they realized they were paying

433
00:15:41,459 --> 00:15:43,260
over ten thousand dollars just in taxes

434
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:45,120
because of the way they had broken up

435
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:48,360
their infrastructure across regions data

436
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,459
Ingress is the one that I highlight for

437
00:15:50,459 --> 00:15:53,579
people every every time right where does

438
00:15:53,579 --> 00:15:55,260
your data start where does it originate

439
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:57,540
and is there any point in time where you

440
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:59,100
have a legitimate business region to

441
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:00,779
pull it off the cloud because you will

442
00:16:00,779 --> 00:16:03,660
get charged for pulling off the cloud so

443
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:06,000
this idea of like where data starts here

444
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,560
off the cloud then we move it into the

445
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:08,699
cloud and then we move it out of the

446
00:16:08,699 --> 00:16:10,019
cloud and then we move it back into the

447
00:16:10,019 --> 00:16:12,000
cloud that is going to cost you a lot

448
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,120
almost invalidating the the cost Savings

449
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,220
of the cloud in general depending on

450
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:19,680
what scale you do do it at

451
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,500
so and then the last little bit that

452
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,600
people sometimes don't factor in that I

453
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,040
think might be most relevant to this

454
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,959
audience is that you know some of us

455
00:16:27,959 --> 00:16:30,959
work in organizations where

456
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:33,779
we care about the nationality of the

457
00:16:33,779 --> 00:16:35,399
people who are involved and have access

458
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:37,380
to our infrastructure I spent a lot of

459
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:38,399
time working with the federal government

460
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,920
and they care a lot about the idea that

461
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,720
Amazon might have some foreign Nationals

462
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,699
digging around in their Data Center and

463
00:16:44,699 --> 00:16:47,160
so making sure that you are with a

464
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:49,079
provider that understands that and can

465
00:16:49,079 --> 00:16:50,579
accommodate whatever your particular

466
00:16:50,579 --> 00:16:52,620
needs are in that regard is something

467
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:54,480
that people sometimes don't factor in

468
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,940
when they're pursuing these things

469
00:16:56,940 --> 00:17:01,139
so again like identify what we think the

470
00:17:01,139 --> 00:17:02,759
value is like if we're doing this

471
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:03,959
because we think they're going to be

472
00:17:03,959 --> 00:17:05,760
cost savings involved with moving

473
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,859
everything to the cloud cool

474
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:09,959
why how are those cost savings happening

475
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:11,040
are they happening because we're

476
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,780
decreasing our staff we no longer have

477
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:15,959
to hire data center people are they

478
00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:17,400
happening because we're no longer

479
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,380
investing in our own Hardware are they

480
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:21,179
happening because we get to operate at a

481
00:17:21,179 --> 00:17:23,339
scale we haven't been able to operate in

482
00:17:23,339 --> 00:17:24,480
before

483
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,000
understand what you're trying to do and

484
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,380
to what extent you're trying to do it

485
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:31,020
right if you need to move everything to

486
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:33,360
the cloud what does everything mean is

487
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,580
it all your data is it all your users

488
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:38,520
like what are we going for here

489
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,980
so this is the thing I think a lot of

490
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:44,940
people miss about about technology and

491
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:47,100
often when I give talks I give a

492
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:49,140
slightly longer introduction of myself

493
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:52,380
and I I disclose to people that my

494
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:54,299
actual background isn't so much in in

495
00:17:54,299 --> 00:17:55,980
computer science it's in anthropology

496
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:58,140
and so what was always interesting about

497
00:17:58,140 --> 00:17:59,820
technology and what particularly

498
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:03,000
interests me about Legacy technology is

499
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,520
that it's an artifact of how people and

500
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,320
organizations think and how they see the

501
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,299
world like technology is about people

502
00:18:09,299 --> 00:18:12,179
it's a successful technology projects

503
00:18:12,179 --> 00:18:14,760
whether they're modernization projects

504
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,880
or their new projects are all about

505
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:20,160
people and how people are communicating

506
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,419
with one another and how they're

507
00:18:21,419 --> 00:18:24,240
organizing with one another

508
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,100
so here are some three three examples of

509
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:27,840
this two of them are bad one of them is

510
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,039
good so let's start with the the

511
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:30,179
negative things

512
00:18:30,179 --> 00:18:33,660
91 of security attacks start with

513
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:36,059
phishing emails right so they start with

514
00:18:36,059 --> 00:18:38,160
a human being being tricked by another

515
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,200
human being and giving access to

516
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,880
something that an attacker shouldn't

517
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,860
have access to

518
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:47,160
59 of performance issues are triggered

519
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:49,440
by some sort of failing in a human

520
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,480
process that's associated with the

521
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:54,660
technology uh a lot of a lot of one of

522
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:55,860
the ones that have been like you know

523
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:57,539
kind of Marquee problems lately have

524
00:18:57,539 --> 00:18:59,640
involved somebody like overwriting a

525
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:02,160
configuration file by accident or

526
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,080
deleting a record that that shouldn't

527
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,419
have been deleted by accident

528
00:19:06,419 --> 00:19:08,280
but they're also like really positive

529
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,740
sides to people involved in technical

530
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:15,120
system 80 of Maintenance work is what we

531
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,220
call

532
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:18,900
non-corrective maintenance corrective

533
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:21,299
maintenance is ah I found a bug in this

534
00:19:21,299 --> 00:19:23,160
system I opened a ticket you went and

535
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:25,200
fixed it or I found a security

536
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,360
vulnerability and a cve that's relevant

537
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,340
to our system and I opened a ticket and

538
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:31,620
you fixed it non-corrective maintenance

539
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:34,500
is somebody sitting at a desk in front

540
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,440
of a computer thinking about a system

541
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:38,400
thinking about how it could be better

542
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,980
and then proactively taking the

543
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:43,860
opportunity to make it better right so

544
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:47,340
80 of Maintenance activity comes from

545
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:49,799
that human beings invested in their

546
00:19:49,799 --> 00:19:51,539
technology and wanting to make things

547
00:19:51,539 --> 00:19:53,580
better

548
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:54,660
and so

549
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:57,360
a lot of times when I when I uh come to

550
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,160
a community of people to talk about

551
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:01,380
Legacy modernization before my Talk

552
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:02,940
starts I get a lot of questions about

553
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:05,520
like are we gonna cover like IBM

554
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,799
mainframes are we going to cover old

555
00:20:07,799 --> 00:20:11,220
Windows 95 installations that are

556
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:13,320
lurking somewhere in your stack are we

557
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,460
going to cover this are we going to

558
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:17,640
cover that and I the answer to that is

559
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:20,100
no because every Legacy modernization

560
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:22,919
story starts exactly the same way every

561
00:20:22,919 --> 00:20:25,260
Legacy modernization story starts with

562
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:28,200
us not doing maintenance and operation

563
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:31,020
work when we should be doing it and so

564
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:32,220
the most important thing to understand

565
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:34,380
when you're doing a modern modernization

566
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:37,380
project is if our solution to the

567
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:39,660
modernization problem is to take out a

568
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:41,280
piece of technology we've been ignoring

569
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,080
for a decade and replace it with a new

570
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:44,820
piece of technology that we're going to

571
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:47,220
ignore immediately after it is up and

572
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:49,200
running then we are going to end up in

573
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,480
the exactly the same place within a few

574
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:53,400
years right we cannot solve a problem

575
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:56,100
that was created by ignoring

576
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:58,679
maintenance and operations which is

577
00:20:58,679 --> 00:21:01,140
putting something new in there right

578
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:02,700
so the thing that is really important to

579
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:04,200
me and what I structure my work around

580
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:07,020
is this idea of operational excellence

581
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:09,780
how do I Define operational excellence

582
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:11,640
well operational excellence starts with

583
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:14,580
goals right what do we want the system

584
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:17,400
to be able to do uh in software we call

585
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:20,640
this uh SLO a service level objective

586
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,559
I'm sure that's a term familiar too some

587
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:25,500
if not all in this room so we figure out

588
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:28,080
what our goals are what the system needs

589
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,280
to do and we figure out how we're going

590
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,620
to monitor it what we should see in in

591
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:34,679
whatever dashboards or logs we have in

592
00:21:34,679 --> 00:21:35,940
order to know whether or not it's

593
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:38,220
Meeting those goals we also want to make

594
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:39,840
sure that we've tested this system

595
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,659
particularly for failure like not just

596
00:21:42,659 --> 00:21:44,940
tested that the happy path works but

597
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:46,620
we've actually like deliberately shut

598
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:48,780
things off or deliberately sabotage them

599
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:50,580
to make sure that we know how it

600
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:54,860
recovers and it recovers correctly

601
00:21:55,559 --> 00:21:58,320
and then we make sure that the

602
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,780
responsible for keeping this system

603
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:02,760
healthy actually have the resources to

604
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:05,940
do it a lot of times I used to tell my

605
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:08,159
team when I was working uh heavily in

606
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:10,380
the federal government I was basically

607
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:12,600
running kind of like a SWAT team where

608
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,860
we would something would go wrong

609
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:16,020
something would would Crash and Burn and

610
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:18,120
we'd be sent in to another organization

611
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,860
to help them stand it back up and I

612
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:22,440
would tell my team all the time your job

613
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:24,780
is not to figure out what the solution

614
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:27,179
is and fix it your job is to figure out

615
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:29,039
roughly what the right thing is and then

616
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:30,659
find the five people who've been

617
00:22:30,659 --> 00:22:32,820
screaming into the void this entire time

618
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:35,039
because they already knew that and then

619
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:36,780
bring them here because what we're going

620
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:37,799
to do is we're going to make sure that

621
00:22:37,799 --> 00:22:40,260
the resources and the ability to do the

622
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:41,640
thing that they've always knew and known

623
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,559
were the right things right so you need

624
00:22:43,559 --> 00:22:46,799
to make sure that the people who are in

625
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:48,539
play to keep that system healthy are

626
00:22:48,539 --> 00:22:51,620
actually able to do that

627
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:54,659
okay so what does this look like right

628
00:22:54,659 --> 00:22:57,059
this looks like we break this down into

629
00:22:57,059 --> 00:22:59,220
three kind of phases the first is that

630
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:01,320
we set our goals typically with the

631
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:02,700
business side of the organization's

632
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:04,919
buy-in what is that value add let's put

633
00:23:04,919 --> 00:23:07,140
those goals uh in some tangible form

634
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:09,179
then we look at the system as it

635
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:11,280
currently exists presumably at this

636
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,600
point we've figured out how we're going

637
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,580
to monitor the system or we already have

638
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:16,380
an existing way of monitoring this

639
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:18,299
system and we kind of collect the data

640
00:23:18,299 --> 00:23:20,340
of like what the Baseline state is and

641
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:22,440
we compare it to our goals how far away

642
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,940
are we

643
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:26,460
and then we kind of structure our work

644
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:28,380
based on that where are we going to get

645
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:31,260
little incremental improvements in those

646
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:33,299
goals like how are we going to get there

647
00:23:33,299 --> 00:23:35,400
I'm a huge fan of like rather than going

648
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,200
for like the wham bam everything is

649
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,580
fixed now because we did this big

650
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:41,580
project going for like the oh if we we

651
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:43,679
change that I'll get a five percent gain

652
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:45,360
and we'll get an eight percent gain and

653
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,159
we'll get a two percent gain over there

654
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:48,960
and at the end of the day we're gonna

655
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,360
walk away with this huge boost in

656
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,700
performance or security or what have you

657
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:55,679
but we're going to do it in a very low

658
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:57,600
risk way because we sort of precision

659
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,700
targeted where the bottlenecks were we

660
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:01,260
identified where the bottlenecks were

661
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:04,620
and then we kind of went for each one

662
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:07,500
and then the last phase is like being

663
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:10,440
very honest about who our organization

664
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:12,120
is culturally and where they actually

665
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:15,179
want to invest their time

666
00:24:15,179 --> 00:24:16,620
and money

667
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:19,020
an issue and a question that comes up

668
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:21,419
quite a lot particularly with things

669
00:24:21,419 --> 00:24:23,280
like Cobalt is people will say to me

670
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:26,280
like okay Marianne so do we

671
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:28,500
hire a bunch of new College grads and

672
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:31,919
teach them Cobalt or do we rewrite all

673
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:33,780
of our co-wall into something else so

674
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:36,120
that we have a larger pool of available

675
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:38,400
Engineers that we can hire

676
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,720
and that's a really hard question

677
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:42,840
because I've seen organizations do both

678
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:45,600
really well and be successful with both

679
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,880
really well again I don't give a

680
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,620
how old your technology is if you have a

681
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:51,240
Cobalt Mainframe buried somewhere and

682
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,799
you're happy with it by all means like

683
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:54,360
let's keep it going all right keep the

684
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:57,179
dream alive for Grace Hopper right

685
00:24:57,179 --> 00:25:00,120
um but if you can't hire people and you

686
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,620
can't transition the knowledge and you

687
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:03,240
can't maintain the system and you're

688
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,440
just kind of like it's just sitting

689
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,700
there and like no one actually knows

690
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:07,559
what the Cobalt is doing or has any idea

691
00:25:07,559 --> 00:25:08,880
how to get it to do something else

692
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,460
that's the problem so it's like which

693
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:13,080
one of those things should you do well

694
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:15,780
it depends on as an organization how

695
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:17,700
good are you at retraining people like

696
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:20,159
how interested are you in investing time

697
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:22,080
and money and actually retraining people

698
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,120
if you work in an organization where

699
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,860
there this is not something they value

700
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:28,380
then deciding to hire a bunch of college

701
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:30,299
grads and teach them Cobalt is probably

702
00:25:30,299 --> 00:25:32,340
the wrong approach so you have to be

703
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:33,600
really honest about where the

704
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:37,140
organization has budget and can get

705
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:39,900
budget to spend time and energy with

706
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:41,880
certain approaches

707
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:45,240
okay so as the Cobalt story kind of

708
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,799
proves out there aren't any silver

709
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:48,539
bullets there isn't I don't really talk

710
00:25:48,539 --> 00:25:50,580
about specific Technologies and these

711
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:52,440
kind of talks because what worked for

712
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:54,059
one organization is not going to work

713
00:25:54,059 --> 00:25:56,820
for your organization necessarily but

714
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:58,620
the Silver Lining with the idea that

715
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:00,600
there are no silver bullets is that it

716
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,039
means that every single one of these

717
00:26:02,039 --> 00:26:04,260
myths that I sort of laid out for you

718
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:07,799
could work in a particular context so

719
00:26:07,799 --> 00:26:09,659
for example when people say our

720
00:26:09,659 --> 00:26:11,400
technology is too old and we just had to

721
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,559
get rid of it because it's too old like

722
00:26:13,559 --> 00:26:15,659
that's probably the right attitude to

723
00:26:15,659 --> 00:26:16,799
have when we're talking about Hardware

724
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:19,080
when we're talking about something where

725
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:21,179
the manufacturer for it went out of

726
00:26:21,179 --> 00:26:22,520
business or there aren't enough

727
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:25,440
manufacturers it's supply chain issues

728
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,360
that's probably the right attitude to

729
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,279
have right we talk about it's better to

730
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:31,679
completely rewrite this

731
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:33,480
that's the right attitude to have if

732
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:35,220
you've had some sort of fundamental

733
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:37,140
shift in your business requirements so

734
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:40,140
that the process that is is ingrained in

735
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:42,240
your systems is no longer the proper

736
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,039
process we see this happen a lot with

737
00:26:44,039 --> 00:26:46,260
like regulation changes like Congress

738
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:48,779
has like decided to sneak something in

739
00:26:48,779 --> 00:26:50,580
an Appropriations Bill and now you have

740
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:52,260
like six more things that system needs

741
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:54,000
to do like if that's the situation

742
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,340
you're in a rewrite might actually be

743
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:59,220
the right approach right and then just

744
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:01,080
replacing it with some sort of software

745
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:04,080
as a service or cots product you know if

746
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,760
that's a popular product that lots of

747
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,860
organizations use you get huge benefits

748
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:09,659
from that standardization you get like

749
00:27:09,659 --> 00:27:12,360
lots of eyes on it better turnover and

750
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:14,640
security problems so there are

751
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,860
advantages to all of these approaches

752
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:19,860
it's about figuring out which one is

753
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:22,799
right for your organization and for what

754
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:24,720
you have the resources to do and for

755
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,480
where you are at the time

756
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,279
and to put it more simply than that

757
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:32,940
technology is contextual right at the

758
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:35,100
end of the day technology does not exist

759
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:37,860
for the sake of having technology I know

760
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:39,059
that's sometimes hard to believe because

761
00:27:39,059 --> 00:27:40,740
there's a new iPhone every single year

762
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:42,299
so it feels like sometimes we do have

763
00:27:42,299 --> 00:27:44,580
technology simply for the sake of having

764
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:48,659
technology but we create technology to

765
00:27:48,659 --> 00:27:50,760
solve problems

766
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:54,779
and so different organizations can be in

767
00:27:54,779 --> 00:27:56,340
the same spaces

768
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:58,559
feel like they have the same problem but

769
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:00,299
actually have slightly different

770
00:28:00,299 --> 00:28:03,179
problems because of who they've hired

771
00:28:03,179 --> 00:28:05,700
where they're operating how much money

772
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:07,799
they have how much of the market they

773
00:28:07,799 --> 00:28:10,860
have all these kind of things and so you

774
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:12,779
really have to go with like what the

775
00:28:12,779 --> 00:28:15,600
organization itself values

776
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:18,000
what it's willing to invest in these

777
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,520
things matter a lot and communicating

778
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:22,620
why we're doing what we're doing we're

779
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:26,100
modernizing a system in the language of

780
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:29,400
those values makes a huge difference in

781
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,020
the ability of these programs to be

782
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:32,820
successful

783
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:34,380
but then the last thing to sort of keep

784
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:36,840
in mind is that even when you feel like

785
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:39,360
you know these trade-offs and you have

786
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,799
understood and you've mapped them all

787
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:44,100
out as the organization ages They're

788
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:47,039
Gonna Change like an organization a

789
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:49,440
startup of like under a hundred people

790
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:52,380
is a very different landscape within the

791
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:54,900
same organization five years later when

792
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:57,960
it's got maybe a thousand people and it

793
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:00,240
has way more Revenue which is a

794
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,820
completely different organization than

795
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:04,200
when it's now a multinational

796
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,900
corporation and it's trying to serve all

797
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:08,640
of these different regions you really

798
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:11,340
have to have this ongoing conversation

799
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:13,980
with your Technical Systems about what

800
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:16,080
value they're providing and how best to

801
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,700
deliver them

802
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:19,740
so that's it for me guys again I'm gonna

803
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:22,200
be at the pool at the Cabana signing

804
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:24,240
some books please feel free to come by

805
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,860
if you have any questions and you just

806
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:27,419
want to chat it was great talking to you

807
00:29:27,419 --> 00:29:29,899
all this morning

808
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:34,580
foreign
