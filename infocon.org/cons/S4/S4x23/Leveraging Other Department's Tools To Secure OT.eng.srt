1
00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:03,179
foreign

2
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:07,379
so today what we're going to ultimate

3
00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:09,360
goal of this talk is going to be to

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,400
provide you some ideas on how to save

5
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,139
time right and I think all of us can

6
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:14,460
agree that's something you know we

7
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:15,900
definitely want to look at is saving

8
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,580
time and how we're going to do that is

9
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:19,199
looking at

10
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:20,460
um different things that other

11
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:22,680
departments have that we can leverage

12
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:25,560
and utilize over on the security side

13
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:28,740
last year the woman in ICS conference at

14
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:32,460
the first um for the S4 conference I met

15
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:36,000
my co-author Ann and we realized that

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,680
although we work in cyber security now

17
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,840
we have decades worth of experience from

18
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,719
engineering quality sourcing and safety

19
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:44,579
departments and as we were listening to

20
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:46,200
people talk about the challenges they're

21
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,059
facing in security we would look at each

22
00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:49,980
other and be like well that information

23
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:52,200
is kind of compiled over here this team

24
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,420
grabs and you know this information is

25
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:56,039
over here so we wanted to be able to

26
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:57,899
share that with you guys today

27
00:00:57,899 --> 00:00:59,940
so if we look at what the first step is

28
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:02,160
in almost every security framework or

29
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,019
set of security requirements were

30
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:07,020
typically asked to look at and identify

31
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:10,200
critical systems and assets and so in

32
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,299
I.T security that's you know based

33
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:13,680
around the CIA Triad right

34
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,840
confidentiality Integrity availability

35
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,640
and typically that's our domain

36
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:21,060
controllers servers databases you know

37
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:23,400
key endpoints and then a handful of

38
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,560
devices that are particular to the

39
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,780
business operations but as we start

40
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:30,180
talking about OT security what happens

41
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:33,540
is safety comes to the Forefront of that

42
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:36,180
and then we start having that category

43
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:38,400
of devices that were critical to the

44
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,240
business

45
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:42,060
um business purpose that grows greatly

46
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:44,159
right becomes more complex and involves

47
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,619
more teams so

48
00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:48,479
um as we look at and see what the

49
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,460
different teams have available to us

50
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:53,520
that we can leverage upon then we can

51
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,759
save time and also identify you know

52
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:58,619
what is critical because to understand

53
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:00,899
what's critical and OT is to you know

54
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:03,020
understand the process the environment

55
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:05,460
where we can put typical cyber security

56
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:08,459
controls and in reality where we can't

57
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:11,340
right so making sure we understand

58
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:12,840
so the first tool I'm going to talk

59
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,660
about is um typically owned by the

60
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:18,980
engineering team it's a risk priority

61
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:22,319
tool and it's you know been around since

62
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:23,940
the 1940s you know it's one of those

63
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:26,160
oldie but goodies

64
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:30,959
and um so that one is typically owned by

65
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:32,280
the engineering team it's called the

66
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,959
FMEA or failure modes and effects

67
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:37,680
analysis so what this is um is a tool

68
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,720
that the team will go through and

69
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,819
they'll typically identify failure modes

70
00:02:41,819 --> 00:02:43,920
and look at okay how can these failure

71
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,060
modes

72
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:47,580
um fail what impact does that have to

73
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:49,800
the organization how what is the

74
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,780
probability of that occurring and then

75
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:53,940
how can we detect that so they use those

76
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:55,440
factors to come up with the risk

77
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,900
priority number rpn number although some

78
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:59,580
Industries lately are calling that and

79
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:01,739
relabeling as Industries and companies

80
00:03:01,739 --> 00:03:04,739
like to do action numbers

81
00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:07,440
so they'll do that do that and they'll

82
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,420
create you know a priority list of risk

83
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:11,400
but where the true value of this comes

84
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,260
in is that it's created by a

85
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:15,300
collaborative team of subject matter

86
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:16,560
experts

87
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,980
so yeah that team okay

88
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:21,120
um so

89
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,739
um and so these subject matter experts

90
00:03:22,739 --> 00:03:23,879
are most likely the people you're

91
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:25,680
waiting you know for an email back from

92
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,500
or you're you know trying to get to be

93
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,860
involved in your event or um and and you

94
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:33,599
know if you're doing like a cc

95
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:35,519
um e-e event you know trying to get them

96
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:37,500
engaged in that as well

97
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,300
um so they have already come together

98
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:41,940
and these are painful to create the fmas

99
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:43,799
right but once they're created they're

100
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:45,239
very effective

101
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:46,980
um so hopefully that team has been

102
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:49,860
bribed you know by lots of great meals

103
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:52,019
and unlimited caffeine and you know

104
00:03:52,019 --> 00:03:54,180
snacks but what they do is they'll

105
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:56,159
typically if it's a process FMEA they'll

106
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:57,900
start with listing out all the steps of

107
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:00,420
the process there's also product fmas

108
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:01,560
where you'll start with the bill of

109
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,000
materials with the components the sub

110
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,700
assemblies and then functional fmeas as

111
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,560
well so they look at those and they say

112
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:10,019
okay how can this fail

113
00:04:10,019 --> 00:04:11,640
and then they'll say how else can it

114
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,080
fail right so they'll go through and do

115
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,060
that but then they also list the

116
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:16,978
consequences of that failure mode and

117
00:04:16,978 --> 00:04:18,238
that's something that's valuable to us

118
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:20,100
right because if that's that particular

119
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,839
item has something that has connectivity

120
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,580
and stuff if we can see what the

121
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:25,800
consequences are if we were to say

122
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,139
create that failure with by you know

123
00:04:28,139 --> 00:04:30,560
stopping a process on the device or

124
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,300
quarantining you know a file on it or

125
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:35,460
you know isolating the device and we'll

126
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:37,740
be able to see what that affected that

127
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:39,600
failure and action would be as well but

128
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,479
they rank that with a severity score

129
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:43,919
and then they go through and say okay

130
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:46,199
what are the possible causes so that

131
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:47,639
would have you know created that failure

132
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:49,440
and they'll list all those out and then

133
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,880
they go back and rank and say well

134
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,820
what's the probability that that cause

135
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:54,960
um you know that that would actually

136
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,400
occur

137
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,680
and then they um go through and they say

138
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,360
how can we detect this like what

139
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,919
processes do we have control what

140
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:04,320
procedures you know what do we have

141
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,479
alarm set that would let us know that

142
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:08,040
this failure has occurred before we

143
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,680
realize the impact of the failure so

144
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,479
they do that and they calculate what is

145
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,460
the again the risk priority number

146
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:16,440
and that is all great information in

147
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,419
itself right like to have that you know

148
00:05:18,419 --> 00:05:20,340
we can we can look upon that and see the

149
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:22,740
impacts that we have we can start asking

150
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:25,020
the teams to look at in those causes

151
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:26,460
because right now they're most probably

152
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:29,160
looking at what I'd consider the you

153
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,320
know children of product liability you

154
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,000
know misuse

155
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,620
um mistakes

156
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:36,780
acts of convenience you know but not

157
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:38,940
really the intentional piece right so

158
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:41,759
maybe intention in the effect of

159
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,039
employee sabotage or competitive

160
00:05:44,039 --> 00:05:46,919
sabotage so being able to ask the teams

161
00:05:46,919 --> 00:05:48,780
to start adding those in as they update

162
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:52,740
or create new fmeas you know will help

163
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:55,139
one buy-in right so as you're adding in

164
00:05:55,139 --> 00:05:57,720
and you're saying okay what if the cause

165
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:00,960
of this failure mode was ransomware

166
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,340
which is the one we're all really

167
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:04,919
concerned about right so how does that

168
00:06:04,919 --> 00:06:06,720
change that and then that will move that

169
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,720
risk up in that priority list so the

170
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,160
team doesn't stop here though right they

171
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,440
create the priority list and then they

172
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,539
go through and if there is a threshold

173
00:06:15,539 --> 00:06:17,340
that they've set based on their risk

174
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:20,520
appetite of um we want to hit anything

175
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,560
that's above this threshold they'll go

176
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,000
through and they'll put mitigation plans

177
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,039
in place for that and then put any

178
00:06:26,039 --> 00:06:28,740
actions um make actions to that and then

179
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:31,979
re-rank all the different scorings so as

180
00:06:31,979 --> 00:06:33,600
you can imagine if you're adding

181
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,639
ransomware into that the occurrence of

182
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:38,819
that will be high right the severity

183
00:06:38,819 --> 00:06:42,060
will be high detection probably pretty

184
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:43,919
high so that's going to put that higher

185
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:46,139
up on their risk so whereas you're

186
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:47,940
trying to maybe struggle with them to

187
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:50,160
see the impact that kind of helps get

188
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,380
that buy-in as well

189
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:54,060
um as we're going through

190
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:55,800
um and with the fmeas you know how else

191
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,900
can security teams use this you know

192
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:59,220
they can use it to understand the

193
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:00,960
process the mitigations and the risks

194
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,940
and what the teams that are currently

195
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:05,699
supporting it um are struggling with and

196
00:07:05,699 --> 00:07:08,100
what they already have in place you can

197
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:10,319
use it to build out your risk assessment

198
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:12,060
so this tools typically meets the

199
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:14,520
requirements of any standards that ask

200
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,800
for a risk assessment tool so you can

201
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,720
use this and build upon it as opposed to

202
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,599
handing the team a blink slate and

203
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,639
saying please create this you know pay a

204
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:25,080
new portrait you're asking them to fill

205
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,660
in the blanks and then again building

206
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:29,520
out playbooks understanding what the

207
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,500
consequences is as you start having them

208
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,539
add in the cyber security aspects into

209
00:07:33,539 --> 00:07:35,940
the fmeas helps you kind of build out

210
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:38,039
those IR playbooks and then just

211
00:07:38,039 --> 00:07:39,599
providing context right you have your

212
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:41,639
asset list to your IPS

213
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:43,500
um your host names you know how how does

214
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,060
this fit into the process and

215
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:47,400
understanding that piece as well and

216
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,259
again the biggest I think impact it has

217
00:07:49,259 --> 00:07:50,940
is building that relationship with those

218
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:53,400
teams so you know you're recognizing the

219
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,900
work they've already done and building

220
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:57,539
upon that as opposing to ask them to

221
00:07:57,539 --> 00:08:00,000
start from scratch I think I see a

222
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,520
couple engineers in the the audience who

223
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,780
are kind of smiling and shaking their

224
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:05,400
heads on that

225
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:08,039
um so I've kind of talked about fmas I

226
00:08:08,039 --> 00:08:09,599
personally think their gold you know is

227
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:13,199
at Value but what if you know if you ask

228
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:15,240
and they don't have an FMEA so some

229
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,099
Alternatives you can ask for are process

230
00:08:17,099 --> 00:08:19,560
maps and value stream apps these aren't

231
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,879
going to give you the full picture but

232
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:21,900
they're going to at least give you the

233
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:24,360
view of that process so you can start to

234
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:27,479
understand the environment as well

235
00:08:27,479 --> 00:08:29,699
um also as we all know people like to

236
00:08:29,699 --> 00:08:32,700
relabel within companies so just ask for

237
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:35,039
risk priority you know Matrix and a tool

238
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,120
they use because they might call it

239
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,520
something else and then the sidepock

240
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,140
it's also a document that's going to

241
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:42,059
have the process and then talks about

242
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:44,159
the suppliers and inputs and then the

243
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:46,440
outputs and the consumers for each of

244
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,180
those and that would again give you at

245
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:50,339
least that Baseline often the sidebox

246
00:08:50,339 --> 00:08:52,560
and the process maps are the first steps

247
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,839
in the FMA that they use to list the um

248
00:08:54,839 --> 00:08:56,339
steps there

249
00:08:56,339 --> 00:08:58,260
so that's talking about kind of a tool

250
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:00,660
from engineering again to me that's one

251
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:03,300
of you know the the top ones that um we

252
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:04,560
can use

253
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,019
um what about safety and quality

254
00:09:07,019 --> 00:09:09,420
so with safety and quality unfortunately

255
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:12,240
right safety incidents occur and quality

256
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,240
spills happen I mean it's reality

257
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,279
um so these teams typically already have

258
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:19,140
response plans in place they

259
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:21,899
unfortunately have either been tested

260
00:09:21,899 --> 00:09:25,260
from necessity or they probably have

261
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:27,540
some compliance or policy reasons that

262
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:30,060
they've been tested so again looking at

263
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:32,279
reviewing those and adding and seeing if

264
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:35,100
you can modify them to include the Cyber

265
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:37,380
you know security piece as opposed to

266
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:39,839
introducing a whole new process I would

267
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,519
definitely recommend that but at a very

268
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:43,440
minimum I would recommend reviewing

269
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,899
these and we call them sometimes eight

270
00:09:45,899 --> 00:09:50,459
D's or pdca plan do checked act to see

271
00:09:50,459 --> 00:09:52,920
where if you can add in the security

272
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:55,260
team as part of the communication plan

273
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:57,839
so again on saving time you know if

274
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:00,120
there's a safety incident going on we've

275
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,980
shut down something over here instead of

276
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:04,260
the sock over here like noticing logs

277
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:06,420
aren't coming in start asking questions

278
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:08,580
as this team's trying to you know work a

279
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:10,380
safety thing they're already in part of

280
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:12,000
that communication plan to know that has

281
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,360
occurred and then you can move on and

282
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,760
also I would have them look at if there

283
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,560
is any safety and quality stuff and

284
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,839
there's after action reports have them

285
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:23,880
look back at the logs and see it it can

286
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,920
rule out whether there was any cyber

287
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:26,899
security

288
00:10:26,899 --> 00:10:29,459
impacts that could have affected that or

289
00:10:29,459 --> 00:10:31,380
cause that

290
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:33,180
so that's what safety and quality

291
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:35,760
response plans another tool that I

292
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,560
debated whether to put as a FMEA

293
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,300
alternative but I decided to put here

294
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:42,000
was Hazard analysis this is very similar

295
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,160
to FMEA but whereas fmeas are looking at

296
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:48,120
outputs to the processes Hazard analysis

297
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,640
sometimes also called JJ's or job Hazard

298
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,740
analysis they're more looking at the

299
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:55,140
safety and internal right so how it

300
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:56,820
affects and it protects our the

301
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:57,899
employees

302
00:10:57,899 --> 00:10:59,940
so these also can be used for CIS review

303
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:01,620
as well

304
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:04,079
so with safety and quality again using

305
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:06,060
Hazard analysis to gain an understanding

306
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:08,399
I'm adding a security teams to existing

307
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:10,860
existing response plans maybe

308
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:13,079
integrating in instead of building out a

309
00:11:13,079 --> 00:11:15,480
new one for security response plans and

310
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,740
then um

311
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:19,740
making sure that we review any after

312
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:21,360
action things to see if there's any

313
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,720
cyber impact that might have played a

314
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,980
role into that

315
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:27,660
so you'll see that I use quality

316
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:29,760
throughout quality to me you know kind

317
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,320
of throughout the organization kind of

318
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,899
like eventually Security will be

319
00:11:33,899 --> 00:11:36,120
um so the next one we're going to talk

320
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,880
about is quality and sourcing

321
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,920
so one of the things we definitely heard

322
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,540
you know before is you know third party

323
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:44,820
risk and how you know that plays a big

324
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:47,160
part into cyber risk so typically the

325
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,540
sourcing teams they're going to have

326
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:50,100
supplier score cards where they're

327
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:52,560
already touching base with and ranking

328
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,959
and providing metrics to the customer or

329
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:57,300
to the vendors with regards to typically

330
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:00,420
delivery quality metrics and then cost

331
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:02,100
savings because of course we're always

332
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:04,920
asking for you know just cost savings

333
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,959
there so this is a good place to go in

334
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:08,399
especially if you have roll down

335
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:10,680
requirements you can add those to the

336
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,180
purchase orders but you can also add

337
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:14,640
those metrics to the supplier scorecards

338
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,320
so that they're part of that already

339
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,420
it's the same touch point with the

340
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:20,100
vendor you're not confusing them with

341
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:21,660
additional requests coming from a

342
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:23,160
different team

343
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,779
um there's also vendor audits typically

344
00:12:24,779 --> 00:12:27,480
the supplier Quality Group will do

345
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,760
um I know being in supplier quality you

346
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,320
know you would go in you'd review look

347
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,060
at the risk sometimes we'd do the fmeas

348
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:34,860
with them as well

349
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:37,079
um but these are a great place too to go

350
00:12:37,079 --> 00:12:39,600
through understand as part of the audit

351
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,060
maybe add in the piece of what access to

352
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:44,459
these vendors have to our systems and do

353
00:12:44,459 --> 00:12:46,440
the audit there is you know is this

354
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,940
still relevant are these still the

355
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:50,959
people that should have access

356
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,760
so the other piece that sourcing has and

357
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,339
this goes into the Integrity right data

358
00:12:56,339 --> 00:12:59,459
Integrity is vendor documentation so if

359
00:12:59,459 --> 00:13:01,620
you're doing a product review

360
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:03,779
um you know you can definitely go to the

361
00:13:03,779 --> 00:13:05,820
engineers but you to know exactly what

362
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:07,440
they purchased

363
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,480
um the the purchasing team is going to

364
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:12,120
have data sheets and schematics

365
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,160
um there so just it's a good place to be

366
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,579
able to get that information as well

367
00:13:17,579 --> 00:13:19,500
so equality and sourcing you know

368
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,060
understanding the supply chain layout

369
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:23,100
and by looking at those scorecards you

370
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:24,839
know how we're evaluating our suppliers

371
00:13:24,839 --> 00:13:26,760
adding to that if there's stuff that we

372
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,500
need to add you know from the security

373
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,720
perspective I'm adding those cyber

374
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,180
metrics and then

375
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:35,160
um again adding the security team to the

376
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,500
response plans

377
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:39,420
that communication back I think

378
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:41,700
um would again hit that Saving Time a

379
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:43,740
lot and then tracking an auditing vendor

380
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,360
access through supplier quality and

381
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,220
sourcing tools

382
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:49,079
this last team we're gonna I'm gonna

383
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:51,060
wrap up and talk about

384
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:53,040
um is finance and I'll be honest with

385
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,240
you you know this is the one Department

386
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,860
I haven't worked in but it's definitely

387
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:58,440
the department I always Ally with

388
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:01,079
um to getting the buy-in I include them

389
00:14:01,079 --> 00:14:03,060
on any of my first trainings like if I'm

390
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:04,680
pulling out a new initiative or program

391
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:07,139
they're the first group that I train so

392
00:14:07,139 --> 00:14:08,940
that they understand and they can help

393
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:11,639
me as a stop Gap as other projects and

394
00:14:11,639 --> 00:14:13,500
programs are coming through if those

395
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,899
that allowed aligned with what my

396
00:14:15,899 --> 00:14:18,480
initiative is there so definitely

397
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,579
utilize them and then they have some

398
00:14:20,579 --> 00:14:22,320
interesting insights they can provide as

399
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,899
well because if we use the concept of

400
00:14:24,899 --> 00:14:27,180
follow the money they can provide

401
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:29,100
insight into existing assets that might

402
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:31,800
be out of sight out of mind right so we

403
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,540
always talk about remote locations you

404
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:35,760
know what's out there well they of

405
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,920
course know what was purchased you know

406
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,160
and what what should be out there

407
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,360
typically they'll have the teams go

408
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,980
through and do an inventory audit every

409
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:46,740
year so they probably have that list you

410
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:47,760
know that they're making can people

411
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:51,180
check only caveat there is if it's an

412
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:52,500
older subsystem that might have

413
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,120
depreciated so it might fall off that

414
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,680
list but at least you'll get a good

415
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,600
start there they'll also be able to tell

416
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,100
you what's on the Shelf like what have

417
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:00,779
we bought but not implemented yet you

418
00:15:00,779 --> 00:15:03,300
know what's coming your way and then

419
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:05,160
also you know just things that are

420
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,600
forgotten about maybe they never got

421
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,820
implemented so they'll be able to tell

422
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:11,579
you upcoming changes and get the you

423
00:15:11,579 --> 00:15:13,620
know what they've approved and what's

424
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:15,480
coming your way you know how you can

425
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,399
start preparing for that and again if

426
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:18,660
they don't align with some of the

427
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:20,220
initiatives you're having you can kind

428
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:22,079
of utilize them as a stop Gap as well

429
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:25,199
and then another area following the

430
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:28,279
money is looking at where we paid for

431
00:15:28,279 --> 00:15:30,540
calibrations and high value maintenance

432
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:32,699
right if we're paying for calibration on

433
00:15:32,699 --> 00:15:34,620
a piece of equipment that pretty much

434
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:36,180
means that the settings and that

435
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:37,920
equipment are pretty critical to the

436
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,740
business so definitely an area of risk

437
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:44,160
right for any studying manipulation and

438
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,260
then high value maintenance that if

439
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:47,880
we're paying high value and it's that's

440
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,560
a piece of equipment that you can't just

441
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:50,760
easily replace

442
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,980
so you know that's something that we're

443
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:55,380
going to need to look at and protect

444
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:58,380
um because obviously you know it's

445
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:00,420
costing a lot to maintain so those are

446
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:02,279
two areas that you know they can give

447
00:16:02,279 --> 00:16:04,620
you insights on that you might not

448
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:07,079
um you know thought of or you know had

449
00:16:07,079 --> 00:16:09,120
before

450
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,800
um so with Finance what can we you know

451
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,779
utilize them for again getting inside

452
00:16:12,779 --> 00:16:14,940
some less valuable based assets some

453
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:16,380
based on what was purchased and

454
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:18,300
following the money

455
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:21,120
um also another thing I look for when

456
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,620
I'm looking at that Finance team in who

457
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:24,240
to Ally with and you know build that

458
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,100
relationship with I always look for the

459
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:28,260
person that typically looks like they

460
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:31,019
work in it you know multiple monitors

461
00:16:31,019 --> 00:16:34,560
multiple you know devices on their desk

462
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,540
um and these are great also because

463
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:38,160
those those are the people that are

464
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,079
probably testing out any changes to the

465
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:41,820
Business Systems making sure they don't

466
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:43,199
impact because you know we have to close

467
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:45,240
the end of every month

468
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,399
um but also they're great to use those

469
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:49,680
in Pilot groups you know for your EDR

470
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,380
program for any beta testing or if

471
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:53,699
you're doing patching and you want to

472
00:16:53,699 --> 00:16:55,560
test that out as well the other thing

473
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:58,079
they can do is they typically know what

474
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:01,199
other people roles and systems have

475
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:02,759
duplicate you know that they've approved

476
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:04,919
for duplicate assets right so again

477
00:17:04,919 --> 00:17:06,839
being able to understand what other

478
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:09,419
teams like if there's a key engineer

479
00:17:09,419 --> 00:17:10,799
that had you know they've they've

480
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:12,359
approved three laptops because you know

481
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:13,740
they need to make sure they do these

482
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:17,280
using that second device again in Pilot

483
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,619
groups for EDR or this type of things

484
00:17:19,619 --> 00:17:22,079
you know you can get that a good input

485
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:24,660
on that of where those duplicate assets

486
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:28,740
are changes we talked about that I the

487
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:30,059
other person I'd like to make sure I

488
00:17:30,059 --> 00:17:32,340
know and I'm allied with is whoever's

489
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:34,160
approving the capital expenditure

490
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,780
expenditures requests or any project

491
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:39,780
requests as well and again aligning with

492
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:42,960
them but also getting to understand so

493
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,780
um you know if you come across an old

494
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:49,020
device right most likely the request has

495
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:50,880
been submitted at some point to get that

496
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,220
updated or changed and there's usually

497
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:55,679
an Roi right that's involved in why it

498
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:57,419
hasn't been or some kind of cost

499
00:17:57,419 --> 00:18:00,059
disparity so they getting that insight

500
00:18:00,059 --> 00:18:02,039
and that understanding as to why that

501
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:03,840
changes and and what it would take to

502
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,059
make that change get in place

503
00:18:06,059 --> 00:18:06,720
um

504
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,280
so that they'll be able to give you that

505
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:11,100
and then Roi again associated with

506
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:12,960
changes

507
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,559
the other piece there is if you have a

508
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:18,900
component right the the you can get this

509
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:21,480
from both finance and sourcing but a

510
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,100
component that has a vulnerability on it

511
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:24,780
and you're all excited because you're

512
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:26,400
like yes this is coming you know

513
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,200
becoming unavailable we're probably

514
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,120
going to switch this out soon

515
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:32,660
um there is a thing called Last Time by

516
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:36,480
and typically the ROI to do the

517
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,520
re-engineering retesting and you know

518
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,260
all that type of stuff to be able to put

519
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:42,480
the new component in place isn't really

520
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,960
you know cost effective so typically a

521
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,700
last time buy and I've seen it happen

522
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:49,440
many times

523
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,660
um purchasing will go by you know as

524
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:53,640
many as they can which could last five

525
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,200
years so whereas you from the security

526
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,539
team are thinking this component's about

527
00:18:57,539 --> 00:18:58,980
to be switched out it's going to fall

528
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:01,980
off our list you know just realize that

529
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:03,780
probably isn't the case and there's a

530
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:05,039
reason for it so they'll be able to

531
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:07,559
provide that reason and in that case you

532
00:19:07,559 --> 00:19:08,820
have to go look at that alternate

533
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:11,160
solution and then as I mentioned buy-in

534
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,660
you know including in trainings and

535
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:14,640
discussion for buy-in on initiatives and

536
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:18,480
alignment of projects to support those

537
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,520
so in summary these are kind of the

538
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:22,220
documents that you know I've suggested

539
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:26,280
that we look at I do recommend you know

540
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:28,520
obviously these help us and get a good

541
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:31,740
understanding more quickly right but at

542
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:33,120
the same time they would let any

543
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,039
malicious actor also get an

544
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:37,200
understanding so you know please make

545
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,419
sure that these are included you know

546
00:19:39,419 --> 00:19:42,660
you have role best access controls file

547
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:44,580
sharing controls and they're probably

548
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:46,679
included on your DLP or data last

549
00:19:46,679 --> 00:19:49,140
program as well

550
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:51,179
um just pulling it all together as I

551
00:19:51,179 --> 00:19:53,820
mentioned you know looking at the ROI

552
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:56,360
maybe that that would change something

553
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:59,280
realizing that you know cyber budgets

554
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,260
and operation budgets are there's a big

555
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:04,320
disparity there so um maybe that change

556
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,299
hasn't been approved right with the

557
00:20:06,299 --> 00:20:08,280
operations budget but going back through

558
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,960
and as I mentioned speaking the same

559
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:13,440
language in regards to risk by adding

560
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,780
um the causes of cyber security and to

561
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:18,600
the FMEA raising that up and then now

562
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,460
bringing the backing you know and the

563
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:24,000
budget of the security department to

564
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,340
that evaluate that change that might

565
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:28,200
actually make a difference and be able

566
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,240
to help the operations team and again

567
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,039
another way to align and build that

568
00:20:32,039 --> 00:20:33,419
relationship

569
00:20:33,419 --> 00:20:36,780
so I talked way too fast during that

570
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:39,799
but um

571
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,480
are there any questions because I went

572
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,039
quick and that means you guys got to

573
00:20:44,039 --> 00:20:47,179
save time and we'll get a break

574
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:49,020
sure you can go to either of the

575
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:51,419
microphones here yep thanks very much

576
00:20:51,419 --> 00:20:53,400
for the presentation and I I think it's

577
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,440
awesome to highlight how other other

578
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,620
teams can help the Allies

579
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:00,539
um there's some movement with the

580
00:21:00,539 --> 00:21:02,460
security Exchange Commission right now

581
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:05,580
in having more kind of dollar-based risk

582
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:07,460
assessments and security

583
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:09,840
and I really like that like Richard

584
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,600
searson's books on like how to measure

585
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,520
anything in risk that kind of gets to

586
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:17,220
the like the economic part of it for

587
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:19,200
finance teams

588
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,059
um have you seen them be more

589
00:21:21,059 --> 00:21:23,940
comfortable to like help engage to you

590
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:25,740
know to look at impact in the context of

591
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:27,780
like I loved your calibration example

592
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:30,179
for example you know but like an hour of

593
00:21:30,179 --> 00:21:32,760
loss on this equipment would mean X are

594
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:35,220
you seeing that more right so again I've

595
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:36,419
typically gone through and just made

596
00:21:36,419 --> 00:21:37,679
sure I understand how they're

597
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:39,360
calculating you know

598
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,760
what those changes and how you know how

599
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,559
what the ROI is right what they're

600
00:21:43,559 --> 00:21:45,120
looking at the other thing the finance

601
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,980
team will do it usually has some

602
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:48,539
interaction with the insurance side of

603
00:21:48,539 --> 00:21:49,799
things right so they've already had to

604
00:21:49,799 --> 00:21:51,419
kind of explain that

605
00:21:51,419 --> 00:21:53,340
um so I do find like if you find the

606
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:55,320
person that can explain you know like

607
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:58,260
how those are calculated so that you can

608
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:00,179
you know like then go back and say okay

609
00:22:00,179 --> 00:22:02,340
and present those numbers to them then I

610
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:04,440
definitely do see more collaboration and

611
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,940
willingness there did they answer your

612
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:08,120
question

613
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:12,140
go ahead Maggie

614
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,460
yeah thank you and great talk thank you

615
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:16,500
for giving it uh one of the the things

616
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,600
that I really appreciated seeing you

617
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:21,659
speak on is the FMEA uh component all

618
00:22:21,659 --> 00:22:24,000
this I know as a vendor it's a

619
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,559
conversation that we end up having to

620
00:22:25,559 --> 00:22:28,380
have sometimes where a researcher will

621
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:30,240
come and say Hey you know we found this

622
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,820
in your product and you know therefore I

623
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:36,240
could cause you know XYZ to happen and

624
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,900
it's it's really an interesting uh

625
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:42,000
Dynamic to have to go back to the safety

626
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,220
team and say hey can you pull the fmeas

627
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:47,159
for this and how do you see us best

628
00:22:47,159 --> 00:22:49,080
maybe raising awareness about that

629
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:51,539
dynamic in the community I mean it would

630
00:22:51,539 --> 00:22:52,799
be it would be my dream to have

631
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:55,080
researchers come to us and say you know

632
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:57,120
hey we think we found this you know can

633
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,280
you pull your FMEA and see if you know

634
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,539
this would have been accounted so I

635
00:23:00,539 --> 00:23:01,919
definitely think again you know these

636
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:03,360
are things security teams can ask for

637
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,460
but these are also things that you know

638
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:08,100
on the other side right we can realize

639
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:10,260
that they don't have the access to so

640
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:12,179
provide those I know when we would do FM

641
00:23:12,179 --> 00:23:13,980
Mas I always provide them to our

642
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:15,360
preventive maintenance team and they

643
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,159
would build the PM programs on that I'd

644
00:23:17,159 --> 00:23:18,840
provide them to our technical you know

645
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:21,179
writers they build the manuals based on

646
00:23:21,179 --> 00:23:23,100
that so just disseminating that

647
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:25,020
information to those teams so that they

648
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:27,780
can start you know having that awareness

649
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:29,820
um you know and then maybe not and

650
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:31,380
that's kind of the point right instead

651
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:34,320
of them coming to you with hey we have

652
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,299
you know this is smoking you know we

653
00:23:36,299 --> 00:23:38,220
always joke right you know you let the

654
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:40,980
smoke out you know it's it's not it's an

655
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:42,659
acceptable failure mode right we've

656
00:23:42,659 --> 00:23:44,580
already evaluated that the other piece I

657
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:45,960
didn't mention was some of the safety

658
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:48,240
testing you know that's out there I was

659
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,380
trying to keep it to the things that

660
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:51,360
people could easily absorb but you know

661
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,580
safety testing we we do extensive

662
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:55,559
testing right you know like if it's

663
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:57,659
