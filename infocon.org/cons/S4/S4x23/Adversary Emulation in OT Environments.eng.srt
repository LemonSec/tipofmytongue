1
00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:03,179
foreign

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:07,020
welcome to my talk on adversary

3
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:10,700
emulation in OT environments

4
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:13,019
so about six years ago

5
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:15,179
this pop-up appeared on a couple hundred

6
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:16,920
thousand different devices all over the

7
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:18,480
world

8
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,400
and what was striking about this was not

9
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,439
necessarily that you know ransomware was

10
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:25,320
a thing but just how broad and how much

11
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,240
of the imagination of executive

12
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:29,460
leadership it actually captured

13
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:31,980
because the very next day many of us

14
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:33,899
were asked this question

15
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:36,540
are we secure

16
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:39,300
so the the problem is is that Executives

17
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:42,059
don't really want to have that nuanced

18
00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:45,059
conversation of culture process and

19
00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:46,920
tools because ultimately like that is

20
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,539
what is required to answer that question

21
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:50,219
around are we secure

22
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:53,940
what they want is that yes or no are we

23
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:55,920
secure that thing I read about in the

24
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,960
Wall Street Journal can that happen to

25
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,640
us

26
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,020
well

27
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:03,239
some of the realities of answering that

28
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:04,140
question

29
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:06,720
and getting to that yes or no is our

30
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,340
people are strained

31
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:10,920
us on the defense side we have an

32
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,600
operations group that is struggling to

33
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:13,920
keep up at times

34
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,960
there's a lot going on

35
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:19,860
process is not necessarily guaranteed

36
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:23,040
and the tools including some of our very

37
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,159
fine vendors their tools may not do

38
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:28,500
specifically what you expect them to do

39
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:31,020
in your time of need

40
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:32,460
but that doesn't help us answer that

41
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:33,960
question

42
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,600
the question is are we secure because

43
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,700
the executives are still needing that

44
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,680
answer

45
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,960
so at OG e

46
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,560
about four years ago five years ago we

47
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,479
started down our path on adversary

48
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,280
emulation

49
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,960
there's a couple of reasons that we took

50
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,820
we went down this path

51
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:56,399
one we wanted to introduce some realism

52
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,140
and we wanted to be able to control that

53
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:01,439
realism and realism for us is we wanted

54
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:04,320
to be able to test the low-hinging fruit

55
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,659
we wanted to be more specific and

56
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:07,979
intentional with the things that we were

57
00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:10,639
going to test we weren't we could not

58
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:13,920
worry about those zero days and those

59
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,480
fancy things that we read on dark

60
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,459
reading and stuff like that we knew that

61
00:02:17,459 --> 00:02:18,900
there's a lot of block and tackling to

62
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:21,720
get to before we got to this point

63
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,959
we we knew we needed to be iterative in

64
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:27,300
our improvements there was not some

65
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:28,800
silver bullet like Dale talked about

66
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,140
there is not you know this big gigantic

67
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:33,840
Quantum Leap Forward for us it was going

68
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,480
to be a grind to improvements iterate

69
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,640
iterate iterate over and over and over

70
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,459
again learn our environment get better

71
00:02:41,459 --> 00:02:43,319
and we felt like we could do this as

72
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:44,940
long as we manage the three things that

73
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:47,400
we could control around scope frequency

74
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,680
and complexity

75
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,879
lastly we viewed adversary emulation as

76
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:56,519
an opportunity to develop our talent and

77
00:02:56,519 --> 00:02:58,319
develop our culture

78
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,780
because I think we all will send people

79
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:02,580
off to some really expensive training

80
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:05,160
class and may not get everything out of

81
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,319
it that we're expecting because those

82
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:08,580
individuals come back to your

83
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:10,379
environment with your tools with this

84
00:03:10,379 --> 00:03:12,840
with your own nuances and have to then

85
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,940
adjust to that environment so we figured

86
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:17,459
why why not just skip that part and get

87
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:18,720
straight to training in our own

88
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,760
environment

89
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,739
so that's why we went there now how did

90
00:03:22,739 --> 00:03:24,239
we get there

91
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:26,099
so our goal

92
00:03:26,099 --> 00:03:29,159
was to develop a process around it

93
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:31,260
and so it starts for us like midi threat

94
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:32,640
hunting programs

95
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,440
around you know some sort of

96
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,540
intelligence or a hypothesis of what

97
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:38,459
could go wrong in your environment

98
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:40,799
we take that information we develop our

99
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:43,080
threat we emulate that threat and then

100
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,120
we measure our tool response We Gather

101
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,700
that telemetry

102
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:50,040
we review that Telemetry we adjust our

103
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,560
tooling update our cmf update our

104
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,440
processes and then we the last step is

105
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,780
around automation of our response

106
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:59,459
this is the critical piece is we're

107
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:01,620
trying again to scale our people and to

108
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:03,900
drive those iterative improvements and

109
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:05,700
if we could just reduce one step of that

110
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:08,099
workload on our people we can begin to

111
00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:09,959
address some of the concerns that we

112
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:13,560
have around are our people taxed

113
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:17,060
so what does this look like in real time

114
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:20,160
so it starts with some sort of CTI

115
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,238
trigger

116
00:04:21,238 --> 00:04:22,740
and in this case

117
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:25,680
we're going to use the ecans ransomware

118
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,620
and ecans was interesting because it it

119
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:30,479
was specifically targeting electric

120
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:32,340
industry companies

121
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:34,800
and for us specifically it had a couple

122
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,540
of processes that we were kind of

123
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:37,860
interested in

124
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:40,020
and so we said this is a great

125
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:42,120
opportunity for us to take this this

126
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,460
threat intelligence convert it into an

127
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:46,919
emulation test our processes develop our

128
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:49,099
people

129
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:52,259
but we couldn't just say take take this

130
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:54,120
CTI report that we got from one of our

131
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,520
trusted vendors and do emulation we had

132
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,380
to translate that somehow and the method

133
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:00,419
that we chose is miter because it makes

134
00:05:00,419 --> 00:05:01,560
a lot of sense

135
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:04,259
our goal on our operations front is to

136
00:05:04,259 --> 00:05:06,240
move up that pyramid of pain away from

137
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,520
hashes away from IPS we wanted to go to

138
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:11,540
detect those ttps we wanted to push up

139
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:13,560
and so

140
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,479
the way we got there is we started doing

141
00:05:15,479 --> 00:05:17,639
these translations

142
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:19,259
and so now members of our operations

143
00:05:19,259 --> 00:05:21,419
team when they receive these Intel

144
00:05:21,419 --> 00:05:23,900
reports they'll actually convert it into

145
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:26,580
miter tactics we'll then build them into

146
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:28,259
the emulations and that's how we go and

147
00:05:28,259 --> 00:05:29,940
spin those up

148
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:32,160
and in this case specifically

149
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,979
the the tip offer us was around some

150
00:05:34,979 --> 00:05:36,840
specific processes in the report that we

151
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,720
received we wanted to go see if we can

152
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,580
identify if a service is looking for

153
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:43,080
those processes and then trying to stop

154
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,400
those processes

155
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,320
we also looked at this Mass grading and

156
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,400
so this is one of the very first

157
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,139
simulations that we ran in our

158
00:05:49,139 --> 00:05:51,240
Enterprise environment because we wanted

159
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,620
to be able to answer this specific

160
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:54,479
question are we secure when our

161
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:57,680
executive teams were asking

162
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,419
so we run the emulation you know we get

163
00:06:00,419 --> 00:06:02,400
our feedback out of our tools you know

164
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,620
some tools you know responded admirably

165
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:06,419
you know we got everything that we were

166
00:06:06,419 --> 00:06:08,280
hoping for some some tools miss the mark

167
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,620
and that's again okay because this is

168
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,419
probably where you want to fail this is

169
00:06:12,419 --> 00:06:13,740
where you can make improvements this is

170
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:15,060
where you can iterate

171
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:17,100
so we made those adjustments and we

172
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:19,620
created those automations

173
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:22,740
so everything's going great here

174
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:25,500
we're into the we're into the I.T

175
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,360
but that's not really where we're

176
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,100
ultimately trying to get

177
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:31,139
because most of us

178
00:06:31,139 --> 00:06:33,120
are crown jewels are in our OT

179
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,860
environments

180
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:37,199
so how do we go from this Enterprise I.T

181
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:39,900
environment towards OT for adversary

182
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,380
emulation

183
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,400
so much like on the Enterprise side

184
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,020
where we try to put some structure and

185
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:47,639
some governance and some guard rails

186
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:50,039
around our activities we wanted to do

187
00:06:50,039 --> 00:06:52,319
kind of the same thing but more specific

188
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:54,780
to our OT environment and so for us it

189
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:57,600
began with how are we viewing our OT

190
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:00,120
environment now as Defenders pretty much

191
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,400
all of us here have seen the image here

192
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,860
on the left around the Purdue model

193
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:06,960
the Purdue model is fantastic because

194
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,060
it's a great tool that can be used to

195
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:11,819
communicate defense and depth and what

196
00:07:11,819 --> 00:07:13,139
we're trying to do from a defensive

197
00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:14,460
perspective

198
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:16,139
but the adversary doesn't necessarily

199
00:07:16,139 --> 00:07:18,180
see it that way

200
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:20,460
the adversary sees it in areas of

201
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:21,720
opportunity

202
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,400
and so what we try to do is create a

203
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,139
translation between the two and say all

204
00:07:25,139 --> 00:07:27,000
right if I take Purdue but I try to view

205
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,860
it through the adversary's mind or eyes

206
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:31,259
and say like how how are they going to

207
00:07:31,259 --> 00:07:33,360
go and approach these problems we are

208
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,099
able to break the Purdue model down into

209
00:07:35,099 --> 00:07:38,539
three larger groups I.T makes sense

210
00:07:38,539 --> 00:07:41,400
beachhead and OT

211
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,680
and upon you know really looking at this

212
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,060
and thinking through this problem with

213
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:46,979
some of our partners we recognize that

214
00:07:46,979 --> 00:07:48,000
beachhead

215
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,220
that's really where we're out to defend

216
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:51,960
or at least that's where our efforts

217
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,699
should be until we're able to

218
00:07:53,699 --> 00:07:55,319
successfully defend the beachhead and

219
00:07:55,319 --> 00:07:57,120
then we can probably move down into more

220
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,280
into the OT space

221
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,319
so

222
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:03,599
that's all well and good how do we get

223
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:05,160
there

224
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,319
so the path OT starts with just an

225
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:10,259
evaluation of maybe our DMZ

226
00:08:10,259 --> 00:08:12,060
I'm guessing most of us in this room

227
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:14,460
have some level of DMZ a space between

228
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:17,520
your I.T and your OT space that's most

229
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,379
likely where the adversary is going to

230
00:08:19,379 --> 00:08:21,960
try to communicate outbound from so our

231
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:25,259
first goal was can we establish C2 in

232
00:08:25,259 --> 00:08:27,860
that environment

233
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:30,840
and so we took some miter tactics

234
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,940
we targeted some specific areas in our

235
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:34,380
environment

236
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:37,080
and we tried to establish C2

237
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,399
and we were successful because

238
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,799
ultimately you give it enough time you

239
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:42,719
can be successful but we learned some

240
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:45,540
really great stuff along the ways namely

241
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:47,940
we were able to test the efficacy of our

242
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:51,779
av EDR and firewall on specific threats

243
00:08:51,779 --> 00:08:55,140
and that's hard to do especially in this

244
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:58,200
environment so we now know that that

245
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,540
first entry into our beachhead What

246
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,100
specifically those tools are are going

247
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:03,240
to look like and how they're going to

248
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,700
respond to threats

249
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,080
and then we started learning other cool

250
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,839
stuff about our environment namely when

251
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:13,140
we try to execute some C2 using HTTP

252
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:17,700
versus https we saw different behaviors

253
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:20,580
now I don't know how many people in this

254
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:22,740
room have read the ICS cyber kill chain

255
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:25,200
written by Rob and Mike Asante

256
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,000
but there's a section in that paper

257
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,640
where they talk about the importance of

258
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,260
leveraging some of the complexities of

259
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:33,360
your OT environment as a mechanism to

260
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,700
defend right you have home field

261
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,740
advantage and so this is what we're

262
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:39,000
building here

263
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,680
we think about that home field advantage

264
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,779
thing a lot and how can we leverage that

265
00:09:42,779 --> 00:09:44,519
home field advantage to be able to shake

266
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:47,160
out the adversary faster or to perform

267
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,899
those disruption activities that we need

268
00:09:48,899 --> 00:09:50,459
to

269
00:09:50,459 --> 00:09:52,980
so we are identifying what makes our

270
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:55,320
environment unique how to leverage and

271
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,000
take advantage of that and in the

272
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,399
meantime we're developing Talent

273
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:02,100
which is not you cannot send anyone to a

274
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,540
you know a ten thousand dollar a week

275
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:06,540
class and have them learn about how your

276
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:07,920
environment is going to respond to

277
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,399
threats

278
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:13,260
so once we've established C2

279
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:15,480
we want to begin to turn our lasers

280
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:18,420
inward because if we're the adversary

281
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:20,459
beachhead is just the first step now

282
00:10:20,459 --> 00:10:22,500
we're wanting to get closer into that OT

283
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,240
we want to actually start to get to a

284
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:28,200
spot where we can impact operations

285
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,899
so this is the area we're targeting

286
00:10:30,899 --> 00:10:33,660
and uh you know we're running pretty

287
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:35,339
standard techniques

288
00:10:35,339 --> 00:10:36,779
we're looking for connections we're

289
00:10:36,779 --> 00:10:38,640
looking for system discoveries

290
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,800
information discoveries you know real

291
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,440
high level generic access operations

292
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,360
because we're new to this

293
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,980
we're developing this muscle we're

294
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,600
trying to grow our organization's

295
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,860
capability

296
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:51,660
but word of the wise

297
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:54,180
once you start facing inward you you are

298
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:57,000
going to run a risk of impact

299
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,800
depending on how far down you go

300
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,240
depending upon the systems that you hit

301
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,040
and so this is where we pivot back to

302
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:04,440
say these relationships

303
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,480
the control of scope the control of

304
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,579
complexity these are the things that are

305
00:11:08,579 --> 00:11:10,680
going to enable you to successfully test

306
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,839
these environments rather than just

307
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:14,880
hauling off and running an automated

308
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,860
emulation campaign where you're going to

309
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:18,180
test all the things and you're going to

310
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:19,740
beat up all your systems and then get a

311
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:22,140
report and go work from that everything

312
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:23,640
we're doing in this environment is very

313
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:26,760
targeted tightly scoped uh you know

314
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:29,399
reduced complexity as we as we grow and

315
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:32,760
develop our own internal capabilities

316
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,980
so other emulation campaigns that we

317
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:38,279
focused on was around our low Bass

318
00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:40,620
because that's what the Intel says

319
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:43,320
Intel tells us that adversaries don't

320
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,060
need fancy malware because we're

321
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:46,920
providing them all the capabilities that

322
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:49,380
they need and it's signed and it's it's

323
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:51,180
part of the Baseline and everything just

324
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:54,680
works it's all hunky-dory

325
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,940
so what we're looking for here

326
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:01,980
through these low bass activities is if

327
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:04,860
we if we are able to say

328
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:06,660
I'm performing this activity that I know

329
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:08,940
is malicious I'm able to detect that

330
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:11,700
activity we now know the adversary has

331
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,980
established some level of persistence

332
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:15,800
and that they have command and control

333
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:18,540
and our shift then moves into a

334
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:20,760
reduction of dwell time and A disruption

335
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:23,040
of any stage two activity

336
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,040
because in our opinion if you're here if

337
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,240
you're already that far down in the

338
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,920
environment and you're performing these

339
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,360
types of activities

340
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,339
you're likely an advanced adversary that

341
00:12:32,339 --> 00:12:34,140
is seeking to move into some sort of

342
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:36,420
stage to you know moving towards impact

343
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:38,399
operations or reading impact operations

344
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:41,399
and so even our response our process May

345
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:43,680
adjust based upon the types of threats

346
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,440
that we discover and where but again

347
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,060
like these are not things that you just

348
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:49,980
like wake up and do these are things

349
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:52,560
that you iterate towards it takes a lot

350
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,760
of discipline it takes a lot of

351
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,279
intentional effort to get to these types

352
00:12:56,279 --> 00:12:58,820
of capabilities

353
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:00,420
and so

354
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:04,380
the big observation for us too is around

355
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:06,360
just the the data collection the

356
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,639
Telemetry that we gathered

357
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:12,060
and uh we uh we like to think that we

358
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:13,380
have our own pyramid of pain on the

359
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:14,459
defense side

360
00:13:14,459 --> 00:13:17,339
because we're really good at logging all

361
00:13:17,339 --> 00:13:20,040
the things yeah storage is cheap send

362
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,959
that syslog stream over we'll just dump

363
00:13:21,959 --> 00:13:25,260
it all we'll do analytics maybe later

364
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:27,300
um but what we see is we collect all the

365
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:30,000
things we alert on some of the things we

366
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,040
block a couple of things

367
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:35,399
and so how are we now moving up that t

368
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:37,200
those ttps

369
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,200
or up that pyramid of pain similar to on

370
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:43,019
the uh on uh with the other

371
00:13:43,019 --> 00:13:44,579
pyramid of pain where we're moving from

372
00:13:44,579 --> 00:13:47,399
hashes and and IPS up to the up to the

373
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:48,779
ttps

374
00:13:48,779 --> 00:13:51,060
again none of it is accidental it's all

375
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:52,680
intentional as we're driving towards

376
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:53,820
that

377
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:56,220
and you guys are going to hear me beat

378
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:58,500
up on this one it's all manageable as

379
00:13:58,500 --> 00:13:59,880
long as you are taking care of the scope

380
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:03,000
frequency and the complexity of uh

381
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,959
of your emulations

382
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:09,720
but we're at S4 and no one really wants

383
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:12,300
to hear about access operations we want

384
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:14,459
to talk about impact operations and so

385
00:14:14,459 --> 00:14:16,440
we we've done a fair bit of thinking on

386
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,839
this uh and I hope I don't disappoint

387
00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:21,079
too many people with the ultimate result

388
00:14:21,079 --> 00:14:24,180
but uh you know there are some impact

389
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:26,160
operations worth pursuing and I'll tell

390
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,320
you why

391
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,459
probably one of the most important

392
00:14:29,459 --> 00:14:30,839
things we're doing right now is we're

393
00:14:30,839 --> 00:14:32,880
building a new lab

394
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,040
and we're doing a new lab specifically

395
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,040
to do impact operations but not for the

396
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:40,500
reason you're thinking we're doing this

397
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:43,380
fancy lab so we can start to develop the

398
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:45,899
security culture of our security or ICS

399
00:14:45,899 --> 00:14:48,300
capability with our security people

400
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:51,120
because like much of you we have I.T

401
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,500
security people that we're trying to

402
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:55,079
transform into OT security people

403
00:14:55,079 --> 00:14:57,480
we have OT secure or OT professionals

404
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,339
that we're trying to grow their security

405
00:14:59,339 --> 00:15:00,660
capability

406
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:02,040
and we're trying to develop the

407
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:04,079
relationships that will ultimately pull

408
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:06,000
us out of the fire in case one were to

409
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,459
occur because going back to the you know

410
00:15:08,459 --> 00:15:10,980
one of my first slides the process will

411
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:12,779
break down the tools will fail you

412
00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:14,940
ultimately it's the relationships that

413
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:16,500
are going to help you recover from

414
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:19,079
whatever you're dealing with

415
00:15:19,079 --> 00:15:20,579
so

416
00:15:20,579 --> 00:15:22,800
let's just say we're going to go ahead

417
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:26,459
and uh and and continue forward with uh

418
00:15:26,459 --> 00:15:28,560
our uh

419
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,240
our impact

420
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,860
so this is kind of what we would you

421
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:33,000
know still consider to be an access

422
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,639
operation where at this this time though

423
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:37,199
we're directly going after level one

424
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:39,180
level zero we're doing kind of same

425
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:42,420
miter tactics we're reporting out

426
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:43,019
um

427
00:15:43,019 --> 00:15:45,060
and uh you know here in our lab

428
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:46,440
environment

429
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,360
uh you know we would actually have the

430
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,279
adversary attacking the the units and

431
00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:51,600
stuff and so

432
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,820
I just wanted to take a pause on this

433
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:57,000
one and and say like we have struggled

434
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,699
to identify that specific value that

435
00:15:59,699 --> 00:16:01,560
doing the adversary emulation on a level

436
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:04,440
one or level zero truly provides when

437
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,420
you think about it in the context of all

438
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:08,820
the other stuff that's going on so when

439
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:11,160
you think about the uh

440
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:13,760
you know

441
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,260
I'm sorry I just lost my train of

442
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:19,500
thought uh when you think about all the

443
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,480
the different opportunities to improve

444
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,639
across the the various miter framework

445
00:16:23,639 --> 00:16:26,399
elements uh just in levels two through

446
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:28,860
four uh that that is going to chew up

447
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:30,600
all of your time

448
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,040
so

449
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,779
so in closing

450
00:16:33,779 --> 00:16:36,000
and uh well I really burned through this

451
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,839
one uh so in closing our adversary

452
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:42,120
emulation activities have truly been

453
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:46,680
focused on levels two through the DMZ

454
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:49,199
um our goal is to prevent access into

455
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:51,420
that beachhead our goal is to reduce

456
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:54,060
that dwell time to disrupt any stage two

457
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:56,699
activities and we do aspire to one day

458
00:16:56,699 --> 00:16:58,560
get further down into level one and zero

459
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,440
but we think that there's so much runway

460
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,779
here in the beachhead area that that's

461
00:17:03,779 --> 00:17:07,220
where our main focus has been

462
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:10,079
so in our wrap up

463
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:12,900
the people the process the tools those

464
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:14,339
are the things that are going to that

465
00:17:14,339 --> 00:17:16,500
that we're trying to to develop and

466
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,359
measure and grow through our adversary

467
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:20,699
emulation practices

468
00:17:20,699 --> 00:17:23,280
um we really focus on what managing what

469
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,980
we can control and everything we do is

470
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:28,860
around iteration uh you know continuous

471
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:30,980
improvements and continuous iteration

472
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:33,120
for our processes

473
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,600
so

474
00:17:36,059 --> 00:17:38,539
questions

475
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:43,679
so you uh you mentioned scope frequency

476
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,900
and complexity several times but what

477
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:48,840
did you really mean by that

478
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:51,480
can you what do you mean

479
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,880
so three times in the slides you you had

480
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:56,280
scope frequency and complexity and you

481
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:58,080
just sort of noted it as an emulation

482
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,360
but what exactly did you mean for those

483
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:03,419
three variables okay uh yeah so thanks

484
00:18:03,419 --> 00:18:06,000
Bryson I uh I did just kind of cruise

485
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,460
right by that one uh scope for us is

486
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:10,860
defining uh the attack service or

487
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:13,500
attacking the uh

488
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,299
What specifically we're going to be

489
00:18:15,299 --> 00:18:16,860
testing so are we testing a specific

490
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:18,660
system are we testing a specific

491
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:21,240
collection of systems what specific

492
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:24,840
tactics techniques or procedures

493
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:26,460
um you know that's that's generally what

494
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:30,120
scope is uh for us frequency

495
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:31,440
um you know there's some stuff that we

496
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,200
try and do you know quarterly with

497
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,760
Partners there's some stuff that we try

498
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,919
and do monthly just with amongst teams

499
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:41,640
and then we even have some uh some some

500
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,679
processes where our security operations

501
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:45,780
Personnel run these emulations on

502
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:48,120
individual virtual machines and so their

503
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:50,160
frequency is actually hourly that they

504
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,900
will go and run these like kind of mini

505
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:54,059
campaigns against you know antivirus

506
00:18:54,059 --> 00:18:56,280
tools or EDR tools just to kind of see

507
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:58,980
what the different variations look like

508
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:02,100
and so as we change our change our

509
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,260
frequency that actually also adjusts

510
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:05,580
complexity

511
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:07,500
so with a lot of adversary emulation

512
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,960
tools you can build kind of a sequence

513
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:12,299
of events and so you can get a really

514
00:19:12,299 --> 00:19:15,720
thorough and robust campaign but the

515
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,039
different measurements and the different

516
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:18,059
things you're going to have to look at

517
00:19:18,059 --> 00:19:20,580
afterwards is going to be a lot for your

518
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:23,039
teams to kind of digest and decompose

519
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:25,440
and so what we try to do is we try to

520
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,539
you know limit the scope and limit the

521
00:19:27,539 --> 00:19:29,280
complexity so that way we're testing

522
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,140
specific capabilities and specific

523
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:33,480
functions of our security stack is that

524
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:36,480
answer okay

525
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,580
so I'm going to ask a question it's

526
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:40,200
going to sound a little cynical and it's

527
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,660
not meant to be uh sounds like the

528
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:43,980
program that you've put together is

529
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:46,799
really cool and you're building out the

530
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:49,200
next generation of professionals with

531
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,940
this process you're giving them the

532
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:52,260
opportunity to really get their hands

533
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:55,380
dirty and see how to protect things by

534
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:58,140
seeing how to protect attack things my

535
00:19:58,140 --> 00:19:59,880
question to you is

536
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:02,520
have you found as you've built this out

537
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:05,000
that people are poaching your resources

538
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,919
and what are you doing about retention

539
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:09,600
to ensure as you're making this

540
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,960
investment that you're not just becoming

541
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:16,080
the the feeder for

542
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,240
um you know other other spaces in the

543
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,340
industry that well candidly pay more

544
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:21,660
than utilities

545
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:24,240
yeah that's a that's a great question so

546
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,940
I think the The General

547
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:30,240
perspective of my team and I I that I

548
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,380
don't necessarily want to speak for them

549
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:33,240
but I have an idea of kind of how how

550
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:35,400
they position themselves

551
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,200
um they see this as continuous

552
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,360
involvement with them

553
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,860
right and that's not necessarily

554
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:42,720
something you get everywhere

555
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:46,080
and so we I look I'm blessed to have the

556
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,760
quality of people working for me that I

557
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,799
do yeah we're it's a really special

558
00:20:49,799 --> 00:20:52,380
group and uh it's an intentional culture

559
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:54,360
right so like we talk you know I talk

560
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:56,100
about Talent Development because for us

561
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:59,220
we hire really we really try to focus on

562
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:00,960
the cultural fits and the people that

563
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,360
want to come and grow and look man we're

564
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,400
an electric utility or excuse me

565
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:08,160
electric company and uh so you're you

566
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,660
know the likelihood of people come in

567
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:11,340
and getting rich working at the electric

568
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:12,960
company's pretty low so the kind of

569
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,820
people that we tend to recruit

570
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:17,700
is kind of a different sort anyway

571
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:20,580
um and at the same time we're going to

572
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:22,500
continue to pour into our people and if

573
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:23,940
they end up going and making somewhere

574
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:26,820
else better hey that's great good for

575
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:29,880
them you know we we can't be afraid to

576
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,380
develop people for fear that they're

577
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:33,919
going to leave

578
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:36,799
so

579
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:40,679
but that's easy for us to say because

580
00:21:40,679 --> 00:21:42,480
the again like the quality of people

581
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,000
that we've somehow managed to find and

582
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,299
maintain is exceptional and uh and so

583
00:21:48,299 --> 00:21:51,120
I'm very lucky but yeah I I I totally

584
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,559
understand that perspective

585
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:55,220
thank you

586
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:57,419
um just to kind of add on to his

587
00:21:57,419 --> 00:22:00,720
question I'm an Oklahoman so to answer

588
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,820
your question differently he's building

589
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:04,260
a culture

590
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:07,440
in a team as an Oklahoman that there's a

591
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,120
lot of there's there's a lot of jobs in

592
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,320
Oklahoma but he's building an

593
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,000
environment where people may want to

594
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,100
work and he's helping keep that

595
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:15,419
retention I know I've known Ian for

596
00:22:15,419 --> 00:22:17,640
years but I now live in Houston Texas

597
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,500
and thank you for keeping my Oklahoma

598
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,720
power on that culture is so good that he

599
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,880
left yeah exactly

600
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,500
um so the people that do work for him

601
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:27,360
are working and staying and helping

602
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:30,840
drive a mission focused uh culture my

603
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:32,940
question to Ian obviously you're not

604
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:35,880
doing level zero level one monitoring to

605
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,280
the degree that you I mean I'm sorry

606
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,720
adversarial emulation to the degree that

607
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:42,059
you can share if you were a company

608
00:22:42,059 --> 00:22:44,760
looking to do level zero adversarial

609
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:48,240
emulation where would you start

610
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,220
where would I start if I wanted to get

611
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:53,000
all the way down

612
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:57,600
uh I mean like functionally like uh you

613
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,280
know low-hanging fruit where would you

614
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,980
start if you wanted to test something in

615
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:04,740
level zero ah I mean I'd probably it

616
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:06,539
depends on what the the Intel says right

617
00:23:06,539 --> 00:23:08,700
so I would probably probably start in

618
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:10,500
you know most likely are substations

619
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,299
that's probably be an area where I would

620
00:23:12,299 --> 00:23:14,280
I would go look at

621
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:16,200
um you know generation facilities

622
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,539
probably as well like I think that those

623
00:23:18,539 --> 00:23:20,700
are those are going to be kind of those

624
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:22,080
are the big ones right I would start

625
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,880
where I think that I could uh have the

626
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:24,840
most value

627
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:26,940
but again like each of these processes

628
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:29,340
are so different right and so like this

629
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:31,260
one sensor I attack it in one way it's

630
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:33,059
going to respond differently than if

631
00:23:33,059 --> 00:23:34,500
it's in another environment or at least

632
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,780
it will that it will show up differently

633
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:38,640
right and so then I have to figure out

634
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,320
that Nuance between the the two

635
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,659
environments but I mean it would it

636
00:23:42,659 --> 00:23:45,600
would be a I would look at what the

637
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,940
Intel says and then I would look at the

638
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:49,559
impact of the business and try and find

639
00:23:49,559 --> 00:23:52,200
kind of that happy medium and I probably

640
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,460
the other one that I would think about

641
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:56,280
is where do I have relationships that

642
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:58,020
will help me get into those environments

643
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:00,900
and and in a way like take care of us if

644
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:02,340
you know something goes sideways because

645
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:05,220
you know that could happen right if

646
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:06,780
you're not careful

647
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:08,220
so I don't know if this is going to be a

648
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:10,080
longer question but at a high level are

649
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,559
you using commercial tools are you guys

650
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:15,299
doing uh build your own

651
00:24:15,299 --> 00:24:17,460
so I was promised to not talk about

652
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:19,500
specific I had a promise to not talk

653
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:23,159
about specific tools uh uh I will meet

654
00:24:23,159 --> 00:24:24,840
anyone out in the hallway that wants to

655
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:27,419
talk tooling but what I'll say is we've

656
00:24:27,419 --> 00:24:29,100
gone through multiple tools we've gone

657
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:30,960
through multiple vendors and it took us

658
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,760
a while to find something that works for

659
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:35,700
us and we've looked at different stuff

660
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:37,020
um

661
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:40,500
the tooling question really is about the

662
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:43,140
uptake of your people right so what are

663
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:45,299
like what do they like to use

664
00:24:45,299 --> 00:24:46,500
you know

665
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:48,000
um you know we were lucky enough to find

666
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,679
a tool that our team has actually taken

667
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:51,600
up on right I think a lot of us have

668
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,100
been through situations where we bought

669
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:55,140
something got it installed and then it

670
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:57,120
just withered on the vine right it just

671
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,280
it never got used

672
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:01,380
um but to answer the deeper part of your

673
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:03,059
question is you know it's a homegrowner

674
00:25:03,059 --> 00:25:06,720
or vendor-led uh it's vendor and and the

675
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,460
reasoning is is that we talked a little

676
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:10,440
bit about the perspective of Defense

677
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:12,240
versus adversary

678
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,220
we don't have that adversary perspective

679
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:16,440
I don't think that we understand it the

680
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:19,080
way we think a third party vendor May

681
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:20,280
understand it they're probably going to

682
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:22,140
get it at a deeper level than than how

683
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:24,240
we get it and so having that

684
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,400
relationship to like help kind of Sanity

685
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,320
check us and it's like okay here let me

686
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,880
tell you how adversaries are really

687
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:33,059
working right that's valuable to us

688
00:25:33,059 --> 00:25:35,640
um and we're also you know we got a lot

689
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:37,559
of other stuff to do so homegrown sounds

690
00:25:37,559 --> 00:25:38,760
great and there's a lot of cool

691
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:40,500
opportunities and if I had the funding

692
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:42,120
to do my own red team like that would be

693
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:44,220
really neat but a lot of us don't have

694
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:46,200
that and so we got to find that kind of

695
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,539
happy middle ground so where we're at

696
00:25:48,539 --> 00:25:50,460
now is we've got this nice partnership

697
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:54,779
uh but it's led by my teams they build

698
00:25:54,779 --> 00:25:57,120
out the emulations they they they figure

699
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,679
out what they want to test and then they

700
00:25:58,679 --> 00:26:00,840
can go confer come back and run it

701
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:02,640
through and that's where we're getting a

702
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,380
ton of value okay I'm definitely going

703
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:05,340
to talk to you because we built it

704
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:06,840
ourselves and it's a pain in the ass to

705
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:08,700
maintain okay yeah so if you've got a

706
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:11,220
special solution yeah man you just

707
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:13,080
totally validated my answer I appreciate

708
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:14,640
that

709
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:17,159
thank you

710
00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:18,179
it's great

711
00:26:18,179 --> 00:26:19,860
um you talked a lot about training and

712
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:21,539
using

713
00:26:21,539 --> 00:26:24,000
which is an end product along that

714
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,620
process are there are certain parts of

715
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:27,059
the process where you see the lights

716
00:26:27,059 --> 00:26:28,679
come on where you see people actually

717
00:26:28,679 --> 00:26:30,779
get the risk and the challenge that

718
00:26:30,779 --> 00:26:32,820
you're trying to teach them to to be

719
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:34,500
alert to and to be motivated to do

720
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:36,360
something about are there certain points

721
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:37,860
in that process where you really see it

722
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:39,600
happen

723
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,039
could you repeat that question one more

724
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:42,960
time for me please so as you're as

725
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,340
you're running your people through this

726
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:46,500
process are there certain points in that

727
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:48,179
process where you see the lights come on

728
00:26:48,179 --> 00:26:50,580
where they actually get the risk and you

729
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:52,740
see that cultural shift yeah and how

730
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:56,039
they approach what's going on yeah uh

731
00:26:56,039 --> 00:26:59,059
uh I think it's

732
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:02,039
so what part of that cycle do they do

733
00:27:02,039 --> 00:27:04,380
they really seem to jump on so I think

734
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:07,020
it's the it's measuring the response of

735
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:08,340
the tools

736
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:10,080
because I think we all go in and we say

737
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,880
wow I'm spending a whole lot of money on

738
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,919
X tool and it's going to do all these

739
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:15,900
things and then you run this emulation

740
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:17,760
and you know that this process is Rand

741
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,440
and you see it go through and like you

742
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,179
know their firewalls logged it but it

743
00:27:21,179 --> 00:27:23,039
didn't actually kick you know kick off

744
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:25,140
an alert it didn't block anything you

745
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:26,880
just see go right through like swiss

746
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,620
cheese and you start to have that

747
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:30,539
realization and it's I think this is for

748
00:27:30,539 --> 00:27:31,740
my new folks like you have that

749
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:33,539
realization like oh my God

750
00:27:33,539 --> 00:27:36,120
these vendors aren't blocking all the

751
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:38,340
stuff they should be by default shocker

752
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:39,419
I know

753
00:27:39,419 --> 00:27:42,179
and so that's typically where we see

754
00:27:42,179 --> 00:27:45,020
that first kind of voila moment

755
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:49,320
for my senior uh uh analysts for them I

756
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:51,240
think it's seeing that repetition

757
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:53,159
right because we you know all of us can

758
00:27:53,159 --> 00:27:55,320
do something once but when they see it

759
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:57,000
baked into a process and they see that

760
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,400
continuous Improvement and like they've

761
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,440
been around long enough to know it is

762
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:04,220
the iterative step by step by step

763
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:06,659
improvements that actually will help you

764
00:28:06,659 --> 00:28:08,580
you know create that defensible

765
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:10,440
environment like that's where their

766
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:12,240
voila moment is

767
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,580
so it's it's high touch it's that kind

768
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:16,679
of continuous nature of the of the

769
00:28:16,679 --> 00:28:18,120
process that they seem to gravitate

770
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,080
towards

771
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:22,158
thank you that's a good question

772
00:28:22,919 --> 00:28:26,179
okay thanks everyone

773
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:29,520
foreign
