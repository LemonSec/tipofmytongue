1
00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:03,179
foreign

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:06,660
it's great to be back at S4 thank you

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:09,300
for joining me on a lovely afternoon in

4
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:11,580
Miami Beach on a Wednesday at 11 o'clock

5
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:13,679
I know a number of you are up late

6
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:16,920
I saw a number of you out I'm here to

7
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:20,039
talk about cyber physical biological

8
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:22,380
convergence or biological Internet of

9
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:24,539
Things

10
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:26,880
our national security our economy our

11
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,699
well-being

12
00:00:28,699 --> 00:00:31,980
requires a secure available Brazilian

13
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:34,559
biopharma capacity and supply chain to

14
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:35,880
respond

15
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:37,800
to the pandemic

16
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:41,460
to respond to biological both man-made

17
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:44,820
and natural occurring events

18
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:47,100
the current pandemic was

19
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:49,680
a grim reminder that we Outsource that

20
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,000
capacity

21
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
the services the system the ability to

22
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,420
respond

23
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,559
I joined one of the fastest growing

24
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:01,620
biopharma manufacturing companies and

25
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:03,899
the U.S really what the goal of

26
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:07,020
how do we bring that capacity back home

27
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:09,600
how do we create the ability to rapidly

28
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,439
respond to develop and deliver a vaccine

29
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:18,060
for again man-made and biological events

30
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:21,240
with that ethos with that goal we were

31
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:24,360
targeted from day one

32
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:27,679
and so I'm here

33
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,720
to deliver a call to action to this

34
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,580
community that we need to put in place

35
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:34,920
the people process and Technology

36
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,360
controls

37
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:39,900
to respond to this Brave New World

38
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,579
what does this Brave New World look like

39
00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:43,439
what's biological internet of things

40
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:45,840
it's it's everything we know about it

41
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,479
and OT the convergence of cyber and

42
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,939
physical all of those challenges and

43
00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:53,399
then we're introducing a new biological

44
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:55,740
system and there's kind of two ways

45
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,899
two waves of biological internet of

46
00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:00,180
things one way to think about it is the

47
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:02,159
current wave is we're combining cyber

48
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:04,680
physical biological to manipulate to

49
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,320
open up new exciting opportunities to

50
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,780
extend life to cure diseases to respond

51
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:12,840
to pandemics and events

52
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,120
so we have humans in the loop the next

53
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,220
wave is really about humans are part of

54
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,200
the loop

55
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:23,040
where we are introducing neural links

56
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,739
genetic engineering that enable us to

57
00:02:25,739 --> 00:02:27,980
advance that enable us new capabilities

58
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:30,720
enable us new advantage over competitors

59
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,180
and for both of those we're ill-prepared

60
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:35,099
to respond when we look at biological

61
00:02:35,099 --> 00:02:37,260
internet of things or biot for this

62
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:39,840
presentation we can call it

63
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,300
um everything we know about OT and it

64
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,340
convergence cyber physical convergence

65
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:46,019
so lack of encryption lack of

66
00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:47,879
authentication communicating and

67
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:50,819
vulnerable protocols lack of regulatory

68
00:02:50,819 --> 00:02:52,379
guidelines and controls all of those

69
00:02:52,379 --> 00:02:53,940
challenges are there

70
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:55,739
but again there are new opportunities

71
00:02:55,739 --> 00:02:58,560
and so this presentation is really about

72
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,420
the good bad and ugly and a call to

73
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:02,459
action to this community

74
00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:04,860
in the movies

75
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:07,620
when we are threatened when our when our

76
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:09,239
when Humanity's threatened when our

77
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:10,920
existence is threatened we put aside our

78
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,560
political and ideological differences

79
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:18,599
we allies and and adversaries

80
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:21,840
come together and we respond to

81
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,560
alien invasions and asteroid falling

82
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:28,860
UFOs or or balloons

83
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:31,260
we respond to candidate contagion and

84
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:33,360
pandemic we come together and I think

85
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,440
the story of the covid response in part

86
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,480
is something that we need to celebrate

87
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:42,000
is that adversaries and allies did come

88
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,739
together and we produced a vaccine in

89
00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:45,239
record time

90
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:47,940
my grandfather lost his leg to polio and

91
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:50,340
if you look at

92
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:52,379
you know throughout history how long it

93
00:03:52,379 --> 00:03:55,200
took us to develop a vaccine

94
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,120
if you look at how long it took us to

95
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,959
develop and deliver the infrastructure

96
00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:02,640
the three years

97
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,860
the record the amount of time that it

98
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:07,379
took us really was a miracle it was

99
00:04:07,379 --> 00:04:08,700
something that we need to celebrate it

100
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:11,720
was the good here of scientific

101
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:15,060
innovation of coming together the

102
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:17,279
downside I think the other part of it is

103
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:19,560
that the bad and ugly is that some

104
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,839
adversaries

105
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:24,720
saw this biological War this fog of war

106
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,580
and took advantage

107
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:28,440
so

108
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:32,060
what we saw during this time

109
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:34,860
at least in with our stakeholders so we

110
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:37,500
launched about two years ago I was

111
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,300
employee number 50 we have two sites we

112
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:41,400
have 20 sites now and about 4 000 people

113
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:44,160
our goal is to bring critical biopharma

114
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,919
manufacturing back home to create a

115
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:49,740
stable supply chain to create resilience

116
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:52,259
around biological iot

117
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:54,360
it's a new space

118
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:57,000
from day one we were targeted

119
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,419
has anybody here ever seen when two

120
00:05:00,419 --> 00:05:02,180
different persistent threats

121
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:04,380
well-resourced sophisticated threats

122
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:06,360
attack each other

123
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:09,080
anybody

124
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,320
I'm sure you have but you probably don't

125
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,600
want to talk about it that's okay

126
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,100
so I think I was like three or four

127
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:19,440
months into my job where some

128
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,540
run-of-the-mill ransomware group was was

129
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:23,639
doing everything that we see lateraling

130
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:26,880
around credential harvesting basically

131
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,280
setting up for a ransomware attack to

132
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,940
set to to shut down to deny our critical

133
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:34,860
manufacturing as part of the covid-19

134
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:37,080
response

135
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,419
a more sophisticated adversary again

136
00:05:39,419 --> 00:05:41,400
attribution is difficult they don't wear

137
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,780
a badge they don't tell us where they're

138
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:46,139
from a more sophisticated adversary did

139
00:05:46,139 --> 00:05:48,120
my dirty work and helped kick them out

140
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,639
help actually remediate and mitigate

141
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:52,259
that threat

142
00:05:52,259 --> 00:05:56,100
and we named the malware

143
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:59,639
that they left behind tardigrade

144
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:01,620
after one of the very few living

145
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:04,500
organisms that could survive a nuclear

146
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,900
blast tardigrade is resilient it's

147
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:09,840
promiscuous it's stealthy

148
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,900
very similar to the malware that was

149
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:15,000
left behind in our production our

150
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,979
control plane

151
00:06:16,979 --> 00:06:20,240
not necessarily to steal very valuable

152
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,740
IP and process on how we're

153
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:24,780
Manufacturing

154
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:29,039
the covid-19 vaccine but to potentially

155
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:31,440
allow one of those vaccines to be

156
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,720
validated in past quality checks and be

157
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:37,199
put in someone's body and cause harm

158
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:40,800
it is easy to respond in comparison

159
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,979
to cyber attacks reputational damage is

160
00:06:43,979 --> 00:06:46,560
very difficult to respond from so that

161
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,419
was tardig grade I was a couple of

162
00:06:48,419 --> 00:06:51,180
months in leading ICS cyber security for

163
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:53,280
one of the fastest growing biopharmers

164
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,319
in the country and we also saw during

165
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:57,120
this time that the frequency of the

166
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,699
severity the sophistication of other

167
00:06:59,699 --> 00:07:01,919
threat actors targeting this supply

168
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:04,199
chain be it the cold chain be it

169
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:05,940
manufacturing be it the production

170
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:10,500
systems ICS and OT increased

171
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:14,220
we were ill-prepared to respond this

172
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:15,900
space still from a regulatory

173
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:17,639
perspective is very much we're still

174
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:20,280
based on paper batch records

175
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,919
we have matured significantly from an

176
00:07:22,919 --> 00:07:24,960
I.T and OT perspective but we have a

177
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,759
long way to go so I'm here this is a

178
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:29,039
call to action the people in this room

179
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:30,120
you all

180
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,400
have the solution the people the process

181
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,199
the Technology Solutions that are needed

182
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:36,539
to fill these critical gaps

183
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:38,580
and I would argue that it's not only the

184
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:41,039
National Security

185
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:43,560
economy well-being it's our very

186
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,539
survival is at risk

187
00:07:45,539 --> 00:07:49,680
I spent um probably close to two decades

188
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,880
working on

189
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:53,400
cyber security r d in the lab space at

190
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,620
energy companies very worried about the

191
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:57,479
electric grid and staying up at night

192
00:07:57,479 --> 00:07:58,860
because there wasn't nerkship

193
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:00,120
requirements that the distribution

194
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,940
levels focused on the bulk grid

195
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:05,520
these are the same systems from the same

196
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:08,280
vendors that again weave together cyber

197
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,419
physical

198
00:08:09,419 --> 00:08:12,660
it and OT with biological systems

199
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:14,639
complex systems of systems that we don't

200
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:17,240
fully understand

201
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:21,300
part of our response has been we've

202
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,699
digitized and networked and automated

203
00:08:23,699 --> 00:08:25,860
these systems

204
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:27,599
and from a cyber perspective you're

205
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:28,979
probably thinking why the hell would you

206
00:08:28,979 --> 00:08:29,879
do that

207
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:32,940
why would you ever connect a system that

208
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:36,120
manipulates cells a bioreactor

209
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,399
fermenter chromatography water

210
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,559
filtration air filtration why would you

211
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:43,080
ever connect that to the internet

212
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,660
well part of it is a this digital

213
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:47,279
transformation of this space this was

214
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:49,200
also part of the opportunities part of

215
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,540
the reason why we were able to develop

216
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:54,959
and deliver a vaccine in record time

217
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:59,279
and so the opportunity far outweighs the

218
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:01,740
potential cost and only if I preface

219
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:04,320
that with only if this community

220
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,800
starts putting in place those people

221
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,140
process and Technology Solutions to

222
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:12,120
create resilience in the space it's

223
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:15,140
currently not there

224
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,660
when we start looking at Cyber physical

225
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:20,940
biological convergence again there's two

226
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:23,640
waves there's one human in the loop and

227
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,899
then the second wave is really about

228
00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:28,380
human being the loop So currently we are

229
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:29,760
manipulating

230
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,140
we are performing genetic sequencing

231
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:35,580
seeking what we're basically doing

232
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:37,980
genetic sequencing here

233
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:40,320
in a way where the upside the

234
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,320
opportunity is to extend life to create

235
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:46,380
to cure hereditary disease to bring

236
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:48,240
sight back to the blind it's it's

237
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,940
exciting

238
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:54,060
there I'm not a proponent to set up

239
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:55,740
blockers or barriers for that the

240
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:58,440
challenge is there's very few guard

241
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:01,200
rails and as we go through that life

242
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,180
cycle if we look at the protocols so

243
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:05,519
Health and Human Services has you know

244
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:08,300
50 different protocols for DNA sequences

245
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:12,420
that should not be processed well when

246
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:15,660
we put our hacker hats on it's very easy

247
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:17,760
to

248
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:21,600
come up with scenarios where we man in

249
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,720
the middle so we send a sequence that is

250
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,940
prohibited by Health and Human Services

251
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:29,519
to a bench scientist that processes that

252
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:30,540
sequence

253
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:33,360
we opsficate a sequence that's

254
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,980
prohibited that goes to a bench

255
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:38,580
scientist you name the attack there are

256
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:40,620
no guard rails there are no standards

257
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:42,600
there are no controls

258
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,640
for a space that we don't completely

259
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,100
understand and that is incredibly

260
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:49,640
dangerous

261
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,279
and a reef in the recent proof of

262
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:55,380
concept ethical hackers demonstrated

263
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:57,360
that again of those 50 protocols they

264
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,339
were able to optificate at least 16 of

265
00:10:59,339 --> 00:11:01,320
them they were able to get through

266
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,720
so again you have this bench scientist

267
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:06,660
there that's going to process that

268
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:08,040
sequence

269
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,260
and they are going to develop a deadly

270
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:13,500
pathogen that we don't fully understand

271
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:16,560
it's released

272
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,839
and when we look at this life cycle it

273
00:11:18,839 --> 00:11:22,140
almost reminds me of you know pre-june

274
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:25,920
13 2003 after the energy act where the

275
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,779
nerk sip requirements were for the you

276
00:11:27,779 --> 00:11:30,360
know bulk Grid in the early days

277
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:33,240
it was hey this is a problem there's no

278
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:35,220
modern organization that could function

279
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:37,320
without access to electricity

280
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,880
and in the last 10 years we have

281
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,860
digitized networked and automated these

282
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:43,079
critical Energy Delivery Systems and so

283
00:11:43,079 --> 00:11:44,700
we're going to perform self-assessment

284
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:48,000
we're still in the space where despite

285
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,660
the risk

286
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:52,560
we are in a space of these are

287
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,620
guidelines the guard rails are not in

288
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:57,600
space they're not in place to prevent

289
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,459
this from happening so again this is my

290
00:11:59,459 --> 00:12:02,220
call to action not only policy and

291
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:03,600
process but

292
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,959
how can we prevent these systems the

293
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:10,740
biot from acting from performing things

294
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:13,140
outside of what normal looks like I

295
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:14,519
think

296
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:16,980
with cyber physical Energy Delivery

297
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:18,480
Systems and other sectors it's a lot

298
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,339
easier I think what when we talk about

299
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:22,620
biot

300
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:24,899
the challenges these systems are random

301
00:12:24,899 --> 00:12:27,600
they're the output is stochastic we

302
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,600
don't fully understand the billions of

303
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,220
interactions that are happening inside

304
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:36,200
of bioreactor we probably never will

305
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:39,600
when we do an analysis a landscape

306
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,279
analysis it's a really interesting

307
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:42,839
findings and we've done this over the

308
00:12:42,839 --> 00:12:45,240
years we've looked at it and OT

309
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:48,000
you know we've concluded that you know

310
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,579
in the OT space and the CIA Triad we

311
00:12:50,579 --> 00:12:52,500
prioritize availability

312
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:55,139
in the I.T space if something breaks we

313
00:12:55,139 --> 00:12:58,440
take it down and fix it our life cycle

314
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:01,440
of how quickly we replace these systems

315
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,540
are very different our culture our

316
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:06,240
vernacular how we communicate threats

317
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,980
and vulnerabilities how we patch

318
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:10,560
completely different and so now we're

319
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,959
introducing a new component a biological

320
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:16,320
component that has

321
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:21,019
added to the complexity here

322
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:23,220
when we get together with other Security

323
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:24,779
leaders in the space we like to

324
00:13:24,779 --> 00:13:26,700
commiserate like that's our only output

325
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:30,600
here to respond because the tech moves

326
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,120
slow the regulations move slow I

327
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,820
recently spoke with one of our other

328
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:37,200
stakeholders also part of the covid

329
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,940
response also part of the critical

330
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:40,200
infrastructure

331
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,660
a CSO that had

332
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:45,420
15 000 end of life systems and I said

333
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:46,740
well what does your roadmap look like

334
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:49,139
how many of those systems are you going

335
00:13:49,139 --> 00:13:52,019
to update so you can patch so you don't

336
00:13:52,019 --> 00:13:55,139
have remote auth exploits into your

337
00:13:55,139 --> 00:13:57,300
production networks into your hmis into

338
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:59,040
your plcs

339
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,779
guess what the answer to that was guess

340
00:14:00,779 --> 00:14:02,579
how many guess what percentage or

341
00:14:02,579 --> 00:14:04,980
systems what do you guys got what do you

342
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:06,540
all got

343
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:09,540
zero percent spot on what would it have

344
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:13,579
cost to do that upgrade

345
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,940
generally impossible is exactly right so

346
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,920
the number I got and again this is a

347
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,660
high level number close to a billion

348
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:24,959
dollars 750 million dollars

349
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:27,720
and that doesn't even solve to some of

350
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,940
the interoperability and functionality

351
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:33,480
issues and so as profits as Revenue

352
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:36,660
falls for the biopharma space

353
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:38,880
this becomes an afterthought how can we

354
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,620
cut costs how can we improve

355
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:42,360
functionality interoperability increase

356
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,940
profits cyber security becomes an

357
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:46,860
afterthought

358
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:49,019
we were all told in this space that

359
00:14:49,019 --> 00:14:51,540
Securities priority zero that's what

360
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:53,160
you're you're told and then day one

361
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,139
happens and you realize

362
00:14:55,139 --> 00:14:57,420
that that's not the case

363
00:14:57,420 --> 00:15:01,199
you know growing from one site to 20

364
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:03,779
sites in two years from 50 employees to

365
00:15:03,779 --> 00:15:06,420
three thousand

366
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:10,079
when you grow by m a in acquisition you

367
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:12,240
do your due diligence everybody tells

368
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,019
you

369
00:15:13,019 --> 00:15:15,240
you're we're air gapped you have nothing

370
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:18,120
to worry about we're air gapped

371
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:22,139
you acquired the site you go in

372
00:15:22,139 --> 00:15:24,480
and then day two you realize that the

373
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,940
only air gap is between the ears of the

374
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:29,220
person that told you that

375
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:31,500
that's the space we're in and again this

376
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:34,199
is a call to action how can we

377
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:37,199
Design Systems and networks and

378
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:39,300
infrastructure that does not do things

379
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:41,880
outside of its predo Optimum outside of

380
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:47,040
an area where you're introducing risk

381
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:49,440
when you look at the regulatory regime

382
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,180
there's actually a lot of things that we

383
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:52,380
can apply

384
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:55,139
to other sectors like biopharma is a

385
00:15:55,139 --> 00:15:57,300
place that prioritizes integrity and

386
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:00,060
quality because ultimately these ICS

387
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:01,560
these OT production systems are

388
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,240
producing drugs that we put in our body

389
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:05,459
right like there's a lot to be learned

390
00:16:05,459 --> 00:16:09,180
from a quality perspective

391
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:12,180
there is a lot to be learned from a

392
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:14,040
physical security perspective and some

393
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:16,019
of these biosecurity level like higher

394
00:16:16,019 --> 00:16:19,380
level three and four labs and Facilities

395
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:21,300
the challenge being

396
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:23,420
you know for good manufacturing

397
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:25,980
practices as dictated and governed by

398
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:29,339
the FDA we have I think it's CFR 21 part

399
00:16:29,339 --> 00:16:31,820
11 that basically says data Integrity is

400
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:36,199
this bioreactor has a leak

401
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,759
as long as you document that leak and

402
00:16:38,759 --> 00:16:41,220
validate that there's a leak you're okay

403
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:45,320
it becomes a check to box exercise

404
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,579
when you're talking about manipulating

405
00:16:47,579 --> 00:16:49,680
cells and systems that we don't fully

406
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,839
understand

407
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:54,779
that becomes incredibly dangerous

408
00:16:54,779 --> 00:16:57,480
life cycle is similar I think again as

409
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:58,560
we

410
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:02,220
as profits fall and Revenue

411
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:04,319
you know equations change it becomes

412
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:05,939
more difficult so we need to actually do

413
00:17:05,939 --> 00:17:07,260
a better job of making the business

414
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:09,359
cases there's also

415
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:11,880
incredible opportunity beyond biopharma

416
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:14,040
that like we can look at safety we can

417
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,720
look at quality we can look at machine

418
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,939
State integrity and say

419
00:17:17,939 --> 00:17:19,859
there are a lot of lessons learned here

420
00:17:19,859 --> 00:17:21,780
we can apply to other sectors to

421
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:24,299
actually improve productivity

422
00:17:24,299 --> 00:17:28,280
reduce value at risk

423
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,880
one of the other challenges so this is

424
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,320
some pretty high level showed in

425
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,820
research I've done a lot of projects

426
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:37,679
over the year to leverage the platform

427
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:40,140
to empower small organizations that

428
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:41,640
don't have the resources to respond

429
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:44,280
another one you know another challenge

430
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:45,960
that we experienced the last three years

431
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:48,600
is that as the pandemic hit as the fog

432
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,580
of War hit we didn't fully understand

433
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:54,299
what was going on the 24 7 production

434
00:17:54,299 --> 00:17:56,400
life cycle did not change that was still

435
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,799
the equation so how do Automation and

436
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:02,039
control system Engineers continue to

437
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:03,179
produce

438
00:18:03,179 --> 00:18:06,000
they work from home

439
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,400
and so now

440
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,460
we're realizing our Revenue requirements

441
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:13,740
but we're significantly expanding the

442
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:15,600
attack service and so basically what

443
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,940
this suggests is that those critical

444
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:20,100
systems that lack basic encryption and

445
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,140
authentication that can communicate in

446
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:25,320
vulnerable protocols that have default

447
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:28,740
usernames and passwords open ports and

448
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:30,419
services how the

449
00:18:30,419 --> 00:18:33,120
bad and ugly that we know about with ICS

450
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:36,179
those are now being accessed remotely

451
00:18:36,179 --> 00:18:38,220
but thank goodness we're using a VPN

452
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:39,480
right because that's going to keep us

453
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,400
secure if we're on a VPN right we're

454
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:45,020
good we're air gapped

455
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,340
and so we've also created this false

456
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:49,980
sense of security that how we access and

457
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:52,440
operate and manipulate

458
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:55,320
these biological internet of things that

459
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:58,080
as long as we have a firewall

460
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,380
web application firewall

461
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:03,360
VPN as long as we have these security

462
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,400
and controls we're okay

463
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,380
but I think this is very much created

464
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:09,120
this false sense of security because as

465
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,520
we step back as we look how adversaries

466
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,720
are getting in

467
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,299
they're oftentimes getting in their

468
00:19:15,299 --> 00:19:17,700
attack vectors become these systems that

469
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:19,620
are poorly deployed or managed or

470
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:20,820
configured

471
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:23,400
and so this is the other challenge we

472
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,799
have is that as we digitize the network

473
00:19:25,799 --> 00:19:27,900
and unlock value as we move towards

474
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:30,240
infrastructure as code infrastructure as

475
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,580
Service as we move towards some of the

476
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:34,620
really exciting Cloud tooling that gives

477
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:38,100
us better visibility into our systems

478
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:40,799
if we do it the wrong way

479
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:43,320
we expand a tax surface that continues

480
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:46,020
to be exploited that keeps me up at

481
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:48,900
night but nothing more than this

482
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:50,720
what are the current security

483
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,840
requirements to operate a bsl3

484
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:57,240
biosecurity level three or four lab a

485
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:59,340
BSL three or four lab these are the labs

486
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:01,320
the facilities that deal with the most

487
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:04,520
deadly pathogens

488
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:09,780
any any ideas what the requirements are

489
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:12,780
are these Labs that are only controlled

490
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:17,120
and governed and operated by governments

491
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:19,980
when we step back and look at these Labs

492
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:22,200
there are no set of Standards on how to

493
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,880
construct how to commission how to

494
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:26,700
operate and secure

495
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:29,160
and so we are manipulating we are

496
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:31,080
playing with highly stochastic random

497
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:34,699
systems that we don't fully understand

498
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,760
and we don't have the controls in place

499
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:41,520
to protect us from ourselves it's not

500
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,280
all about

501
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,780
bioterrorists it's also about the

502
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:47,400
opportunity that hey if we get this

503
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,539
right

504
00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:51,240
if we deploy methodologies like gain of

505
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:53,340
function where we're tinkering

506
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:56,340
with how contagious a pathogen is and

507
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:57,780
why do we do that why do we the same

508
00:20:57,780 --> 00:20:59,820
same reason

509
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:01,980
we establish signature heuristics and

510
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:05,880
have malware appiaries and deploy pen

511
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:08,820
testing and Chaos engineering we break

512
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:11,520
things to build them back stronger and

513
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,960
resilient and we're doing the same thing

514
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,880
with the biospace with biological

515
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,820
internet of things I think the

516
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:19,320
difference here

517
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:22,020
is we don't fully understand what we are

518
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:24,059
doing

519
00:21:24,059 --> 00:21:26,940
there are 59 Labs 60 there's probably a

520
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:28,440
lot more than that at the highest level

521
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:32,039
of bsl4 so the most deadly pathogens

522
00:21:32,039 --> 00:21:34,320
a recent report suggested that only

523
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,960
about 20 percent of them pass basic

524
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:41,840
security basic security audits

525
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:45,780
were those security audits you all that

526
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:46,919
you know

527
00:21:46,919 --> 00:21:50,100
can get on Cali Lennox that can exploit

528
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:52,559
ladder logic and figuration changes do

529
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:54,720
stealthy attacks exploit zero days

530
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,240
exploit like with all of these systems

531
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,799
as we know once you get privileged

532
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:00,659
access to the human machine interface

533
00:22:00,659 --> 00:22:03,120
the beachhead which in this space

534
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:06,539
require have default passwords

535
00:22:06,539 --> 00:22:10,620
shared credentials once you gain access

536
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:12,840
you can turn off alarms you don't need

537
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:15,600
malware you don't need a zero day

538
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,000
the wrong command at the wrong time or

539
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,700
frequency and you can cause incredible

540
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:22,380
amount of damage

541
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:24,539
and a lot of this I think that's not

542
00:22:24,539 --> 00:22:26,460
even what scares me what scares me is

543
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:27,659
the

544
00:22:27,659 --> 00:22:30,299
altruistic bench scientist that thinks

545
00:22:30,299 --> 00:22:31,980
there are

546
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:34,500
tinkering with a pathogen with the idea

547
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,179
that they are going to come up with the

548
00:22:36,179 --> 00:22:37,740
next vaccine for the next deadly

549
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:40,020
pathogen before somebody else and then

550
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:43,700
something bad happens

551
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:46,200
so that's the bad and ugly I think again

552
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,940
there's a lot we can learn from our own

553
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:51,120
facilities from a perspective of quality

554
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,380
safety

555
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:55,260
of segmentation of water filtration of

556
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:56,700
air filtration there's a lot of things

557
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:58,559
that are done right here but again

558
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:00,900
there's no enforced requirement on what

559
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:02,820
these looks like the I mean this is even

560
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:06,539
happening in private bsl4 Labs I think

561
00:23:06,539 --> 00:23:09,720
in the US there's like 200 bs3 Labs does

562
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,700
anybody know what the number is

563
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:13,799
I bet you somebody here does

564
00:23:13,799 --> 00:23:17,159
and if you can say that's okay

565
00:23:17,159 --> 00:23:19,620
so Moore's Law is playing out is that as

566
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:21,000
costs fall

567
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,159
and the technology here becomes

568
00:23:23,159 --> 00:23:25,260
ubiquitous

569
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:27,600
we've become less discernment less

570
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,299
Discerning about how we secured the data

571
00:23:30,299 --> 00:23:33,600
how we manipulate these deadly pathogens

572
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,840
and it reminds me very much of you know

573
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:38,460
what was going on it reminds me of like

574
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:40,860
the 70s and 80s

575
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:43,500
when the hacking

576
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,059
you know movement

577
00:23:45,059 --> 00:23:47,400
when we had you know college dropouts

578
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,200
hacking mainframes that really gave

579
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,240
impetus to this personal Computing and

580
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:53,159
digital Revolution that's what's

581
00:23:53,159 --> 00:23:56,220
happening now most of these people you

582
00:23:56,220 --> 00:24:00,120
know have good intentions the biohackers

583
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:02,539
yeah

584
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:05,460
manipulating genetic material from from

585
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:07,559
a

586
00:24:07,559 --> 00:24:09,659
jellyfish to have glow and dark

587
00:24:09,659 --> 00:24:11,460
glow-in-the-dark beer I mean that's

588
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:13,380
altruistic right we deserve

589
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:16,340
glow-in-the-dark beer

590
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:18,900
the other side of that is again there's

591
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:21,360
not the controls in place and I don't

592
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,280
want to be all doom and gloom and so

593
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:25,740
looking at I'm running out of time here

594
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:27,600
let's talk about what we're doing about

595
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,780
the response one we're bringing together

596
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:32,700
industry Academia and government we've

597
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:34,740
launched two bio eye sex we're creating

598
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:37,620
cyber situational awareness to respond I

599
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:39,240
think the first part is just creating

600
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:41,700
awareness I mean this is a space that

601
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:45,179
three years after covid-19 first started

602
00:24:45,179 --> 00:24:47,159
killing people

603
00:24:47,159 --> 00:24:50,880
unlike the 9 9 11 attacks we we still

604
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:54,000
have very little information between hey

605
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,000
it probably originated in Wuhan it

606
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,559
probably evolved from bats like between

607
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:00,900
those two points we don't know a lot

608
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:03,179
and there is a lack of information we

609
00:25:03,179 --> 00:25:04,740
don't fully understand what's happening

610
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:06,720
and so by creating that cyber

611
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:10,080
situational awareness for biot we have

612
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,419
been able to better understand what are

613
00:25:12,419 --> 00:25:13,740
the controls in place how do we

614
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:16,679
prioritize our response

615
00:25:16,679 --> 00:25:18,600
the other thing we're doing is we're

616
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,940
taking a zero trust a true zero trust

617
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:23,460
defense in-depth approach to get inside

618
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:25,799
my stack

619
00:25:25,799 --> 00:25:27,840
whether your people process or

620
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,700
technology we have a more rigorous

621
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:32,640
process than NASA we have an s-bomb

622
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,679
program s-bomb is super effective just

623
00:25:34,679 --> 00:25:36,659
by asking do you have an s-bomb

624
00:25:36,659 --> 00:25:39,000
you know you just ask that and you have

625
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,440
a better understanding of whether they

626
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,960
have a secure software development life

627
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,159
cycle or not you have a better

628
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:45,840
understanding of their maturity just by

629
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,460
asking that question

630
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:50,100
we've worked closely with Partners to

631
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:52,860
automate to scale our ability to

632
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:53,720
understand

633
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:57,779
what we are using to manipulate those

634
00:25:57,779 --> 00:26:00,120
deadly pathogens what we're using to

635
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:02,760
develop vaccines and we've had some very

636
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,500
interesting findings

637
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:07,140
you know even you know one of our

638
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:09,419
cloud-based scada systems we found

639
00:26:09,419 --> 00:26:12,360
something that was not reported that the

640
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:14,279
company did not know about we were able

641
00:26:14,279 --> 00:26:17,100
to actually rapidly pass rapidly patch

642
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:19,320
and continue manufacturing because we

643
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:21,059
had those close relationships we had the

644
00:26:21,059 --> 00:26:22,559
communication we had the ability to

645
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:25,320
scale s-bomb we are deploying full

646
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:29,178
Telemetry through our entire stack

647
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:32,100
itot all the way down to we don't

648
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:34,440
actually trust that like we don't trust

649
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:36,360
something when it becomes a packet

650
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:38,279
how do we know those sensors haven't

651
00:26:38,279 --> 00:26:40,080
been spoofed or manipulated in the

652
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,220
supply chain

653
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:44,279
so we are taking an out-of-box approach

654
00:26:44,279 --> 00:26:46,980
full Telemetry through our entire stack

655
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:50,100
down to process oriented technology what

656
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:52,559
can we learn from the physics

657
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:56,340
to tell us that that device that system

658
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:58,980
has machine State integrity

659
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:00,480
we are also applying a lot of

660
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,460
methodology so

661
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:05,460
borrowing from inl the Cyber informed

662
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:07,740
engineering cyber consequence driven

663
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:09,539
engineering because we have limited

664
00:27:09,539 --> 00:27:11,580
resources and we need to prioritize a

665
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:14,820
response we need to secure and segment

666
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:18,600
we need to add compensating controls to

667
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,700
these critical systems especially

668
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:22,500
because they're manipulating cells in a

669
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:25,700
way that we don't fully understand

670
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:30,600
once we gain that Telemetry and better

671
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,640
understand what normal looks like not

672
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,679
only at the packet Network level but

673
00:27:34,679 --> 00:27:36,179
we're looking at infrared we're looking

674
00:27:36,179 --> 00:27:38,520
at Acoustic and then we're using

675
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:40,740
complexity instead of complexity being a

676
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:43,500
challenging a challenge we're using that

677
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:46,620
as we correlate if x then y this

678
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:49,860
Behavior doesn't make sense this P this

679
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:52,620
behavior deviates from a predo Optimum

680
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:55,020
we are less concerning of whether it's a

681
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:57,600
fault or an attack it's reduced our

682
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,240
efficiency so now in doing that and

683
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,820
taking an all-source sensing approach

684
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:04,860
we've actually solved some of the

685
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:06,480
business challenges and we can better

686
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,340
justify our spend

687
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:10,080
if I say I'm all I'm going to do all

688
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,720
this because I'm a you know crazy ICS

689
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,340
cyber security

690
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:16,620
leader I'm probably not going to get

691
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:18,179
funded

692
00:28:18,179 --> 00:28:19,679
I'm probably not going to get the

693
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:21,659
resources I need to do this but if I can

694
00:28:21,659 --> 00:28:23,419
say look

695
00:28:23,419 --> 00:28:25,799
chromatography cell counters have an

696
00:28:25,799 --> 00:28:28,559
18-month lead time

697
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:30,659
if I can better understand what normal

698
00:28:30,659 --> 00:28:32,580
looks like what a fault looks like what

699
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:35,000
your utilization looks like in procure

700
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,640
one of those systems before it burns out

701
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:41,159
I've saved a lot of money I've kept

702
00:28:41,159 --> 00:28:42,179
things running I've increased

703
00:28:42,179 --> 00:28:44,760
productivity and efficiency and so

704
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:47,640
ultimately what we are trying to do

705
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:49,500
we are working with industry government

706
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:52,080
Academia we're working with the digital

707
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,720
ghost team at GE to produce

708
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:57,299
an industrial immune system

709
00:28:57,299 --> 00:29:01,220
and the way we are

710
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:03,360
articulate and highlighting the value

711
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,279
proposition is oftentimes not security

712
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:07,320
it's like one of the few spaces where

713
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:09,240
we're saying hey we're going to improve

714
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:11,520
computational modeling so if there is an

715
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,080
incident we need to scale up batch

716
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:15,360
production we can run those complex

717
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:18,360
Dynamic models and understand

718
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:20,760
how it's going to impact production how

719
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,320
it's going to understand

720
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,480
utilization and these are complex

721
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:27,299
systems of systems where in the next 10

722
00:29:27,299 --> 00:29:29,640
years we we may not fully understand all

723
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:30,960
of those billions of interactions

724
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:33,179
happening in the bioreactor

725
00:29:33,179 --> 00:29:35,460
but we are able to correlate and

726
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:37,200
understand that networking at the

727
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,059
physics level at the acoustic infrared

728
00:29:39,059 --> 00:29:42,240
this is not normal this is not where

729
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:45,539
this system should be operating and so

730
00:29:45,539 --> 00:29:47,700
now we've improved modeling we've

731
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:50,340
improved per um we've improved

732
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:52,740
efficiency we've improved predictive

733
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:54,059
maintenance

734
00:29:54,059 --> 00:29:56,460
but we've also improved these very

735
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:57,840
stealthy

736
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:00,120
our defenses to these very stealthy

737
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:01,799
attacks that have been targeting us at

738
00:30:01,799 --> 00:30:04,200
the boundary conditions that's where

739
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:07,679
apts are able to lateral and exploit

740
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:10,260
these critical systems those are the

741
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:11,940
areas where we have gaps that's where

742
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:14,960
we're focused and again

743
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:19,620
this is a call to action to all of you

744
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:22,559
we're starting to develop the next-gen

745
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:24,600
solutions of the technology we're still

746
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:27,179
missing the policy we're still missing

747
00:30:27,179 --> 00:30:29,340
the process guidelines that we guard

748
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:31,440
rails we need to come together as a

749
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,059
community to get this right

750
00:30:33,059 --> 00:30:35,580
because this is that existential threat

751
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:37,080
that we saw in the movie

752
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:40,020
it's not the balloons it's the asteroid

753
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:41,640
that's coming at us and it's going to

754
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,320
wipe us all out if we don't figure this

755
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:44,520
out

756
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:47,760
this is the opportunity where we can put

757
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,380
aside political and ideological

758
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:52,700
differences to figure it out

759
00:30:54,419 --> 00:30:56,100
when you're developing your own digital

760
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:57,480
strategy

761
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:59,039
you have to understand what's the

762
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:00,899
problem you want to solve

763
00:31:00,899 --> 00:31:02,460
I've heard in a couple of presentations

764
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:05,100
that did the data is the new gold it's

765
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:07,740
the new oil when in fact it's a lot more

766
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:09,559
like water

767
00:31:09,559 --> 00:31:12,360
97 of the earth's surface is covered by

768
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:14,880
water and only two three percent of that

769
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,919
is consumable

770
00:31:16,919 --> 00:31:18,779
the same thing with data what's the

771
00:31:18,779 --> 00:31:21,419
challenge that you want to solve what

772
00:31:21,419 --> 00:31:22,860
does normal look like what does The

773
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:24,840
Fault look like how can we Design

774
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:28,320
Systems that not only advance and

775
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,960
improve productivity but do not go

776
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:33,299
outside of an area that jeopardizes

777
00:31:33,299 --> 00:31:35,700
their machine State integrity

778
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:38,820
so when you think of your digital twin

779
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:41,100
strategy which is essentially how do you

780
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:42,419
create a high fidelity virtual

781
00:31:42,419 --> 00:31:45,120
representation of your things of your

782
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,220
network of your critical systems

783
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:49,440
make sure you know what problem you want

784
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,120
to solve

785
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:54,779
and then finally again we're deploying a

786
00:31:54,779 --> 00:31:56,820
lot of machine learning to better

787
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:59,700
understand inference and correlation if

788
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:02,520
x then y but if we don't understand how

789
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:05,399
it's arriving at its conclusion

790
00:32:05,399 --> 00:32:08,700
if we are assuming that it's arriving at

791
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:10,260
the answer that we need we have to be

792
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:12,360
very careful and that's only for the

793
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:14,940
first wave of biological Internet of

794
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:18,179
Things the second wave when all of your

795
00:32:18,179 --> 00:32:20,700
competitors have a neural link

796
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:25,320
chat gbt 7.0 enabled

797
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:27,899
we have to make sure we understand how

798
00:32:27,899 --> 00:32:29,880
those Learners how those algorithms are

799
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:32,460
on arriving at their conclusions

800
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:34,620
have they been poisons have they been

801
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:36,179
biased what are the guard rails right

802
00:32:36,179 --> 00:32:39,299
now to stop us very soon even if we're

803
00:32:39,299 --> 00:32:40,620
completely

804
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:42,659
diametrically opposed to some type of

805
00:32:42,659 --> 00:32:44,940
neural link if all of our competitors if

806
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:46,559
our adversaries have a neural link

807
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:48,539
that's chat CBT enabled we'll have to

808
00:32:48,539 --> 00:32:50,760
make that decision we've already had to

809
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,500
make the decision when

810
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:55,679
like consider autopilot for most planes

811
00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:57,659
fly themselves well when you have a

812
00:32:57,659 --> 00:32:59,760
suicidal pilot that turns off the

813
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:02,460
autopilot no sides and kills what

814
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:03,960
happened with the German pilot two three

815
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,880
years ago a couple hundred people on a

816
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:08,520
commercial flight soon we are going to

817
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:11,340
be in a space where autonomous human

818
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:14,399
machine teams and systems the whole lens

819
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:16,200
and philosophy behind that is like it's

820
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:18,000
not only how do we trust the machines

821
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,120
how do they trust us

822
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:23,940
third wave AI contextual AI it's it's

823
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:27,120
upon a sentient AI Singularity we are

824
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,559
going to have to address these things

825
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:31,260
very soon this is the second wave of

826
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:33,120
biological internet of things that we

827
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,559
are not prepared to answer and I'll

828
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:37,080
conclude with we're also stepping back

829
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:38,940
and looking at a lot of these systems a

830
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:40,140
lot of the solutions a lot of the

831
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:41,760
wearables a lot of the apps and saying

832
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:42,720
look

833
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:45,600
we're tired of being the product we've

834
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:48,299
collected and aggregated and sold

835
00:33:48,299 --> 00:33:50,880
these data sets and we've become the

836
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:53,940
product how do we gain insight

837
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:57,000
from these from these prodigious data

838
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,100
sets without

839
00:33:58,100 --> 00:34:01,620
sacrificing our our identity

840
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:03,779
and so we need to move towards more of a

841
00:34:03,779 --> 00:34:06,960
privacy preserving space especially as

842
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,699
we collect Aggregate and share our own

843
00:34:08,699 --> 00:34:10,260
source code

844
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:13,440
I'll conclude with you know I shared my

845
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:16,320
own source code I I shared my my DNA my

846
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,719
genomic data to better understand I

847
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:20,339
wanted to understand where my ancestry

848
00:34:20,339 --> 00:34:22,199
was fun

849
00:34:22,199 --> 00:34:24,480
and I got the results and it reaffirmed

850
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:27,119
that I was 100 pirate all my relatives

851
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:29,780
were pirates

852
00:34:30,659 --> 00:34:32,879
but more seriously

853
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:34,980
how many of you would share source code

854
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:37,739
for a kinetic weapons platform or other

855
00:34:37,739 --> 00:34:39,839
sensitive infrastructure that's what

856
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:40,800
we're doing

857
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,080
we don't have the guard rails we don't

858
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:45,239
have the policies process and Technology

859
00:34:45,239 --> 00:34:48,300
to respond this is a call to action

860
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:49,980
and it's not just our national security

861
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:51,899
it's not just our economy it's not just

862
00:34:51,899 --> 00:34:54,780
our well-being it's our survival and you

863
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:56,940
all have the answers and we need to

864
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:58,440
start moving that direction fast because

865
00:34:58,440 --> 00:34:59,580
we're not there

866
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:00,760
thank you so much

867
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:05,969
[Applause]
