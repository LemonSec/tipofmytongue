1
00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:03,179
foreign

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:07,379
get right into this everybody ICS is

3
00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:09,840
doing threat intelligence wrong okay

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,400
that's my hot take let me tell you what

5
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,740
I mean so right now in the current state

6
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:17,039
something happens so maybe there's a

7
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:19,199
vendor type security vendor company who

8
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:20,880
has some researchers who come up with

9
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,520
something new maybe gosh forbid there's

10
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:24,660
something that actually happens in

11
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:27,240
attack against ICS systems what happens

12
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:29,820
is either your vendor or maybe your

13
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:32,399
internal team will will ingest this

14
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:35,160
information will regurgitate it write it

15
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,320
up a little bit more put their own

16
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,780
threat group names on it put an opinion

17
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:41,460
dressed up as an assessment slap it on

18
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:43,620
they're good to go out the door but the

19
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:45,360
problem with this approach it's not

20
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,120
inherently bad but it's really passive

21
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:51,300
it's really reactive so either you are

22
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:54,059
the news you are the problem or you're

23
00:00:54,059 --> 00:00:55,680
just reading the news there's nothing

24
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,120
that you're doing that's moving

25
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,460
everything a step forward so what we

26
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:01,680
want to do is we want to take a more

27
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,440
a more proactive approach to threat

28
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,060
intelligence using a couple more

29
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:07,820
traditional intelligence

30
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:11,220
routes as it were so what I want to talk

31
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:12,780
about today is Target tiering and just

32
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:14,640
really quick before I go any further a

33
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,260
little disclaimer I am speaking today

34
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:18,659
just as an individual I am not

35
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:20,520
associated with employers past present

36
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:23,460
or future I am just speaking as me any

37
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:25,200
examples that I give are examples from

38
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,400
research that I've done that's been

39
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,259
publicly published

40
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:29,820
um and so there is nothing there's just

41
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:33,659
me today guys nothing else so and this

42
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:35,400
is a process that I just came up with as

43
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,860
an individual while learning about and

44
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:39,659
working through ICS specific problem

45
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:42,960
sets so targeteering as a concept is not

46
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,659
new it's a military concept it's really

47
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:48,720
somebody who is responsible for planning

48
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,340
and coordinating these bombardment style

49
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:52,979
attacks but don't let this kind of

50
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:55,259
military background be a barrier to

51
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:57,720
entry I have no military background and

52
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,880
I do this this is an Air Force specific

53
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:02,280
term but really it you can take this

54
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,960
approach to your work with any

55
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,460
background that you have

56
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:08,639
so targeteering

57
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:11,940
is is all about to find of all about

58
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:14,819
identifying key dependencies so you can

59
00:02:14,819 --> 00:02:15,900
do this both on the battlefield

60
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,520
obviously if you're in the military or

61
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,599
you can do it within critical

62
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:20,700
infrastructure so let's define what a

63
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:22,140
key dependency is because that's really

64
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:24,840
what the talk is built on a dependency

65
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:27,540
by definition is a noun right so it's a

66
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:30,000
person a place or a thing a key

67
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,580
dependency is an identification of a

68
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:34,739
single point of failure so it's a person

69
00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:37,739
place a person a place or a thing that

70
00:02:37,739 --> 00:02:39,900
if it goes down everything goes down

71
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:43,319
we're in trouble so this could be uh you

72
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:44,640
know it could be a person it could be a

73
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,319
controller a control engineer in a

74
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:48,599
control room it could be a place where a

75
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:50,640
bunch of pipelines all converge into one

76
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,340
bigger pipeline or it could be an actual

77
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:54,959
piece of technology so that's like an

78
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:58,140
actual HMI or a PLC something like that

79
00:02:58,140 --> 00:02:59,940
so when you're working with key

80
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:02,040
dependencies what you can do is you can

81
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:04,860
use them to create hypotheses right so

82
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:07,319
you're saying my hypothesis is that if I

83
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:11,040
Target X thing y fails y shuts down and

84
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,900
so there's five simple steps that I've

85
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,519
come up with when I'm actually moving

86
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:17,220
through this process to Define where you

87
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:20,159
start and where you stop so before I

88
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:21,720
jump into this slide as another note

89
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,220
when you're working through this process

90
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:25,620
I highly recommend using something that

91
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:28,680
will let you keep track of your data so

92
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,599
you want something that will help you if

93
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:32,159
you need to look back later in the

94
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:33,720
future and be like oh my gosh you know I

95
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,280
totally forgot about where I got this

96
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,019
piece of information from so OneNote

97
00:03:37,019 --> 00:03:38,700
multigo whatever works for your brain

98
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:40,319
even if it's just keeping up a Word

99
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:42,360
document that you keep saving so you can

100
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:45,840
look back later and that helps you when

101
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,400
you want to do if this leads to a

102
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,440
write-up in the end it helps you draw

103
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,420
back to that as well so the first thing

104
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:52,560
you want to do is you want to select

105
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,200
your broad Target so this is your who

106
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,180
you're going to be targeting the second

107
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:58,379
thing you want to do and this is a a

108
00:03:58,379 --> 00:03:59,819
little bit of a stretch but bear with me

109
00:03:59,819 --> 00:04:01,500
you want to learn the fundamentals of

110
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:04,680
your target or why your target is a good

111
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,840
Target the third thing you want to do is

112
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:09,659
identify where your key dependencies are

113
00:04:09,659 --> 00:04:11,760
or what your what your key dependencies

114
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,920
are that's your what the fourth thing is

115
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,780
understanding where they live within a

116
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:17,220
broader environment that's your where

117
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:19,500
and the fifth thing is looking for

118
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,238
vulnerabilities and that of course would

119
00:04:21,238 --> 00:04:23,220
be your how you're going to Target

120
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:26,580
so the sixth secret step is profit is

121
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:28,080
needed and we'll go get into this later

122
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,699
but just to plant a seed in your head

123
00:04:29,699 --> 00:04:32,160
now your profit is what you're going to

124
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,440
do with this information so your target

125
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,360
hearing for a reason I mean unless

126
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,560
you're just me and you're doing it for

127
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,840
fun this is what you're going to do with

128
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,520
that information at the end and it does

129
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,080
change based on who you are what

130
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:45,660
organization you're with Etc

131
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,820
so the first thing you want to do is

132
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:49,919
select your broad Target once again this

133
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:52,020
is your who you're going to be targeting

134
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:53,639
the first thing you want to do when

135
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:54,960
you're thinking about this is consider

136
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,060
your objectives so if I'm just an

137
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:58,919
independent cyber researcher right the

138
00:04:58,919 --> 00:05:00,540
world is my oyster I could look at any

139
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:02,940
system it doesn't really matter if I was

140
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:04,259
working for an original equipment

141
00:05:04,259 --> 00:05:06,840
manufacturer maybe I would be wanting to

142
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,360
look at something in my supply chain for

143
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,800
example I would want to be looking at

144
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,139
what if this product didn't come in from

145
00:05:13,139 --> 00:05:14,820
this place and it could cause everything

146
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:16,560
to crash what is that product and how do

147
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,600
I identify where it is

148
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,520
um and if you're like an asset owner

149
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,080
operator obviously you'd want to be

150
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,000
applying this process to your own

151
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,220
systems and Target hearing against your

152
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:28,320
own systems to figure out where the weak

153
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,539
spots are uh just with you know

154
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:32,580
traditional intelligence you can you

155
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:34,080
want to consider what you're doing in

156
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,539
the context of current events so if we

157
00:05:36,539 --> 00:05:37,919
think about obviously what's going on in

158
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:40,620
Ukraine maybe there are European asset

159
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:42,539
owners and operators who are kind of

160
00:05:42,539 --> 00:05:44,220
perking up a little bit you can you can

161
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:45,900
use current events to help frame and

162
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,699
what you're going to Target here and the

163
00:05:47,699 --> 00:05:50,400
last thing is is known weaknesses so for

164
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,139
example if we think about Oldsmar right

165
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:55,080
when that happened we all kind of take a

166
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,639
look took a mental step back and said

167
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:58,860
okay we know that water treatment plants

168
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:00,720
is a potential weakness we know this

169
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,759
we've seen it we've seen it targeted

170
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:05,759
before this is how we can defend against

171
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:07,440
it in the future

172
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,539
so with each of these I'm going to talk

173
00:06:09,539 --> 00:06:11,340
about a little bit more about what it is

174
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:14,039
I'm going to give for one relevant some

175
00:06:14,039 --> 00:06:16,560
open source references that you can use

176
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,900
or your team can use back at home to to

177
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,699
do this research and then I'm going to

178
00:06:20,699 --> 00:06:22,680
tell a story and I always joke about

179
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,539
this because I Love Trains And so I

180
00:06:24,539 --> 00:06:26,400
always have to fit a way to find a way

181
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,800
to fit them into every talk I give one

182
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,780
of my first research projects that I did

183
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:33,000
was on trains but it didn't start out

184
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,300
that way so I started out noticing that

185
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:38,940
there was a gap in reporting for for

186
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:41,340
transportation right so I was like I'm

187
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:43,620
going to write a paper on transportation

188
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:46,259
and that's impossible it is too broad of

189
00:06:46,259 --> 00:06:47,580
a sector you're never going to get

190
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:49,740
anything out of that so then I was like

191
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:51,539
okay maybe I'll narrow it down I'm going

192
00:06:51,539 --> 00:06:53,580
to look at transportation of freight so

193
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,139
then you're looking at Maritime Freight

194
00:06:55,139 --> 00:06:56,580
you're looking at Freight Rail and

195
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:58,440
you're looking at trucks things that are

196
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:01,620
taking places things to other places

197
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:03,960
um and that was all well and good but

198
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:06,120
the issue is that that is still far too

199
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,919
broad of a category to do any sort of

200
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:09,960
Target hearing on so the next thing I

201
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:12,840
did was just focus just solely on Rail

202
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:15,720
and dig into rails specifically and then

203
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,880
finally I got to my end state which was

204
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:20,460
looking at technology within rail that

205
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:22,440
is a key dependency and if it were to go

206
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,699
down it would cause significant

207
00:07:23,699 --> 00:07:25,440
disruption to rail in the United States

208
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,240
so you can see how you start with a

209
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,340
really wide funnel and then you take it

210
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:30,720
all the way down to something that is

211
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,599
actually actionable and you're able to

212
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:37,139
conduct Target hearing against it

213
00:07:37,139 --> 00:07:39,180
so the second thing you want to do is

214
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:41,039
learn once you figured out who you're

215
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:42,180
targeting now you're going to figure out

216
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:43,919
why they're a good Target you're

217
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:45,479
learning the fundamentals of your target

218
00:07:45,479 --> 00:07:48,240
so buckle up everybody we're going back

219
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,160
to school sometimes you are starting

220
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,560
from the absolute ground floor and you

221
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,800
have to be willing and able to fail you

222
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,840
have to be comfortable not understanding

223
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,479
things if you're somebody who just lives

224
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,620
with certainty and you can't handle

225
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:03,599
uncertainty this is probably going to

226
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:06,000
cause you some significant anxiety so

227
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,500
you have to really be comfortable with

228
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,479
the idea of you're not going to know

229
00:08:09,479 --> 00:08:11,940
what's going on right away it's going to

230
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:14,639
take some time so obviously this is ICS

231
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:16,560
you have to understand basic processes

232
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,199
and control flows you and you have to be

233
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:21,720
able to look at attacks that have been

234
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,639
conducted against your Target in the

235
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:26,160
past that were both successful and

236
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,020
unsuccessful and the unsuccessful part

237
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:30,960
is important because you don't you need

238
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,700
to know what what attacks have been

239
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:34,620
propagated against your target that

240
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:36,779
ultimately didn't work because that

241
00:08:36,779 --> 00:08:39,000
security a safeguard was in place or

242
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,260
maybe they didn't work because it was

243
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:41,820
just a bad day or maybe you need to

244
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:43,260
understand the conditions for which

245
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:45,180
something either did work or didn't work

246
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:47,940
both are equally important

247
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:50,700
so you can do this using a bunch of

248
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:52,740
different resources really quick before

249
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,839
I get started on this side oscent is

250
00:08:54,839 --> 00:08:57,300
kind of of a misnomer so I put it on

251
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:58,740
this slide because on these slides

252
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:00,839
because as a community we all can kind

253
00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:04,019
of register what it is but really it's

254
00:09:04,019 --> 00:09:05,940
not open source intelligence because

255
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:07,680
intelligence needs to be processed and

256
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,180
assessed before it becomes actual

257
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:11,040
intelligence and my intelligence nerd's

258
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,080
in the room I will be glad that I made

259
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:15,420
that caveat this is essentially really

260
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:17,399
just open sources publicly available

261
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:19,440
information that you can use to conduct

262
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,040
targeting so the first one arcgis I

263
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,899
don't use it a ton other people use it

264
00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:28,140
and love it caveat here it is paid if

265
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:29,880
you use it a ton but you can get

266
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,860
week-long free trials so if you go in

267
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:33,839
knowing what you're looking for it's a

268
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:35,820
great tool software mapping you can put

269
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:37,440
on different layers add subtract layers

270
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,839
based on what you want to look at this

271
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,700
image actually on the right hand part of

272
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:44,940
the slide is the Lowe's hotel in arcgis

273
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:47,580
um probably my favorite tool for this

274
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:48,959
step actually that's not true I love

275
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:51,600
Holly blogs but YouTube is amazing I am

276
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,300
not like a YouTube for fun person but if

277
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:56,399
you can show me a YouTube video that

278
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:59,700
goes over material in a level at a level

279
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,680
that I can understand and I can pause it

280
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,360
and take notes like if somebody's

281
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,860
talking to you you can't really pause

282
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:06,959
the person and say like I'll hold that

283
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:08,040
thought let me write down what you just

284
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,600
said but you can do that with YouTube

285
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,060
and it's a really amazing tool that can

286
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:14,040
provide you with a serious depth of

287
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:16,560
knowledge across a wide base of topics I

288
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,120
would also say make sure that you look

289
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,980
uh when you're looking at YouTube videos

290
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:22,080
make sure that you look at the suggested

291
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,519
videos a lot of this is just about

292
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:26,580
making educated guesses to lead you

293
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:28,200
further down the rabbit hole that you're

294
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,899
trying to get down hobby blogs awesome

295
00:10:30,899 --> 00:10:33,060
these are these like websites you guys

296
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:34,800
I'm sure I've seen them where some

297
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,180
somebody who's super passionate about

298
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:37,800
something maybe they're retired and this

299
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,540
is just what they love and they maintain

300
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:41,519
these websites and graphically they look

301
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:43,740
like they're straight out of 2007 but

302
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:47,160
the content is amazing so these are you

303
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,959
have to note that maybe what you're

304
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:51,839
seeing is not 100 accurate but a level

305
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:53,399
of detail can be provided in Hobby

306
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:55,200
blocks that you wouldn't find anywhere

307
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,000
else this is especially great I've

308
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,100
noticed with Transportation

309
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:01,920
um air travel there's obviously a huge

310
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,899
fan base for planes which I didn't know

311
00:11:03,899 --> 00:11:05,579
until College

312
00:11:05,579 --> 00:11:06,959
um trains is great for this as well

313
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:08,880
obviously cars so

314
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,680
um hobby blogs amazing and then

315
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:13,440
regulations you can use to look at what

316
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,320
issues were in place in the past in your

317
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,180
what you're targeting that have since

318
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:21,480
been remediated using regulation so an

319
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,160
example of that you know if two planes

320
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,740
hadn't crashed over the Grand Canyon Air

321
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:27,720
Traffic Control would not look anything

322
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,060
like it does today

323
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:32,519
so really quick example of me using this

324
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:34,980
when I first started researching the

325
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:37,260
electric grid specifically I watched so

326
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:38,579
many of these practical engineering

327
00:11:38,579 --> 00:11:42,240
videos I mean I would say like yeah and

328
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,160
insane probably all those 36 000 likes

329
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,779
were just me being really excited about

330
00:11:45,779 --> 00:11:47,459
these videos

331
00:11:47,459 --> 00:11:49,140
um there's also there's a ton of really

332
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:51,060
great resources for the electric sector

333
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:53,040
in every sector on YouTube but you can

334
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,420
get guys who are working out on

335
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:55,860
substations and they've got their phone

336
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:58,079
and they're just like and this is a and

337
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:59,339
they're like just walking you around

338
00:11:59,339 --> 00:12:01,079
telling you what everything is stuff

339
00:12:01,079 --> 00:12:02,880
like that for me personally super

340
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,560
informative

341
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,380
so we're gonna kind of speed things up a

342
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:09,300
little bit here key dependencies once

343
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:11,339
again a dependency person place or thing

344
00:12:11,339 --> 00:12:14,279
and by nature of risk management the

345
00:12:14,279 --> 00:12:16,200
more dependencies you have the riskier

346
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:19,260
it is key dependency key dependency is a

347
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:21,420
single point of failure so you can start

348
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:22,920
wherever you

349
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,240
um go through what your out point is

350
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,399
output is and you can trace backwards up

351
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:29,700
from that process to identify what is

352
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:31,680
the point where if it fails everything

353
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,320
falls apart one thing you can do is if

354
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,700
you're kind of struggling with this look

355
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:38,040
for ubiquity if it has high ubiquity

356
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,420
first of all a few targets here against

357
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:42,720
it it's probably going to have a wide

358
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,240
impact if you're successful and second

359
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,320
of all

360
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,600
um if there is if it's really ubiquitous

361
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,820
there's a higher chance that either some

362
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:52,560
installations were faulty maybe the

363
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,540
patches aren't being applied properly

364
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:56,220
just from a statistical perspective

365
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:57,720
there's a higher chance of that

366
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,579
happening with the more ubiquitous

367
00:12:59,579 --> 00:13:02,160
devices and one important thing to note

368
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,500
here you want to select your key Focus

369
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,839
but you don't want to only select a key

370
00:13:06,839 --> 00:13:09,300
Focus so in Dale's talk this morning he

371
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:11,279
talked about how when you're exploring

372
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:13,019
sometimes you come up with essentially a

373
00:13:13,019 --> 00:13:15,060
nothing burger right you come up with a

374
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:17,220
dead end if you only focused on one

375
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:18,600
thing while you were building this

376
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,639
process you're and you hit a dead end

377
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:22,440
you're you're dead in the water like

378
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:25,139
you're stuck so having us as you go

379
00:13:25,139 --> 00:13:26,880
through and you learn uh the

380
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,560
fundamentals kind of keeping a list of

381
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,180
okay I think this might be valuable I

382
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:31,440
think this might be valuable I think

383
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,180
this might be valuable having the thing

384
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:35,220
you care about the most on top and then

385
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:37,800
filtering down from there to just have

386
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,420
some backup options it's more important

387
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:40,680
than you would think

388
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:43,380
some resources here manuals online

389
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:46,740
awesome there's surprisingly a lot of

390
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:47,820
them

391
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:50,940
um buyer beware do not download manuals

392
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:54,180
from sketchy sites uh this is a threat

393
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:56,040
factor a Threat Vector that attackers

394
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,740
have used to get onto engineering

395
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:01,500
workstations so just I have to say that

396
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,660
because I've seen it happen

397
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:05,040
um on this one linkedin's my favorite

398
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,139
LinkedIn is awesome if you can find

399
00:14:07,139 --> 00:14:10,380
people who work either with or for who

400
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:12,540
you're targeting against it's basically

401
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:14,160
like a free encyclopedia on that

402
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,139
person's life and so you can see if they

403
00:14:16,139 --> 00:14:17,339
have listed that they're really

404
00:14:17,339 --> 00:14:19,560
proficient in such and such a scale or

405
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:21,420
such and such as technology you're

406
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:22,920
making the inference that they probably

407
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,720
work with that in their day-to-day life

408
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,760
it's it's information that you would

409
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,980
just never have if if LinkedIn didn't

410
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:31,680
exist without like finding that person

411
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,120
at a bar and being like tell me what you

412
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,500
work on which we're not doing because

413
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,300
we're cool and we're targeters so we're

414
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:38,519
probably in a basement

415
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:42,240
um public government databases are great

416
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,220
um I don't use a ton of them but I know

417
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:46,680
a lot of people who do eiaa.gov is a

418
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,620
good one if you're in the energy sector

419
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:51,720
vendor press releases are a huge wealth

420
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:54,720
of information so vendors love to brag

421
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,480
about what they're doing uh so you can

422
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,279
see look up stuff all the time that says

423
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:00,000
like

424
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,660
vendor X is so excited to company is so

425
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:05,639
excited to partner with company y so

426
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:07,680
that we can do a b and c and you're like

427
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,560
great thank you for that I'm really glad

428
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,240
you had to had that bragging moment

429
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,339
because now I've got some information

430
00:15:13,339 --> 00:15:16,199
another thing to note with this though

431
00:15:16,199 --> 00:15:17,940
um this is vendors of all shapes and

432
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:20,699
sizes right so even I have seen it

433
00:15:20,699 --> 00:15:22,139
happen where there's a company that does

434
00:15:22,139 --> 00:15:24,839
like HVAC installations for example and

435
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:26,760
they will take a picture of this amazing

436
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,440
HVAC installation they did in your

437
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,600
facility put it on their website and say

438
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,220
look at how amazing our HVAC

439
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:34,260
installation is and you're like that is

440
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:36,600
a picture of my data center on the

441
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,760
internet so be aware of that with your

442
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,860
own vendors as well

443
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:42,360
um this was a project I did that I

444
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:45,839
really loved on the left side is uh all

445
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:48,720
the pipelines in the North Sea thank you

446
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,000
the BBC for making a nice picture for us

447
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,100
on the right side you kind of have to

448
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,600
zoom in and I should have done that

449
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,160
myself but I didn't

450
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,660
um you can see that there's only if you

451
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:59,160
look at the North Sea area there's only

452
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:02,399
two blue full blue dots and those are

453
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:05,279
operational uh terminals for liquefied

454
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:08,220
natural gas so when natural gas comes

455
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:11,459
into comes in off the ocean it needs to

456
00:16:11,459 --> 00:16:13,260
go through re-gasification which is

457
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:15,600
turning it from liquid back into a gas

458
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,760
that has to happen at a regasification

459
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,860
plant there are not that many of them

460
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:22,260
and so that is a huge choke point where

461
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:24,899
if the regassification plant went off uh

462
00:16:24,899 --> 00:16:26,459
there you wouldn't be able to continue

463
00:16:26,459 --> 00:16:28,079
the process

464
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:30,060
so this is where I'm the weakest

465
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:32,100
understanding how the key dependencies

466
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:34,500
fit within the environment so it's two

467
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:35,820
sides of the same coin right you have

468
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:37,680
connectivity which is how it's connected

469
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,959
who does it talk to how does it talk and

470
00:16:39,959 --> 00:16:41,940
then there's segmentation which is what

471
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:44,220
is it not talking to is that deliberate

472
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:45,839
is it lucky

473
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:47,759
um and that connectivity can help you

474
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:50,040
not only when you're actually doing

475
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:51,899
Target the initial Target hearing

476
00:16:51,899 --> 00:16:53,639
operation but it can help you pivot

477
00:16:53,639 --> 00:16:55,079
later down the line if there's something

478
00:16:55,079 --> 00:16:57,420
that you think you might want to look at

479
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:58,920
that it's connected to it can help you

480
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:02,820
identify secondary or tertiary targets

481
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:05,040
so if you're lucky and you can find

482
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,140
schematics online obviously best day

483
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:09,720
ever tell me where you found them

484
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:12,000
um I love using a combination of

485
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,040
pictures and Google Maps to establish

486
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:16,079
connectivity and segmentation if you're

487
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:17,939
looking at a place

488
00:17:17,939 --> 00:17:19,619
um so you can get you can get a picture

489
00:17:19,619 --> 00:17:21,179
on Google Maps so they're like public

490
00:17:21,179 --> 00:17:24,000
whatever and then you can a picture on

491
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,260
Google Images and you pull up Google

492
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:26,579
Maps and you're looking down at the

493
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:27,660
facility and you're looking at the

494
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:28,559
picture and you're looking at the

495
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:29,580
facility and you're looking at the

496
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:31,500
picture and you can start to see how

497
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,600
things intersect and connect

498
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,280
um I have heard I have not done it I've

499
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,660
heard that if you know what to look for

500
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:39,539
you can track transmission lines across

501
00:17:39,539 --> 00:17:42,000
the Us and other countries I've also

502
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,500
heard if you know what to look for you

503
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,960
can track natural gas pipelines as well

504
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:49,140
so a lot that you can find just on

505
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:51,320
Google Maps if you know what to look for

506
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:54,660
regulations are super helpful for where

507
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:56,039
things once again where things have been

508
00:17:56,039 --> 00:17:57,600
a problem in the past so like this is

509
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,240
just a nurse you know page and

510
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,340
information sharing groups are great so

511
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:05,039
some sometimes they don't vet their

512
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:07,380
members if you have a group please vet

513
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:09,360
your members but sometimes you can just

514
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:12,660
join a group this is also great for like

515
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:14,039
Twitter groups for example you can

516
00:18:14,039 --> 00:18:15,720
organize people

517
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:18,600
um it's slack channels like a lot of

518
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,100
this and I I wanted to make this point

519
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,900
up front this is not a technical talk

520
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,820
like if you want a technical talk stage

521
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:25,740
two's got some great ones this is just

522
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:27,720
high level conceptual how can you do

523
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:30,480
this so you know it's not you don't need

524
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,179
a bunch of technical experience to join

525
00:18:33,179 --> 00:18:34,860
an information sharing group like you

526
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:37,440
just need a nice smile and a like polite

527
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,919
message in most in some cases

528
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:42,480
um so I don't have a really great

529
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,299
picture for this one but what the story

530
00:18:45,299 --> 00:18:46,919
I wanted to tell is essentially how you

531
00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:50,220
can use a um one of these reference

532
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:52,440
architectures as kind of a baseline in

533
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,940
your own mind and when you're going

534
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:55,919
through the process of targeteering and

535
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:57,240
once again you've got your really nice

536
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,919
one note that you're maintaining you can

537
00:18:58,919 --> 00:19:01,080
kind of start to build one of these

538
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:03,000
pictures for yourself of what you're

539
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,220
working on and you can use that to later

540
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:07,200
reference back to

541
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,780
um in your reporting or whatever

542
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:13,140
so the fifth and final formal step is

543
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:15,539
looking for vulnerabilities I call this

544
00:19:15,539 --> 00:19:18,299
step phone a friend because I think

545
00:19:18,299 --> 00:19:20,220
working as an analyst working with

546
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:22,620
researchers in a direct capacity is a

547
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:25,020
really valuable thing that you can do

548
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:26,520
um there are ways of course that you can

549
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,679
find vulnerabilities looking stuff up on

550
00:19:28,679 --> 00:19:31,140
MVD different different vulnerability

551
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:33,720
databases super helpful

552
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,820
um you can also look for systems that

553
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:38,340
either aren't updated or they're just

554
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:41,039
straight up not supported by the vendor

555
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:43,320
anymore obviously we are working out

556
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:44,820
today we know there's a lot of Legacy

557
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:46,880
systems and Legacy equipment in place

558
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,080
identifying that can be super super

559
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:52,260
valuable and then one of my favorites is

560
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:55,020
just appreciating the features that

561
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:57,840
could be a vulnerability if you hate it

562
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,120
at the right angle so this is the good

563
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:03,059
old-fashioned we sell product you

564
00:20:03,059 --> 00:20:05,700
because it's got this great feature and

565
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:07,020
I'm taking a look and I'm like that

566
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:09,600
feature is directly communicating with

567
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,419
the with the internet so maybe don't buy

568
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:15,360
that and put it in your facility these

569
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,400
are really great because generally the

570
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:20,100
feature that is vulnerable is something

571
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:21,780
that they have that the product was

572
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:24,059
specifically designed for so it is

573
00:20:24,059 --> 00:20:27,059
automatically off the gate uh something

574
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:28,860
that people don't want to turn off when

575
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:30,960
they're protecting their systems

576
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,480
so obviously all of the different

577
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:36,120
databases you can use I think it's super

578
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,500
important to leverage structural

579
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,419
analytic structured analytical

580
00:20:39,419 --> 00:20:41,400
techniques these help you check your

581
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,960
bias as you're working through this

582
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,000
process make sure you're not it helps

583
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,460
you identify any assumptions you might

584
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:49,080
be making as you're working through this

585
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:51,419
analyst in the know analysts in the room

586
00:20:51,419 --> 00:20:52,919
will know that identifying your

587
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:54,960
assumptions is one of the most important

588
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,059
things you can do and you must do when

589
00:20:57,059 --> 00:20:59,520
you're conducting analysis you can also

590
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,200
obviously like I said look for known

591
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,760
features look for things that a product

592
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:06,179
was advertised as being unique for

593
00:21:06,179 --> 00:21:08,100
including and then looking back on

594
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,840
historical events I can't say it enough

595
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,179
the past teaches us so much about what

596
00:21:12,179 --> 00:21:14,160
is possible

597
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:16,679
so of course we're in Florida I've

598
00:21:16,679 --> 00:21:18,059
talked about it once got to talk about

599
00:21:18,059 --> 00:21:21,660
it again old smart this all old smart

600
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:22,860
happened because they were running

601
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:24,960
Legacy Windows 7 that was no longer

602
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,360
supported and TeamViewer which we all

603
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,640
know has like significant issues this

604
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,559
was not sophisticated that's like two

605
00:21:31,559 --> 00:21:33,480
things that we already knew about so

606
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:36,120
that's just an example of of using known

607
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:38,280
vulnerabilities in conjunction with

608
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:40,860
unpatched or outdated software

609
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:43,980
um leading to an attack success well

610
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:45,419
moderately successful attack depending

611
00:21:45,419 --> 00:21:47,220
on your definition also if there's any

612
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:48,960
olds more people in the room I am so

613
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,940
sorry

614
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:53,159
um so the number one question that I get

615
00:21:53,159 --> 00:21:54,600
asked when I'm going through this and

616
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:57,600
explaining this to people is how do you

617
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:01,679
know when to stop and my answer is you

618
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:04,440
just know but it turns out that that is

619
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:06,480
not helpful if you don't live in my

620
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:09,539
brain uh so I started asking other

621
00:22:09,539 --> 00:22:11,640
people who I know also conduct this how

622
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,559
they know it's time to stop and my

623
00:22:13,559 --> 00:22:15,120
favorite quotes that I got is you stop

624
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,340
once the juice is no longer worth the

625
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:20,460
squeeze so that's when you

626
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:22,679
throughout this process you have to be

627
00:22:22,679 --> 00:22:24,600
both engaged and one step behind right

628
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:27,360
so you have to be actively over looking

629
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,039
at the process but you also have to be

630
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:31,020
constantly reflecting on if what you're

631
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:32,900
doing is moving your objective forward

632
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:35,400
obviously objectives can change with

633
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:38,640
time but analysts you know I I can find

634
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,320
myself going off on a tangent that is

635
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,240
absolutely and fully unrelated to what

636
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,500
I'm doing

637
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,840
um and so that constantly bringing

638
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,820
yourself back and asking yourself either

639
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:50,039
is this adding to what I'm trying to do

640
00:22:50,039 --> 00:22:52,320
or will this move me one step forward is

641
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,480
key and you might not a lot of times you

642
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,039
know you're making an educated guess and

643
00:22:56,039 --> 00:22:57,480
hoping that what you learn later

644
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,700
corroborates what you are saying today

645
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:02,340
that's just part of analysis

646
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:04,080
so then there's the mystery sixth step

647
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,880
which is profit you've targeted you

648
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,200
found something vulnerable you've built

649
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,820
up a use case for why it is the way it

650
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:12,299
is this is the next step so once you've

651
00:23:12,299 --> 00:23:14,880
conducted this you can bet your red team

652
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,500
against it like you've come up with this

653
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:19,260
hypothesis that if this was successfully

654
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:20,640
targeted

655
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,140
um you know would it take something down

656
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:23,580
that's putting the people who have the

657
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:25,799
hands on the keyboards there to actually

658
00:23:25,799 --> 00:23:27,480
go take a look and see if you were right

659
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:31,140
bulking up defenses huge so looking at

660
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:32,760
your connectivity looking at your

661
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,919
segmentation figuring out is could I put

662
00:23:34,919 --> 00:23:37,200
another firewall in here could I maybe

663
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,179
disrupt this connectivity in a way

664
00:23:39,179 --> 00:23:40,919
because it doesn't really need to be

665
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:43,020
there and then of course you can also

666
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:45,900
look at creating redundancies for your

667
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:48,059
key dependencies obviously a single

668
00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:49,679
point of failure is not the single point

669
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:51,840
of failure if it is literally not the

670
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,520
single point so having those

671
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:56,520
redundancies wherever you can so that if

672
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:58,559
there was a successful operation against

673
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:01,140
your or disruption of your technology or

674
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:04,620
your process is super super important

675
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:07,320
so I am knocking on your door Target

676
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,960
hearing on your stuff what can you do to

677
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:12,240
stop me do this process and do it often

678
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,919
the more you do it you're the more

679
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:15,299
you're going to find that's weak within

680
00:24:15,299 --> 00:24:17,880
your system I think Consulting with

681
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,700
Engineers is one of the most

682
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:22,260
underutilized elements of cyber security

683
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:24,120
for ICS and OT

684
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:26,039
those are the people who know what's

685
00:24:26,039 --> 00:24:27,780
going on with your equipment better than

686
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:30,720
anyone and they can determine both they

687
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,460
can give you suggestions of like hey man

688
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:34,200
I saw this thing the other day like

689
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,000
maybe you should go check it out but

690
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,039
they can also tell you if you come and

691
00:24:38,039 --> 00:24:39,480
say like hey you know I think I found

692
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:40,860
this thing that's vulnerable what do I

693
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:42,419
do they can tell you actually no don't

694
00:24:42,419 --> 00:24:44,700
worry about it that's fine or they can

695
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:46,140
tell you oh yeah you're right that's a

696
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:47,700
huge issue let's go figure out how to

697
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:49,080
fix that

698
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:51,360
um control you can't control what other

699
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,580
people say in most cases but you control

700
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:56,159
control your own narrative please do not

701
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:58,080
put pictures on your website that will

702
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,700
help me really think about the pictures

703
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:00,900
that you're putting on your website

704
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:02,100
before you put them on your website

705
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:04,080
before you make press releases or you

706
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,880
make social media postings just think

707
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,740
about it and also remember that

708
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:11,039
ultimately security is everyone's job so

709
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:12,960
way back when when I used to work for a

710
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,360
bank there was a story of an intern who

711
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:16,860
was on his first day of his internship

712
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:19,440
and he took a picture of himself you

713
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,880
know like oh first day of my internship

714
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,740
and on the computer screen behind him

715
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:24,120
and I don't know how he got this in from

716
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:26,340
nation was a list of the bank's most

717
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:29,178
valuable assets

718
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,039
um he does not work for that bank

719
00:25:32,039 --> 00:25:34,860
obviously uh anymore

720
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:36,600
um so that's somebody who's not a

721
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,340
security person and who doesn't might

722
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:40,140
not even have that much interaction with

723
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:42,059
the technology themselves but they're

724
00:25:42,059 --> 00:25:45,059
creating a significant security risk

725
00:25:45,059 --> 00:25:47,520
so let's wrap it up what does

726
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,200
targeteering allow you to do it helps

727
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,559
you identify vulnerable OT and within

728
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:54,720
within your system it helps you define

729
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,600
and defend key dependencies super

730
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,580
important and it helps you mature your

731
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:01,980
security posture against adversaries of

732
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:04,080
varying capabilities but most

733
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,179
importantly it allows you to take a

734
00:26:06,179 --> 00:26:08,220
proactive approach towards protecting

735
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:09,900
your community

736
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:12,860
that's what I've got

737
00:26:13,050 --> 00:26:19,559
