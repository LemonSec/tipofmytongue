1
00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:03,179
foreign

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:08,460
how's everybody doing good I hope I want

3
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:10,320
you to know that if you think I'm going

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,460
to do any

5
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:13,320
cartwheels probably not you don't want

6
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:16,940
to see this to a cartwheel just say it

7
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:19,619
so I want to talk a little bit about

8
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:21,420
software-defined networking and I want

9
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:23,460
to do that in the context of my

10
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:25,980
experience so back in 2006 I was an end

11
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:27,060
user

12
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:29,039
and we started building out our first

13
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:31,740
ethernet plant floor controls Network so

14
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:33,540
we really went cold turkey ethernet in

15
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:36,540
06. and if I look at the challenges we

16
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:38,460
had then versus you know what's

17
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:39,780
available today from a technology

18
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:41,820
perspective particularly in the case of

19
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:42,960
sdn

20
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,460
I'm going to try to kind of compare and

21
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:46,860
contrast the differences so for those of

22
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:48,960
you who are not maybe as familiar with

23
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,780
sdn as others it really is the same

24
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:54,180
network that everything you have runs on

25
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:54,960
today

26
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,180
the only difference is how the network

27
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:01,440
is managed all right standard IEEE 802.

28
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,899
Network

29
00:01:02,899 --> 00:01:06,360
so the software defined networking kind

30
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,939
of started back in the 10 12 years ago

31
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:10,500
let's say and it was pretty predominant

32
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:13,200
in the cloud space

33
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,960
um so and at the time it was really a

34
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,280
paradigm shift in how they were going to

35
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,140
do things and they what they needed is

36
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:20,700
more flexibility they needed more

37
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:23,280
capability they didn't have the luxury

38
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,900
of going out and physically rewiring

39
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:26,939
rerouting and doing all the things that

40
00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:29,220
we might do with a network today so this

41
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:31,500
idea of software-defined networking uh

42
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:34,159
came into being

43
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:35,579
so

44
00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:37,380
it's really

45
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:40,259
um today is a paradigm shift in the OT

46
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:41,579
space

47
00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:43,140
so if you look at you know operational

48
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:46,140
technology or controls networks you know

49
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:47,640
they're pretty depending on the company

50
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,960
they're pretty traditional some

51
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,340
companies you know they're crazy and

52
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:51,780
they use Rings which I'm actually a

53
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:53,759
proponent of rings you know star

54
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:56,159
topologies what you don't think what you

55
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:57,659
don't see here are things like typically

56
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:00,119
like a mesh for example but in the world

57
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:01,380
of sdn

58
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:03,000
a mesh is fine

59
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,700
you cannot mess up the network it's it's

60
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,140
kind of like you know money in the

61
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:08,160
checking account as long as there's

62
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,780
checks in the books you can write checks

63
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:11,520
because you've always got money in the

64
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,560
world of sdn you can really plug things

65
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,300
in however makes sense to your

66
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:16,500
environment and what you're trying to

67
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,959
accomplish and it will work you're not

68
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:20,580
you're not constrained by some of the

69
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:22,200
the things we see today in a typical OT

70
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,080
Network

71
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,819
so as I said most of my career was an

72
00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:30,300
end user in an 06 we really started down

73
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:32,459
the road towards

74
00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:36,020
ethernet IP is a field bus at the time

75
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:39,239
so you know where was it when I needed

76
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:42,300
it right we really break it down from an

77
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,160
end user's perspective in manufacturing

78
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,500
at least we were discrete manufacturing

79
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,000
so there's a lot of other pieces of

80
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,680
manufacturing you know process and lots

81
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,379
of things but generally speaking we

82
00:02:52,379 --> 00:02:54,480
broke it down into design

83
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,519
so we have to design the system design

84
00:02:56,519 --> 00:02:58,940
the network build our standards

85
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:01,440
deploying that at an oem or a machine

86
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,000
Builder who's building our equipment

87
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,519
right they've got 40 weeks to build a 10

88
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:08,580
million dollar line and there's 60 PLC

89
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:10,400
60 switches

90
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,159
and that's really the challenge was how

91
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:17,340
do we do that the next piece is how do

92
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:19,260
we manage it once we have it

93
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:21,420
right once it lands on my floor it's a

94
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:23,819
different environment the OEM floor if

95
00:03:23,819 --> 00:03:25,019
you guys have ever done that is kind of

96
00:03:25,019 --> 00:03:26,940
a free-for-all because things are in a

97
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:28,140
constant state of flux when you're

98
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:30,060
building equipment at least on the

99
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:31,319
discrete side they're moving equipment

100
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:33,300
around they're rebalancing the line so

101
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:34,920
it's a bit of a challenge to try to put

102
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,180
anything in place from a security

103
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:37,620
posture because

104
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:39,840
if you set that up the next day that

105
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,400
whole end of the line has moved shifted

106
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,959
changed equipment's no longer there it's

107
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:44,819
now down here so it becomes a big

108
00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:48,060
Challenge and how do you do that

109
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:50,879
um and of course the security right how

110
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:52,140
do you secure the system how do you

111
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:54,420
secure the equipment I'll tell you in o6

112
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:56,519
we weren't really thinking about

113
00:03:56,519 --> 00:04:00,000
Security in o6 it um

114
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,680
it wasn't something we really started

115
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,620
looking at until probably 09 or 010 when

116
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:06,360
we started developing some solutions for

117
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:09,480
securing our plant floor networks and of

118
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,459
course visibility wasn't really a big

119
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:13,319
thing for us now I will tell you that if

120
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:15,959
you've ever worked with um show hands

121
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:17,699
who's who's like an end user a machine

122
00:04:17,699 --> 00:04:19,440
builder in here or work with machine

123
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,779
Builders or had equipment built for them

124
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:23,639
so you know that about the time you

125
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:25,320
deliver it to the client you have six

126
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:28,020
months for those drawings to be useless

127
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:29,580
right because as soon as it hits the

128
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:31,919
plant floor they change and you don't

129
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:33,360
know what's there you don't know how

130
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,280
it's where it's plugged in I can

131
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,840
remember troubleshooting systems in

132
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:39,479
Mexico and you're you're listening to

133
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:41,160
what they're telling you you're looking

134
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,540
at what they're saying is the case

135
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:44,220
they've even sent you a chicken scratch

136
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:46,680
on paper and there's no physical way in

137
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,180
the Sun the network is wired that way

138
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:50,220
and working the way it is it's just not

139
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:53,400
possible right so visibility was a huge

140
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,840
challenge but we didn't have an answer

141
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,000
there really wasn't anything back in

142
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,840
that time frame uh that let us do that

143
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,280
so what I want to do is kind of go

144
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,540
through the pieces of each of these

145
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:05,340
sections and talk about what was our

146
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:07,139
challenge or our question and and how

147
00:05:07,139 --> 00:05:08,580
would that be answered today in a

148
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:11,660
software-defined network okay uh design

149
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:15,000
so when we designed it what topology we

150
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,340
use well do we use a star do we use a

151
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:20,400
ring do we want dual uplinks do we want

152
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,020
to dual home the switches so that we

153
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:24,060
have redundancy right how do we

154
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:25,500
configure that whose switches are we

155
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,780
using

156
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:30,060
nice thing about sdn is it doesn't

157
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:32,220
matter use the topology that makes sense

158
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:33,720
for you

159
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,740
um

160
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:36,900
flat Network well we'll talk a little

161
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,340
bit more about that right because we've

162
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:40,139
been preaching for years that flat

163
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:43,139
networks are evil but maybe that's not

164
00:05:43,139 --> 00:05:44,759
necessarily the case maybe that's a

165
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:46,740
byproduct of the technology and the

166
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:48,960
approach we were taking

167
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,259
what about spanning trees well we ended

168
00:05:52,259 --> 00:05:54,360
up at the time using rapid spanning tree

169
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,160
right because if an engineer or an

170
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,660
electrician plug the cables into the

171
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:59,220
wrong place in the network and created a

172
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:01,139
loop the whole line go down

173
00:06:01,139 --> 00:06:03,060
so we needed something in o6 that would

174
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:05,759
keep that from happening and and to give

175
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:08,100
you an idea in o6 how new this was we

176
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,360
actually put a product on one of our

177
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,860
lines and we couldn't figure out why it

178
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:13,139
wasn't working until we realized that it

179
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:16,380
only had an ARP cache of eight

180
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:18,840
right so that's how new this stuff was

181
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:22,199
when you connected i o to your line you

182
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:24,000
might be lucky enough to be able to set

183
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,639
a gateway address without it imploding

184
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:29,280
all right that day he's not in his head

185
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,380
he's been there right so that's when I

186
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:33,300
say we didn't have the tools not only

187
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:34,979
did we not have the tools most of the

188
00:06:34,979 --> 00:06:37,800
vendors didn't have a real clue what an

189
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,620
Ethernet field bus device looked like

190
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:42,479
it was oh we did it with control net now

191
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:44,520
we've got a TCP stack from the same guy

192
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,680
say hey we're ethernet right and that

193
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,060
that was really what it was for the

194
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:50,340
first couple years

195
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:53,940
how about igmp oh I struggled we

196
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:56,520
struggled with igmp right because back

197
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,720
in the day there was a lot more

198
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:00,300
multicasting in o6 than there is today

199
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:01,560
right particularly in the world of

200
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,360
ethernet IP

201
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,940
um so you know my little plug there live

202
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:08,520
long and multicast right

203
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:11,160
what matters is how do you control who

204
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,259
the queryer is and where it is we found

205
00:07:13,259 --> 00:07:15,360
at times that the queryer was all the

206
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,100
way across the plant

207
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:20,039
right because our our it guys where we

208
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:21,660
touched bases with them put in a nice

209
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:24,120
layer 3 routing system and and it was

210
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,979
crazy where sometimes this stuff would

211
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:28,880
end up right

212
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,599
um what else do we have to worry about

213
00:07:30,599 --> 00:07:32,160
vlans

214
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,400
we struggled with this idea of vlans not

215
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,660
because we didn't think it was a good

216
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:38,940
idea we couldn't figure out how to get

217
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:41,520
electricians and plant OT Personnel who

218
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,440
didn't understand what an IP address was

219
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,620
to understand what a VLAN was right I

220
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:48,539
mean it was it's I remember having

221
00:07:48,539 --> 00:07:50,280
conversations with guys that would put

222
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,319
would get an oem and bring in a piece of

223
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,580
equipment and it'd have a

224
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:54,960
three-dimensional array in the PLC

225
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,340
ladder logic and I would look at them

226
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:58,500
like are you for real

227
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:01,800
Are you seriously expecting us as a

228
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,800
customer to support that you have any

229
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,139
idea I mean nobody in my plan is going

230
00:08:07,139 --> 00:08:08,880
to get that right well the same thing is

231
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:12,240
true here vlans so vlans obviously we

232
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,639
know a segmentation is necessary I would

233
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:16,680
I would argue that I would not argue and

234
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,720
I would expect no one in here would

235
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,699
argue that the segmentation is necessary

236
00:08:20,699 --> 00:08:22,800
anybody here thinks segmentation is a

237
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,479
bad idea

238
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:27,060
right but by the same token you can go

239
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:28,560
way overboard

240
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,139
we have a customer today has no less

241
00:08:31,139 --> 00:08:33,719
than 14 vlans in every switch in their

242
00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:36,000
plant floor in every panel

243
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,520
and their number one source of downtime

244
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:41,039
is that related to vlans and people

245
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,539
trying to understand them how they work

246
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:43,979
what to plug into what port what's

247
00:08:43,979 --> 00:08:46,920
trunked where right it's a struggle and

248
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:49,560
does I have why I've heard stories well

249
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,420
yeah the the they took the line down

250
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:53,279
they were working on a couple of panels

251
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:55,260
the electrician's unplugged all the

252
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:57,000
ethernet cables from this one this front

253
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:57,959
of the switch

254
00:08:57,959 --> 00:08:59,580
as well they just they got the prints

255
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:00,660
out right and followed the prints

256
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:01,740
because they were all clearly identified

257
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:03,360
what each cable was it was tagged

258
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,320
properly and had here laughing right

259
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,459
it's all tagged properly and we know

260
00:09:08,459 --> 00:09:09,360
where they're going to plug them back in

261
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,040
so everything should come up working

262
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,640
zero chance that ever happened right if

263
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,320
it did happen it was time to go get a

264
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,060
beer and call it a day because it was it

265
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:19,500
was it was like you know it was the

266
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,060
unicorn of your day

267
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:21,720
um

268
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,360
so what what about vlans well what if

269
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,519
you don't need them

270
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:27,839
in the world of software-defined

271
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:30,540
networking the network is micro

272
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:32,220
segmented

273
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:34,980
it is infinitely more segmented than

274
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:37,620
anything you could do with vlans and you

275
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:40,019
don't have to manage it it takes care of

276
00:09:40,019 --> 00:09:41,040
it for you

277
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:45,180
it is device Centric meaning I want this

278
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:47,580
PLC to talk to that robot over ethernet

279
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:48,839
IP only

280
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:51,959
and what you get is basically a isolated

281
00:09:51,959 --> 00:09:54,120
communication that is allowing ethernet

282
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:57,600
IP between those two devices only

283
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,920
all right

284
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:01,200
so the idea of vlans is really

285
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,140
unnecessary in the world of sdn in fact

286
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:06,420
it over complicates things because the

287
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:08,279
network or the fabric of the network in

288
00:10:08,279 --> 00:10:09,959
the case of sdn takes care of that for

289
00:10:09,959 --> 00:10:10,920
you

290
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,540
and I can tell you right now when I talk

291
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:14,399
to customers and I say what's your

292
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:17,399
biggest pain points spanning trees vlans

293
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:18,839
and they they give me and I'm like what

294
00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:20,760
if you could just get rid of them what

295
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:23,160
if they what if what they intended to do

296
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:25,380
is not wrong absolutely we just agreed

297
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:27,720
that segmentation is critical right

298
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:30,360
but if we could do it better and more

299
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,860
granularly

300
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:33,660
better and more granular should be

301
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:35,940
better right

302
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:37,860
how about what switch brand should we

303
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:40,019
use oh we struggled over this struggled

304
00:10:40,019 --> 00:10:41,940
right do we use Belden do we use you

305
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:43,140
know rock all the time didn't have a

306
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:44,160
switch

307
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,079
so we went to our Rockwell partners and

308
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:47,459
said hey what switch should we use and

309
00:10:47,459 --> 00:10:49,500
they said Belden and I said are you guys

310
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,180
ever going to use ever going to come up

311
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:53,640
with your own switch line no

312
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,920
so we spent eight months designing and

313
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,420
testing and building it all out and

314
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:59,640
introducing the stratix switch

315
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,839
right

316
00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:03,899
so we stayed with Belden because we were

317
00:11:03,899 --> 00:11:05,519
there because they were really the

318
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:07,440
player at the time

319
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,899
in the world of sdn it doesn't matter

320
00:11:09,899 --> 00:11:11,700
as long as the switch supports the

321
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:13,019
standard

322
00:11:13,019 --> 00:11:14,940
it doesn't matter you can use a Cisco

323
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:18,600
9300 you could use a dynix eight Port

324
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:22,740
switch you could use SEL Allied Telesis

325
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:24,720
the list goes on and it's growing more

326
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,459
and more rapidly in the OT space there's

327
00:11:26,459 --> 00:11:29,040
lots of sdn switches in the Enterprise

328
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,680
Enterprise grade switches it's growing

329
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:35,160
rapidly in the OT space but you know

330
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,720
what do I do about my line in Brazil

331
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,940
maybe I can't get Belden down there as

332
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:40,920
easily as I can get it here what about

333
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:43,200
the line in Thailand China right I've

334
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,300
got these all over the world and I want

335
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:48,839
a standard but if it cost me three times

336
00:11:48,839 --> 00:11:51,420
as much to buy that switch that's kind

337
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:53,160
of painful right and I'm not necessarily

338
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,260
willing to do that also if you've ever

339
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:57,480
managed stores in a plant and if you

340
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,860
don't know what stores is that's where

341
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:00,480
people go to get stuff when it breaks on

342
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,680
the floor and they got to put new stuff

343
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,459
out

344
00:12:02,459 --> 00:12:03,620
stores

345
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:06,360
is part number based so when they go to

346
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,820
stores they say I need this part number

347
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:10,860
all right and if storage doesn't have

348
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:12,060
that part number

349
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:14,519
you're a toast right you have a serious

350
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:15,839
downtime problem

351
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:17,519
if you didn't have to worry about the

352
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:18,959
switch because all you needed was a

353
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:21,120
switch that supported the standard and

354
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,040
you could source that locally and it was

355
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,959
whatever was convenient you and I

356
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,180
wouldn't probably never mix switches on

357
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:28,920
a single system right now if we had if

358
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,660
we have the choice right

359
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:33,480
I wouldn't put stratix and Belden and

360
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,279
moxa and dainiks and all these other

361
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:36,839
switches on the same network I would I

362
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:38,820
would try to keep them the same

363
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:40,500
in the world of sdn it doesn't matter

364
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,720
because the magic of the network and the

365
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,220
management of the network does not take

366
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:45,959
place in the switch I will never run

367
00:12:45,959 --> 00:12:47,339
around to every switch to make a

368
00:12:47,339 --> 00:12:49,380
configuration change

369
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:51,180
right

370
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:53,220
um Grandmaster clocks who would have

371
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:54,720
thought that was a problem

372
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,519
well we used to do something called the

373
00:12:56,519 --> 00:12:58,440
an nvh machine anybody ever heard of an

374
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,240
nvh machine noise vibration and

375
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,680
harshness

376
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,839
we built axles some of those axles were

377
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:05,399
1500 pounds

378
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:07,920
we would spin those axles at five to

379
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,380
eight thousand RPM and we would apply

380
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:12,779
drag to them to simulate dragging on the

381
00:13:12,779 --> 00:13:15,120
vehicle dragging climbing a hill or

382
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,519
coasting going down the hill dragging on

383
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:21,660
it that way you did not want to not know

384
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:23,820
where your clock was apparently we

385
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:26,339
learned this the hard way right if the

386
00:13:26,339 --> 00:13:28,680
Grand Master Clock was the little bitty

387
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:31,560
PLC 27 hops away

388
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:34,200
through you know any more than seven and

389
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,600
in a non 1588 switch at any more than

390
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,760
seven Hops and the the disparity in time

391
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:41,339
sinking becomes too great you were toast

392
00:13:41,339 --> 00:13:43,320
so all of a sudden what we found out was

393
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:46,139
hey we actually have to care about where

394
00:13:46,139 --> 00:13:48,120
this Grand Master Clock is because when

395
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:51,120
we're doing motion it's critical right

396
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,940
in the world of sdn I have absolute

397
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:56,820
control over my Grandmaster clocks I can

398
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:58,560
determine who what and where are the

399
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,600
clocks I could have one clock I could

400
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:03,000
have a clock in every single station

401
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,779
I can let only that PLC talk to these

402
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:10,380
servos with 1588 PTP therefore I know

403
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:11,760
who the election will be the other

404
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,040
problem was you know if unless you

405
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,420
really know how to pre-load the election

406
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:19,320
process it's Mac based so if I put a Mac

407
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,339
in that's

408
00:14:20,339 --> 00:14:23,279
newer than the Mac I had

409
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,800
the Grand Master Clock is changing right

410
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,540
anybody run into that before he's not

411
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:29,279
his head over here he knows Dave you

412
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:32,040
probably have it can be painful but now

413
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:34,920
I have absolute control over that okay

414
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:38,120
Layer Two or layer three switches well

415
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:40,560
I just need switches to support sdn

416
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,779
right I

417
00:14:42,779 --> 00:14:44,519
I don't need any more than a layer 2

418
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:45,899
switch because everything is micro

419
00:14:45,899 --> 00:14:47,579
segmented and there's no routing taking

420
00:14:47,579 --> 00:14:48,420
place

421
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:51,720
it doesn't route doesn't need to route

422
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,880
so the way I want to do this though is I

423
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,019
want to at the end of each one of these

424
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:56,279
sections I want to talk a little bit

425
00:14:56,279 --> 00:14:59,519
about what are the challenges that that

426
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:01,440
sdn maybe wouldn't be

427
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,300
you know where I might still have a bit

428
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:04,620
of a difficulty

429
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:07,139
this will be very dependent upon the sdn

430
00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:09,240
controller that you utilize right

431
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,860
because some will handle this some will

432
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:12,899
not but what if you do if you plug into

433
00:15:12,899 --> 00:15:14,639
the Enterprise Network where you want to

434
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:16,440
send data up and there's three vlans

435
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,779
trunked on that that connection

436
00:15:18,779 --> 00:15:20,940
what if they're using pvst plus because

437
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:23,820
you're connecting to a catalyst switch

438
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:26,040
right so you have to be aware of that

439
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:29,220
and some controllers

440
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:31,139
we'll handle that very well they'll Auto

441
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:33,300
identify the vlans they'll let you even

442
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:35,399
talk to a device down in the sdn network

443
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:37,500
that's on a VLAN even though the sdn

444
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:38,880
network itself could care less about the

445
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,980
VLAN it just helps facilitate that

446
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:43,680
because they understand what what's the

447
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:44,880
truth of the matter is you're not going

448
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,320
to rip and replace all these switches in

449
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,300
your Enterprise to make them sdn today

450
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:49,860
right it's just not going to happen so

451
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:51,060
they have to talk they have to be

452
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:52,639
friendly

453
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:55,800
dual Port devices right again when

454
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,000
you're looking at software-defined

455
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,380
networks make sure that the controller

456
00:15:58,380 --> 00:15:59,760
understands the difference in a dual

457
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,320
Port device because it's both a switch

458
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,480
and a device

459
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,399
so if your controller thinks it's a

460
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:06,779
switch it's not a device if your

461
00:16:06,779 --> 00:16:08,040
controller thinks it's a device it's not

462
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,480
a switch

463
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,220
so you have to be cognizant of some of

464
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,420
those things that are a little bit

465
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:14,040
different right I've got a customer

466
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,300
today who

467
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:18,540
he uses DLR as his ring Network and then

468
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:20,699
he puts a bunch of two port rfids in

469
00:16:20,699 --> 00:16:22,500
between all the switches on that DLR

470
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,899
ring Network okay

471
00:16:24,899 --> 00:16:25,860
um

472
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:27,480
that's a bit of a challenge but if

473
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:28,620
you're working with the right controller

474
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:32,000
that problem is solved

475
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:34,980
beacons beacons beacons

476
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:37,500
sdn works like this when a packet comes

477
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,480
into a switch the switch says do I have

478
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,339
a flow that's that communication between

479
00:16:41,339 --> 00:16:43,920
two devices do I have a flow that says

480
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,959
this packet is okay because it's

481
00:16:45,959 --> 00:16:48,060
intended for that device on ethernet IP

482
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:49,980
and I have a flow already that says

483
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:51,060
that's cool

484
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:53,279
if so switch just lets it go

485
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:56,100
if not that very first packet is sent to

486
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:57,480
the controller

487
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,220
the controller evaluates its policies

488
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:01,380
and says do I have a policy that says

489
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:03,360
that device can talk to that device over

490
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,000
ethernet IP I do

491
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,740
send the flow to the switch the switch

492
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:09,839
writes the flow controller is no longer

493
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:11,280
necessary I can turn the controller off

494
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,619
I could reboot the switch 500 times

495
00:17:13,619 --> 00:17:15,480
next time it comes up if that device

496
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,220
tries to talk to that device the switch

497
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:18,660
is going to say no problem you're good

498
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:20,220
okay

499
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:22,319
well if you have something like a beacon

500
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:24,599
anybody from anybody anybody not

501
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:26,579
familiar with the LR you guys kind of

502
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:28,199
know what DLR is right

503
00:17:28,199 --> 00:17:29,760
device level ring in the world of

504
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,679
ethernet IP so it beacons and the

505
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:33,120
beacons are about a 50 millisecond

506
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,340
rotation around the network

507
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:36,900
well if you think about what I just said

508
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:38,940
and how the switch works

509
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:41,940
if you're sending a packet up to the

510
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:44,580
switch every 50 milliseconds from 150

511
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:46,500
devices on the network

512
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,539
the controller is like

513
00:17:48,539 --> 00:17:52,080
I said no all right wait a minute it's

514
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,880
back I said no

515
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:56,460
I'm still back I still said no but you

516
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:58,500
start doing some funky things with I had

517
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,179
a customer hit line speed because he

518
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:02,160
plugged his he plugged it into an

519
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,539
Enterprise Network that had so

520
00:18:03,539 --> 00:18:04,860
absolutely much traffic that it

521
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:06,360
literally took is linked to line speed

522
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,860
and he couldn't he couldn't figure out

523
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:09,360
why the controller wasn't responding I'm

524
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,980
like well

525
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:12,600
you're in line speed and you're not

526
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,820
doing anything but asking it should I

527
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:16,980
let this thing talk so there's this

528
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:19,679
concept of block flows

529
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:21,360
so when you look at a controller make

530
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,559
sure the controller does This Thing

531
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,000
Called block flows because what's going

532
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,620
to be critical is the second that first

533
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:27,419
DLR Beacon gets up there the controller

534
00:18:27,419 --> 00:18:29,520
says Nope I never want to see this again

535
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,020
writes a block flow to the switch the

536
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:32,580
switch gets this packet on Ingress next

537
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:34,080
time throws it away

538
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,720
and it'll just keep throwing it away

539
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:37,860
until

540
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:39,539
the controller says yeah I want to see

541
00:18:39,539 --> 00:18:42,299
those again okay again so that's kind of

542
00:18:42,299 --> 00:18:44,640
a difference beacons and how flat is too

543
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,840
flat

544
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,419
I love this discussion

545
00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:50,400
anybody in here heard anybody recently

546
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,260
say you know the flatter your network is

547
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:54,360
the easier it is to manage and the more

548
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:56,460
secure you are

549
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:58,559
I can't remember the last time I heard

550
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:00,780
that did you say you heard that

551
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:02,940
okay were they right

552
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:04,740
Maybe

553
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:06,660
possibly I'll give you the possibly is

554
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:08,700
correct so if you look at what we've

555
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:10,260
done with segmentation of networks if

556
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:11,760
you look at the whole VLAN concept if

557
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,140
you look at the whole hierarchies that

558
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:15,240
we've built and put in place from a

559
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,740
physical perspective you know flat

560
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:18,780
versus not flat largely it was to

561
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:20,760
support the technology that we use to

562
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,740
help us segment and manage the network

563
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:24,419
it's not because we all necessarily

564
00:19:24,419 --> 00:19:26,280
thought that was the right way to go

565
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:28,559
it just made sense

566
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:31,260
in the world of sdn it doesn't matter

567
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:33,960
you can have as hierarchical and network

568
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,760
as you want you can have as flat a

569
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,320
network as you want in fact I would

570
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,480
argue that if I had a great big flat

571
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,700
network but it was an sdn Network it

572
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:44,039
would be a more secure and B easier to

573
00:19:44,039 --> 00:19:45,360
manage

574
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,760
right and if you're like me you've been

575
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,620
in traditional networking for as long as

576
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:50,880
traditional networking has been around

577
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,520
there are Concepts in sdn that you will

578
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,559
will melt your head because they're

579
00:19:55,559 --> 00:19:57,120
contrary to everything you've ever heard

580
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,940
right but it's important to stop step

581
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:04,020
back and go ah that really oh I get it

582
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:06,000
right but you I still have customers

583
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,679
today that say all right well how do I

584
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:09,360
control this port well that Port doesn't

585
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,380
matter

586
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:12,900
in the world of SCM ports are irrelevant

587
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:15,179
it's the two devices can they talk to

588
00:20:15,179 --> 00:20:17,280
each other right are they allowed to

589
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,080
talk to each other and by what means are

590
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,640
they allowed to talk

591
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:24,120
so this whole idea of acl's Port ACLs

592
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:26,580
don't need it okay that concept doesn't

593
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:27,980
apply here

594
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:31,320
all right so deployment

595
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:33,120
we used to have to configure all of our

596
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:36,360
switches for our oems that was painful

597
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,460
so we bought them and configured them

598
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:40,500
and delivered them because the first few

599
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,179
times we tried to do it when we let the

600
00:20:42,179 --> 00:20:45,299
customer configure our switches

601
00:20:45,299 --> 00:20:48,299
didn't work out exactly as we'd hoped

602
00:20:48,299 --> 00:20:51,539
so we started doing that right well what

603
00:20:51,539 --> 00:20:53,760
if I don't have to do that what if I can

604
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,740
put my sdn controller in learn mode and

605
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:57,600
just let it learn the traffic write its

606
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,280
own flows in its own policies based on

607
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,960
what it sees on the shop floor at the

608
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,160
OEM

609
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,260
I'm a lot less concerned about Security

610
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:06,000
on the OEM floor

611
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,640
still concerned but less concerned so if

612
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,740
I could tell this thing learn the

613
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:12,360
traffic learn what devices are allowed

614
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:14,160
to talk to each other write the policies

615
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:16,200
to allow that and then I can go peel

616
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,179
that stuff out that I don't want later

617
00:21:18,179 --> 00:21:19,620
that's a great that's a great solution

618
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:20,760
because then I don't have to worry about

619
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:22,260
configuring switches they literally

620
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:23,760
power them in plug them up and you

621
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,380
pretty much go

622
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:28,020
controller takes care of the rest

623
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:29,820
I get a lot of oems that don't

624
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:31,919
understand networks and security it

625
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:33,539
doesn't matter

626
00:21:33,539 --> 00:21:35,820
right they can we can put the controller

627
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:38,039
in learn mode

628
00:21:38,039 --> 00:21:39,539
and it'll do what it needs to do to let

629
00:21:39,539 --> 00:21:40,980
them whoever talk to whatever wherever

630
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:43,280
on the network okay

631
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:46,020
we used to have to be on hand I used to

632
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:48,360
get zinged by my machine Builders and

633
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:50,280
Equipment Builders they would say you

634
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:53,340
know you um you have exactly

635
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:54,720
um three days to get out here and

636
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:55,679
reconfigure this or we're going to

637
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:56,820
charge you a big boatload of money

638
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:58,260
because you've stopped our ability to

639
00:21:58,260 --> 00:21:59,340
build your machine

640
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:01,440
this goes away right

641
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:04,320
so deployment you know what are the sdn

642
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,780
challenges you have to be able to adopt

643
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:08,940
a switch which means you tell the switch

644
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:10,380
this is your controller you talk to

645
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:11,880
nobody else ever you take no directions

646
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:14,039
no configuration from anything else ever

647
00:22:14,039 --> 00:22:15,360
period

648
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,159
okay it's not it's a pretty simple

649
00:22:17,159 --> 00:22:18,780
process but it's different than what we

650
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:20,159
have to do today

651
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:22,200
right

652
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,179
um when the equipment is moved you

653
00:22:24,179 --> 00:22:25,200
should take a look at the rules and

654
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,400
decide what you want to keep what you

655
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,620
want to get rid of in the policies

656
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:30,120
and when you connect it to the

657
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:31,799
Enterprise Network you don't just

658
00:22:31,799 --> 00:22:33,419
literally plug everything in which we

659
00:22:33,419 --> 00:22:34,679
don't do today I mean if you just walk

660
00:22:34,679 --> 00:22:36,360
in and start willy-nilly plugging things

661
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:37,500
in from your controls Network your

662
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,539
Enterprise Network they really don't

663
00:22:39,539 --> 00:22:40,919
like a lot of the stuff that we Bounce

664
00:22:40,919 --> 00:22:44,039
Around Enterprise networks okay so

665
00:22:44,039 --> 00:22:46,200
managing it how do I make changes 60

666
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,539
switches I don't

667
00:22:48,539 --> 00:22:50,400
I make one change and it applies to 60

668
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,740
switches I make it to change and I say

669
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:55,020
all hmis can talk to all plcs in zone 2

670
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:56,760
over ethernet IP

671
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:58,260
I'm done

672
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:00,240
all plcs anywhere in my network even if

673
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,520
I move them around 27 times today we'll

674
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,620
only be able to talk to all the plcs in

675
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:06,299
that zone over that protocol period

676
00:23:06,299 --> 00:23:08,880
doesn't matter where they go okay

677
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,919
can't fat finger changes like that I

678
00:23:10,919 --> 00:23:11,940
mean I can tell you I've tried to

679
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:13,620
configure and my guys used to go out and

680
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:15,240
try to configure like minor changes to

681
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:17,039
something we'll miss it on four of the

682
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:18,539
operations and the guys on third shift

683
00:23:18,539 --> 00:23:19,740
tonight are gonna have to figure out why

684
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:22,380
it's not running or working

685
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:24,179
uh you don't need to back up your

686
00:23:24,179 --> 00:23:26,220
switches that was a huge problem for us

687
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:28,679
right the controller knows what the

688
00:23:28,679 --> 00:23:30,059
switch is supposed to do so if you plug

689
00:23:30,059 --> 00:23:32,640
in a new Switch the controller goes

690
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,080
configuration goes to the switch and

691
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,320
you're done

692
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,880
training plant staff this is super easy

693
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,820
I can I can literally teach somebody in

694
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:43,440
in maintenance who's not a network

695
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:46,080
person it takes me about 15 minutes to

696
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,880
show them how to manage it now again

697
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,380
some of the stuff I talk about is

698
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:51,240
specific to the type of controller or

699
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:52,620
whose controller you're using and how

700
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:53,760
much thought they've given to the OT

701
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:54,900
space

702
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:56,700
because there's lots of ocn controllers

703
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:59,400
that are not OT specific or don't take

704
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:01,700
into consideration OT

705
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:03,960
capabilities Staffing things of that

706
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:04,860
nature

707
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:06,120
um

708
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:07,620
knowing what's on the network when

709
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:09,120
deployed and being accurate I think we

710
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,380
talked about this a few minutes ago

711
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:12,720
right I used to say six months six

712
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,039
months by the time six months has

713
00:24:14,039 --> 00:24:16,260
escaped or passed after I've deployed

714
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:17,400
equipment to one of my facilities

715
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,900
globally the drawings are no longer

716
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:20,640
accurate

717
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,860
and how accurate or not accurate they

718
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:24,539
would be depend upon where you are and

719
00:24:24,539 --> 00:24:26,100
what was going on but they were never

720
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:27,720
the same nobody ever redlined a drawing

721
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,580
so I never knew what was out there

722
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:32,039
in the world of sdn you have real-time

723
00:24:32,039 --> 00:24:33,780
asset inventory I know everything that's

724
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:34,980
on the network where it's on the network

725
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:36,480
when it's on the network what port it's

726
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:37,740
on the network of what switch it's on

727
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:38,820
the network and I will see it

728
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:40,380
immediately If It Moves

729
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:43,200
not in an hour not after we've rescanned

730
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,760
the network because sdn is the network

731
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,799
fabric I will see it when it moves in

732
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:48,840
nearly real time okay

733
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:50,580
I will see it when it tries to talk a

734
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:52,799
new protocol it will tell me this device

735
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:54,299
on this port of this switch just tried

736
00:24:54,299 --> 00:24:55,860
to talk profinet to this device on this

737
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:58,260
port of this switch traffic was blocked

738
00:24:58,260 --> 00:24:59,520
right

739
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,740
out of date drawings doesn't matter you

740
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:03,419
get a nice topology this real real view

741
00:25:03,419 --> 00:25:05,100
of what your network looks like

742
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:07,320
complaint controlling supplier access is

743
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:09,000
huge right we didn't know how to keep

744
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,020
people out

745
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:12,179
how do I keep them from uploading our

746
00:25:12,179 --> 00:25:14,640
proprietary scada PLC stuff if I can

747
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,960
plug them into the network anywhere they

748
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,580
can get there right

749
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:20,159
beautiful thing about sdn is that guy

750
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:21,600
can only get to his equipment and only

751
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,820
over ethernet IP he can't even ping it

752
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:25,740
if you don't let him he also can't go to

753
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:27,240
the web page on that if you don't let

754
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:29,340
him right so you have and it won't

755
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:30,900
matter where on your network he plugs in

756
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:32,700
he can only get to his device he can

757
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:36,059
only see his device okay

758
00:25:36,059 --> 00:25:37,440
um

759
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:40,260
we tried with written policy to do stuff

760
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:44,039
right yeah written policy is great and I

761
00:25:44,039 --> 00:25:45,179
would never argue that you shouldn't

762
00:25:45,179 --> 00:25:47,279
have it I will argue that by the time it

763
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:49,679
hits the plant floor the likelihood that

764
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:52,200
it's followed is slimmer than we would

765
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:56,520
like and that's just the way it is okay

766
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:58,980
um in general switches and stores talked

767
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:00,779
about that a little bit you know how do

768
00:26:00,779 --> 00:26:02,820
I how do I keep Personnel from plugging

769
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:04,200
stuff into the wrong place at the wrong

770
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,760
time either creating Loops you can't

771
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,860
create a loop in an sdn Network we'll

772
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:10,440
allow it it calculates the fastest path

773
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:12,059
between two points but it will not let

774
00:26:12,059 --> 00:26:14,520
you do things like create loops

775
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:15,419
um

776
00:26:15,419 --> 00:26:18,960
so sdn challenges it's not designed to

777
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:22,080
control user-specific access

778
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,000
you have tools that you like for that

779
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,980
that you use for that they still they

780
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:28,200
still work they're still very valuable

781
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,600
but at sdn is specifically not designed

782
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:33,600
to control user access okay it's

783
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,539
designed to control device protocol that

784
00:26:36,539 --> 00:26:38,700
type of thing if there's a tool you like

785
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:40,200
that sits on your network today that

786
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,240
helps you control user access use it

787
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:45,140
it'll work just fine okay

788
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:47,220
it's a different way to manage the

789
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:50,340
network but it's a traditional Network

790
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:52,140
how do I keep people from getting rip

791
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:53,640
don't let them get to the equipment

792
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:55,679
that's not theirs how do I keep them off

793
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:56,820
the network when they don't belong there

794
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:58,500
don't let them on the network they could

795
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:00,000
plug their laptop into any port of any

796
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,140
switch and if they're not allowed on the

797
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:02,940
network that packet goes right out the

798
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:04,799
window they can't get there from here

799
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:06,440
but I'll get an immediate notification

800
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:09,299
telling me somebody on this port of this

801
00:27:09,299 --> 00:27:11,100
switch with this laptop just plugged

802
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:13,140
into this right

803
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:14,760
how do I know when a supplier is on my

804
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,020
network and where they're connected I

805
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:17,580
will know again where they plugged in

806
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:19,080
what they're doing and what protocols

807
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:21,059
they're trying to use

808
00:27:21,059 --> 00:27:22,760
all right

809
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:24,840
how do I know what protocols are on my

810
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,340
network you will know in nearly real

811
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:28,559
time when something is on your network

812
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:30,240
if something new shows up you will know

813
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,880
in nearly real time okay you have that

814
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,799
visibility into your network

815
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:37,080
how do I keep people from taking it down

816
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:38,760
by creating Loops we talked about that

817
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,860
right all them create loops

818
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:42,299
how do I keep them you see I get off

819
00:27:42,299 --> 00:27:43,799
topic I get way ahead of my slides

820
00:27:43,799 --> 00:27:45,299
sometimes I even forget I have a clicker

821
00:27:45,299 --> 00:27:47,700
periodically so unfortunately I've only

822
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:49,260
got about another two hours so we'll get

823
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:51,120
through all this

824
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,940
I realize I'm between you and beer and

825
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:56,039
sunshine so I'll try to keep it down to

826
00:27:56,039 --> 00:27:58,260
less than two hours

827
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:00,720
um you know the Mind twist it requires

828
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:01,919
you to think differently about the

829
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:02,940
network

830
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:05,400
because it eliminates a lot of the

831
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,799
things that we struggle with today when

832
00:28:07,799 --> 00:28:09,299
you deploy the network

833
00:28:09,299 --> 00:28:11,400
and we can have that conversation but I

834
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,779
will tell you that I you know even

835
00:28:12,779 --> 00:28:14,039
myself I'll start thinking about

836
00:28:14,039 --> 00:28:16,620
something in in 20 years of 25 years of

837
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:18,000
networking start saying well I shouldn't

838
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,860
and you're like no I don't have to do it

839
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:22,559
that way right

840
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:24,059
um can a physical Network be more

841
00:28:24,059 --> 00:28:25,740
segmented that a network is not a

842
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:28,080
physically flat Network absolutely

843
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,299
I can absolutely be vastly more

844
00:28:30,299 --> 00:28:31,799
segmented than anything you can create

845
00:28:31,799 --> 00:28:33,059
with vlans

846
00:28:33,059 --> 00:28:34,980
I won't even argue it

847
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:36,360
I have a customer right now who just

848
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:38,400
deployed their first line there are 3

849
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:41,460
500 flows in a given switch

850
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:44,460
that means they have created this is a

851
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:46,320
horrible way to describe it there are 3

852
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,059
500 point-to-point Communications

853
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:49,860
between devices and protocols on their

854
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:51,360
Network and it's managing every one of

855
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:54,120
those as an individual conversation

856
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:56,820
you will never do that with vlans Not

857
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:58,860
only would it be obscenely difficult to

858
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:01,620
manage and configure it just it would be

859
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:03,600
you wouldn't be able to do it it'd just

860
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,820
be painful

861
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:08,279
um the network is device Centric it's

862
00:29:08,279 --> 00:29:10,320
not switch or Port Centric that's a big

863
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,419
mind change right we don't we think we

864
00:29:12,419 --> 00:29:15,679
think today Port Centric right

865
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:18,659
sdn is not a silver bullet

866
00:29:18,659 --> 00:29:21,000
it does not solve all problems of all

867
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,940
things what it does is lay a tremendous

868
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:27,179
Foundation at the network fabric layer

869
00:29:27,179 --> 00:29:29,700
that you can build upon to mitigate

870
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:31,440
those risks that you are concerned with

871
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,659
right everybody knows that the amount of

872
00:29:33,659 --> 00:29:35,220
security you need is

873
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:36,539
depends on the amount of risk you're

874
00:29:36,539 --> 00:29:38,520
willing to live with right but if you

875
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:40,140
start with a solid foundation you get

876
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:42,779
visibility you get firewall in every

877
00:29:42,779 --> 00:29:44,580
port of every switch even east to west

878
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:46,620
across the single switch can't do that

879
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:49,080
today with much not very not very easily

880
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:52,919
if you start with sdn and you do it and

881
00:29:52,919 --> 00:29:54,299
you put it in play in the OT space

882
00:29:54,299 --> 00:29:56,220
making sure it's you know controller

883
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:57,480
that understands what the difference is

884
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:59,940
in the OT space are

885
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:01,740
um you'll find that it's very

886
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:05,700
it makes a huge difference right

887
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:07,320
um I keep pushing the laser pointer

888
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:10,679
which I was forewarned to never push

889
00:30:10,679 --> 00:30:12,240
um so this is a great time for questions

890
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,520
again I'm Jeff with dynix

891
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:16,559
um and we offer of course the products

892
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:18,360
that are up there including we work with

893
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:19,919
a partner company called veracity who

894
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:21,720
has an sdn controller for the OT space

895
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,340
so I'm happy to talk about that stuff

896
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:25,440
with anybody afterwards or later

897
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,240
you can get a hold of me at that but are

898
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,740
there any questions please use the

899
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:30,720
microphone yourself

900
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,820
yeah so um

901
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:36,000
how do you deal the the sdn is concerned

902
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,279
with the device the device flows yes how

903
00:30:38,279 --> 00:30:41,520
do you deal with Device trust and then

904
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,380
another thing you said like how do you

905
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:45,000
know the device that's purporting to be

906
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,440
the device that you've established a

907
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:49,260
flow for is the device that you're

908
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:51,480
expecting and then another thing you

909
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:53,640
said was that all these switches need to

910
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:55,140
be Layer Two but my experience on the

911
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:57,960
Enterprise SD inside is that the vendors

912
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:00,720
tend to pack the sdn interfaces up in

913
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:03,240
the higher tier yep layer three software

914
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,740
packages you end up having to pay for it

915
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:06,960
anyway so I mean different in the OT

916
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,760
space let me answer your second question

917
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:10,200
first because this is shorter than two

918
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,299
answers it doesn't have to be Layer Two

919
00:31:12,299 --> 00:31:13,980
doesn't have to be layer three whatever

920
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:16,620
supports the standard okay

921
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:18,480
that was the key question what is the

922
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,279
standard what what standard is emerging

923
00:31:20,279 --> 00:31:23,220
right so the the current standard is a

924
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:26,100
technology called open Flow okay there

925
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:27,299
are other standards that are coming

926
00:31:27,299 --> 00:31:29,279
along but unfortunately some of those

927
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:30,240
standards at least from the OT

928
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:33,000
perspective are very silicon focused so

929
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,980
unless you want to put a 240 gigabit

930
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:37,740
chipset in your 16 Port switch in a

931
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:39,360
control panel and pay the extra four

932
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,919
grand for it probably not going to

933
00:31:40,919 --> 00:31:44,039
happen to your other question and again

934
00:31:44,039 --> 00:31:46,200
this is going to be controller specific

935
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:49,020
or Centric right so in in the case of

936
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:50,460
the controller that I'm most familiar

937
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:51,240
with

938
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:53,640
we fingerprint the devices so let's take

939
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:55,380
for example it's a Rockwell device I

940
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:57,600
plug it into the network so the first

941
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,399
thing we see is an arp we see a Mac we

942
00:31:59,399 --> 00:32:00,720
see all the normal stuff then the next

943
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:01,679
thing we're going to do is we're going

944
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:03,120
to do a sip identity request and we're

945
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,620
going to say who are you we're going to

946
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:05,820
get back product codes we're going to

947
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:07,140
get back serial numbers we're going to

948
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:08,520
get firmware revisions we're going to

949
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:10,500
get a couple other pieces of data we

950
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:12,480
fingerprint and use all of that

951
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,159
so if I unplug that device from the

952
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:15,419
network and I plug it in somewhere else

953
00:32:15,419 --> 00:32:16,919
and we see it come back on the network

954
00:32:16,919 --> 00:32:19,260
we're going to say this is all the same

955
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:21,120
we're good if I see that the product

956
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:22,620
code is 13

957
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:24,779
it used to be seven but the mac and

958
00:32:24,779 --> 00:32:25,980
everything else is the same that device

959
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:28,140
will be immediately quarantined

960
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:30,120
so we take a deeper dive and again

961
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:31,679
that's kind of one of the OT specific

962
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:33,779
pieces of it is we take a deeper dive on

963
00:32:33,779 --> 00:32:35,100
the device to understand how to

964
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:36,419
fingerprint it

965
00:32:36,419 --> 00:32:38,340
did that did answer your question okay

966
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:39,539
great

967
00:32:39,539 --> 00:32:41,100
yes sir

968
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:43,020
so uh first of all thanks for the for

969
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:44,640
the talk it's awesome

970
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,740
um I'm super familiar with sdns from

971
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:48,059
back in the day

972
00:32:48,059 --> 00:32:49,919
um you know the roof net to MIT to

973
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:52,740
Moroccan Cisco and Sierra have a complex

974
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:53,820
question so I'm trying to get through

975
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:56,159
this but the OpenFlow protocol you know

976
00:32:56,159 --> 00:32:57,240
there's lots of research that was

977
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:59,580
happening in the early days in the

978
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:01,320
current state with with Cloud native

979
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:03,419
Solutions you've got like traffic and

980
00:33:03,419 --> 00:33:06,059
core DNS yep not necessarily it's the

981
00:33:06,059 --> 00:33:08,039
total polar opposite of the OT space

982
00:33:08,039 --> 00:33:10,799
right there's things like AWS Green

983
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:13,620
Grass and lots of the businesses headed

984
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:16,620
or already in the cloud yep where do you

985
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:19,320
see the convergence of things that you

986
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:20,340
may not be familiar with like traffic

987
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:22,620
and and Court DNS I'm not sure but

988
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:24,419
there's a convergence at some point

989
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:26,640
where you had this early consolidation

990
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:29,399
of m a right and the tech you now have

991
00:33:29,399 --> 00:33:31,200
cloud and lots of consolidation M A

992
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,600
you've got physical layer yep and you've

993
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,159
got cloud and you've got things like

994
00:33:35,159 --> 00:33:36,840
kubernetes and stuff in between with

995
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:39,299
with essentially sdns but they're not

996
00:33:39,299 --> 00:33:41,519
sdns they're part of cloud native stuff

997
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:43,559
yeah where do you see that mold going

998
00:33:43,559 --> 00:33:45,240
and is there other standards besides

999
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:47,399
open Flow that that people should be

1000
00:33:47,399 --> 00:33:49,679
looking at and monitoring

1001
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:51,659
a great question that would probably

1002
00:33:51,659 --> 00:33:53,519
take me about 15 minutes to answer

1003
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:56,820
correctly the short answer is OpenFlow

1004
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:58,080
is the technology that's working today

1005
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,519
and it works on the plant floor and in

1006
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:01,080
the OT space makes a lot of sense there

1007
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,640
a lot of these other technologies that

1008
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,200
rolling through the Enterprise are based

1009
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,000
on that at least they cover it up really

1010
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,320
nicely but they won't tell you it's

1011
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:09,540
there there are other Technologies like

1012
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:11,760
P4 if you're familiar with P4 technology

1013
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:14,399
it's not the same OpenFlow is an

1014
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:16,379
application layer protocol P4 is

1015
00:34:16,379 --> 00:34:18,119
literally much lower than that it's a

1016
00:34:18,119 --> 00:34:19,800
programming level you could literally

1017
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,659
create a switch

1018
00:34:21,659 --> 00:34:24,359
a communication between devices with

1019
00:34:24,359 --> 00:34:27,239
open Flow because you wrote it in P4

1020
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:29,760
so the the convergence is going to be

1021
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,679
more gradual the biggest problem from an

1022
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:33,780
OT perspective is people are scared to

1023
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:35,820
put their safety off the floor

1024
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:37,139
yeah and that's where you're asked about

1025
00:34:37,139 --> 00:34:40,379
a layer one you know question earlier I

1026
00:34:40,379 --> 00:34:41,940
was thinking that like the idea of like

1027
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:44,820
if you secure the edge with kind of like

1028
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:47,159
a casbia cloud access security broker

1029
00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:50,460
but at the edge using sdn you could

1030
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:52,260
flatten everything out potentially and

1031
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:54,659
have the right vlans that trunk up

1032
00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:57,180
absolutely so no no argument or

1033
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:59,160
discussion there at all

1034
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:02,220
yes sir um two questions would you argue

1035
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:04,440
rip and replace or

1036
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:07,020
gradually moving into it that's a really

1037
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:09,119
good question and we work with a lot of

1038
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:10,740
customers and I'll give you all the

1039
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:13,640
perspectives that I I've heard and

1040
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:16,980
surprisingly to me it's changed in the

1041
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:18,720
last year and a half to two years

1042
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:21,359
probably last year so my initial thought

1043
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:23,160
was and as an end user who's deployed

1044
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:24,660
thousands and thousands and thousands of

1045
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:25,859
switches and production networks around

1046
00:35:25,859 --> 00:35:28,859
the world I can't imagine ripping and

1047
00:35:28,859 --> 00:35:31,320
replacing right so my answer to that

1048
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:33,420
would be well you can literally put we

1049
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:35,040
always had an aggregate switch at the

1050
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,780
top of our our Network you know where

1051
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:39,060
all of our Rings came back to this if I

1052
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:41,339
make that sdn I get a tremendous amount

1053
00:35:41,339 --> 00:35:42,960
of benefit by replacing that one

1054
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,520
aggregate switch with an sdn switch

1055
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:47,099
because I can still manage traffic

1056
00:35:47,099 --> 00:35:49,079
up and down and in between and across

1057
00:35:49,079 --> 00:35:51,060
that switch so that's one answer

1058
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:53,339
the thing that surprises me the most and

1059
00:35:53,339 --> 00:35:55,800
I had this conversation with the head of

1060
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,720
OT cyber security for one of our bigger

1061
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:59,579
customers it's one of the automotives

1062
00:35:59,579 --> 00:36:03,480
the big three and it's not GM or Ford

1063
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:04,820
um

1064
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:06,900
I can't really say who but it's not

1065
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:08,400
Jammer Ford

1066
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,960
um I said you know what what are your

1067
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:12,180
thoughts and the answer was well

1068
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:13,859
when I look at some of the monitoring

1069
00:36:13,859 --> 00:36:15,599
tools and software I'm looking to put in

1070
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:18,180
right now and the cost that's going to

1071
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:20,940
incur I got no problem spending a couple

1072
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:21,900
hundred thousand dollars to replace

1073
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:24,240
switches and and so that was that was

1074
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:26,400
the answer and I was like wow I'm

1075
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,560
surprised uh one of our other big

1076
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:31,260
customers had to replace all of their

1077
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:33,359
Cisco ie4000s in a plant because they

1078
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:34,740
were trying to get their ice installed

1079
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:36,240
to work and Cisco said you guys need to

1080
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:37,560
use this version of firmware it's not

1081
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:39,000
available on that platform so they

1082
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,619
literally spent four months and replaced

1083
00:36:40,619 --> 00:36:42,839
every single switch across the facility

1084
00:36:42,839 --> 00:36:45,599
and the reason for that is visibility

1085
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:49,260
and control and security is is

1086
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:51,300
exponentially more important today than

1087
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:53,520
it was so that cost is amazing to me

1088
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:55,920
that you know her answer was uh I'll

1089
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,300
happily spend a couple hundred thousand

1090
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:59,220
dollars on switches if that gives me

1091
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:00,960
what you're giving me which is control

1092
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:03,119
and visibility instead of me spending

1093
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:04,560
three million dollars across a couple of

1094
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,660
plants for some software

1095
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:08,880
the cool thing is depending on the sdn

1096
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,980
controller again and you may get the

1097
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:13,680
plug for me in there someplace

1098
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:15,480
if your controller supports things like

1099
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:17,160
per switch learning mode and network

1100
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:19,260
learning mode and has lots of tools that

1101
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:20,760
allow you to do that I could literally

1102
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:22,440
if you could wire up all the switches I

1103
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:24,060
could convert an entire plant in a half

1104
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:25,800
an hour

1105
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,060
because I'm just going to put the

1106
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:28,500
controllers in learn mode when it tries

1107
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:29,760
to come up and things start trying to

1108
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:30,780
talk the controller is going to say no

1109
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:31,920
problem no problem no problem no problem

1110
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,960
just go talk and they'll be right back

1111
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,280
to where they were with their existing

1112
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,359
switches

1113
00:37:36,359 --> 00:37:38,280
at that point they can say though I

1114
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:40,380
don't like this uh telling that stuff I

1115
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:43,140
don't like this FTP I didn't even know I

1116
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:44,820
had FTP on my network don't want that

1117
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:46,740
and as soon as they start doing that it

1118
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:48,540
literally in nearly real time starts you

1119
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:49,980
know I'm a controls guy so nearly real

1120
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:51,660
time to me means something I had some

1121
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:53,040
guys try to sell me software a few years

1122
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:56,040
ago and they said oh it's real time I

1123
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:58,560
said it is I said yeah I said well how

1124
00:37:58,560 --> 00:37:59,700
long does it take to update they said

1125
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:01,020
well three to eight seconds I wouldn't

1126
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:02,760
do that isn't even close to nearly real

1127
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:04,560
time in the controls world I said we

1128
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:07,020
think microseconds milliseconds at best

1129
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:09,900
that's nearly real time so that's the

1130
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:12,300
answer I would give you it's

1131
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:13,440
um there are ways to do it without

1132
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:14,940
ripping and replacing and still

1133
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:16,800
significantly elevating the control and

1134
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:19,980
visibility but some customers are

1135
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:21,900
surprising me and just simply saying I

1136
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:23,940
want the control I want visibility I'm

1137
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:26,760
not opposed to doing that

1138
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:29,460
um so um what about mixed environments

1139
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:31,859
right so most logically you won't rip

1140
00:38:31,859 --> 00:38:34,260
and replace yep I'm most likely you

1141
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:37,500
would have different segments that will

1142
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:39,660
be on different technology for some time

1143
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:41,220
yep

1144
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:43,560
um but until then you won't get the full

1145
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:44,760
benefit

1146
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:47,880
of sdn meaning no Loops no visibility

1147
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:51,780
all those stuff yeah so I can't control

1148
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:54,420
what isn't the sdn network but I can

1149
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:57,359
control Ingress and egress into it and

1150
00:38:57,359 --> 00:38:59,339
out of it from a traditional Network by

1151
00:38:59,339 --> 00:39:02,040
even by VLAN I can connect to stuff

1152
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:04,380
that's on a maybe it's using pvst and it

1153
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:07,440
has vlans 2013 or 401. because there are

1154
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:09,540
controllers out there

1155
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:11,520
that are smart enough to identify all

1156
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:12,839
that and even though they don't care

1157
00:39:12,839 --> 00:39:14,460
about vlans they know how to work with

1158
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:15,240
them

1159
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:17,700
so it's it makes it very easy and again

1160
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:19,200
that's that's our experience in the OT

1161
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,480
space right we know how that works that

1162
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:22,980
gives you the ability to get started and

1163
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:25,260
ease into it and drastically over time

1164
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:27,060
increase your security posture without a

1165
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:28,800
lot of risk because risk is the key in

1166
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:29,940
manufacturing

1167
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:31,920
we used to have a line that built uh

1168
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,839
axles built a new axle every nine

1169
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:35,339
seconds it was sixty percent of the

1170
00:39:35,339 --> 00:39:36,780
company's Revenue

1171
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:38,520
you shut that line down you didn't want

1172
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:39,780
to be in the plant

1173
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:41,579
if that line shut down you didn't want

1174
00:39:41,579 --> 00:39:44,300
to be in a plant right so uptime

1175
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:47,160
mitigating risk is is key so what we've

1176
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:50,220
tried to do is and what sdn does is

1177
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:51,960
helps you mitigate that risk but still

1178
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:53,880
start moving to a technology but

1179
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:55,200
dropping in that one aggregate switch

1180
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,700
like I said it's going to drastically

1181
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:59,940
elevate your your security posture with

1182
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:01,260
literally replacing out a single

1183
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:03,599
aggregate switch okay and I'd be happy

1184
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:05,339
you know I've only got a fixed amount of

1185
00:40:05,339 --> 00:40:06,960
time but I'd be happy to talk to anybody

1186
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:09,060
about that over time find me on LinkedIn

1187
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:11,520
find me at my email address we can talk

1188
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,859
about it you know I can give you my what

1189
00:40:13,859 --> 00:40:15,240
my

1190
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:17,160
what my other perspectives are and and

1191
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:19,020
if you're interested into technology I

1192
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:20,520
can certainly help you get pointed in

1193
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:23,300
the right direction any other questions

1194
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:26,760
more of a one final comment yeah when

1195
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:29,160
you say a person not familiar with IP or

1196
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:31,680
vln or trunking yeah is capable of doing

1197
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,180
sdn Network

1198
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:37,320
um I I don't believe you fair enough I'd

1199
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:39,660
be happy to prove it to you

1200
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:43,380
I love to put my money where my mouth is

1201
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:45,900
just a quick question is this primarily

1202
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:48,180
just in this great world or have you

1203
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:50,339
actually seen this actually work with

1204
00:40:50,339 --> 00:40:54,780
DCS vendors like a uh Delta V or

1205
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:57,300
Experian if it can plug into an Ethernet

1206
00:40:57,300 --> 00:40:59,700
Network it works okay

1207
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:01,380
there's literally again as I said in the

1208
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:02,900
onset of this that's a great question

1209
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:05,099
this is nothing more than the network

1210
00:41:05,099 --> 00:41:07,260
you have today we're simply changing how

1211
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:09,660
it's managed okay we're adding some

1212
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:11,339
automation to it

1213
00:41:11,339 --> 00:41:12,480
okay

1214
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:14,400
and some intelligence yeah you have to

1215
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:15,420
go there though

1216
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:18,300
uh it's more related to impacts in the

1217
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:19,859
actual infrastructure let's say I work

1218
00:41:19,859 --> 00:41:21,720
for a global company and I have been

1219
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:24,300
traveling for eight years for segmenting

1220
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:27,119
all the networks yeah and suddenly comes

1221
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:30,359
up sdn networks and we have this this

1222
00:41:30,359 --> 00:41:32,339
discussion at the table so which are the

1223
00:41:32,339 --> 00:41:35,280
real impacts for moving from a nice net

1224
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:37,500
OT Network segmentation to as the

1225
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:40,859
networks do I have benefits or this is

1226
00:41:40,859 --> 00:41:42,980
something for a green field uh project

1227
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:45,300
absolutely there are benefits right you

1228
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:47,540
get infinitely better segmentation

1229
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:49,320
significantly less complex

1230
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:51,240
configurations a central point of

1231
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:53,640
management for all of those switches you

1232
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:56,400
know you can make decisions like uh

1233
00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:00,000
all of the devices in zone two uh can

1234
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,800
talk over ethernet IP to everything in

1235
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:04,020
zone three or you can say things like

1236
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:06,060
all the plc's in zone two can talk to

1237
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:08,280
the hmis in zone three over ethernet IP

1238
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:10,440
but nothing else so the management

1239
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:12,660
becomes significantly easier

1240
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:15,060
and the the overall complexity of the

1241
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:16,980
system becomes vastly I had a customer

1242
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:18,359
in mind right now at one of the big

1243
00:42:18,359 --> 00:42:19,560
three

1244
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:22,560
um wasn't Ford or Chrysler who said you

1245
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:24,060
know I told him initially I said if it

1246
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:25,560
takes me more than 15 minutes to show

1247
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:27,960
you how to manage your network

1248
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:29,460
um I've messed up somewhere in what

1249
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:31,560
we've built and he was doing a podcast

1250
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:34,260
with me a couple of months later and the

1251
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:36,180
podcaster asked him a question and he

1252
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:37,800
said well Jeff told me at one point it

1253
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:39,359
would take me 15 minutes to learn how to

1254
00:42:39,359 --> 00:42:41,520
manage my network and he lied so of

1255
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:43,380
course we're in a podcast I about melted

1256
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:45,240
I'm thinking oh oh here it comes here's

1257
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:46,560
the 50-pound Hammer he said it took me

1258
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:48,240
about 10.

1259
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:52,020
okay so save save me big

1260
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:52,859
um

1261
00:42:52,859 --> 00:42:54,720
any other questions before I let you

1262
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:57,000
guys get out to the sunshine and the

1263
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,520
Cabana sessions uh great questions by

1264
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:00,839
the way like I said if you have more I'm

1265
00:43:00,839 --> 00:43:02,040
happy to talk about it I'll be around

1266
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:04,200
for the next couple days find me

1267
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:04,859
um

1268
00:43:04,859 --> 00:43:06,780
and to the gentleman who doesn't believe

1269
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:09,240
me I love that and I would have be happy

1270
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:12,180
to give you a different perspective

1271
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:14,960
all right thanks guys

1272
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:18,000
foreign
