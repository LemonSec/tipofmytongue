1
00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:03,179
foreign

2
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:07,500
it's never been a better time for OT

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:09,480
security

4
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:11,160
now

5
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:13,799
before we get into why uh can I see a

6
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:16,740
quick show of hands uh any Founders or

7
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:19,759
would-be Founders in the room

8
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:23,520
nice thanks for coming any um

9
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:26,519
employees of startups or Consultants or

10
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:28,619
people who work with startups

11
00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:30,660
yeah okay great

12
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:33,059
anybody who sees their logo on the

13
00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:35,160
slides behind me here any asset owners

14
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:38,040
utilities Industrials customers of

15
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:40,260
startups well thank you I think I have

16
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:41,940
something in this for for each one of

17
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:43,680
those audiences

18
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:44,700
um

19
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,500
but you probably want me to justify why

20
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,539
it's been it's never been a better time

21
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:51,239
for OT security than right now and there

22
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:53,460
are three reasons really the first is

23
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:55,739
it's a massive Market these companies

24
00:00:55,739 --> 00:00:57,239
that are buying these OT security

25
00:00:57,239 --> 00:00:59,039
products some of the biggest companies

26
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:01,500
in the world they have huge budgets and

27
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:02,940
they're finally starting to take cyber

28
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:05,339
security as seriously as other sectors

29
00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:07,439
who have long spent you know substantial

30
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:10,619
portions of their budget on security

31
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:13,140
the second is we have proven success we

32
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:14,400
know it's possible to make a lot of

33
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,479
money in OT security dragos is a energy

34
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:21,240
impact Partners portfolio company it's

35
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,640
worth 1.7 billion dollars today and

36
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,500
people know that there's a lot of

37
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,659
opportunity here so it's been proven it

38
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:28,799
can be done

39
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:31,200
and the third reason which is related to

40
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,780
this success and proof that it can be

41
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:35,520
done is that there's access to Capital

42
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,520
so in 2021 more than a billion dollars

43
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:41,640
of venture capital went into OT security

44
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,920
2022 the market took a little bit of a

45
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,020
dip but OT security has stayed strong

46
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:48,299
and cyber security in general has stayed

47
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:48,960
strong

48
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,939
so it's a great time to be in this space

49
00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:53,759
you're all positioned really well

50
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:55,860
um and we're here to help energy impact

51
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:58,140
Partners the team behind me uh this is

52
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:00,420
our cyber team we're a three billion

53
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:03,299
dollar Venture Capital fund backed by 60

54
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:06,060
plus utilities in industrial companies

55
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:07,500
so if you take one thing away from this

56
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,380
talk and nothing else take away that you

57
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:11,819
should go big

58
00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:13,319
everything else in this talk is really

59
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:16,379
just the why it matters to go big and

60
00:02:16,379 --> 00:02:18,360
some tips and tricks on how you can go

61
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,260
big

62
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:21,180
Adventure capital and startups are all

63
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:23,340
about going really big

64
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:25,020
I love talking to a room like this

65
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,520
because I come from a cyber security

66
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,080
background and because everyone in this

67
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,780
room inherently understands risk you all

68
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:33,239
know that equation impact times

69
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:34,560
probability

70
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,980
you know equals the risk so

71
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:40,379
when I think about this uh I go back to

72
00:02:40,379 --> 00:02:41,580
one of my favorite games growing up

73
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:44,459
Dungeons and Dragons and you know I

74
00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:46,200
think about the knowable and the

75
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,000
unknowable the outcomes are knowable

76
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,500
it's like the dungeon master right they

77
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,940
have all the options they've already

78
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:54,239
prepared everything uh similarly in

79
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:56,280
cyber security we know the worst case

80
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,620
scenario we've you know mapped

81
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:01,560
everything out and we understand uh you

82
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,819
know what we can

83
00:03:02,819 --> 00:03:06,900
actually predict will happen versus the

84
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:09,180
things that are uh you know

85
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:10,500
unpredictable

86
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:13,019
okay so go big you don't remember

87
00:03:13,019 --> 00:03:15,659
anything else remember there's one slide

88
00:03:15,659 --> 00:03:17,400
um

89
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,659
you know I think about the game Dungeons

90
00:03:18,659 --> 00:03:21,120
and Dragons and you think about the uh

91
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,819
outcomes that are knowable and we think

92
00:03:23,819 --> 00:03:25,200
about the probabilities which are also

93
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,580
knowable you might not know how the dice

94
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:28,980
get turned up when they get rolled but

95
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:31,200
you know the range in which the outcomes

96
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,480
are distributed just just the same in

97
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,340
cyber security you know zero days are

98
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,560
the rare exception we basically know

99
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,720
when things are vulnerable or at least

100
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,220
it's possible to know when things are

101
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:42,599
vulnerable you may not always know

102
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:45,420
exactly but these are knowable things

103
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:47,340
by contrast

104
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:49,920
startups are managing uncertainty so a

105
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,659
Founder's job is pretty different in a

106
00:03:51,659 --> 00:03:54,840
lot of key ways you don't know the size

107
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:55,860
of the outcome you're going to have

108
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:58,200
right a company like Google can be

109
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,879
founded with a few hundred thousand or a

110
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:01,140
couple million of venture capital and

111
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:03,000
grow to be you know tens of billions of

112
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,319
dollars

113
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:05,220
um

114
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:07,260
you also don't know the probability of

115
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:08,879
that outcome right so we have some rough

116
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:10,620
heuristics we can look at historical

117
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:13,439
stuff but it's fundamentally unknowable

118
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:15,180
there's many as many ways to succeed

119
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:17,160
inside in cyber security startups as

120
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,380
there are people so this is a little

121
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:21,720
more like poker you know the odds are in

122
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,100
the cards but you're not playing the

123
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,479
cards you're playing the person across

124
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:25,979
the table from you and you don't know

125
00:04:25,979 --> 00:04:27,540
what's going on their head whether

126
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:29,340
they're bluffing or not what the

127
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:31,620
propensity to bet is

128
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:33,360
and you don't know the upside if you're

129
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,400
playing against a billionaire uh you

130
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,840
know you might take all their chips and

131
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,280
they might throw down the keys to their

132
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,440
yacht and you know you could get really

133
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,680
lucky

134
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:46,440
so when I put this on a spectrum uh you

135
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,300
can see you know risk management on one

136
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:50,280
end and uncertainty Management on the

137
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:52,740
other end in finance it looks like

138
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:55,080
insurance and fixed income which are

139
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:58,080
bonds on one end and private equity in

140
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,120
venture capital on the far end

141
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,639
uh in cyber security we live over on the

142
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:04,259
risk management side of things they're

143
00:05:04,259 --> 00:05:05,400
really only four things you can do in

144
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:08,400
Risk Management uh you can avoid you can

145
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,500
accept the risk you can mitigate the

146
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,000
risk which is where we spend most of our

147
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,460
day and you can transfer which is you

148
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:15,900
know kind of controversial people have a

149
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,040
lot of opinions about cyber security

150
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,080
insurance but there are other ways to

151
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,820
transfer to whether it's Outsourcing to

152
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,699
a managed security service provider but

153
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:26,220
again most of the focus is on mitigation

154
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:28,560
in uncertainty management

155
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,160
um

156
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,500
you know there are four tools uh but

157
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,300
only one of them overlaps and that's a

158
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,699
void and just like in cyber security

159
00:05:35,699 --> 00:05:37,680
that decision is usually made Upstream

160
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,360
the business has already decided to take

161
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,639
the risk it's our job to deal with it in

162
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:44,039
Venture Capital the investors you know

163
00:05:44,039 --> 00:05:47,100
these large corporates that want us to

164
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:49,139
invest their money into cyber security

165
00:05:49,139 --> 00:05:51,600
startups on their behalf have decided to

166
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,580
take a very small percent of their

167
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:55,380
balance sheet and put it towards Venture

168
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:58,080
Capital to make some smart bets but that

169
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,400
decision has already been made by the

170
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,139
time it gets to us

171
00:06:01,139 --> 00:06:03,479
you can also hedge your risk that's more

172
00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:05,220
of the business of hedge funds it's

173
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:07,500
making opposing bets that balance each

174
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,840
other out so you might sell treasury

175
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,660
bonds and buy US dollars if you don't

176
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:14,699
want to take the interest rate risk

177
00:06:14,699 --> 00:06:15,840
um but you want exposure to the US

178
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,340
dollar it's not really what venture

179
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:20,940
capital is all about what we do do is

180
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:23,479
diversification so we have a portfolio

181
00:06:23,479 --> 00:06:26,160
we would like to make more bets but

182
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,780
there are only so many good cyber

183
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:28,979
security startups that you can bet on

184
00:06:28,979 --> 00:06:31,380
it's not like buying an S P 500 Index

185
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:32,819
Fund where you own the 500 biggest

186
00:06:32,819 --> 00:06:35,400
companies in America uh you know there

187
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:38,819
may be a dozen or so we have 13 in our

188
00:06:38,819 --> 00:06:41,280
portfolio right now uh We've exited one

189
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,139
so in

190
00:06:43,139 --> 00:06:44,699
a little less than 10 years we've made

191
00:06:44,699 --> 00:06:47,100
14 cyber security bets we'd like to do

192
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:47,940
more

193
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:49,919
the main thing we do is we stage our

194
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:50,819
bets

195
00:06:50,819 --> 00:06:52,680
so what does that look like

196
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,900
well before we get into staging let's

197
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:57,240
discuss why it's important

198
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,160
first

199
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,539
you know you want to distribute your

200
00:07:00,539 --> 00:07:01,919
bets throughout time

201
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:04,919
so you want to take your poker chips and

202
00:07:04,919 --> 00:07:06,900
you want to buy that ticket to the next

203
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:10,020
round which will let you know if you

204
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:11,880
should make further investments in the

205
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,440
following rounds

206
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,639
second

207
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:16,620
you have to get information from that

208
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:18,360
poker chip right you have to turn over

209
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,940
the next card in other Industries oil

210
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,759
and gas this looks like exploration

211
00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:24,660
whether you

212
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:26,880
are going to invest more in drilling

213
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,800
because you know that oil is there in

214
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,199
entertainment it's like a TV pilot you

215
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:33,060
want to run the show and see what the

216
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:34,919
test audience thinks or you commit to a

217
00:07:34,919 --> 00:07:36,900
whole season in Pharmaceuticals it's a

218
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:39,060
clinical trial same thing

219
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:41,520
and then fundamentally the third part

220
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,259
has to be there you have to be able to

221
00:07:43,259 --> 00:07:45,419
walk away if it doesn't actually go the

222
00:07:45,419 --> 00:07:47,039
way that you thought it would so in

223
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:49,500
poker that's folding your hand in

224
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:52,080
entertainment uh you know you cancel the

225
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:52,919
season

226
00:07:52,919 --> 00:07:55,680
oil and gas you pick up the rig and move

227
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,419
somewhere else more fruitful

228
00:07:57,419 --> 00:07:59,280
in cyber security investing that's

229
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,740
called a Down Round so you might have

230
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:03,060
invested in a bunch of rounds of a

231
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:05,160
company before and then you reprice the

232
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,400
company

233
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:09,060
what does this look like in practice

234
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:12,120
well here's kind of a toy example any

235
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,280
any real Finance Pros will know that

236
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,680
this is a huge simplification we don't

237
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,599
deal with the ideas like time value of

238
00:08:18,599 --> 00:08:20,580
money which is a dollar today is worth

239
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:22,400
more than a promise of a dollar tomorrow

240
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,479
we're not really looking at dilution

241
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:26,460
we're assuming that you're going to own

242
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:28,800
20 to 25 of the company when you sell it

243
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,120
but

244
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,580
in principle this is how it works you

245
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:34,620
could either like at the top make one

246
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:36,360
lump sum investment

247
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,760
let's say 44 million dollars

248
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:41,219
for the opportunity to make 375 million

249
00:08:41,219 --> 00:08:42,000
dollars

250
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,679
there's a less than 10 chance that

251
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:45,000
that's going to happen you run that

252
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,279
experiment 10 times and you lose money

253
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:49,620
it's not a good deal right

254
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:52,560
but Venture Capital stages the bets so

255
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,940
we're only going to bet two million

256
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:55,440
dollars in the seed round

257
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,540
for a company that we believe is worth

258
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:59,580
five million dollars and we think

259
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,680
there's a 30 chance that it could be

260
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:02,700
worth

261
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:04,860
30 million dollars

262
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:07,560
then we'll invest a little bit more

263
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,240
if we if we think that it's going to hit

264
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,220
the next Milestone we'll invest more and

265
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:13,260
then pretty soon you're at that 375

266
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:15,899
million dollar exit on a 1.5 billion

267
00:09:15,899 --> 00:09:17,279
dollar company

268
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:19,200
but crucially at each of these stages

269
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,660
you have the opportunity to walk away so

270
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:23,100
if companies don't hit their Milestones

271
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:25,620
you're not throwing good money after bad

272
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:27,180
what goes through the mind of a venture

273
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:28,440
capitalist that was a one company

274
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,480
example let's look at a end company

275
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,980
portfolio

276
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:34,440
so maybe we'll make four investments in

277
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:37,140
the very first year we have a 10-year

278
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:39,000
fund that's usually what the investors

279
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,620
in Venture Capital expect to get their

280
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:42,600
money back in 10 years they'll want to

281
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,160
see a few investments in that very first

282
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,959
year so that you have something coming

283
00:09:45,959 --> 00:09:47,339
right out the gate

284
00:09:47,339 --> 00:09:49,019
but you can only make new Investments

285
00:09:49,019 --> 00:09:51,300
for a few years because you have to give

286
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:53,640
the companies time to grow and then you

287
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:54,899
have to sell them before you return

288
00:09:54,899 --> 00:09:56,880
Capital to your investors your

289
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,040
investment period is really in years

290
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,980
let's call it zero to four

291
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:04,920
uh and your investors are going to

292
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,540
expect you to not only return that

293
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:08,760
Capital but to probably double or triple

294
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,080
it because you're holding their money

295
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,000
for 10 years it's a long time they could

296
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,140
have done something else with that money

297
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:15,000
and you're taking a substantial amount

298
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,140
of risk

299
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:18,779
that means in year two for example you

300
00:10:18,779 --> 00:10:20,700
might make three more new investments in

301
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:23,220
the uh four that you made before you

302
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:24,899
only follow on with two

303
00:10:24,899 --> 00:10:29,220
in year six or excuse me in year four uh

304
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:30,779
you'll make your last three Investments

305
00:10:30,779 --> 00:10:33,600
and you'll follow on uh with another

306
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,839
series a and maybe that those two series

307
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:38,820
a companies are now series B but you're

308
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:40,380
done making new Investments because

309
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:41,880
these companies need time to grow and

310
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:44,220
you want to double down on your winners

311
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:45,839
a lot of times you get by the time you

312
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:48,060
get into years six and eight you have

313
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:50,339
very few winners left you're pouring all

314
00:10:50,339 --> 00:10:51,899
of your Capital into helping those ones

315
00:10:51,899 --> 00:10:52,620
grow

316
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:55,079
and then by year 10 if you do it right

317
00:10:55,079 --> 00:10:58,079
you have at least one second IPO or get

318
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:00,360
bought for a large acquisition

319
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,640
so the way this breaks down is you know

320
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,680
you have fixed companies that will fail

321
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,540
by fail I don't mean go to zero I mean

322
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:09,120
you get your money back but if I told

323
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,680
you you could lend me money for 10 years

324
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,240
and I paid it back to you with zero

325
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,680
percent interest you would not be very

326
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,120
happy with me

327
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,459
then you have three companies where

328
00:11:17,459 --> 00:11:19,140
maybe you'll do as well as the market

329
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:22,260
right you'll grow a bit you'll sell them

330
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:24,300
you know it won't be a catastrophe but

331
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:26,279
it causes you a lot of pain and a lot of

332
00:11:26,279 --> 00:11:27,899
stress and a lot of work when you could

333
00:11:27,899 --> 00:11:29,640
have just bought some bonds or bought

334
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,320
some stocks 10 years ago and not looked

335
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,160
at it

336
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,260
and then you have one that's going to go

337
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:36,060
really well and we'll return the whole

338
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:39,060
fund so that's when it works crazy as it

339
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:41,180
is

340
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:43,800
okay so what are my five reasons that OT

341
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:46,320
security investors don't invest in a

342
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,220
startup

343
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:49,680
one back to the main point the idea

344
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,320
isn't big enough it's got to be big

345
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,500
two the product doesn't scale quickly

346
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,899
three there are no Milestones or product

347
00:11:57,899 --> 00:12:00,180
mode road map or Venture capitalists to

348
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:01,920
follow so that we know the staged

349
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,720
Investments

350
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:06,540
four no traction with customers or team

351
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:08,579
credibility now this one's really hard

352
00:12:08,579 --> 00:12:10,260
because a lot of early stage companies

353
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:12,060
of course aren't going to have you know

354
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:14,880
a long roster of customers but there are

355
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:15,959
ways you can mitigate this and we'll

356
00:12:15,959 --> 00:12:17,940
talk about that in a second

357
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:21,420
and five low gross margins

358
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:22,980
so how do you actually go big this is

359
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:24,360
where we get into some of the tips and

360
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,660
tricks

361
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:29,100
you know it's not easy going after the

362
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:31,079
Big Ideas because it's kind of obvious

363
00:12:31,079 --> 00:12:33,480
what the big ones are and the incumbents

364
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,579
are going after them as well so my

365
00:12:35,579 --> 00:12:36,720
advice to you is a little bit of a

366
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,880
paradox start small and start with

367
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,279
things that don't scale

368
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:42,839
I always think of this image behind me

369
00:12:42,839 --> 00:12:46,139
this seal on an ice flow Circle by orcas

370
00:12:46,139 --> 00:12:48,600
and other big threats those are the

371
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,980
incumbents right those are the monsters

372
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:51,240
in the market going after the

373
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:54,120
opportunity that is really obvious what

374
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,040
you have to do as a startup is you're

375
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:58,500
the seal you're trying to find a nice

376
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,720
little ice flow you know it might be

377
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,940
melting you might outgrow it pretty

378
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:05,399
quickly but you find a little space and

379
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:07,440
then you hop to the next Ice Flow

380
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,240
you eat a little bit more and that ice

381
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,620
flow kind of melts and then you hop to

382
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:12,120
the next one you start out with

383
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,740
something that doesn't scale

384
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:18,060
service maybe or uh you know some sort

385
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:20,700
of Niche offering and then you make that

386
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,860
into a product that you can repeat and

387
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:23,940
then once you have a product that's

388
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:25,740
repeatable you figure out how to Market

389
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:28,019
it and how your messaging resonates and

390
00:13:28,019 --> 00:13:31,200
you can you know really pour fuel on the

391
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,600
fire and grow very quickly

392
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:37,459
pretty soon you end up as the Orca

393
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:40,800
now this is very specific to OT security

394
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:41,700
um

395
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:44,579
you know I said you should start with a

396
00:13:44,579 --> 00:13:46,260
a product that doesn't scale but my

397
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:48,300
number two point was we don't invest in

398
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:50,700
products that don't scale so how am I

399
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:52,440
supposed to resolve that for you

400
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:55,079
well startups are really tough so I

401
00:13:55,079 --> 00:13:56,639
don't have all the answers

402
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:59,339
but here's what I'll tell you

403
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:01,380
the software the margins on software are

404
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:02,579
really great

405
00:14:02,579 --> 00:14:05,160
the repeatability and control you get

406
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,839
from deploying Hardware is really great

407
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:08,639
and then the customer service you can

408
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,620
provide and the solution you can offer

409
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:14,220
with Services is really great so in pure

410
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:16,079
software businesses in the b2c market

411
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:19,860
like an Uber or an Airbnb it's great to

412
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:22,079
be all software and you can do what Reid

413
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:24,779
Hoffman founder of LinkedIn calls Blitz

414
00:14:24,779 --> 00:14:26,880
scaling that doesn't really work as well

415
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:30,600
in B2B so you got to be thinking like a

416
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,339
strategist and Military in the military

417
00:14:32,339 --> 00:14:34,680
and you got to go with combined arms you

418
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,240
want a little bit of software because

419
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,920
you want scalability and you want your

420
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,480
margins to be good you want a little bit

421
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:41,639
of hardware and a little bit of services

422
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:42,959
and anybody who's ever played a

423
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:44,399
real-time strategy game will understand

424
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:45,360
this

425
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,220
you know the spearmen can beat the

426
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,139
Cavalry the Cavalry can beat the archers

427
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:51,120
and The Archers can beat the spearmen so

428
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,220
the best is to go with all three of them

429
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:55,260
in your army together

430
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:57,000
now my fourth point was about

431
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,560
credibility and if you're early stage

432
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,480
you don't have any customers it's really

433
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,880
tricky to show an investor you know that

434
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,620
you're growing and you're credible

435
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:06,060
but there are a few ways you can do it

436
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:08,160
and it's a little trait but nothing

437
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,440
succeeds like success so surround

438
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:12,360
yourself with successful people surround

439
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,620
yourself more importantly with people

440
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:15,600
who want to see you win

441
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,760
early stage that may not be customers it

442
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,100
might look like advisors it might be

443
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:22,880
your co-founders it might be employees

444
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,380
eventually it'll probably be investors

445
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:27,600
you know investors do look at other

446
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,920
investors and see whether they're

447
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,300
credible in the space whether they've

448
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:32,940
had good investments in the past and

449
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:34,740
then ultimately it is going to be your

450
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:35,940
customers

451
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:38,160
but not all customers are created equal

452
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,959
you know the customers that are more

453
00:15:39,959 --> 00:15:41,399
transactional are not going to do as

454
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:43,860
much for you are as the ones who are

455
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:45,839
helping you be a design partner figure

456
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:48,899
out the features understand your Market

457
00:15:48,899 --> 00:15:50,940
so those are kind of my tips in general

458
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:53,040
and now I'm going to give a little bit

459
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,540
of advice to each of the specific

460
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:56,180
audiences here

461
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:58,920
for customers

462
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,899
you want to go really big and that means

463
00:16:00,899 --> 00:16:03,120
you have to share your big problems with

464
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,100
the startups you just share little

465
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:06,660
problems that they can kind of pick at

466
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:07,980
at the edges

467
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:09,480
it's not going to be worth your time

468
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,100
you're really busy you're trying to

469
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,899
defend your networks and it's not going

470
00:16:12,899 --> 00:16:14,040
to be worth their time they're not going

471
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:14,880
to end up with something that's

472
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,920
investable

473
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,720
it's also important that you share your

474
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,279
big problems with startups because

475
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:22,440
you'll get more access you'll be allowed

476
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,540
to give input into the features you'll

477
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:26,339
be a design partner you'll get the

478
00:16:26,339 --> 00:16:28,320
solution that you want instead of just

479
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,699
getting something thrown over the fence

480
00:16:29,699 --> 00:16:32,940
to you and saying well buy it or don't

481
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:35,100
and then lastly this is a big problem

482
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,779
for a lot of corporates and in large

483
00:16:36,779 --> 00:16:38,459
industry they want to make sure the

484
00:16:38,459 --> 00:16:39,959
startup is going to be around for a long

485
00:16:39,959 --> 00:16:41,699
time they want longevity so they don't

486
00:16:41,699 --> 00:16:43,860
want to partner with a startup only to

487
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:45,720
have it you know go under in a couple

488
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:46,920
years

489
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:48,360
there are a couple things you can do one

490
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,620
you can make sure that they have good

491
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:52,079
financing a lot of Runway to survive

492
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:53,820
but more importantly you can talk about

493
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:55,259
it and this is one thing I think

494
00:16:55,259 --> 00:16:56,940
customers can do a lot more of you can

495
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:58,980
do use cases you can talk to your peers

496
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:01,920
about it if you love a startup and you

497
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,959
talk about it other companies are going

498
00:17:03,959 --> 00:17:05,280
to start being customers and then you

499
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,359
know that company is going to be around

500
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:09,198
for the Long Haul

501
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:11,640
as an employee you want to go big

502
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,199
because you want to be on a rocket ship

503
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:15,240
right that's the dream you get options

504
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,760
there's company IPOs you make a lot of

505
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:18,900
money too

506
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:20,339
but that means you got to think kind of

507
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:21,540
like a venture capitalist when you're

508
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,459
thinking about your career you should be

509
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:25,500
asking questions about whether this

510
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,419
company can really scale

511
00:17:27,419 --> 00:17:28,799
and then once you know whether this

512
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:30,120
company can scale

513
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,320
you've got to see whether it's the right

514
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:33,419
fit for you are you bringing something

515
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:34,980
to this team and are you getting

516
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:37,440
compensated in a way that lines up with

517
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,660
their roadmap and their Milestones so

518
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:41,460
that you can help move the needle on

519
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,679
hitting a milestone and then you're

520
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,240
getting compensated in terms of equity

521
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:48,240
or options or moving the needle

522
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,460
and then finally you don't want to be

523
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:52,740
the 10th marketing person at a startup

524
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:54,299
that doesn't have any software Engineers

525
00:17:54,299 --> 00:17:56,340
you want to be a differentiated person

526
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:59,460
who can really add value to that

527
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:01,260
startup's roadmap this is slightly

528
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:02,940
different than being compensated for it

529
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:05,340
you want to make sure that your ability

530
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:09,000
to help Drive scale is unique to you

531
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,220
and then lastly for the founders in the

532
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:12,780
room

533
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:15,299
so The credibility question we talked

534
00:18:15,299 --> 00:18:17,700
about a little bit you know it is about

535
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:19,140
surrounding yourself with really great

536
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:20,460
people and people who want to see you

537
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:22,740
win but it's also about listening to

538
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:24,480
them so

539
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,460
we think the founders are really

540
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:29,280
credible when they take that advice they

541
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,320
internalize it into their product so

542
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,400
it's not just about throwing up

543
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,320
somebody's headshot on your website it's

544
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,240
about listening to them as a customer as

545
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,620
a person with a lot of experience in

546
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:40,200
this space and then having that

547
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,360
knowledge and that experience speak

548
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:45,020
through your product

549
00:18:45,419 --> 00:18:47,580
the one point I didn't get to in the

550
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:50,280
five reasons that a VC won't invest in

551
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52,620
an OT security startup is gross margins

552
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:54,480
and that's really tough nobody's going

553
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,500
to help you out with that right

554
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:56,880
customers are not going to ask you to

555
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,080
raise prices so this is the

556
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,000
responsibility of the founder and the

557
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,880
only reason that you can credibly go to

558
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,620
a customer and say I should be charging

559
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:06,360
you more is if you're providing even

560
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:08,280
more value you have to be a product

561
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,320
Visionary you have to set the bar very

562
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,419
high for the value that you provide to

563
00:19:12,419 --> 00:19:14,460
your customers and believe me they have

564
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:15,539
plenty of money they're not going to

565
00:19:15,539 --> 00:19:17,400
complain about it if they get a lot of

566
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,679
value out of the product

567
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:21,539
and then finally this brings me to my

568
00:19:21,539 --> 00:19:24,059
last point with with the founders is

569
00:19:24,059 --> 00:19:26,880
product Market fit product Market fit is

570
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,440
not some Metric we're looking at in

571
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:31,080
terms of average recurring revenue or

572
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,580
making it into some Gartner magic

573
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:34,559
quadrant what we mean by product Market

574
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:36,660
fit is if we're hearing that the

575
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:38,700
customers are pulling this product from

576
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:40,740
you so again this goes back to being a

577
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:42,419
product Visionary it goes back to

578
00:19:42,419 --> 00:19:43,860
listening to your customers to your

579
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:45,600
advisor and to all the credible people

580
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,918
that you've surrounded yourself with

581
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:51,900
that's all the tips and tricks I have if

582
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:52,919
you don't remember anything else

583
00:19:52,919 --> 00:19:56,039

00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,580
here to take any questions

598
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:32,340
thanks for your time and and uh

599
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:35,178
please ask away

600
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:40,140
[Applause]

601
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:42,020
hey Rob that was great thank you for

602
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:43,860
demystifying some of the aspects around

603
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:46,140
investment and in very clear tangible

604
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:48,120
examples so you talked about going big

605
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:51,419
and you alluded to it can you say more

606
00:20:51,419 --> 00:20:53,580
about how what are the questions that

607
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:55,440
people should ask themselves to figure

608
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,960
out if it's big enough how do they push

609
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:00,900
themselves out and where do you find

610
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:02,400
that balance between

611
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,160
big crazy it just might work impossible

612
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,539
yeah

613
00:21:06,539 --> 00:21:08,460
it's a good question in there

614
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:09,900
there's some heuristics but there's

615
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:12,600
probably no firm rule around that

616
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:15,900
um roughly speaking for a company to be

617
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:19,260
a viable uh IPO Mr public offering where

618
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:20,700
they sell stock to the General stock

619
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:23,160
market it needs to have a market cap of

620
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:27,000
one billion dollars so depending on

621
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,260
you know

622
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:30,539
the way evaluations are calculated a

623
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:32,880
rough rule of thumb is that you want 10

624
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:36,840
times your annual recurring Revenue to

625
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,280
be a billion dollar company so you

626
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,840
should be doing 100 million in sales

627
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,059
after 10 years

628
00:21:42,059 --> 00:21:43,440
so if you think you can get to 100

629
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,419
million sales

630
00:21:45,419 --> 00:21:46,740
um you know then it's definitely a big

631
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:50,100
enough idea if you don't see a way that

632
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:52,080
it's even possible to get there I would

633
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,820
say go bigger if you're coming up with

634
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:55,980
some crazy number where you know you

635
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:57,299
back into

636
00:21:57,299 --> 00:21:59,220
uh I don't know the cyber security

637
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:01,100
market for

638
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:04,200
anyone who has a personal computer and

639
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,640
you say you know they're this many

640
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,200
billion personal computers out there in

641
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,640
the world and I'm going to sell my

642
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,679
software to you know one percent of that

643
00:22:10,679 --> 00:22:12,679
probably not very realistic and I would

644
00:22:12,679 --> 00:22:15,059
re-evaluate how you're coming to that

645
00:22:15,059 --> 00:22:17,880
market size the rough rule of thumb is a

646
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:20,960
billion give or take

647
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:24,960
with SAS coming in to our space I was

648
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:27,179
just curious about you know looking at

649
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:29,520
scale-ups and kind of the core you know

650
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:32,580
the service software you know balance

651
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:34,679
and you know any other specific um

652
00:22:34,679 --> 00:22:36,960
expectations around margin there

653
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,760
yeah thank you that's a good question

654
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:41,400
some of these uh companies on the slide

655
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,980
are more SAS based almost all of them

656
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:46,080
have an on-prem solution because our

657
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,940
investors are utilities so they care a

658
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:50,940
lot about having that as an option

659
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:51,600
um

660
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:55,500
but you know the SAS margins are good uh

661
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,120
certainly seen a lot of success in the

662
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,820
general cyber security investing Market

663
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:02,100
um I think it's

664
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:04,679
you know it's an and in the OT space you

665
00:23:04,679 --> 00:23:07,679
have to have SAS and something on-prem

666
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:08,520
um

667
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:10,559
for investor perspective

668
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:12,120
you know it's it's a really good sign

669
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:14,340
because we can predictably tell what

670
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:16,620
your revenue is going to be the

671
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:18,000
recurring revenue is really what we're

672
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,500
interested in seeing as opposed to

673
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,600
one-off Services deals

674
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,600
if you can transition those services or

675
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,340
pair your services with a SAS solution

676
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:29,340
and help move them into the product and

677
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:31,380
kind of take the services you're

678
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:33,919
offering and build them in as a feature

679
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:36,059
you know that's a really positive sign

680
00:23:36,059 --> 00:23:37,260
and I think

681
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:38,280
I think that a lot of venture

682
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:39,659
capitalists look for as an inflection

683
00:23:39,659 --> 00:23:43,080
point in a company that maybe had a roll

684
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:46,020
up or came from a Services background

685
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:48,600
um but you know could potentially be a

686
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:51,500
great outcome in the future

687
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:56,340
hi thank you I wanted to ask like uh in

688
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:57,960
the path and up to the point up to this

689
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:00,419
point like you said in OT that has to be

690
00:24:00,419 --> 00:24:03,539
this on-prem version of the solution but

691
00:24:03,539 --> 00:24:06,419
going forward it looks like that will no

692
00:24:06,419 --> 00:24:08,940
longer be a regulation or a requirement

693
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:11,640
so how do you kind of see this changing

694
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:15,659
once OT doesn't have that uh limitation

695
00:24:15,659 --> 00:24:16,620
anymore

696
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:18,179
yeah

697
00:24:18,179 --> 00:24:20,400
you know in some ways I agree with you

698
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,440
that you know the air gap is dead and

699
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:24,240
and we're seeing more and more cloud in

700
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:27,360
the OT space it's still single digit

701
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,740
penetration at this point so I think

702
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:31,799
there's a long time until you know maybe

703
00:24:31,799 --> 00:24:34,380
never will you see uh you know

704
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:36,360
everything in the cloud in complete

705
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:38,400
removal of on-prem that said it's

706
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,080
growing and it's growing fast even if

707
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,640
it's off a small base

708
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:45,000
so how would you consider things like uh

709
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,039
artificial intelligence

710
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:48,440
um figuring into

711
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:51,120
production and things like that and the

712
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,400
need to actually be able to to connect

713
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:56,100
the edge to the cloud to do the type of

714
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:58,260
Big Data calculations that that requires

715
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:00,299
yeah yeah I think that's that's a really

716
00:25:00,299 --> 00:25:01,320
good point there's a lot of security

717
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:06,120
opportunity in rolling up that data uh

718
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:08,220
in the OT environments and then Edge

719
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:10,740
security because all the compute and a

720
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:11,820
lot of the models are going to be done

721
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:13,140
in the cloud

722
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:15,000
with AI it's always tricky it depends

723
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,520
what people mean by AI we certainly see

724
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,020
a lot of machine learning Predictive

725
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:21,120
Analytics

726
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,760
you know forecasting of what you're

727
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:26,039
going to need in terms of load or demand

728
00:25:26,039 --> 00:25:28,440
response all of that AI I think is in

729
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,720
the market today and we've invested in a

730
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,580
couple of those companies

731
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:34,080
um

732
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:36,659
it's hard not to be very commodified in

733
00:25:36,659 --> 00:25:39,419
AI unless you have a data set that is

734
00:25:39,419 --> 00:25:41,460
unique and proprietary that you can

735
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:43,380
train it on the models are at this point

736
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:45,360
at least mostly open source

737
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,159
you can come up with your own model that

738
00:25:47,159 --> 00:25:49,740
nobody else has that's you know Head and

739
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:51,059
Shoulders above everyone else I would

740
00:25:51,059 --> 00:25:53,400
say that would be a great breakthrough

741
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,000
um

742
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,419
but in general I think the AI use cases

743
00:25:57,419 --> 00:25:59,520
will be more case specific so we have a

744
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:02,000
company called Urban For example that

745
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,640
looks at uh underground gas lines and

746
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:08,220
helps you predict uh where you should do

747
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:09,600
maintenance first

748
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,100
that sort of stuff I think is really

749
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:12,900
useful the the

750
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:14,820
artificial general intelligence stuff I

751
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:16,440
think we're still a long ways out from

752
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:19,580
but I'm optimistic

753
00:26:20,039 --> 00:26:22,170
great thank you so much

754
00:26:22,170 --> 00:26:25,829
[Applause]
