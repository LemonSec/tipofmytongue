1
00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:03,179
foreign

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:08,880
so the word critical is both clear

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,740
and confusing

4
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:14,759
it is clear because we know it means the

5
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:16,199
most important

6
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:18,240
it is confusing because it gives us no

7
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,000
help whatsoever to figure out how to

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,340
figure out what's most important

9
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:24,840
what I want to talk to you about today

10
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:26,340
is share with you my journey and

11
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:28,800
experience wrestling with this word

12
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,679
and thinking about defending the

13
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:33,480
critical infrastructure of the city of

14
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,718
New York

15
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:40,020
so to go back to before the pandemic

16
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:42,960
when I first started at the city I was

17
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,660
the director of cyber risk and one of

18
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:47,160
the ideas we were trying to figure out

19
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:50,219
is how do you evaluate the loss of a

20
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:51,899
service what does it mean if a service

21
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:53,700
is gone

22
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:56,039
how do you measure that

23
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:57,780
and we really struggled with this idea

24
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:01,020
because New York is pretty resilient and

25
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:03,180
can come back from a lot

26
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:05,040
so to ask people to imagine that a

27
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,320
service isn't there that you

28
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,000
can't go to a school that you can't get

29
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,280
a permit that the traffic lights aren't

30
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,840
working really stretch people's

31
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,159
imagination and then the pandemic

32
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:15,060
happens

33
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:16,380
you didn't have to stretch people's

34
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:18,860
imaginations

35
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:21,240
something else happened too

36
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:24,720
and I think I hope maybe you had this

37
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,119
experience as well

38
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:31,020
which is at the end of the beginning of

39
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:33,000
the pandemic when we knew we were in a

40
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,140
pandemic

41
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:37,320
we started to realize that this affected

42
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,060
everyone

43
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:41,040
people started to think about groups of

44
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,840
people

45
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:46,020
for whom if they got sick it was going

46
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:48,840
to be a real problem doctors nurses

47
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:52,259
Pilots teachers we knew that if that

48
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:53,579
group everyone started to realize that

49
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:55,560
if that group gets sick we are in a

50
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,240
downward spiral in terms of our capacity

51
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,860
to respond to this

52
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:02,340
that group critical

53
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:04,799
we all understood that

54
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:06,360
we still didn't know exactly how we got

55
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,539
there

56
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:12,540
the other thing that happened is

57
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:14,819
everyone experienced the pandemic

58
00:02:14,819 --> 00:02:17,099
their experience of it was so local

59
00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:19,260
people got to know their Mayors and

60
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:21,599
their local public health that's how a

61
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,879
lot of people experience the response

62
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:27,060
was local there was a wide scale

63
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:28,200
incident

64
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,399
everyone experienced

65
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:33,780
I think many of you have probably seen

66
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:34,860
this before

67
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:37,200
how many of you have seen this before

68
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,599
okay let me some of you haven't this is

69
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:42,959
Abraham Maslow's hierarchy of needs and

70
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:44,700
I'll give you just a few seconds to take

71
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:45,599
it in

72
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:48,599
it's pretty intuitive Abraham Maslow is

73
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:51,720
an American psychologist uh educated in

74
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,580
New York City product of a number of the

75
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:54,900
institutions

76
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:57,780
he had a fairly simple idea

77
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:00,000
there are certain needs that humans need

78
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,360
to address before others that's it and

79
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:08,040
then he ranked this hierarchy of needs

80
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,379
and this I think again should make

81
00:03:10,379 --> 00:03:12,599
intuitive sense you need food and water

82
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:17,119
before you think about a job

83
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:20,700
pandemic tested a lot of this

84
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,379
now I'm presenting this to you not

85
00:03:22,379 --> 00:03:23,940
because we had this really clear idea

86
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:25,560
we're going to use Maslow's hierarchy of

87
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:28,019
needs and apply that across the city I'm

88
00:03:28,019 --> 00:03:29,580
giving it to you in Reverse at the end I

89
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:31,860
was like oh this is Maslow's hierarchy

90
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:34,280
of needs

91
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:36,959
and there's some debate about

92
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:39,420
this hierarchy by the way that it's

93
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:41,760
culturally specific that it only applies

94
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,739
in Western societies and you can see

95
00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:46,500
that there's a question there but what's

96
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,420
not a question is that there is a

97
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:49,860
hierarchy

98
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:52,560
we are sometimes afraid to say that is

99
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,459
more important than that

100
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,299
and some of that can be technical that

101
00:03:57,299 --> 00:03:59,040
depends on that

102
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,220
but otherwise you can't think about

103
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:03,239
that

104
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:06,860
other thing until you address this

105
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,400
so I want to tell you a quick story

106
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,080
about my first day at New York City

107
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,459
cyber command

108
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:12,900
um I was then like I am today under

109
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,700
prepared and overdressed

110
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:19,199
and I showed up and I was taking the

111
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:21,959
subway which you know you've been to New

112
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:23,220
York even once but even if you haven't

113
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:25,320
you know is the artery

114
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,300
so I was taking the subway I was

115
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,100
thinking about my first day

116
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,960
um I had already been to the government

117
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,540
office building so I had my expectations

118
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:34,880
managed about what I was walking into

119
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,020
but I was talking to someone on my first

120
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:37,860
day

121
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:41,100
and all these ideas were going around in

122
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:44,220
my mind and and this is a true story

123
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:46,259
um I'm mildly embarrassed but I have no

124
00:04:46,259 --> 00:04:48,300
shame so it does not matter and and so I

125
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:49,680
got there and I was like wow the subway

126
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,740
like how do we think about cyber defense

127
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:54,720
of the subway

128
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,780
the person said we don't I was like what

129
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:59,520
do you mean and they were like the

130
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,040
subway is governed by the MTA which is

131
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,780
part of the state

132
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:05,160
that's not something that we the city

133
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,900
necessarily have purview over and they

134
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,460
went about their day and I stood there

135
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:10,560
be like uh oh

136
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,600
what do you mean like how does that work

137
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:15,960
I'll come back to that later

138
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,699
so we start to think about back to the

139
00:05:17,699 --> 00:05:19,139
loss of services we started to think

140
00:05:19,139 --> 00:05:20,100
about

141
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,979
different lenses that we could use to

142
00:05:22,979 --> 00:05:25,580
prioritize

143
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:29,840
what would a New Yorker notice first

144
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,280
what would they make the biggest deal

145
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,638
out of

146
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:38,280
so if the power went out no immediately

147
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,860
right you know immediately

148
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:42,600
if you are on the subway or in an

149
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,940
elevator and that stopped working yes

150
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:46,560
you would notice immediately

151
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,539
and you wouldn't have many Alternatives

152
00:05:48,539 --> 00:05:51,180
we think about contingency

153
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:56,100
there's immediacy visibility contingency

154
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:58,080
and then

155
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,699
let's say the trash stopped getting

156
00:05:59,699 --> 00:06:01,139
picked up

157
00:06:01,139 --> 00:06:03,600
would you notice immediately

158
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,860
nope

159
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:08,520
and they'd do their best esny New York's

160
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,800
strongest

161
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,600
you might not notice immediately but

162
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,280
when you notice

163
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,740
it would have a huge impact

164
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:20,300
how do we trade off against these

165
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:23,160
this brought to a larger question whoops

166
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,380
uh how does the city plan for outages

167
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:27,660
now I'm not going to spend too much time

168
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:29,280
talking about that here because that's a

169
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,780
whole separate talk that someone else

170
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:32,460
can and should give around Disaster

171
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:35,220
Response Emergency Management within the

172
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:36,000
city

173
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,460
the key point is that they had planned

174
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:40,500
to a certain extent for the idea of

175
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,259
responding to an outage

176
00:06:43,259 --> 00:06:45,479
that response mechanism was there but

177
00:06:45,479 --> 00:06:48,240
again the prioritization up front

178
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,639
there wasn't Clarity there surely wasn't

179
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:54,600
consensus and I tried to push and say

180
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,340
okay well this one is more important and

181
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:58,620
there was a rough tearing when it came

182
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:00,479
down to it we really needed to know so

183
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:02,280
now I want to talk to you about what are

184
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,380
the challenges that I faced in trying to

185
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:05,580
do this

186
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:09,120
uh and I'm talking now to people who are

187
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,220
maybe going to try and do this

188
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:13,440
or want to try and do this

189
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:18,060
or have tried and can maybe are stuck on

190
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:19,319
one of these

191
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:21,539
so the first was again just the the

192
00:07:21,539 --> 00:07:23,639
foremost there's a consensus around the

193
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:26,340
criticality but no agreement on the

194
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:29,819
definition when I asked and I did many

195
00:07:29,819 --> 00:07:31,919
people as I could

196
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:33,300
in the city

197
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:35,220
you know DHS has these 16 critical

198
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:37,020
infrastructure sectors how do those map

199
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:40,380
to the city where do those line up

200
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:41,699
what

201
00:07:41,699 --> 00:07:44,400
I I don't we think about it this way

202
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,099
that's interesting that that's there no

203
00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:49,740
one was dismissive of it per se

204
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:51,599
that's interesting that that's there but

205
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:54,800
this is how we think about it

206
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,000
so then I started to look at others

207
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,460
Canada Australia for other ideas and

208
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:01,020
there isn't even consensus there now I'm

209
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:02,580
not proposing that there be something

210
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:04,440
Universal but there needs to be

211
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:07,919
something Central if not similar

212
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:10,319
and I started to scratch on this a

213
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:13,080
little bit that cities share a lot more

214
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:16,139
in many ways than countries

215
00:08:16,139 --> 00:08:17,880
the other key component is that services

216
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:21,120
are not delivered through sectors

217
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,160
that will either be patently obvious to

218
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:26,180
you or brand new

219
00:08:26,699 --> 00:08:29,520
and it was both to me

220
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,319
working in the city and when I would

221
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:33,479
talk to my colleagues at agencies and

222
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:35,219
they would think about what they did as

223
00:08:35,219 --> 00:08:37,200
part of their agency Mission and the

224
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,120
service that they provided that's how

225
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,059
they and when I worked there we thought

226
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:44,899
about what we do

227
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,640
but if you ask someone

228
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,080
in the city of New York what's your

229
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,899
experience with the chemical sector

230
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:54,480
right it doesn't really line up and even

231
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,339
the water sector they might know the

232
00:08:56,339 --> 00:08:58,920
agency they wouldn't know much more than

233
00:08:58,920 --> 00:08:59,820
that

234
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:02,279
I'll give you one example and and I the

235
00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:03,540
example I'm going to give you all of

236
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:05,220
this comes from collective learning from

237
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:07,140
talking to other people so colleagues

238
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:09,720
who work in cyber defense in healthcare

239
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:12,420
and Hospital Systems particularly

240
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:14,640
I I asked as many people as I could

241
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,959
across the different sectors that were

242
00:09:15,959 --> 00:09:17,880
represented in the city which sectors

243
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,320
line up with you and who do you depend

244
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,899
on those kinds of questions

245
00:09:21,899 --> 00:09:23,339
but okay so tell me about Healthcare and

246
00:09:23,339 --> 00:09:25,320
Public Health well the first thing you

247
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,940
need to know that it's not just

248
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:28,440
Healthcare and Public Health in a

249
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,519
hospital

250
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:31,560
a hospital includes and now going to 16

251
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,660
critical infrastructure sectors

252
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:35,940
Healthcare and Public Health

253
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:37,860
transportation

254
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:39,360
nuclear

255
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,740
chemical

256
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:42,480
commercial facilities

257
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,000
five sectors at least are subsumed in

258
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,100
that one

259
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:48,480
you can say okay well I see there's

260
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,279
complexity and across those but it's not

261
00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:53,399
the right lens it was unhelpful

262
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:54,779
the kind of work that we were trying to

263
00:09:54,779 --> 00:09:55,800
do

264
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,019
which involve prioritization and also

265
00:09:58,019 --> 00:09:59,399
and you know this and appreciate this

266
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:01,320
communication I need to influence other

267
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,540
groups to focus on that so if I said

268
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:05,220
okay there's 16 sectors and these are

269
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:06,779
the five and now I'm talking numerators

270
00:10:06,779 --> 00:10:08,459
and denominators what's 5 16 I don't

271
00:10:08,459 --> 00:10:10,920
know like not not helpful not helpful

272
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:13,260
for for our purpose

273
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:14,880
then we had to come to an agreement

274
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,800
about

275
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,420
what was relatively important that

276
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:20,160
required some assumptions

277
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,839
and I'll talk about how we tested some

278
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:23,160
of those assumptions through scenarios

279
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,899
and incidents

280
00:10:24,899 --> 00:10:27,000
did use Sis's

281
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,800
National critical functions how many of

282
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,140
you have seen the set National critical

283
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:33,360
functions a few nerds probably raised

284
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,880
their hand hello hello fellow nerds

285
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,500
55.

286
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,540
you thought 16 was Lot 15 is a lot but

287
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:41,339
there is an overarching logic there's

288
00:10:41,339 --> 00:10:43,320
four big areas they line up under

289
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,300
connect distribute manage and Supply

290
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:48,000
they're things like manage Wastewater

291
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,279
Supply electricity connect electricity

292
00:10:50,279 --> 00:10:53,160
provide law enforcement protect

293
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,899
sensitive information so it's much more

294
00:10:54,899 --> 00:10:56,579
about the how it's getting closer to

295
00:10:56,579 --> 00:11:00,140
services but it's not quite there

296
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:04,320
and this and I'll talk a little bit more

297
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,120
about this later the the sector-based

298
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,079
approach

299
00:11:07,079 --> 00:11:10,740
really sets up blind spots

300
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:13,860
around interdependencies cascading

301
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:16,019
failure and other ideas it's not that

302
00:11:16,019 --> 00:11:17,519
people don't think about them it just

303
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:20,339
doesn't naturally happen

304
00:11:20,339 --> 00:11:21,839
so these are the challenges we had

305
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:24,060
coming in

306
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:26,519
what I proffer to you is that services

307
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:29,519
in this lens are a more effective way to

308
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:32,279
think about prioritization

309
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:34,260
the other challenge that I found

310
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:37,860
was that sectors vary widely

311
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:40,680
on maturity the type of OT that they use

312
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:42,959
the regulatory pressures that are there

313
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:45,420
the size the big players the number of

314
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:48,740
players the supply chain

315
00:11:48,839 --> 00:11:50,220
but when we start to think about it

316
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:52,680
through services

317
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,839
they were more comparative they weren't

318
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:58,260
the same it didn't normalize everything

319
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:00,480
but it did give us something that was

320
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,060
comparative because of services Drew

321
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:05,899
from different sectors

322
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:07,260
so

323
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:11,220
that started to started to enable us to

324
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:13,560
more effectively allocate resources

325
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,420
and talk about it in a clear consistent

326
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:16,500
way

327
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:19,860
I say started because still started

328
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:22,800
one of the things we needed to do was

329
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,540
Define

330
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:26,700
to test some of our assumptions and

331
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:29,399
understanding of what's critical is

332
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:31,380
do our own version of what does it look

333
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:35,720
like when it's under duress under attack

334
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:38,399
and so we did some scenarios

335
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:41,420
where we looked at

336
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:43,500
incidents focused on critical

337
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,600
infrastructure and we had a grid it's a

338
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,820
two by two you can picture in your head

339
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:49,440
single vector

340
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,480
multi-vector

341
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:54,899
single sector multi-sector how many went

342
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:57,180
through each of those

343
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:59,959
so single Vector say yes cyber

344
00:12:59,959 --> 00:13:02,339
multi-vector cyber and climate event

345
00:13:02,339 --> 00:13:04,500
cyber and terrorism

346
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:08,100
uh we had ercot and Texas and Colonial

347
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:10,019
pipeline those two things happened they

348
00:13:10,019 --> 00:13:11,220
didn't happen at the same time doesn't

349
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:12,660
require stretch and Imagination to

350
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:15,120
imagine them lining up

351
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,220
and then we looked at single sector

352
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:19,740
one of the things that became clear is

353
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:22,079
that wonderfully people are focused on

354
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:24,600
their institution their entity and then

355
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,459
the benchmarks the other entities around

356
00:13:26,459 --> 00:13:27,480
it

357
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:30,180
and the sector writ large

358
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:32,820
so I can only speak in my experience

359
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:34,320
what it was in New York but those

360
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,700
sectors were pretty robust they were

361
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:36,959
lined up next to each other they're in

362
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:38,040
the same room they have those great

363
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,839
relationships but as soon as it flipped

364
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:42,420
over to another sector we don't talk to

365
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:44,399
them I don't know who to talk to

366
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:46,320
why would we

367
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,000
you know the answer

368
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,440
because you share the same operational

369
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,200
attack folks like if there's a problem

370
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,000
and it happens there you're going to be

371
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,139
in the same boat and we're not going to

372
00:13:55,139 --> 00:13:57,899
know until we're all experiencing it

373
00:13:57,899 --> 00:13:59,459
this is the thing that kept me up at

374
00:13:59,459 --> 00:14:00,779
night it's also the thing that got me up

375
00:14:00,779 --> 00:14:01,980
in the morning but New York is a city

376
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:05,000
that never sleeps so it's fine

377
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:07,260
and we so we've set that threshold of

378
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:08,639
okay it occurs simultaneously in

379
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,959
multiple sectors you know we did this

380
00:14:09,959 --> 00:14:11,639
sort of incident and we saw where there

381
00:14:11,639 --> 00:14:12,839
were gaps and it was really that

382
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:17,000
multi-sector that we wanted to focus on

383
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:19,260
so

384
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:21,600
just laying out I'll call it a framework

385
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,060
but it's really a an overlay of thinking

386
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:25,019
about

387
00:14:25,019 --> 00:14:27,839
these four categories of Services Public

388
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:29,940
Safety and Emergency Services Public

389
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:33,420
Health and Welfare Community Services

390
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:35,940
Financial stability and economic health

391
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:37,440
now if you're familiar with the

392
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,540
conventional definition the DHS

393
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:41,100
definition at least of critical

394
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,959
infrastructure this sounds really

395
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:45,779
similar and in some ways it is but

396
00:14:45,779 --> 00:14:47,940
there's a city lens on here

397
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:51,000
that I want to unpack with you

398
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,620
so we took all this agencies all the

399
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:57,720
city services and we looked at how the

400
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:00,120
city thinks about them and we map those

401
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:02,699
to the critical infrastructure sectors

402
00:15:02,699 --> 00:15:04,980
and the national critical functions and

403
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:06,540
came up with

404
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:09,300
this lens of Service delivery and we're

405
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:11,699
going to look at this and go yeah

406
00:15:11,699 --> 00:15:13,620
and I hope that's the case you look at

407
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:14,940
this and recognize that it doesn't look

408
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:17,360
strange

409
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,940
so first category Life Safety

410
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:22,019
unequivocally There's issues of life and

411
00:15:22,019 --> 00:15:22,920
death

412
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,899
and back to Maslow's hierarchy of needs

413
00:15:24,899 --> 00:15:26,339
that's going to be our first and

414
00:15:26,339 --> 00:15:27,540
foremost

415
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:29,579
and it's it's not just because you need

416
00:15:29,579 --> 00:15:31,500
to address that first it's because

417
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,839
that's what people think about first

418
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:35,459
if you try and put something ahead of

419
00:15:35,459 --> 00:15:37,320
that you'll run into this confusion I

420
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,880
ran into that a lot

421
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,699
if we didn't overtly say yes this is how

422
00:15:41,699 --> 00:15:43,500
we're dealing with public health or yes

423
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,339
this is how we're dealing with

424
00:15:44,339 --> 00:15:46,920
sanitation someone say but what about

425
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,899
so there's a real need to prioritize

426
00:15:48,899 --> 00:15:50,399
that in our communication so Emergency

427
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:52,680
Management law enforcement those ones

428
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,620
you know are clear Public Health

429
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:58,199
sanitation Water and Wastewater I know

430
00:15:58,199 --> 00:16:00,839
you know these from the work that you do

431
00:16:00,839 --> 00:16:02,940
but the services that are being provided

432
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:05,699
and how agencies line up

433
00:16:05,699 --> 00:16:07,260
I believe

434
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:10,620
that if you started to if one started to

435
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:13,019
use this lens and talk to someone who

436
00:16:13,019 --> 00:16:14,760
worked in a municipality they'd

437
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:17,519
recognize yes I know the agency does

438
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:18,600
that

439
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:21,000
I know where that fits for us

440
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,680
the second category is a really

441
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,839
interesting one it's very broad now

442
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:27,240
there are going to be some issues of

443
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:29,579
life and death in this category

444
00:16:29,579 --> 00:16:32,459
but in all of these this is something

445
00:16:32,459 --> 00:16:35,699
where a city is the provider there is no

446
00:16:35,699 --> 00:16:37,079
alternative

447
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:38,759
there's no alternative to the Department

448
00:16:38,759 --> 00:16:40,139
of homeless services to the fire

449
00:16:40,139 --> 00:16:40,980
department

450
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:43,560
this annotation

451
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:44,759
there's no one else who's going to do

452
00:16:44,759 --> 00:16:45,779
that

453
00:16:45,779 --> 00:16:47,220
anyone who has that charge that mission

454
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:50,699
that responsibility that duty of care

455
00:16:50,699 --> 00:16:52,139
and that's something that a long time

456
00:16:52,139 --> 00:16:54,480
colleague of mine really introduced he

457
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,259
said

458
00:16:55,259 --> 00:16:57,000
you know I think and he had been with

459
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,620
City for a long time he said you know

460
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:00,240
when you're we think about in the city

461
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:03,300
you're under the care of the city

462
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:05,699
stewards of that that's where the second

463
00:17:05,699 --> 00:17:09,480
category comes in education elections

464
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,980
yes Healthcare

465
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:16,099
shelters Corrections and Technology

466
00:17:16,439 --> 00:17:18,359
and shelters get to issues around Public

467
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:20,760
Health Corrections gets to issue of Life

468
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,260
Safety

469
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:24,059
but these are things that you know are

470
00:17:24,059 --> 00:17:25,319
harder to put a frame around and then

471
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:28,140
the last is boring and yet so important

472
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:30,120
processing and management tax collection

473
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:32,940
fees payments payroll permits there's

474
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:35,100
two reasons that's really important one

475
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:37,260
the money collector from that funds all

476
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:39,419
the other stuff

477
00:17:39,419 --> 00:17:41,880
and two pays the people that do all that

478
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:44,299
other stuff

479
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:48,900
payroll processing crucial

480
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,340
crucial

481
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:51,900
think back to the hierarchy of needs

482
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:52,679
right

483
00:17:52,679 --> 00:17:56,179
like how am I going to get paid

484
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:00,000
so the other part is let me go back to

485
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,100
this for a second these are all things

486
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:04,440
that a city of New York but a city

487
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,480
municipality provides

488
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,140
public sector

489
00:18:09,299 --> 00:18:11,460
it rests crucially

490
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:14,100
on other sectors that are

491
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:16,980
almost entirely private sector

492
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:19,799
telecommunications data electric and

493
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:22,799
power cargo when I talked to the folks

494
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:24,240
that work on those services and I said

495
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,220
what do you most need what are you most

496
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:27,720
going to need in a time of cyber crisis

497
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,220
or what do you want to make sure is

498
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:30,600
going to be steady and stable they

499
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,700
pointed to these great we have agreement

500
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:34,799
on those now what

501
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:36,720
we need those for our critical services

502
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,220
but they're not in our purview of

503
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:39,360
control this is where the partnership

504
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,880
aspect came in

505
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,559
but really identifying those

506
00:18:43,559 --> 00:18:46,860
dependencies and calling that out

507
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:49,320
to me there is no

508
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:51,059
way to defend critical infrastructure

509
00:18:51,059 --> 00:18:53,960
but collectively

510
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:57,240
I don't know how else to think about it

511
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,919
the other thing that came up for me and

512
00:18:58,919 --> 00:19:00,960
this is a brief aside but I want to put

513
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,240
it in here is

514
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,740
you know the frame lots of times as

515
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:07,799
utilities so water and electricity but

516
00:19:07,799 --> 00:19:11,179
the more I started to talk to people

517
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,059
the more I realize that data is also a

518
00:19:15,059 --> 00:19:17,340
utility

519
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:19,320
has the same issues around jurisdiction

520
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,299
around generation distribution

521
00:19:21,299 --> 00:19:23,640
transmission

522
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,380
doesn't really matter how it's used in

523
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:27,720
one sense in one sense it does matter we

524
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,280
think a lot about how the data is used

525
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,780
but in the other it's just about getting

526
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:33,419
the data there Cloud providers that kind

527
00:19:33,419 --> 00:19:35,580
of framing came in there

528
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:37,080
the other thing that came up to me here

529
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:39,059
was concentration risk I would talk to

530
00:19:39,059 --> 00:19:40,860
each of the sectors and some of the

531
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:43,320
different organizations and say who do

532
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:46,280
you most depend on

533
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,240
and everybody

534
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,220
named you know this one provider that I

535
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:52,620
was like right okay besides that I said

536
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:54,299
oh for our backup or whatever yeah we

537
00:19:54,299 --> 00:19:57,900
depend here I talk to them

538
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:00,360
and what I realized is that a lot of

539
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:02,820
those organizations were dependent

540
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:05,100
on this one party

541
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:07,320
that no one was really paying attention

542
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:09,960
there's a concentration risk

543
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,880
what Dale was talking about earlier it

544
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:12,840
was known

545
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,039
it was there

546
00:20:14,039 --> 00:20:15,900
people knew it you just need to draw the

547
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:18,720
pathway to it so this lens of services

548
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,640
and then sectors so I'm not saying a

549
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,900
shoe sectors it's just putting that

550
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:24,600
service lens first is really helpful

551
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,640
okay so I want to share some resources

552
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,960
here that were really helpful for me

553
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,460
that I hope are helpful for you

554
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:30,660
especially if you're trying to undertake

555
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:33,900
this journey in 2015 and 2016 MIT did a

556
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,100
series of workshops where they looked

557
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:37,559
specifically about sector dependency

558
00:20:37,559 --> 00:20:39,000
and to no one's surprised they found

559
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,160
electricity at the core of it okay they

560
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:43,020
also found some other key dependencies

561
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:44,580
and how do we build those in so I

562
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:45,780
encourage you to look at the results of

563
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:46,500
that

564
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:49,200
another is an exercise from West Point

565
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,919
the Army called Jack voltaic those was

566
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:55,080
specifically focused on multi-sector

567
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:56,820
incidents and

568
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:59,039
municipalities now you might think oh

569
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:00,240
isn't that what you were looking for

570
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,039
yeah we built a lot of work on top of

571
00:21:02,039 --> 00:21:04,559
that we also needed to customize it and

572
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:07,440
adjust but it was really great to have

573
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,360
that lens and build on top of that and

574
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,280
it's continued

575
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,260
uh the national critical functions I

576
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:15,240
talked about where they could be complex

577
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,160
or a little bit challenging but they are

578
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:19,740
also really close lens to how we are

579
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:21,240
providing what we're providing that's

580
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:24,120
critical and I I took those and sort of

581
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,679
mapped and lined them up and made my own

582
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:27,059
version of them and shared that back

583
00:21:27,059 --> 00:21:28,799
with the folks at sisa and they were

584
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:30,240
very open to that great it's great for

585
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,600
us to see how people are using this set

586
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,000
and the last is the analysis and

587
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,159
resiliency center now they're focused

588
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:40,320
primarily on the financial sector

589
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,179
but they think a lot about systemic risk

590
00:21:42,179 --> 00:21:44,820
this was a hard thing not just to think

591
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:46,740
about but to communicate about remember

592
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:48,120
those cascading failures and

593
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:49,559
interdependency

594
00:21:49,559 --> 00:21:51,480
it can get kind of overwhelming think

595
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:53,220
back to Maslow's hierarchy of needs if

596
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:54,720
you say yeah what if this hits this it's

597
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:55,860
that people go no I'm just thinking

598
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:57,480
about this first I need to think about

599
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,580
this first

600
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:02,220
and so it helped put that scale in there

601
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:06,059
a few limitations caveat mtor here

602
00:22:06,059 --> 00:22:07,220
um

603
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:09,360
Metropolitan right not all cities and

604
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,100
counties I think people say state and

605
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:12,720
local travel territories sltt it's all

606
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,179
encompassing no it's not uh the density

607
00:22:15,179 --> 00:22:16,980
in population not just of New York but

608
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:18,720
of those metropolitan areas some of

609
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,580
these challenges around distribution of

610
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:22,020
services and application of those

611
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:24,480
Services really does vary widely we will

612
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,580
make different decisions on shelters and

613
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:28,380
education other things based on density

614
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:29,880
and population so that's a very

615
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:32,460
important factor governance I talked

616
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:34,679
about the subway so transportation in

617
00:22:34,679 --> 00:22:35,760
the city of New York there's the

618
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,080
Department of Transportation the Port

619
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:39,299
Authority of New York and New Jersey and

620
00:22:39,299 --> 00:22:40,620
the State Department of Transportation

621
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:43,140
and the MTA

622
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:45,000
if you ever fly into New York those

623
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,500
three airports that's controlled by the

624
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:47,580
Port Authority of New York and New

625
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:48,900
Jersey the Port Authority of New York

626
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:51,299
and New Jersey is co-governed by the

627
00:22:51,299 --> 00:22:52,500
state of New York and the state of New

628
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:53,340
Jersey

629
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:55,820
what

630
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:57,120
so if we have a challenge in

631
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,380
transportation

632
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:00,900
how do we do this there is no answer but

633
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:03,720
together collectively

634
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:04,919
um I will underline again the point

635
00:23:04,919 --> 00:23:06,480
about tax Taxation and Revenue

636
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,840
generation uh because you know different

637
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,640
cities set this up in different ways

638
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,260
there's different taxation but that was

639
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:15,120
a really important factor when we talked

640
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,740
about prioritization and then I will

641
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:19,080
just underline again this is just me

642
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,700
my experience

643
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:22,320
just the city of New York and it is

644
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,960
unique but it is not peerless

645
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,340
so back to this

646
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:28,679
I encourage you to think differently

647
00:23:28,679 --> 00:23:30,659
I invite you to think differently about

648
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:32,940
scale and scope severity of that impact

649
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:35,039
the number of people how long it will

650
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:38,159
last when they will notice

651
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:40,380
not to lose the human side and the last

652
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:42,600
is some of the applications here I

653
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,039
talked a little bit about the

654
00:23:44,039 --> 00:23:46,440
prioritization but what it allowed us to

655
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:49,080
do is more effectively allocate those

656
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:51,780
resources to think about Mutual Aid and

657
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:53,340
assistance in a time of cyber crisis

658
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:54,960
where would we get that support from who

659
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,820
would provide it who should we all go to

660
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:59,299
First

661
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:01,140
and did the resourcing line up there

662
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:04,380
answer no didn't and hasn't and then

663
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:07,980
most important in my mind

664
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:10,440
is as a communication tool

665
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:12,480
so I invite you to challenge this to

666
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:16,860
test it to try it talk to me about it

667
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:19,140
but I think we all can agree that one of

668
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:20,880
the biggest challenges

669
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:23,880
in security operational technology ICS

670
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:26,220
is around communication

671
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:27,960
coming back to this word and the power

672
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,640
of that one word

673
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:32,100
I hope you have a bit better

674
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:34,200
understanding of what that word means

675
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:38,120
how to think about it thank you

676
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:45,240
I have some time for questions

677
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:46,679
yes

678
00:24:46,679 --> 00:24:48,840
go ahead yeah thanks very much for the

679
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:51,840
presentation I I did have a question so

680
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:55,380
given your adventure of dealing with a

681
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:58,260
lot of different stakeholders

682
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:01,020
um do you have any like Pro tips to

683
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:03,659
share in terms of

684
00:25:03,659 --> 00:25:06,179
trying to bring people to like a common

685
00:25:06,179 --> 00:25:08,640
understanding just even even the

686
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,880
language right yeah so interested in you

687
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:14,039
sharing about that yeah a few things the

688
00:25:14,039 --> 00:25:15,480
first is

689
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:17,039
um I started with the least mature

690
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:18,720
sectors I didn't go to the most mature

691
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,880
sectors those mature sectors are used to

692
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,140
people coming to them and saying hey how

693
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:23,760
can you help what do you think

694
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,320
I started with the least mature sectors

695
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:28,200
that's number one number two I asked

696
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:31,320
everybody who do you most depend on

697
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:33,179
who do you need to be strong for you to

698
00:25:33,179 --> 00:25:35,520
be strong that did two things one it

699
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,740
started to give me a short list of that

700
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:39,840
central element

701
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:42,360
and two it started to get them to think

702
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:43,919
about dependencies third parties other

703
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:46,260
things like that other questions I asked

704
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:47,100
them

705
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:48,720
um and I was with the government at the

706
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,460
time so I said

707
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:55,440
what are you not getting that you need

708
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,120
because I assume that if someone needs

709
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,039
something they're getting it what are

710
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:01,140
you not getting that you need

711
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:02,700
from us

712
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:04,020
there are two questions in there what

713
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:06,299
are you not getting that you need okay

714
00:26:06,299 --> 00:26:08,220
and then from us

715
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:09,299
and then there was just general

716
00:26:09,299 --> 00:26:12,299
consensus like do you have a clear way

717
00:26:12,299 --> 00:26:14,159
in your sector of you to wait the way

718
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:16,380
you define criticality no would you be

719
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:18,360
open to that what is needed where is the

720
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:20,100
you know how do you influence that

721
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:21,960
thinking all of that I hope that answers

722
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:24,179
your question a bit

723
00:26:24,179 --> 00:26:25,200
um I got another question in the app

724
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,520
that I'll answer real quick has this

725
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:29,159
been tested or tabletop no and I would

726
00:26:29,159 --> 00:26:29,940
love it

727
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:32,760
I would love it uh we got to the point

728
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:33,840
where if you're familiar with the

729
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,279
tri-sector it's three sectors that have

730
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:36,539
come together

731
00:26:36,539 --> 00:26:38,279
um we said here try your operational

732
00:26:38,279 --> 00:26:39,779
exercise and incident response under

733
00:26:39,779 --> 00:26:41,159
under this

734
00:26:41,159 --> 00:26:44,640
let's let's see if this lens works

735
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,200
because you said you're working across

736
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:49,380
sector so let's try it through this lens

737
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:51,000
other questions

738
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,120
you just shout them out yeah

739
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:56,279
uh Finance electricity

740
00:26:56,279 --> 00:26:59,000
Telecommunications

741
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:01,140
just gonna say I I love this

742
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:03,779
presentation and I think it's one of the

743
00:27:03,779 --> 00:27:05,760
the very valuable ones that I wish that

744
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,380
this I know that the room was packed

745
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:09,779
that I mean even more so with people I

746
00:27:09,779 --> 00:27:11,159
think what you're really talking about

747
00:27:11,159 --> 00:27:12,779
and it's more of a comment than a

748
00:27:12,779 --> 00:27:15,620
question but I will ask

749
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:19,580
a preview in a second

750
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:25,320
science I I do believe that we we've

751
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:27,779
we've aired in some ways and that yes

752
00:27:27,779 --> 00:27:29,220
there needed to be an intense

753
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:31,500
concentration on Cyber because we're so

754
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:34,080
weak on capability but at the same time

755
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,120
we've lost some of the basics that

756
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:38,940
emergency managers

757
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:42,900
no no to be true 100 when I'm looking at

758
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:45,179
your presentation I'm like man this also

759
00:27:45,179 --> 00:27:47,279
directly drives with continuity of

760
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:49,919
government Mission essential functions

761
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:52,500
versus business essential functions like

762
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:55,500
payroll delegations of authority who

763
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:57,900
actually has the power during an event

764
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:00,779
to make decisions if other people become

765
00:28:00,779 --> 00:28:03,360
ill or otherwise income hesitated to

766
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:06,120
make the decision this all just ties in

767
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,919
so well and I just want to thank you

768
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:09,299
because I think that you're one of the

769
00:28:09,299 --> 00:28:11,880
few thought leaders that is making these

770
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,620
connections between cyber and Emergency

771
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:16,140
Management and quite frankly it just

772
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:19,500
makes so much sense I I just I think

773
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:21,120
it's part of an Awakening so thank you

774
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,400
thank you Megan I appreciate that

775
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,559
um I will say I've built on some of the

776
00:28:25,559 --> 00:28:27,900
work that that Megan's done so the the

777
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:31,140
feeling is mutual and it really is

778
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:33,000
um why are we rebuilding a thing that

779
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,820
already exists right the that capacity

780
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:38,700
that capability even the language

781
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:40,440
um it we shouldn't have to duplicate

782
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:42,480
that yeah question

783
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:43,980
one of the constraints I didn't see on

784
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:45,419
the slide but I'm sure is in your mind

785
00:28:45,419 --> 00:28:46,919
and everyone's mind is resources right

786
00:28:46,919 --> 00:28:49,740
it's not infinite right yeah so did you

787
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:51,720
ever have to tackle with how you uh

788
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:53,400
allocate resources so not only are the

789
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,440
most critical underlying things uh you

790
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,820
know more resilient but also you don't

791
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:58,740
lose the things that they are underlying

792
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:00,659
for right yeah if you you know secure

793
00:29:00,659 --> 00:29:02,640
all the Power Systems but no hospitals

794
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,080
can work then what does it matter that

795
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,220
you've got the power so how have you

796
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:06,179
have you had to deal with that challenge

797
00:29:06,179 --> 00:29:08,279
and if so have you do you have a way of

798
00:29:08,279 --> 00:29:11,220
thinking about making sure you not only

799
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:11,880
um

800
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,740
strengthen the backbone but also the

801
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:15,299
things that require that backbone for

802
00:29:15,299 --> 00:29:17,400
operation yeah that's a good question it

803
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,840
ties to a bit what Megan was talking

804
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:21,299
about one of the reasons and it wasn't

805
00:29:21,299 --> 00:29:22,559
intentional but it worked out this way

806
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:24,179
and it was fantastic one of the reasons

807
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:25,559
we use critical infrastructure is

808
00:29:25,559 --> 00:29:26,880
because there wasn't a question about

809
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,919
we're going to defend that that needs to

810
00:29:28,919 --> 00:29:30,600
work

811
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,159
um so if we need to figure out how we're

812
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:33,179
gonna work with emerging Emergency

813
00:29:33,179 --> 00:29:34,620
Management we know we got to figure it

814
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:36,000
out for this to your question about

815
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,159
resourcing and resource independency we

816
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:39,480
got into it a bit when we looked at

817
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:41,279
Mutual Aid and assistance how are we

818
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:42,659
going to support because I asked people

819
00:29:42,659 --> 00:29:45,659
if you are having a bad day

820
00:29:45,659 --> 00:29:48,720
who are you willing to support

821
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:51,600
if you are having a bad day who are you

822
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:54,059
willing to support that helped get to

823
00:29:54,059 --> 00:29:57,360
that critical dependency and The crucial

824
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,620
paths there because yeah the

825
00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:00,120
Telecommunications folks were like we

826
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:02,100
need the roads to be cleared and yes of

827
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:04,020
course we need power we need water for

828
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:06,480
cooling hospitals are like we can't do

829
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,220
it without 48 Hours of fresh water and

830
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:09,899
you can't just have water lying around

831
00:30:09,899 --> 00:30:11,940
you have to truck it in right so these

832
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:13,440
all these interdependencies started to

833
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,940
to show up so I think it was really

834
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:16,380
highlighting those interdependencies

835
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:17,940
that was helpful that's all my time

836
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:20,159
thank you so much

837
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:23,159
foreign
