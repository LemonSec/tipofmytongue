1
00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:03,179
foreign

2
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:07,500
good afternoon ladies and gentlemen a

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:09,420
fabulous time here in Miami beautiful

4
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:11,760
weather we've had some wonderful talks

5
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:12,719
already

6
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:14,940
I'm here to talk about something that is

7
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:16,619
really near and dear to my heart and

8
00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:18,840
that's basically how do we help people

9
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:21,900
in the industry to understand cyber

10
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:24,359
security and safety analysis and what

11
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:26,279
I'm trying to do is bring It Forward

12
00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:28,380
Concepts from my previous experience

13
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:30,960
working as a control system designer at

14
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,180
Ontario power generation to get us all

15
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:35,100
off the hamster wheel of pain

16
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:37,739
and so why did I come up with this

17
00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:39,120
concept called the information harm

18
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,280
triangle right and what does it mean

19
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,100
well when I started at Sandia I became

20
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:46,680
very very interested in the use of

21
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:49,320
systems theoretic process analysis

22
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:51,539
and this is a systems engineering

23
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:53,640
approach and Hazards methodology that

24
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,440
was developed in response to the

25
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,840
Challenger accident and Dr Nancy

26
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,260
Levinson MIT and the key part of this is

27
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:03,120
essentially you have things that go

28
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,739
wrong within your system and this

29
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:06,720
results in an unsafe control action

30
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,119
those ucas are the things that we are

31
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:11,520
trying to prevent and why do we try to

32
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,439
prevent those unsafe control actions

33
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:15,600
well because if you have an unsafe

34
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,520
control action that's going to bring

35
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,040
about a hazard and a hazard will bring

36
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:22,619
about a loss and so a really simple

37
00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:24,659
example would be you know a traffic

38
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:27,180
light right traffic light one light's

39
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:29,100
green one light's red well the unsafe

40
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:31,439
control action would turn both lights to

41
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:34,380
green and that brings a hazard right A

42
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:36,420
Hazard that two drivers going the

43
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:38,520
opposite directions could actually cause

44
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,439
a vehicle accident that would lead to a

45
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:43,799
loss of vehicle damage injury or loss of

46
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:46,799
life and so stpa Maps unsafe control

47
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:48,960
actions to those consequences that we're

48
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,700
trying to avoid

49
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:53,159
the second part of it is in cyber

50
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:54,720
security we've already focused on

51
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,399
integrity and availability and

52
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:57,899
confidentiality and this actually came

53
00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:00,299
from basically JP Anderson's study

54
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:02,280
within the Air Force in the 1970s that

55
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,860
said how do we stop harm to our

56
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:05,939
information

57
00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:07,799
and that's sort of a real key part that

58
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:10,080
I sort of internalized and said why are

59
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,340
we so focused on integrity and

60
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:13,020
availability of the information in the

61
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:14,160
digital world

62
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,480
when we should be more worried about

63
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:18,360
what does the harm to the data provide

64
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,400
the adversary and so the information

65
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,260
harm triangle tries to bring in both

66
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:24,480
these Concepts so that you do protect

67
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,280
your integrity you do want your digital

68
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,379
information to be accurate complete you

69
00:02:28,379 --> 00:02:30,780
do protect the availability product but

70
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:32,520
you turn the challenge of this really

71
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,739
ambiguous way of adversaries attacking

72
00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:37,260
rot systems and you turn it into an

73
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:38,879
engineering challenge

74
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:42,720
and so how do we take this approach and

75
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,940
use it to understand how adversaries can

76
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:46,680
interact with the systems to bring about

77
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:49,560
those physical losses right in our

78
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:52,080
community we care about those things

79
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,900
that harm people persons the environment

80
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:57,480
society and property and so how do we

81
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,860
understand how the adversaries can

82
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:00,180
enable that

83
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,220
and reduce that

84
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:04,080
to basically build out protections and

85
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,360
defense and depth to limit their harm in

86
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,640
the digital space and limit the harm

87
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,379
within the physical world

88
00:03:10,379 --> 00:03:12,480
and so what is the information harm

89
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,620
triangle

90
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:15,180
well the information harm triangle

91
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:18,180
starts with data right so one of the

92
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:19,379
things that's really interesting is that

93
00:03:19,379 --> 00:03:21,480
you know as a control system designer

94
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,640
the control systems they don't act

95
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,260
directly with the digital world right

96
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:26,940
you have analog to digital converters

97
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:29,459
you have digital analog converters and

98
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:30,540
what they're really doing is they're

99
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:33,300
taking a snapshot and they're producing

100
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:35,280
a digital representation of what they

101
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,720
believe is occurring within those

102
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,580
physical process so it's no different

103
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:40,200
than if you were to take a photo of me

104
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,599
and then add a mustache right you're not

105
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:44,700
really impacting the physical world

106
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,860
and so this is really important to

107
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:48,780
understand that data can only be

108
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:51,480
interpreted by digital systems that's

109
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,400
the first practical postulate there's

110
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,659
four of them for the information harm

111
00:03:54,659 --> 00:03:57,180
triangle now postulate is not a truth

112
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:00,599
it's a practical assumption you take to

113
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:02,519
simplify the approach of the analysis

114
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:04,980
techniques the second one is that cyber

115
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:07,080
attacks can only affect

116
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,599
the data right cyber attacks can only

117
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:11,819
increase digital harm and this allows

118
00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:13,620
you to divide and conquer that engineer

119
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:16,079
analysis that'll show on the next slide

120
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,000
the third practical postulate is that

121
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,858
the physical consequences the one we

122
00:04:19,858 --> 00:04:21,180
care about because we want to protect

123
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:23,520
the environment safe our people and

124
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,540
property

125
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:26,040
those are the ones that are only

126
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,139
produced by physical harm right that's

127
00:04:28,139 --> 00:04:29,759
that physical information harm and the

128
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:32,040
final posture is that in order for an

129
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,199
adversary to result in physical harm

130
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:36,540
from a Cyber attack they need to have a

131
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:38,220
transform function and that's where the

132
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:40,800
unsafe control action comes in so as you

133
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,660
notice both data harm and physical

134
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:45,300
information harm they're orthogonal and

135
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,280
this really provides tremendous insights

136
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,720
for how you can build in defense and

137
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,060
depth and how you can accredit

138
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:53,580
tasks and activities for safety within

139
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:55,979
your security analysis and so how do we

140
00:04:55,979 --> 00:04:58,380
simplify this approach into an

141
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:00,660
engineered analysis so as I mentioned

142
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:03,660
you have that first postulate with data

143
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:05,759
can only be interpreted and used by

144
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:07,860
digital system we as humans can't use

145
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:10,440
data we don't understand it I can't tell

146
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,060
whether it's a one or a zero by touching

147
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:13,440
the line on the wire

148
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,180
and then the second posit comes in and

149
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:17,280
that's what you're seeing here is you

150
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,900
have a Cyber attack can only increase

151
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:21,360
data harm right and so this Cyber attack

152
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,520
it adds a plus to the data harm and

153
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,139
eventually the adversary is able to

154
00:05:25,139 --> 00:05:27,660
cause enough data harm to initiate that

155
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,880
unsafe control action and start that

156
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:32,820
Cascade from the unsafe control Hazard

157
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:35,280
to bring apart the hazard that brings

158
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,620
apart the physical loss that consequence

159
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:39,419
so it's no different than that traffic

160
00:05:39,419 --> 00:05:42,240
light example right you turn both lights

161
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,340
to Green eventually wait long enough

162
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:45,900
you're probably going to get a car

163
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:48,060
accident and you might get definitely

164
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:50,940
vehicle damage or injury or death

165
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:53,280
now how do we stop that well one of the

166
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,020
ways is you can look how do I limit the

167
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:57,060
data harm right these are your intrusion

168
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:58,919
detection Protection Systems your

169
00:05:58,919 --> 00:06:01,500
firewalls your antivirus these are the

170
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,600
things that interact directly with your

171
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,820
data right just like digital systems you

172
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:07,919
need digital systems to protect those

173
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:09,720
digital systems from data harm

174
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:12,120
but what we've found as well is that you

175
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,979
also have measures to reduce physical

176
00:06:13,979 --> 00:06:15,840
information harm and these are like

177
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,000
mechanical interlocks they're Governors

178
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,820
they're being gears right so as an

179
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:22,800
adversary if I'm doing a Cyber attack I

180
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,240
can't change the volume of my pressure

181
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,120
vessel I can't change the size of a pipe

182
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,639
or I can't affect a physical lock and so

183
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:31,440
by having these together we actually

184
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,900
take this from a really unambiguous

185
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:36,720
situation into an optimization problem

186
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,460
and a lot of my team have really

187
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:40,440
benefited from this concept when they

188
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,479
sit and they say as an engineer I'm

189
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:45,539
trying to limit the data harm and

190
00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:48,780
initiate a UCA that brings about large

191
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:50,759
amounts of physical information harm and

192
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:52,199
so we've done a lot of testing that I'll

193
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:55,560
describe in the future slides but first

194
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,880
i'm going to come up with a simple

195
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,860
example I'm a nuclear system designer

196
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:01,199
and so I'm going to talk about

197
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:03,660
a pressurized water reactor so this is a

198
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:06,000
simple light Water Reactor pressurized

199
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,819
water reactor and one of the Key Safety

200
00:07:08,819 --> 00:07:10,319
functions one of the primary safety

201
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:12,539
functions is removed Decay heat from the

202
00:07:12,539 --> 00:07:13,380
core

203
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:15,539
and so what you're seeing here there's

204
00:07:15,539 --> 00:07:19,740
three thermodynamic loops the red is the

205
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:21,780
primary Loot and this is the one that

206
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:24,720
transports the Decay heat that heat from

207
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,360
fission from the reactor vessel and

208
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,460
transfers it conducts it to the steam

209
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:31,800
generator which provides the heat source

210
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,080
for the secondary Loop which is in

211
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:34,979
purple

212
00:07:34,979 --> 00:07:37,860
right and so the purple then is high

213
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:39,840
quality steam that creates the energy

214
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,759
you need to drive the turbine the steam

215
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:44,400
turbine and then it basically vents out

216
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,620
that heat to the atmosphere through the

217
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:48,660
condenser and then finally you have that

218
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:51,419
tertiary Loop that provides for cooling

219
00:07:51,419 --> 00:07:53,639
water for the condenser so in this way

220
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:56,039
you have a transporting of heat through

221
00:07:56,039 --> 00:07:58,440
the three Loops from the reactor vesser

222
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,660
on the left to the condenser on the

223
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:01,919
right which is actually the ultimate

224
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:03,960
heat sink of the environment

225
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,240
so one of the Key Safety events that

226
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,460
could occur this is not from cyber is

227
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:10,560
something called a steam generator tube

228
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,360
rupture right right and this is where

229
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,400
you have a break in the steam generator

230
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,979
tubes that will result in the loss of

231
00:08:16,979 --> 00:08:18,800
primary coolant which is light water

232
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,259
from the red primary Loop right so this

233
00:08:22,259 --> 00:08:23,879
is going to cause all kinds of bad

234
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:25,979
things and so there's usually an

235
00:08:25,979 --> 00:08:29,639
automatic decision made by the main

236
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:32,099
steam isolation valve that's the MS IV

237
00:08:32,099 --> 00:08:35,039
and so the adversary is able to

238
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:37,200
notice that there's been a steam

239
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,419
generator tube rupture and they're able

240
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:41,219
to prevent the mainstream isolation

241
00:08:41,219 --> 00:08:43,740
valve from closing now what this means

242
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:46,920
is you have now condensate ingressing

243
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:49,560
into that secondary Loop and with that

244
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,779
contestant you have the potential for

245
00:08:51,779 --> 00:08:53,399
damage to Major equipment like the

246
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:55,200
turbine so so you definitely want to

247
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:59,820
prevent this so anyways the unsafe

248
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:02,399
control action would also result in

249
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:04,080
things that would become apparent to the

250
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,040
operator

251
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,779
and so the what you're going to see is

252
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:08,519
you've got this light water light water

253
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:11,220
is a wonderful Neutron absorber

254
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:12,660
and what's going to happen is when it's

255
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:14,459
ingressing into the secondary Loop

256
00:09:14,459 --> 00:09:16,140
you're going to get radiation Fields

257
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:18,240
outside of containment that's what that

258
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,620
signal is right there you've got these

259
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:21,660
radiation fields and that's a really bad

260
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:23,040
day so that's going to create a big

261
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,260
alarm right the operator is going to see

262
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:27,360
that alarm and they're going to go I

263
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,100
think I have a steam generator tube

264
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,260
rupture but this is such a significant

265
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:33,300
event there's also other things that

266
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:35,519
would alarm such as you're losing mass

267
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:37,260
you're losing mass you're losing that

268
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:39,720
water from the primary Loop so now your

269
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:42,240
flow is going to start to decrease and

270
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,920
you would start to have an alarm on a

271
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,019
flow mismatch right you're expecting x

272
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:47,459
amount of flow and you're getting less

273
00:09:47,459 --> 00:09:49,740
than x and so that's the second alarm

274
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:51,839
and then the third one because the

275
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:54,300
primary Loop is a closed system but that

276
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:55,980
rupture actually makes it now open

277
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:57,899
you're going to see a pressure decrease

278
00:09:57,899 --> 00:10:00,779
so now you have three alarms and so what

279
00:10:00,779 --> 00:10:03,120
this means is that if the mainstream

280
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,860
isolation valve fails and you see the

281
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:07,200
unsafe control action the operator is

282
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,060
going to intervene and how does that

283
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:11,100
look with the information harm Triangle

284
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:13,800
Well how that looks is we have

285
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:16,980
essentially the operator action is going

286
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:19,080
to see those three alarms right the

287
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:21,120
radiation in the outside of containment

288
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,339
they're going to see the steam generator

289
00:10:23,339 --> 00:10:25,500
flow rate mismatch and they're going to

290
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,600
see the pressurizer decrease

291
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,800
and they're going to they're going to

292
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,420
basically intervene they're going to say

293
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:32,279
oh I know what the problem is and I'm

294
00:10:32,279 --> 00:10:35,100
going to close that isolation valve and

295
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,560
protect the turbine and stop the egress

296
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:40,500
of that radiation into the secondary

297
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,399
side

298
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:43,620
what happens if the adversary says hey

299
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:46,200
I'm going to inhibit I'm going to hide

300
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,959
those alarms from the operator that

301
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:51,360
means we can't really accredit for the

302
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,120
operator to perform the action in order

303
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,100
to limit the physical harm at the

304
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:57,899
necessary physical information harm

305
00:10:57,899 --> 00:11:00,180
limit which is shown in the red dotted

306
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:01,440
line

307
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,079
but we have three alarms right and this

308
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:05,640
is sort of where we got into a lot of

309
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,079
our experimentation

310
00:11:07,079 --> 00:11:10,380
the operator is likely going to make the

311
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:12,240
same decision if they have two out of

312
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,100
three it's a simple voting system right

313
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:16,140
if if they see like the radiation alarm

314
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:18,480
or the pressurizer decrease they're

315
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,519
probably going to continue to say oh

316
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:22,860
this is a steam generator tube rupture

317
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:24,540
and make the right decision

318
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:27,060
what happens if they only have one of

319
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:29,880
the three right it's likely they'll

320
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,560
still be conservative and do the correct

321
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:34,320
action but it's not guaranteed and if

322
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,440
they spoof all three then that unsafe

323
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,600
control action of leaving the isolation

324
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,060
valve open will remain and so that's

325
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:43,320
sort of what you're seeing with these

326
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,579
three different information harm

327
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:47,519
triangles is that a is where you say you

328
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:49,320
spoof the radiation alarm

329
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,440
B is where you spoof the radiation alarm

330
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:55,260
plus the flow mismatch and then C is

331
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:58,019
where you inhibit the all three of those

332
00:11:58,019 --> 00:12:00,660
alarms and so right away we start to

333
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:03,660
realize that the operator has a cap of

334
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:06,480
how much data harm they can withstand

335
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,220
and still be able to meet the

336
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:09,779
requirements of protecting that physical

337
00:12:09,779 --> 00:12:11,160
information harm

338
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:14,399
and so this is why it's so critical when

339
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:17,700
we design our measures to say hey I can

340
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,920
lose one but I can't lose more than one

341
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,260
and so then how do I build and design my

342
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:23,940
systems especially with my intrusion

343
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:25,860
detection to say hey

344
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:28,019
adversary is able to inhibit one alarm

345
00:12:28,019 --> 00:12:30,899
now we need to put additional effort

346
00:12:30,899 --> 00:12:32,940
apply additional resources to really

347
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:34,560
know when the adversary is inhibiting

348
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,839
two or three and that's how you get to

349
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:39,180
lower the data harm limit to an amount

350
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:41,640
that only the information harm triangle

351
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:44,100
that represents scenario a which is that

352
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:46,139
single alarm inhibited is actually

353
00:12:46,139 --> 00:12:48,060
allowed so this is tremendously

354
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:50,579
important for how we do our defense and

355
00:12:50,579 --> 00:12:51,420
depth

356
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:53,880
and so how did we validate this well

357
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:56,399
we've been really lucky the reason why

358
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:57,959
we're really lucky is because at the

359
00:12:57,959 --> 00:13:01,019
international atomic energy agency we

360
00:13:01,019 --> 00:13:03,899
have the Shira pressurized water reactor

361
00:13:03,899 --> 00:13:05,040
and there's some in your room the room

362
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,540
right here that if we're really involved

363
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:08,339
in developing that pressurized water

364
00:13:08,339 --> 00:13:10,560
reactor in this example we call it the

365
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:13,560
Ashira pressurized water reactor has all

366
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,000
the components in that previous

367
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,579
conceptual example it's got the primary

368
00:13:17,579 --> 00:13:20,459
Loop has the pressurizer has the steam

369
00:13:20,459 --> 00:13:22,320
generator and then it has the turbine

370
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,120
and the condenser so we're able to

371
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:27,060
actually use real physics models right

372
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:30,540
and simulators and we plug those in to

373
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:32,100
something developed at Sandia what we

374
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,600
call the emulation platform we actually

375
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,100
have a name for it called arcade our

376
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,079
focus is on Advanced reactors and it's

377
00:13:37,079 --> 00:13:38,880
called Advanced reactors cyber assurance

378
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,459
and development environment and so right

379
00:13:41,459 --> 00:13:43,920
now it only works for the assure model

380
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,320
but the goal of our work with this

381
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,420
network emulation is to have true Plug

382
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:50,639
and Play functionality the people that

383
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:53,519
have Matlab and simulink type models can

384
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:55,440
provide them to us and we can plug them

385
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,959
into the network emulation and run these

386
00:13:57,959 --> 00:14:00,300
recursive and automatic tests that I'll

387
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:01,920
be describing in the next experiment

388
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,180
scenario

389
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:05,639
so what do we want to do with this

390
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:07,620
approach one of the things that's really

391
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:09,420
really important that we've really feel

392
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:12,120
strongly about is that a single UCA just

393
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,339
like in the previous example will not

394
00:14:14,339 --> 00:14:16,320
really bring about the large severe

395
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,060
consequences that we really need to be

396
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:20,579
focused on and so we're looking at how

397
00:14:20,579 --> 00:14:23,519
do we see combinations right of you see

398
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:25,620
on the reactor coolant pump and then we

399
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:27,480
sequence that and time it correctly with

400
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:30,240
the Reactor with the steam generator and

401
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,100
so one of the things we really found

402
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:34,620
with this experiment was that we wanted

403
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:36,120
to take the reactor coolant pump flow

404
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,040
down to zero and then second we wanted

405
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,720
to freeze the steam generator throttle

406
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,639
so that it would take the pressure down

407
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:43,860
to zero right and we were trying to say

408
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:45,480
you know are there sort of resonant

409
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,279
effects right is there sort of a

410
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:49,740
standoff timing where basically we

411
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:51,959
create unstable States within the

412
00:14:51,959 --> 00:14:54,240
overall nuclear power plant that result

413
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,160
in more significant impacts than we'd

414
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,740
expect and sure enough we did we created

415
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:00,959
open source automatic tools what's

416
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:04,019
called manipio manipulate process I IO

417
00:15:04,019 --> 00:15:06,839
and we were able to essentially automate

418
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:08,519
these tests and just stand off the

419
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:11,040
timing between those ucas so in this

420
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,500
example that uca1 which is that reactor

421
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,600
coolant pump we basically set the set

422
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,180
point and we skip the flow to end

423
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:21,420
we started that at 500 seconds

424
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:24,060
and it took 1300 seconds to take it down

425
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:26,820
to zero right pretty bad day you're not

426
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:28,440
so good you're losing that primary

427
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,420
coolant that's actually you're no longer

428
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:32,459
transferring heat from the core to those

429
00:15:32,459 --> 00:15:34,320
steam generators right but then we

430
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,940
looked at the steam generator and we

431
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:38,760
said hey what happens if we have a UCA

432
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,740
on the steam generator to take the

433
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:43,800
pressure to zero and this is the maximum

434
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:47,820
harm example at 1400 seconds that's 900

435
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:49,620
seconds after the first UCA on that

436
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:51,120
reactor coolant pump

437
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,000
we actually initiate the second one

438
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,440
and one of the things that's really

439
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,360
really important is that the second

440
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,420
steam generator UCA results in Rapid

441
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:02,459
depressurization and you'll see this in

442
00:16:02,459 --> 00:16:03,779
the information harm triangle on the

443
00:16:03,779 --> 00:16:05,699
next slide but the one thing that we

444
00:16:05,699 --> 00:16:08,279
didn't expect is the dnbr ratio and

445
00:16:08,279 --> 00:16:09,480
people that aren't nuclear Engineers

446
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,220
won't understand what that is so I'll

447
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:15,060
explain it dnbr is the departure from

448
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:17,940
the nuclear boiling ratio okay so what

449
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:19,260
this is it's just like when you jump in

450
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:21,480
a pool right you jump in a pool and it's

451
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,160
all water and it really cools you down a

452
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:25,380
lot faster than the atmosphere well the

453
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:28,560
dnbr basically represents when a steam

454
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,019
jacket forms across the fuel and

455
00:16:31,019 --> 00:16:32,880
prevents the liquid water from coming

456
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,519
into contact so you're no longer able to

457
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:38,160
conduct heat and transfer it from the

458
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:41,279
fuel rods to that now when the dnbr is

459
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:43,139
flat like you're seeing before those two

460
00:16:43,139 --> 00:16:45,360
ucrs that's that's there's no rate of

461
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,000
change you do not have that steam jacket

462
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,100
forming you do not have the fuel being

463
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:52,560
insulated by those steam jackets but

464
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,480
when the dnbr the departure nuclear

465
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,180
boiling ratio starts to increase its

466
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:59,399
rate that is when you see that steam

467
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:01,860
jacket forming and that's when the fuel

468
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:03,899
starts to heat up and and the most

469
00:17:03,899 --> 00:17:06,179
severe constant sequences and nuclear

470
00:17:06,179 --> 00:17:07,859
power plants today is when you have fuel

471
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:09,599
melt so if you're not able to

472
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:12,179
re-establish that cooling the fuel will

473
00:17:12,179 --> 00:17:13,679
continue to heat up and you'll get fuel

474
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:15,660
melt which is a really really bad day

475
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:17,640
and so how does the information harm

476
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,439
triangle look at this

477
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:22,199
well we have uca1 that's that reactor

478
00:17:22,199 --> 00:17:24,540
coolant pump right the data harm is the

479
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:26,699
same because it's a set point attack so

480
00:17:26,699 --> 00:17:28,439
the data the data harms the same between

481
00:17:28,439 --> 00:17:31,020
the ucas we did the same thing but the

482
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:32,400
rate of harm for the reactor coolant

483
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:36,360
pump it took 1300 seconds 1300 seconds

484
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:38,520
to set it to zero

485
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:42,299
with the steam generator took 400. so

486
00:17:42,299 --> 00:17:44,039
there's the rapid depressurization so

487
00:17:44,039 --> 00:17:46,440
the rate of physical harm from uca2 is

488
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,640
much higher

489
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,380
so what do you think we would want to

490
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:51,120
really protect against you see A1 or you

491
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:54,000
say two well our way of looking at this

492
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,460
is uca2 the steam generator the one that

493
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:58,860
brings rapid change through the unsafe

494
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:01,140
control action to hazards to loss would

495
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:02,700
be what you would prioritize your

496
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:04,620
resource to protect against

497
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:06,900
and so it's no different than the

498
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:08,520
traffic light example I talked about at

499
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,200
the beginning right I talked about a

500
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,720
traffic light example we have the two

501
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,000
both ways showing green if you're up

502
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,980
north in the Arctic in Canada or Finland

503
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:19,559
right there's no cars there you could

504
00:18:19,559 --> 00:18:21,360
leave that both green lights on all the

505
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,760
time but if you're in downtown Miami it

506
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,440
won't take long for that Hazard to bring

507
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,299
about the loss and that's what we're

508
00:18:27,299 --> 00:18:29,039
seeing between the reactor coolant pump

509
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:31,860
and the steam generator in this example

510
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:34,500
now the question we have because of this

511
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,600
sort of resonance type effect where the

512
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:39,059
sum is not equal to the parse so uca1

513
00:18:39,059 --> 00:18:43,740
and uca2 separated by 1300 seconds is

514
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:45,900
literally going to bring about more harm

515
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:47,760
and that's shown in the departure of

516
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,100
nuclear boiling ratio so how do we bring

517
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:52,320
those into summing up

518
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,000
right summing up these information harm

519
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,640
triangles so we can get a composite UCA

520
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:59,580
one and two what does that mean

521
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:01,440
and so what is our future efforts for

522
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,260
rigor we want to look at how do we

523
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:05,940
investigate data units and physical

524
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:07,799
information harm so the reactor coolant

525
00:19:07,799 --> 00:19:10,260
pump we had kilograms per second

526
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:12,539
for the for the steam generators we had

527
00:19:12,539 --> 00:19:15,059
pressurizers right so we had a pascals

528
00:19:15,059 --> 00:19:17,640
those things don't relate correctly but

529
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,200
there is one concept there's one

530
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,480
property that is in both data and

531
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:23,640
control systems that's entropy so we're

532
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,860
doing a really large effort to discover

533
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:28,559
what are the linkages between entropy

534
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:30,179
between data and physical information

535
00:19:30,179 --> 00:19:32,039
harm that could apply and normalize

536
00:19:32,039 --> 00:19:33,419
these approaches

537
00:19:33,419 --> 00:19:35,280
we also looked at cumulative harm and

538
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,260
rates of harm so our initial research as

539
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:39,360
shown in the last one with the reactor

540
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,740
coolant pump and the steam generator

541
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:43,320
does point to that this is rates of harm

542
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:45,360
which actually was a really interesting

543
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,700
finding because I based this concept off

544
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:50,100
of an engineering concept called the

545
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:52,020
power triangle which is Watts which is

546
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:54,260
joules per second so it seems sort of

547
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:56,760
coincidental at least initially that

548
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,799
it's a rate based calculation

549
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:00,720
we also looked at the effects of timing

550
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,240
and sequencing so how do resonance come

551
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:06,179
into this how do the sum of uca1 and

552
00:20:06,179 --> 00:20:08,280
uca2 get represented

553
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:10,440
and then finally we really want to

554
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:13,260
basically apply formal methods and rigor

555
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:15,299
we want to adapt this into control

556
00:20:15,299 --> 00:20:17,760
theory so that first year second year

557
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,260
engineering students can learn how to do

558
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:20,700
these combined Safety and Security

559
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:22,020
analysis

560
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:24,900
and so finally you know this is a new

561
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:27,299
Pro approach for defense and depth right

562
00:20:27,299 --> 00:20:29,760
right away in the first example we were

563
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:30,900
like you can lose one of the three

564
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:32,820
alarms so if you've got to protect your

565
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:34,679
data harm you've got to be able to

566
00:20:34,679 --> 00:20:36,480
detect when you're losing one alarm and

567
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:39,299
then prevent any further data harm and

568
00:20:39,299 --> 00:20:41,580
the RCP and steam generators it shows

569
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:43,620
you what to prioritize those ucas that

570
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:46,799
bring across quick changes between uca's

571
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:48,539
Hazard and losses

572
00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:50,400
we also want to combine Safety and

573
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,260
Security analysis we don't actually

574
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:54,840
provide the sdp analysis we go out to

575
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:56,520
Advanced reactors at Sandia and they

576
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,380
provide us with their STP analysis and

577
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:00,780
then we adopt this concept we adapt it

578
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:02,700
for their needs

579
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:05,400
we also built out Advanced modeling and

580
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,799
simulation tools that's Ashira is from

581
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:09,360
the Ia but we want to build the network

582
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,220
emulation platform and we want to have

583
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:13,380
it plug and play so if we can have more

584
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:15,780
models make it more versatile and

585
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:17,880
interoperable that benefits our

586
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:20,100
community writ large and then finally

587
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:22,380
the biggest thing I always had is when

588
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:23,880
is that the Ia there was a conference

589
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,380
and somebody stood up and said you have

590
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:28,380
10 cyber Security Experts do the same

591
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:29,820
risk assessment and you'll get 10

592
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:32,460
different results and so my huge goal

593
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:33,840
with the information harm triangle is

594
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,520
that we could get a third or fourth year

595
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,799
engineering student to have the same

596
00:21:37,799 --> 00:21:40,679
information harm triangles that a 20 or

597
00:21:40,679 --> 00:21:42,360
30 year professional to bring that

598
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:44,280
repeatable and consistent anal

599
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:46,559
analytical approach that can give us

600
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:49,260
sort of the single source of Truth for

601
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:50,340
our community

602
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:52,020
and get us off that hamster wheel of

603
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:53,880
pain so thank you again for your

604
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:56,039
attention and I'm here for questions so

605
00:21:56,039 --> 00:21:57,960
please if you do ask a question come to

606
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:00,430
the microphone thank you very much

607
00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:04,140
[Applause]

608
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:05,400
just curious if any of this is written

609
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,900
up in a white paper or anything at this

610
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:09,240
point uh if I want to dig into it a

611
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:11,400
little more deeply yeah so so this is

612
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,960
based on a journal article it actually

613
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,179
includes the the pressurized water

614
00:22:15,179 --> 00:22:17,880
Reactor with the conceptual but this

615
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,679
year we'll actually undertaken a huge

616
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:21,539
effort at San Diego to provide more

617
00:22:21,539 --> 00:22:23,520
mathematical rigor with real

618
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,020
experimental data so we'll be having

619
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:27,360
those likely you know probably June July

620
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,460
of this year thanks for your

621
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:30,900
presentation

622
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:32,640
um I've got a question regarding the

623
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:35,400
delineation to safety so what parts of

624
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:38,340
the ucas are already covered by safety

625
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:40,080
what you can what can you draw from

626
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,419
safety and what is beyond that and the

627
00:22:42,419 --> 00:22:43,440
security

628
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:46,020
yeah so so for instance like a new scale

629
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:48,000
is an advanced reactor they're licensed

630
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,640
by the NRC they have a full STP analysis

631
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,799
on safety so they're always looking at

632
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:54,720
what are the control actions that would

633
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,880
lead to what they call licensing basis

634
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:59,159
events right so licensee-based events

635
00:22:59,159 --> 00:23:01,620
are those events and and sequences

636
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:03,720
within the failure modes and effects

637
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:06,659
that lead to essentially loss of any one

638
00:23:06,659 --> 00:23:08,700
of your three safety functions and so

639
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:10,020
the example I had was the steam

640
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:12,659
generator tube rupture that would be one

641
00:23:12,659 --> 00:23:14,580
of the ways that the STP would be used

642
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:16,080
along with what they call probabilistic

643
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,940
risk assessment to take it from the

644
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:19,799
steam generator tube rupture to those

645
00:23:19,799 --> 00:23:22,200
events that are meant to be totally

646
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,679
unacceptable by regulation

647
00:23:24,679 --> 00:23:27,980
okay thanks

648
00:23:28,919 --> 00:23:30,419
yeah it's clear clearly you've done a

649
00:23:30,419 --> 00:23:31,799
lot of thinking about this and how it

650
00:23:31,799 --> 00:23:33,059
applies to nuclear I'm wondering if

651
00:23:33,059 --> 00:23:34,200
there are anything is there anything

652
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,520
anything that's unique about the nuclear

653
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,960
sector and the way that you guys

654
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,059
approach safety security and Engineering

655
00:23:39,059 --> 00:23:41,220
that would make it a challenge to adapt

656
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:42,960
in other sectors

657
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:46,860
so this is completely agnostic of the OT

658
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:49,740
domain other than you have to have an

659
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:52,559
STP analysis right so you can do STP

660
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:54,120
analysis I've seen them on electric cars

661
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:56,220
vehicles I did that for my thesis

662
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:57,720
actually was one on the battery control

663
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:00,419
system there's also ones within like

664
00:24:00,419 --> 00:24:02,580
hydroelectric so anything that you can

665
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:04,260
perform an stpa analysis even the

666
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:06,480
Challenger disaster you can apply this

667
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,299
approach right we only focus on nuclear

668
00:24:09,299 --> 00:24:11,100
power because we're able to validate

669
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:13,140
right with the Shira it's a pressurized

670
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:14,940
water reactor so we're able to validate

671
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:17,000
our assumptions using experimental

672
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,559
approaches so it gives us a lot more

673
00:24:19,559 --> 00:24:22,200
rigor in the research rather than just

674
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,960
sort of provide conceptual examples

675
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,520
well that's it for the questions thank

676
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:28,380
you very much it was a pleasure to be

677
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:30,860
here with you
