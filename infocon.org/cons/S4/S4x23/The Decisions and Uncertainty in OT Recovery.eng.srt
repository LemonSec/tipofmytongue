[Music]

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,660
hi Pete this is the Kimberly Clark help

4
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:13,920
desk

5
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:16,800
we have a machine down event

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,440
are you able to join the team's call and

7
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:23,100
verify the severity of the incident

8
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,500
now I can imagine that some of you have

9
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,660
been in that situation before where

10
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:30,720
you're called on to recover some sort of

11
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,520
system

12
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,260
um for me

13
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:36,480
that occurs monthly

14
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,260
we have

15
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:42,719
over a thousand process lines that were

16
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:44,760
responsible for supporting in our in our

17
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:46,800
facilities and

18
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,379
any technology can fail

19
00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:52,320
so what could play out

20
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,719
over the next hours of that telephone

21
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:55,920
call

22
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,140
could be hours could be days could be

23
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:01,800
longer depends on the severity of the

24
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:04,199
failure so the question

25
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:07,380
that I ask is are you confident or

26
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:09,600
uncomfortable in your ability to recover

27
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,659
from whatever may come so a little bit

28
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:15,420
about Kimberly Clark we recently

29
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:17,880
celebrated our 150th

30
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:20,100
anniversary so we've been around a long

31
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:21,600
time

32
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,420
we make products that serve billions of

33
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:27,119
people a day every day billions touch

34
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:29,360
our products we've been out in the hotel

35
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,340
you've probably used our products

36
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:34,799
those product names are

37
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:38,159
names like Huggies Cottonelle Kleenex

38
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:40,020
depend

39
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:43,079
pull-ups good nights

40
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:47,939
you buy Kotex Scott among many others

41
00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:49,680
and the reason why

42
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,360
those brands are important is because

43
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,640
our reputation and protecting those

44
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:56,840
Brands is our bread and butter

45
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:59,460
we make money off of those Brands we

46
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:01,020
have to make money

47
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:03,479
so that's why we exist

48
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:04,320
um

49
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,939
so

50
00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:10,199
in 2017 We performed an internal audit

51
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:12,599
of our systems and looked at our

52
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:15,239
industrial control space

53
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:17,400
and we're trying to find out where that

54
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,260
risk existed against some of those

55
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:22,140
products and to the teams that support

56
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:23,700
our OT space

57
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,500
the findings weren't going to be too

58
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:28,800
shocking but we had findings

59
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,700
our people the people processes that we

60
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:34,680
have we're inadequate we weren't

61
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,360
maintaining we weren't following our own

62
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:39,180
internal processes so we had challenges

63
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:41,819
with why we didn't do that we don't have

64
00:02:41,819 --> 00:02:43,920
visibility to the to the pieces of our

65
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,300
OT space so we didn't have the

66
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:47,519
visibility to all the components

67
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:49,920
that exists in that space

68
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,260
so we couldn't Quantified risk so we

69
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:54,420
built we built a program to help us

70
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:55,980
solve that

71
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:58,019
on the flip side of that in our I.T

72
00:02:58,019 --> 00:03:00,239
space we have a very very well

73
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:01,800
controlled environment

74
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:05,040
our I.T folks have focused on Disaster

75
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,220
Recovery processes for for years

76
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:11,099
have to recover data centers have to

77
00:03:11,099 --> 00:03:12,720
recover mainframes

78
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,780
how to do that well they practice that

79
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:19,140
they practice it annually so that and

80
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:21,300
through that practice through that that

81
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:24,840
effort processes were generated and so

82
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:27,659
that that program that we launched kind

83
00:03:27,659 --> 00:03:30,659
of was bringing us along the journey to

84
00:03:30,659 --> 00:03:32,819
improve how do we continuously improve

85
00:03:32,819 --> 00:03:35,280
and make things better for this idea for

86
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,260
this talk I originally proposed it last

87
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:40,500
year but kovit got in the way

88
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,659
our travel budgets were cut we couldn't

89
00:03:42,659 --> 00:03:44,760
travel during that there's too risky so

90
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,440
Kimberly Clark is a risk-averse

91
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,080
organization

92
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,120
so those of you that were here last year

93
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,040
great for us that couldn't attend

94
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,760
there's reasons why and one of the

95
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:00,239
Genesis for this talk is related to my

96
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:02,940
previous attendance at S4 and listening

97
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:04,379
to all the products

98
00:04:04,379 --> 00:04:07,920
and recommendations that come about

99
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,140
and trying to integrate those into our

100
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:12,239
environment and take advantage of all

101
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:15,239
the knowledge here and I felt like there

102
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:17,579
are some gaps because our experiences

103
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:19,978
don't necessarily align with reality the

104
00:04:19,978 --> 00:04:22,139
challenges that we have in our spaces to

105
00:04:22,139 --> 00:04:24,680
deliver on all these ideas have

106
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:27,479
organizational Financial

107
00:04:27,479 --> 00:04:30,120
and practical limitations

108
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:33,120
so this word cloud that built this cloud

109
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,160
based upon the terms that I used

110
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,860
repeatedly with my customers the people

111
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:40,199
that we needed to work with to say how

112
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:42,919
do we improve and a lot of the words

113
00:04:42,919 --> 00:04:46,380
relate to availability systems

114
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:48,180
technologies

115
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:50,280
but the things that come about or the

116
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:52,320
things that really surface to the top

117
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,840
are really the people

118
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,840
the knowledge that those people have the

119
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,940
processes that we use and the data that

120
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:02,280
we we need to consume to be able to

121
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,979
recover our systems so without those

122
00:05:04,979 --> 00:05:07,139
without those people without those

123
00:05:07,139 --> 00:05:09,419
processes without the data and knowledge

124
00:05:09,419 --> 00:05:11,759
we would not be able to recover

125
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:14,580
from whatever instance may be there back

126
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:17,460
to that phone call recovery doesn't just

127
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:20,340
occur it requires a lot of planning it

128
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:22,800
requires the right people it requires

129
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,860
systems and expertise that requires that

130
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:28,500
practice so people that are in the OT

131
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:31,680
space typically don't have that

132
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,960
process they're not exposed to that

133
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:37,340
process the I.T teams are so we try to

134
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:39,960
take advantage of our I.T knowledge and

135
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:42,419
apply it into OT space take advantage of

136
00:05:42,419 --> 00:05:44,400
those things that are there and really

137
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,320
bring those right people together was a

138
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,660
challenge for us so

139
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:50,580
some people add some questions I looked

140
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:52,080
at some of the questions and people were

141
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,820
focused on well could we use this

142
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,740
technology or that technology to help us

143
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:57,120
with recovery

144
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,419
and I think we have very good component

145
00:06:00,419 --> 00:06:02,479
recovery plans we have very good

146
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:05,220
application recovery plans

147
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:07,080
but when it comes to the people process

148
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,360
how do you do that that that's where the

149
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,520
challenges begin it's not a discipline

150
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,639
that the OT teams typically take on

151
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:16,800
the people that are operating our our

152
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,240
machines

153
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,160
essentially do that every day but it's

154
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,840
not a it's not a process they're

155
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,280
constantly trying to keep the machine

156
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,380
running and so they have failures they

157
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:27,300
have to repair things

158
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:30,479
but when it comes to a system-wide or a

159
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:32,460
site-wide or enterprise-wide type of

160
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:34,620
event that's not something that the

161
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:36,600
business has really thought about we

162
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,759
have to build those processes so if we

163
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:40,199
were to think about

164
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:42,720
you know if I were to focus on a small a

165
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,539
small problem you know machine down

166
00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:47,460
I have to know I have to be able to look

167
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:48,960
at that process I have to be able to

168
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,639
listen to the people and understand what

169
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:51,720
that is

170
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:54,300
and I have to bring the right people to

171
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:57,060
to the table to get that and so

172
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:59,940
as you think about Communications when

173
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:01,560
you have outages there's a lot of people

174
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,240
that want to know what's happening they

175
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,039
want to know why something failed they

176
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:06,660
want to know when it's going to be

177
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:09,479
returned to service and you may have

178
00:07:09,479 --> 00:07:12,840
even further you may need to recover a

179
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,639
whole facility let's say a facility was

180
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:15,479
down

181
00:07:15,479 --> 00:07:16,740
let's say there's a security

182
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:19,020
vulnerability that's been exploited and

183
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:20,699
now you can't trust your whole

184
00:07:20,699 --> 00:07:22,139
environment you have to shut it down

185
00:07:22,139 --> 00:07:25,139
what if there's a legal implication of

186
00:07:25,139 --> 00:07:26,759
that you may need to communicate with

187
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:29,340
your external communication Partners to

188
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:31,919
say maybe there's a news event so you

189
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:33,720
have to have plans in place you have to

190
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:36,180
think about that before your disaster or

191
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:39,080
your your failures occur so we have

192
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:41,819
within a process we call our critical

193
00:07:41,819 --> 00:07:44,400
outage process we have dedicated people

194
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,620
who are who are there for communication

195
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:49,440
so people in the technology space the

196
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,020
Technical Resources can focus on

197
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:54,240
recovering or learning what the source

198
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,759
of the problem is so some of the things

199
00:07:56,759 --> 00:07:58,740
I think about because I've participated

200
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:00,539
in a number of power down events at

201
00:08:00,539 --> 00:08:02,759
facilities and in some of those power

202
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:06,000
Downs our Network team likes to perform

203
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,520
activities of Maintenance and the last

204
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:11,039
power down I was in the core network was

205
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:11,880
down

206
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:14,460
and the team couldn't bring it back up

207
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:16,560
the switches were down core switches so

208
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,840
there's no there's no communication at

209
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,160
the site

210
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,020
and they were trying to reach out to

211
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:24,599
their support teams offshore

212
00:08:24,599 --> 00:08:26,580
and the problem is they couldn't because

213
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:28,800
we rely upon a telephone system that's

214
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,180
in the cloud

215
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:32,940
so now I have no means to communicate in

216
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:34,500
the cell phone service in the facility

217
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:37,860
was inadequate it could not communicate

218
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:40,080
from that data center room

219
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,419
and oh by the way we ripped out pbx's

220
00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:45,480
five years earlier so we had you have to

221
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,220
you have to think about what are you

222
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:48,899
going to do in those situations how are

223
00:08:48,899 --> 00:08:50,640
you going to handle that do you have a

224
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,220
plan the data and operational signals

225
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:55,860
that that come with thinking about this

226
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:59,040
is a challenge so you have a lot of data

227
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,839
that's there

228
00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:02,519
the people that are going to participate

229
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:04,380
in this process do they have access to

230
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:07,380
that data or is that restricted to only

231
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,779
the people that need to know oftentimes

232
00:09:09,779 --> 00:09:11,459
that's going to impact your ability to

233
00:09:11,459 --> 00:09:13,500
recover so

234
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,959
we did not have all of the signals in

235
00:09:15,959 --> 00:09:17,760
place when we did this audit for our

236
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,279
teams and we still struggle with

237
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:22,380
exposing our logs to the people that

238
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:25,019
need them we have internal control

239
00:09:25,019 --> 00:09:26,880
processes that say I need to have

240
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,640
segregation a duty and you don't need to

241
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:30,899
know that

242
00:09:30,899 --> 00:09:35,300
and that's a challenge in and of itself

243
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:37,320
but certainly from a recovery

244
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:41,100
perspective so we've been focused in our

245
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:44,279
process of learning and failing a bit or

246
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:46,860
practicing this on smaller scale scale

247
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:49,680
attempts we started focusing on systems

248
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,360
to put in place

249
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,519
in some of those systems we put in place

250
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:55,200
were for Discovery how do we discover

251
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,540
all of our control components how do we

252
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:59,640
get those and expose them and make them

253
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,620
visible

254
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:04,200
how do we log interesting events what

255
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,820
are those interesting events who are the

256
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:07,320
people that know what those events mean

257
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:10,800
do you have a tool to do so

258
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,560
how do you put this into a corporate

259
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,560
system so that you can have a

260
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:18,000
configuration management database how do

261
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,380
you track it

262
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:21,959
a lot of the OT systems are not in our

263
00:10:21,959 --> 00:10:23,820
corporate cmdb

264
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:26,940
they're not there so do they exist

265
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:29,040
so when we think about this how do we

266
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,980
get these people into this process we're

267
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:34,200
challenged in that place

268
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,440
we needed in our process of trying to

269
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,000
get some of those tools in place we

270
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,980
needed to cultivate some people some

271
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:43,019
roles in our organization

272
00:10:43,019 --> 00:10:46,200
and we we landed on this

273
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,660
concept of an OT Champion so the people

274
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:50,940
in the plant who are

275
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:53,100
knowledgeable about the processes that

276
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:54,540
run machines that are knowledgeable

277
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:56,100
about the machinery

278
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:58,800
and have exposure to the technology but

279
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,600
may not be there they're the folks

280
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,920
they're the most valuable in this

281
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:05,160
process because their their feedback to

282
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:07,019
recovery is critical

283
00:11:07,019 --> 00:11:09,480
we have core people who understand all

284
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,519
the systems the people that are experts

285
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:13,700
in networks and firewalls and

286
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:17,399
applications in the control space itself

287
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:19,079
and you have all the support

288
00:11:19,079 --> 00:11:21,060
organizations that are there they have

289
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:23,399
challenges they don't have the language

290
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:25,260
but you have to have them there to be

291
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:28,019
able to operate in recover systems

292
00:11:28,019 --> 00:11:30,120
and in a recovery you may need

293
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:33,120
additional resources you may have people

294
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,220
from outside your organization that need

295
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:37,140
to come and help recover you might have

296
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:39,000
a vendor that needs to travel do you

297
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,980
have the budget are you ready to pay for

298
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:42,300
that

299
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:44,399
and then we have recovery process

300
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:47,760
experts those folks who are

301
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,279
offloading the work of of communicating

302
00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:53,700
what's happening with that recovery and

303
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:56,339
allowing the tech people to to focus on

304
00:11:56,339 --> 00:11:59,880
getting systems back and working so

305
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,980
we have a lot of process knowledge we

306
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:05,040
have a lot of system knowledge

307
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,200
it's buried down at the look at the

308
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,640
bottom layer it's buried down in those

309
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:11,339
plants it's not brought into the into

310
00:12:11,339 --> 00:12:13,500
the center of our organization certainly

311
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:16,140
not in the I.T space I sit in a group

312
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:17,700
that's in between there I sit between

313
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:21,959
I.T and the in the engineering community

314
00:12:21,959 --> 00:12:23,160
um

315
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,500
in a unique space and so the challenges

316
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,240
that we have is that we've got we've got

317
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,620
all these roles

318
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:32,220
and we need to have that knowledge and

319
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:35,399
bring that knowledge together and so you

320
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:37,740
talk about convergence of it and OT and

321
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:40,620
my perspective that's a one-way Street

322
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:43,620
I.T folks are not learning the OT space

323
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:46,740
it's vice versa OT folks are only

324
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:48,360
learning the I.T

325
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:51,120
and

326
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,760
that doesn't help because there's real

327
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,579
technical language gaps

328
00:12:56,579 --> 00:12:58,860
between the organization so when

329
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:01,440
somebody says hey my machine is down

330
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,440
I.T folks thinks that's a PC or a

331
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,639
computer

332
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:07,560
and it doesn't get the urgency that's

333
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:09,720
needed on on the desk on the help desk

334
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,880
they set it as a low priority and it's

335
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,620
like well wait we have a problem we got

336
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:16,560
to get it fixed and so recovery is

337
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,480
probably not the time when you're trying

338
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,100
to recover that's not the time to be

339
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,480
fighting with people and trying to

340
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,399
communicate what's what's there you have

341
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:25,079
to start building the language between

342
00:13:25,079 --> 00:13:26,820
organizations

343
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:29,160
and so what we've done is we've we've

344
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,260
built this group that we call the OT

345
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:33,720
support center which which gathers a lot

346
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,880
of these skill sets together to begin

347
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:38,519
breaking down those language barriers so

348
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:40,800
that when you have a critical event

349
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,260
you're able to communicate effectively

350
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:46,380
one of the common themes or the things

351
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:48,060
that a lot of the tool vendors will talk

352
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:50,160
about is hey I got a baseline for you I

353
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,899
need to get your Baseline

354
00:13:51,899 --> 00:13:55,380
tell me what your Baseline behavior is

355
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:56,760
we don't have the time to build

356
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,740
baselines we have barely have enough

357
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:00,720
time to get the system running

358
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,519
to be able to document it well our

359
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:04,320
documentation is on a spreadsheet and a

360
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,459
cad drawing

361
00:14:05,459 --> 00:14:08,760
it's not it's not automated today we're

362
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:11,940
working on it but it's not there so the

363
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:13,560
challenge with that is we don't have the

364
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,480
resources we didn't have the resources

365
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,700
to do do the things that we that we

366
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:19,519
really need help with

367
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:21,660
and it's a struggle to get the

368
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:24,000
leadership to buy into that because

369
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,040
we're a financially driven organization

370
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:28,320
we're meant to make profit not

371
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,139
necessarily put security tools in place

372
00:14:31,139 --> 00:14:33,899
and so the projects that get brought

373
00:14:33,899 --> 00:14:35,880
forth have to compete against capital

374
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:38,880
projects to make a product Improvement

375
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,680
so the money doesn't necessarily get put

376
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:43,560
forth to put in security systems and so

377
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,060
that we have a lot of operational

378
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:46,920
signals that we're starting to build in

379
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:49,019
those operational signals really need to

380
00:14:49,019 --> 00:14:51,120
have people who know

381
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:54,600
what those signals mean so the challenge

382
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:57,120
of these operational signals is their

383
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,440
manual

384
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:01,139
we need help with automating things we

385
00:15:01,139 --> 00:15:03,120
need help to offload that work so we can

386
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,060
return time to to the people who use

387
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:09,019
those tools so they can be better

388
00:15:09,019 --> 00:15:11,579
affecting change and improving the

389
00:15:11,579 --> 00:15:13,760
security

390
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:16,199
um a lot of the things that people will

391
00:15:16,199 --> 00:15:18,139
look at when when we do get into

392
00:15:18,139 --> 00:15:21,360
recovery processes people don't focus on

393
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,100
the data they don't look at their log

394
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:25,320
data and actually listen to it that's

395
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,880
one of the things I think over and over

396
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,100
again the data is telling you something

397
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:32,040
use it and learn from it make make sense

398
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:34,860
of it so that your your teams can can

399
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:38,519
move on but we oftentimes our security

400
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:40,920
groups are looking at and say here let's

401
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,899
collect everything let's put it in a day

402
00:15:42,899 --> 00:15:44,880
like it's like well I don't want

403
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,500
everything I want the things that are

404
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,839
important how do you filter down to that

405
00:15:48,839 --> 00:15:50,639
data you have to you have to get to that

406
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:52,199
point you have to have people who know

407
00:15:52,199 --> 00:15:54,300
the data so that you can trust it so

408
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:55,740
that you can build upon that and make

409
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:58,380
make useful information and you have to

410
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:00,600
rely upon the people so those people

411
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,519
closest to the process

412
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:05,040
they're the folks that know what's

413
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,480
happening they're the ones that have

414
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,240
feedback to say hey this is broken this

415
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,620
is not normal

416
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:12,720
we don't have those technical baselines

417
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,940
to say hey something's abnormal

418
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:17,760
the abnormality for us is the machine is

419
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:20,399
running it's running good or it's not

420
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:23,579
running and when it's not running that's

421
00:16:23,579 --> 00:16:25,860
not good so some of the some of the

422
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:27,500
things that I feel

423
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:30,120
important that we need help with or that

424
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:32,339
we've run into and I think that's for

425
00:16:32,339 --> 00:16:34,800
Community can help with we have problems

426
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,079
with the data and defining when we do

427
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:40,259
this automatic discovery and you start

428
00:16:40,259 --> 00:16:42,360
to put things into place and you say hey

429
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:45,060
I discovered this pile of stuff

430
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:47,820
what does it align to what context does

431
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:50,220
it does it belong to machine one machine

432
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:53,639
two or machine five is it shared is it

433
00:16:53,639 --> 00:16:54,839
dedicated

434
00:16:54,839 --> 00:16:57,180
what firmware version does it have what

435
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:58,259
is it

436
00:16:58,259 --> 00:17:02,339
is it a PLC is it a is it an i o point

437
00:17:02,339 --> 00:17:05,819
is it a server is it a virtual is it a

438
00:17:05,819 --> 00:17:08,459
physical there's not a language to be

439
00:17:08,459 --> 00:17:10,679
able to take that data and say now that

440
00:17:10,679 --> 00:17:13,140
we discovered it inject it into a

441
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:15,839
configuration management database

442
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:18,059
there's no structure in place that

443
00:17:18,059 --> 00:17:21,480
allows us to do that easily so we had to

444
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:25,199
build custom capabilities in our cmdb

445
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:28,260
our baselining and being able to get

446
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:30,559
there a lot of a lot of vendors here can

447
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:34,200
learn put their systems in learning mode

448
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,720
but then there's thousands and thousands

449
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,419
of flows that have to be analyzed in the

450
00:17:39,419 --> 00:17:42,840
past we had the expectation that uh

451
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,640
somebody was going to sit down in front

452
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,820
of that tool and and validate that we

453
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:49,679
don't have the luxury of time to do that

454
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:52,020
we don't have the people to do that

455
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:54,720
so the challenge we have is we need more

456
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:57,000
help with with automation we need to be

457
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,640
able to get and offload the manual

458
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:00,600
effort

459
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,820
from people so that they can focus on

460
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:05,400
the value and they can return things to

461
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:09,600
operations and so you you look at this

462
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:13,559
and you you see this I I can focus on so

463
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:15,240
many different pieces of technology and

464
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,160
talk about how I recover that or how I

465
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:19,799
prepare for that but it's the people

466
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:23,100
processes that the OT space does not

467
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:26,640
have the luxury of of working with

468
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,740
and aligning to the I.T folks it's

469
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:30,900
typically been hey you're over there I'm

470
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:33,419
over here this is your job that's my job

471
00:18:33,419 --> 00:18:35,940
we don't talk

472
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:37,740
so

473
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:41,220
that's the end of my slides there's some

474
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:42,780
room for questions if you guys have

475
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:44,720
questions

476
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:48,380
microphones on either side

477
00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:50,280
how you doing thank you for your talk

478
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:53,340
so you brought the idea of having folks

479
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:55,440
kind of converging between your security

480
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:58,260
slash it and your controls Engineers

481
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:01,919
perhaps the actual process engineers

482
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:03,360
be it

483
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,120
electrical or whatever

484
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,679
do you have any suggestions or like a

485
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:09,120
baseline a guidance that you would

486
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,880
provide to anybody for how you get those

487
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,980
people in the same room where you kind

488
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:15,960
of find to identify who should be an

489
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:18,179
ambassador for each group and what kind

490
00:19:18,179 --> 00:19:19,500
of challenges they should sit down to

491
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,240
actually discuss

492
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:24,299
our experience was that we needed those

493
00:19:24,299 --> 00:19:26,100
people at the site to be able to help

494
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:28,140
put context into the tools that we're

495
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:30,299
using to discover gear

496
00:19:30,299 --> 00:19:33,240
this program that got launched for us

497
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:36,240
was launched without the planning for

498
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,919
resources in the engineering community

499
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:40,679
so it was a night it was I.T security

500
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:43,380
LED and driven and a program was

501
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:45,360
launched we didn't plan for the resource

502
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:48,360
time for those people so we were not a

503
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:50,340
hundred percent successful

504
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:53,520
we have a staff driven organization a

505
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,960
number of our businesses are staff

506
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,580
driven so we have people in the center

507
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:59,220
who allowed us to do that we built the

508
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:01,320
core around those people and then we

509
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:03,960
reached out to the people at the edge to

510
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:06,179
say hey there's value to you in your

511
00:20:06,179 --> 00:20:09,720
role to help us and do this and use

512
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,640
automated tools instead of using those

513
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:14,039
manual processes so that was our

514
00:20:14,039 --> 00:20:16,200
approach to say how do we get people at

515
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:19,320
the edge to participate and we've seen

516
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,900
in the few places where we've had people

517
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:23,820
really dive into that they've been

518
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:27,600
extremely successful in accelerating the

519
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,660
the Automation and the usage of of

520
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:33,360
digital tool sets to do that so we had

521
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,820
to get it really is a cross-functional

522
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:37,200
and it's dependent upon your

523
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,179
organization and how your how you're

524
00:20:39,179 --> 00:20:42,620
structured we we struggled with that

525
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:46,080
but we're seeing the winds now we're

526
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,000
seeing the value because of the tools

527
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,280
are are providing the value back to the

528
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:53,280
to their role excellent thank you I uh I

529
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,660
just encourage anybody that is trying to

530
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:56,280
do that effort to make it known whether

531
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:57,780
you have a blog or a

532
00:20:57,780 --> 00:20:59,940
posting you put on your website more we

533

00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:03,960
get these things done so like that

535
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:06,179
