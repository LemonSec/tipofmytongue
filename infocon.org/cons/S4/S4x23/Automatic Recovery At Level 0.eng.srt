1
00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:03,179
foreign

2
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:07,259
thank you appreciate the announcement

3
00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:08,400
so

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,500
at Mission secure we are considering

5
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:11,940
ourselves an

6
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:14,519
OT native cyber security company

7
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:16,079
and we're actually helping our customer

8
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:22,320
and clients to deploy and run a

9
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,140
zero trust architecture so bringing them

10
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:26,519
into Azure trust architecture

11
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:29,279
architecture over the years we always

12
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,500
had interesting interest at level zero

13
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,180
and you hear a lot about this some

14
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:35,399
people say it exists it doesn't exist so

15
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:37,200
we started working on this for about

16
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,660
like eight years ago and then we kept

17
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:41,640
evolving it so today I want to share a

18
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,079
little bit our experience with level

19
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:45,360
zero technology especially when it comes

20
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,579
down to automatic recovery which is

21
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:50,160
really like the top-notch deployment of

22
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,920
a level zero technology

23
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,980
um what's so fascinating about

24
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:58,680
OT is that every environment is so

25
00:00:58,680 --> 00:00:59,940
different I want to show you two

26
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:02,640
environments that you say like wow I

27
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,559
didn't even know that you can Implement

28
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:07,260
a cyber security technology on that so

29
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:09,720
here's the first one we're working on

30
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:12,720
okay got this one thank you this is a

31
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,360
oil drilling platform that sits in a

32
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,479
North Sea of Denmark okay there's very

33
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:20,820
few uh there's there were a few people

34
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:22,740
working on it it's very hard to reach if

35
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:24,119
you want to deploy something you have to

36
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:26,360
find a helicopter that flies you out

37
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:28,439
surprisingly there's pretty good

38
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:30,540
connectivity there and it's highly

39
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:31,920
critical environment so dealing with

40
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,880
possible explosions fire oil leaks it's

41
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,740
a very sensitive highly critical

42
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:39,000
environment

43
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,439
here's another one we have been working

44
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:43,740
on autonomous drones these drones they

45
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:46,380
fly for weeks think about like the stone

46
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:49,500
flying for four weeks in a row executing

47
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,540
a predefined flight pass

48
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:54,259
so you avoid about like a GPS location

49
00:01:54,259 --> 00:01:57,000
rather control obviously in this

50
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,520
particular

51
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:01,979
vehicle there is no staff on board right

52
00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:04,020
this is unmanned and everything that's

53
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:06,119
happening is happening remotely once in

54
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:07,740
a while this drone connects to a control

55
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:08,940
center

56
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:10,020
so when you think about these

57
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:13,500
environments still you know the zero

58
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,599
trust architecture applies you want to

59
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:17,640
inspect as much as you can you want to

60
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,200
validate validate validate you want to

61
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,959
look at who is accessing it how did they

62
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:23,580
get to it which Cloud where they came

63
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:25,379
from what's the network pass which are

64
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:26,640
the firewall configurations with

65
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,120
protocol how vulnerable our workstations

66
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,400
what applications running on it who's

67
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,400
logged in and then what protocol and

68
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,860
which um PLC are they connecting to is

69
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:39,720
there a vulnerability on the PLC and

70
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,580
then what kind of like OT protocol are

71
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:43,920
they using to program that plc

72
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,260
and lastly you know this is what we're

73
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:48,720
going to talk about you can think about

74
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,340
level zero

75
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:52,980
that's the idea too you have a finger on

76
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:54,900
the ground you know what the actual

77
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:57,300
outcome of your cyber physical process

78
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:59,400
is going to be

79
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,560
um and that is almost like too good to

80
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:04,739
be true because if you have that why is

81
00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:07,500
not everyone doing it and I want to shed

82
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,879
some light on that one and walk you

83
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:10,440
through like a scenario in a use case

84
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,640
where it actually makes a lot of sense

85
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,379
and hopefully that drives a little bit

86
00:03:13,379 --> 00:03:15,300
interest for you to think about level

87
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:17,580
zero technology in the future

88
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:20,280
so here's another interesting case when

89
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,959
you think about it who's actually really

90
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:25,019
using it first of all what we in our

91
00:03:25,019 --> 00:03:27,180
experience and it must be must be and

92
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:29,159
there will be many many other cases it

93
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:31,739
needs to be high criticality high risk

94
00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:34,620
like a sensitive nature where the

95
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:36,480
operator wants to go the extra mile to

96
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,040
create like really the highest possible

97
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,720
protection they can do

98
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,060
then we see frequently it's being used

99
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:43,739
and where it's like restricted physical

100
00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:46,799
access infringment maintenance and

101
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:48,900
always the need for automate something

102
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,819
like that's somewhat remote

103
00:03:50,819 --> 00:03:54,420
and then lastly relatively few clear

104
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:56,340
performance indicators some type of

105
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:58,920
sensor some kind of output that gives a

106
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:01,620
clear status of the overall system helps

107
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:04,200
okay and the risk indicators

108
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,580
so

109
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:08,060
here's another example

110
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:11,459
we have been working on a an fsiu who

111
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:13,379
knows what an fsiu is

112
00:04:13,379 --> 00:04:18,238
okay this is a a floating storage and a

113
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:21,120
regasification unit so the vessel on the

114
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,419
right hand side is the fsiu the one on

115
00:04:24,419 --> 00:04:26,580
the left hand side is like an a liquid

116
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:29,160
natural gas tanker it brings the liquid

117
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,800
natural gas to the fsiu unloads and the

118
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,620
FSA you will then create gas out of it

119
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:38,280
okay makes sense yeah so this fsiu only

120
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,740
floats around like travels like a few

121
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:43,020
times a year maximum and then the tank

122
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:45,660
has come and many times a day or a week

123
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:48,120
and then and deliver the liquid natural

124
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,280
gas the process for this application

125
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,900
looks like this okay on the left hand

126
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:54,240
side you have the LNG tanker that sat

127
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,979
around thing with the round storage

128
00:04:55,979 --> 00:04:57,479
containers

129
00:04:57,479 --> 00:05:00,360
the unloading arm comes in pumps out the

130
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:04,440
LNG minus 160 degrees Celsius into the

131
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,780
LNG storage tank

132
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:09,419
uh over there it's contained as a bigger

133
00:05:09,419 --> 00:05:11,160
tank and will be collected and then it

134
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,919
will be pumped out into the LNG

135
00:05:12,919 --> 00:05:16,139
vaporizer over there they're using sea

136
00:05:16,139 --> 00:05:19,680
water of roughly plus 13 degrees Celsius

137
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,620
and they'll warm up the LNG and then it

138
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:24,720
creates gas and it gets into the into

139
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,360
the pipeline and IT Supplies the country

140
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,060
with gas that's like the LNG type of

141
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:32,759
scenario interestingly with the scenario

142
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:34,740
is there's two really big choke points

143
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:36,780
on here on the surface now one is the

144
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:39,900
LNG storage tank and the other one is

145
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:42,360
the vaporizer the LNG storage tank we

146
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,220
avoid about either exploding or

147
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:46,199
imploding so we have the level has to be

148
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:48,840
perfect okay and the vaporizer we have

149
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,340
the Palm we're dealing with a low

150
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:51,840
pressure scenario that goes into high

151
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,520
pressure scenario there's the potential

152
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,340
risk there okay now let's simplify this

153
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:59,820
entire process and look at the tank

154
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:03,300
okay so we got a a level meter we got a

155
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:05,940
valve and a pump connects a typical OT

156
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:08,419
system with a workstations a PLC

157
00:06:08,419 --> 00:06:10,800
firewall and then there is a vsat

158
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,259
connection depending on if the FSU is

159
00:06:13,259 --> 00:06:15,300
traveling or like a wireless ISP if it's

160
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:17,820
audio and Port all right so very very

161
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:21,060
simple makes a lot of sense now if you

162
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:22,919
think about a potential attack it would

163
00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:26,160
roughly look like this okay so somehow

164
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,620
one of the workstations gets compromised

165
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:30,180
that could be spear phishing could be

166
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:32,460
also be an Insider attack all right or a

167
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:34,020
vulnerability gets exploited so

168
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:38,460
workstation gets um compromised then uh

169
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:40,680
um the attacker attacks over the network

170
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:43,919
gets to the PLC or figures out how this

171
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:47,699
thing works and then uh reprograms some

172
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:49,680
of our values and this particular case

173
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,020
doesn't have to be much if it identifies

174
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:54,300
the level meter as a level meter it can

175
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:56,220
potentially just change the range factor

176
00:06:56,220 --> 00:07:00,240
for the 11 meter so then the the our gas

177
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,880
tank would just overfill and possibly

178
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:06,419
explode so if successful and working for

179
00:07:06,419 --> 00:07:08,100
this for a long time the attacker might

180
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:10,080
have found a way to mask the condition

181
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,720
and possibly even taking Network offline

182
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,240
when it comes to that so we have to be

183
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,280
worried about that for sure there will

184
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,099
be some malicious activities and

185
00:07:20,099 --> 00:07:23,220
possibly a physical impact later on

186
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:25,919
so we got all of the three check marks

187
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:27,780
here we got the remote location we have

188
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:29,880
a sophisticated attacker that had a long

189
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,979
time possibly to prepare and we have the

190
00:07:31,979 --> 00:07:34,680
potential for catastrophic damage

191
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:37,440
so let's get the screwdrivers out now

192
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,440
excited let's install a level zero

193
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,539
sensor okay so I have a picture here so

194
00:07:42,539 --> 00:07:44,819
you know it actually does exist so on

195
00:07:44,819 --> 00:07:47,780
the left hand side you see the Cyber

196
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:50,460
signal Integrity monitor that's our

197
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:51,539
Guild of the device is probably about

198
00:07:51,539 --> 00:07:55,020
eight inches big and you can connect it

199
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:57,060
straight to the signal it has about six

200
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:00,720
inputs uh one for 20 million milliamps

201
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:04,500
um 24 five volt and five Watts so pretty

202
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:05,819
much any sensor out there you can

203
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:07,919
connect to it

204
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:10,199
um most of the time these sensors I mean

205
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:11,639
almost they're already connected to the

206
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:14,400
PLC so you need to have like a signal

207
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,340
splitter in between so that you can

208
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:19,199
split the signal and then make that

209
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:21,180
signal Integrity sensor like a passive

210
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:23,460
listening device to the actual physical

211
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:25,979
signal okay

212
00:08:25,979 --> 00:08:27,120
um

213
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,460
how does it look in a like a Dean rack

214
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:31,560
here we go I set this up and took a

215
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,839
photo for you so the signal Integrity

216
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:35,520
sensor is obviously connected to power

217
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,080
in this particular case it's connected

218
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:41,039
to 20 to a 24 volt um signal and then

219
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:43,140
underneath is also an ethernet port and

220
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:44,820
actually connects to the to the next

221
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,620
switch that that way has it has access

222
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:49,740
to the PLC and to a potential control

223
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:52,320
console and then on the right hand side

224
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,060
you also see the the signal Splitters

225
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:57,000
that we need there was two two inputs

226
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,339
out and two inputs in and four inputs

227
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:02,160
out okay so this is set up and then in

228
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,779
our setup it looks like this on the

229
00:09:03,779 --> 00:09:05,160
bottom left now you have the signal

230
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,800
Integrity sensor and it's a passively

231
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,560
listening it gets the from the input

232
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,140
from the level meter and then it reports

233
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:14,820
status up to a console in this

234
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,440
particular case that our console is in

235
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:19,080
the cloud but it could also be on on our

236
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,940
vessel or or somewhere else it really

237
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:23,899
doesn't matter that much

238
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,740
um most importantly now you want to

239
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:28,080
prepare for this first of all you need

240
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,760
to understand what Logics you have in

241
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,380
place you have the process logic in

242
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:34,620
place which is our normal PID tank pump

243
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:37,380
valve type of configuration then you

244
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:38,940
always have the safety logic that runs

245
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:40,740
on a different PLC right next to it

246
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:43,560
which was avoiding about certain safety

247
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:46,380
conditions possibly a shut off button

248
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:48,839
and then the lastly you want to consider

249
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:51,540
what kind of logic do you need for cyber

250
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:54,360
recovery okay this will be a logic that

251
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:57,000
basically assumes that you can't trust

252
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,880
any value and any input tag in the

253
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,320
system anymore and you want to reset

254
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,600
that this is a very powerful setup now

255
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,399
it basically means we have a finger on

256
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:07,440
the ground like an additional eoner

257
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,120
guard a really third completely

258
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,120
independent way to listen to what's

259
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,160
going on in the actual output of of

260
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:17,160
cyber physical system all right okay

261
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,899
good

262
00:10:18,899 --> 00:10:21,540
so what happens now if there's an attack

263
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:24,120
now since we have our signal monitor in

264
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:27,000
place and we configured in a way that um

265
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,040
generally we as uh the operating window

266
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:32,580
is between 20 and 60 of the level meter

267
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:34,920
and be configured in a way to trigger an

268
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:37,620
alert when we're below 20 or when we're

269
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:42,300
above 60 let's say 85. so we got the

270
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:44,459
same attack again with someone is coming

271
00:10:44,459 --> 00:10:46,140
over the workstation goes over the

272
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:49,740
network finds the PLC reprograms it but

273
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:52,019
this time we detected it which is pretty

274
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:54,420
good right now we know something is

275
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:57,300
wrong and we can start some activities

276
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:59,100
there

277
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:02,100
um with this kind of thing you have two

278
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:05,399
choices you can do either a manual or

279
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:07,800
you can do an automatic response and I'm

280
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,959
telling you one thing manual response in

281
00:11:09,959 --> 00:11:11,760
the scenarios that I'm telling shortly

282
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,640
before takes a very long time all right

283
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,740
we're talking here about minutes weeks

284
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:19,860
days maybe even longer than that

285
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:20,820
um

286
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:23,579
in the best way to handle it is some

287
00:11:23,579 --> 00:11:25,019
sort of like an automatic response but

288
00:11:25,019 --> 00:11:26,579
it's really hard to do in this

289
00:11:26,579 --> 00:11:28,500
particular case now the good thing is

290
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:31,560
our signal intelligence sensor is also

291
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,540
connected to the PLC so it has access to

292
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:36,060
the PLC so even if the attacker has

293
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:39,480
removed our access from the network we

294
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:42,600
can still go and make changes to the PLC

295
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:45,360
all right so three possible ways we can

296
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,519
do and I have graded them in amount of

297
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:50,339
difficulty and risk okay so the first

298
00:11:50,339 --> 00:11:52,320
one is we can rewrite all of the input

299
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,660
tags to a non-good scenario that's a

300
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:57,660
really easy one could work all right in

301
00:11:57,660 --> 00:12:00,720
some cases we can also replace

302
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,579
um the input text and also replace the

303
00:12:02,579 --> 00:12:05,279
program logic that might be a really

304
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:07,019
good idea because we can't trust

305
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:09,839
anything anymore anyway and the last one

306
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:12,360
assuming our PLC actually you know got

307
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,860
compromised itself and there's maybe

308
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:16,140
already running something else on it we

309
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:17,940
maybe have to reload the entire firmware

310
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:21,300
and replace the program okay so

311
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:24,240
um let's um for Simplicity let's really

312
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,640
Target the first scenario that is more

313
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:29,100
realistic and actually has been proven

314
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:33,740
for us in the field uh we more workable

315
00:12:33,959 --> 00:12:36,060
so what we would do is we basically

316
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:37,860
would take a snapshot of all of the

317
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:39,720
input tags on a regular basis let's say

318
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:42,839
once a day once they then forget the

319
00:12:42,839 --> 00:12:44,519
alert we find out that the operating

320
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:47,160
window that the level meter is way

321
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,079
outside the operating window I'm gonna

322
00:12:49,079 --> 00:12:53,100
take one of the um sets of tags and

323
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:56,100
replace an mplc or the set of non-good

324
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:58,680
tags which then gets me with a pretty

325
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:01,980
good chance to a much safer scenario and

326
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:04,440
delays potential impact

327
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:07,680
now that seems to be pretty simple and

328
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,959
you can also manually snapshot this by

329
00:13:09,959 --> 00:13:10,740
the way it doesn't have to be

330
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:13,139
automatically we have done it many times

331
00:13:13,139 --> 00:13:15,120
manually and that's pre-configured then

332
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,220
in the Integrity sensor when it gets

333
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:19,560
written back to the PLC so there's a few

334
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,000
choices there

335
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,800
the problem with that method though is

336
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,180
that you have underestimated the

337
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:26,880
attacker right if we can write these

338
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,800
signals back and the tags back in a

339
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,260
system the attacker can do this too and

340
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:33,959
I guarantee you that they will do that

341
00:13:33,959 --> 00:13:35,940
because they have worked on this for

342
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:38,100
weeks they probably bought access to

343
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:40,200
that workstation on the.net and they

344
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,060
bought some experts in there so they

345
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:43,680
have done some reconnaissance so they

346
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,839
know exactly what's going on if we find

347
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:48,660
a way to restore the the system values

348
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:51,779
they will restore their system base as

349
00:13:51,779 --> 00:13:53,940
well and we have tried that in a lab and

350
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:55,680
I'm telling you that's not pretty

351
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,480
I'm working against the attacker

352
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,940
basically in real time all right plus

353
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:01,200
the attacker has a little bit of an

354
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,579
advantage they'll likely have already

355
00:14:02,579 --> 00:14:06,300
shut down network access and uh and so

356
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:08,519
the signal Integrity sensor has works by

357
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:10,860
itself and has an automated response

358
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:12,839
attacker has more resources at that

359
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:14,100
point of view

360
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:17,820
okay so what we have to do is we have to

361
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:20,459
do level this up a little bit here so

362
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:22,740
just having the signal Integrity monitor

363
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:25,019
by itself and looking at the values is

364
00:14:25,019 --> 00:14:27,420
really not good enough okay so we have

365
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:31,380
to deploy a um a network security

366
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:32,639
um

367
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:35,519
um a network security Appliance and this

368
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:38,459
is here on this on the um on the slide

369
00:14:38,459 --> 00:14:40,860
with the with the red logo that

370
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:42,899
Appliance is really critical because it

371
00:14:42,899 --> 00:14:46,320
guards the input to the PLC and knows

372
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,180
what traffic is coming in on what is

373
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:50,639
actually has been done in the past on

374
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,800
our plc

375
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:53,639
um

376
00:14:53,639 --> 00:14:56,160
You could argue now okay that's an extra

377
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,860
system that I need how do we get to that

378
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:01,920
and why is it needed well

379
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:05,639
it is uh possibly already there if you

380
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:07,740
developed a really good zero trust

381
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:10,199
architecture you should have a security

382
00:15:10,199 --> 00:15:12,959
Appliance at that point already there to

383
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:15,300
prevent lateral movement and north south

384
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:17,399
movements you have to have something

385
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:20,339
there so this could be an existing

386
00:15:20,339 --> 00:15:23,040
um industrial firewall or something very

387
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,380
similar obviously we have a device that

388
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:27,300
we know that works and that also

389
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:28,860
communicates with our signal Integrity

390
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:31,199
sensor really well so now in this

391
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:33,420
particular case what this network

392
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:36,000
security Appliance does it keeps record

393
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,300
of all access to the PLC like SSH access

394
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:42,480
we see modbus access we see OEM

395
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:46,860
protocols FTP and so on So based on that

396
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:49,860
um the signal Integrity sensor can now

397
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:52,620
signal to the network appliance that

398
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:54,839
there is a a problem on this particular

399
00:15:54,839 --> 00:15:59,160
system and then we can Auto isolate the

400
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,899
um the workstation that is basically

401
00:16:00,899 --> 00:16:03,839
creating the impact and auto isolate

402
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:06,000
this to a standby workstation that way

403
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,560
the attacker is taking off the system

404
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,959
and then we can start our auto recovery

405
00:16:09,959 --> 00:16:14,339
process okay so um now and this one is

406
00:16:14,339 --> 00:16:16,440
obviously a one-to-many relationship you

407
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,639
will have one of these security

408
00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:21,000
appliances for hundreds of plc's okay so

409
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,579
it is uh should be already there there

410
00:16:23,579 --> 00:16:25,860
should be an API and the signal tank

411
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:27,779
sensor can signal to it and then Auto

412
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:32,880
isolate the um the workstation

413
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,680
so now

414
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:37,320
um that one is a really good example

415
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:40,500
where we understand now that just having

416
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,880
level zero

417
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:44,459
detection is not really good enough it

418
00:16:44,459 --> 00:16:45,899
needs to work together with the network

419
00:16:45,899 --> 00:16:48,060
it needs to work with the protocols we

420
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:49,920
need to understand the access over time

421
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,259
if we don't have that we can't protect

422
00:16:52,259 --> 00:16:54,720
the system so really we need to inspect

423
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,579
what to expect but we have to create a

424
00:16:56,579 --> 00:16:58,980
full zero trust architecture it's not

425
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:01,320
enough to have only level zero and I

426
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,519
think that's the biggest earning from

427
00:17:02,519 --> 00:17:05,819
this exercise is always look as as many

428
00:17:05,819 --> 00:17:08,640
input vectors as you can and build a

429
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,640
full security posture

430
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:15,119
so in a punch line what do we learn from

431
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:18,179
this is you can use level zero detection

432
00:17:18,179 --> 00:17:19,740
technology that's actually very good

433
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:22,619
it's there it's available

434
00:17:22,619 --> 00:17:25,020
and use it where it makes sense use it

435
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:28,140
where you know we have critical kpis we

436
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:31,080
have critical state in our cyber

437
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:32,400
physical system

438
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:36,000
and then sample very few signals don't

439
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,400
overdo it don't sample too many all

440
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,620
right and then inspect not just level

441
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:42,960
zero create a full signal to Cloud

442
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,600
strategy and get as many input vectors

443
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,900
as you can and start small and expand

444
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,520
where needed

445
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,679
overall always implements your trust

446
00:17:52,679 --> 00:17:56,220
over time start now lower the risk and

447
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:58,930
increase your safety thank you very much

448
00:17:58,930 --> 00:18:06,279
[Applause]

449
00:18:06,539 --> 00:18:08,340
so with that one I would like to open it

450
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:10,440
for questions um if you please walk up

451
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,480
to the microphone and because that way

452
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,039
everybody gets to

453
00:18:14,039 --> 00:18:15,660
hear it

454
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:19,260
hi um so I'm Andre so uh as far as

455
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:21,360
understood your technology does work

456
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,280
against Insider threats as well

457
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,440
intentional and intentional

458
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,960
uh so do you have cases of using your

459
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:30,000
technology into manufacturing and food

460
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,940
and Better Beverage companies

461
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:35,280
so I think your first question was like

462
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,140
um does this apply also for Insider

463
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:39,720
attacks up absolutely yes actually does

464
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:42,000
really well and the greatest thing about

465
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,520
110 technology it will always raise when

466
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:45,900
the problem happens right it doesn't

467
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:47,700
matter how it happened yeah absolutely

468
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:50,580
and it's it's a big use case and it gets

469
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:51,960
you a lot of confidence to having these

470
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:54,179
extra sensors in place

471
00:18:54,179 --> 00:18:56,220
and I think your question was does do

472
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:57,720
you have applications for this beverage

473
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,900
and Manufacturing yes exactly yes we do

474
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:03,360
we have worked on with manufacturing on

475
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,880
that one and it applies equally well I

476
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,380
use the maritime example here because

477
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:08,820
it's kind of like it's more like on the

478
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:12,059
on the edge but it uh depends on your

479
00:19:12,059 --> 00:19:13,260
use case and what you're trying to

480
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:15,299
protect and if you have these parameters

481
00:19:15,299 --> 00:19:16,740
if you think you have something that is

482
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:18,240
critical enough that you really want to

483
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,640
double and triple protect you absolutely

484
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:23,160
can use this in manufacturing and and uh

485
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:25,740
and similar applications okay let's talk

486
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:28,220
later then

487
00:19:30,299 --> 00:19:32,280
thank you that was uh really interesting

488
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:35,820
and my question is as I understand it

489
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:37,799
from the monitor side

490
00:19:37,799 --> 00:19:41,100
it's based or triggered on thresholds

491
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:42,900
what happens if those thresholds aren't

492
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:46,559
actually breached in any way I.E say I

493
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,960
know the 420 signal is

494
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,840
Frozen yep

495
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:55,200
well like uh yeah that's a good that's a

496
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,960
good question obviously the signal could

497
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:01,200
be Frozen that would not be ideal

498
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,120
um but assuming that the sensor is still

499
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,400
working and it's frozen then we will

500
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,260
also not have a problem in our example

501
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:11,640
right so um the exposure can only happen

502
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:15,780
if the level is above a safe or below a

503
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:16,919
safe value so it's all about the

504
00:20:16,919 --> 00:20:18,900
operating window are you inside or

505
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:20,340
you're outside of the operating window

506
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:23,820
but you could be pumping into the vessel

507
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:25,980
your level is frozen and therefore you

508
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:28,860
keep pumping you overflow you obviously

509
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:31,320
could deploy more sensors and then

510
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:33,360
correlate right so in this particular I

511
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,220
made it very easy by only hooking it up

512
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:37,679
with a level meter we could hook up more

513
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:39,780
sensors and we can do six with one box

514
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,880
or we can also deploy multiple boxes and

515
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,980
then create a correlation between them

516
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:46,880
okay thank you

517
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:50,720
good any other questions

518
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:53,400
well I would say thank you so much and

519
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,020
I'll see you guys later down there at

520
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:58,400
the lawn thank you
