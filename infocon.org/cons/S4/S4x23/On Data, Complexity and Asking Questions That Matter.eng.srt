1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,240
foreign

2
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:06,680
hello hi

3
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:09,720
good morning everyone how are we

4
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:12,300
hooray all right I'm so excited to be

5
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:14,580
here thank you for having me we are here

6
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:17,820
to have a conversation about data

7
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:21,119
complexity and answering questions that

8
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:23,100
matter it's very suspenseful title but

9
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:26,000
first I wanted to wish you a very happy

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,800
Valentine's day hooray Round of Applause

11
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,940
for Valentine's Day oh

12
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:34,980
very nice so I was just in my hotel room

13
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:37,200
this morning eating some conversation

14
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,660
hearts and you'll never believe what I

15
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:41,760
found in the bag I found a heart that

16
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,120
said S4 isn't that amazing it also said

17
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,760
two three wow

18
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,899
it said ICS

19
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:54,300
OT what a magical bag I'm not in this

20
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:55,620
field I don't even know what these

21
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:58,199
acronyms mean but I was so excited

22
00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:00,000
to find them and I trust they're in

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,219
everybody's Swag Bags as well and and

24
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:04,080
then I found all of these right I found

25
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,020
oh

26
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:08,640
explore right magical all right and I

27
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,799
know what you're thinking and yes I do

28
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:12,420
do my own Graphics thank you so much

29
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:15,140
thank you very much

30
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,220
I'm already got distracted back to what

31
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:19,380
I was here to talk about data complexity

32
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:22,439
and answering questions that matter well

33
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:24,659
I have three observations I wish to make

34
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:27,720
uh for you all today observation one and

35
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,220
maybe you've made this observation too

36
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:32,340
observation one there is more data out

37
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:34,380
there than we know what to do with if

38
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:36,360
you do know what to do with all that

39
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,400
data please come talk to me because I

40
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,979
don't know right all right observation

41
00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:44,159
two the world is very complex by complex

42
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,500
I mean it's interconnected it's evolving

43
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,600
it's changing there are big events and

44
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,100
they are unpredictable

45
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:51,360
I feel like I don't have to tell this

46
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,680
crowd that

47
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,619
finally an observation is that I at

48
00:01:55,619 --> 00:01:57,299
least have a lot of questions about the

49
00:01:57,299 --> 00:01:58,979
world what's going to happen what we can

50
00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:00,720
do and I imagine you all have some

51
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,579
questions as well again if you have no

52
00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:04,740
questions tell me the answer all right

53
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:07,079
but just to summarize what my questions

54
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:09,300
about the world are these days this is

55
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:10,739
pretty much the best summary I could

56
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:11,700
muster

57
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,140
that's kind of what I got right these

58
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:14,940
are what my thoughts look like as I

59
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:17,760
think about where the world is headed

60
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,599
so I am going to assert to you all today

61
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:24,840
that in order to answer all of these

62
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:27,300
questions using data in a complex world

63
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:31,140
I am going to assert that we need to ask

64
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:33,120
big questions

65
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,120
further I am going to talk today about

66
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:39,780
how in order to ask big questions it is

67
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:43,140
not enough to think outside of the box

68
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:45,959
not enough we must

69
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:47,580
go outside of the box look at these

70
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:48,780
Graphics all right thank you so much

71
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:51,599
very good by the way I did not I was

72
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:53,040
like there's not going to be a statue of

73
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,360
someone running I figured it would only

74
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,680
be standing and I'd have to do something

75
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,840
but it turns out there's a lot of

76
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,400
statues out there of people running so

77
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,140
if you take nothing away go check out

78
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:03,660
some great statues so we need to try new

79
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:06,300
things and honestly to put it in the

80
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:09,180
most scientific terms I possibly can we

81
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:11,640
need to get weird all right you ready to

82
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,140
get weird Make some noise

83
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:14,580
all right

84
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:16,800
we're getting weird we're getting weird

85
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,200
with more PowerPoint slides so my name

86
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,360
is Andrea Jones Roy as they said at the

87
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,640
introduction I am a professor of data

88
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,200
science practitioner of data science I

89
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,000
love data science I think about it all

90
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
the time I also am a stand-up comedian

91
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,940
when I'm not doing that I am also a

92
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:34,379
circus performer now my favorite thing

93
00:03:34,379 --> 00:03:36,239
about this picture uh all three of these

94
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:37,620
are me my favorite thing about this

95
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:40,200
picture of the circus act is all these

96
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,120
people standing and then the one woman

97
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,819
just lie down in the front so if anyone

98
00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:47,819
wants to come up and just lie down uh it

99
00:03:47,819 --> 00:03:49,980
will put me at ease thank you so much so

100
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:52,799
when I talk to fancy important smart

101
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,500
sophisticated crowds like this one I

102
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:58,019
almost never mention these two things

103
00:03:58,019 --> 00:04:00,959
right almost never I I put a little

104
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:02,340
corner there because it's like I'm not

105
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:03,659
going to lie to your face if you say

106
00:04:03,659 --> 00:04:05,700
have you ever done stand-up yes but I'm

107
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,860
not going to say it right and I don't do

108
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:09,840
it because I want to seem like a very

109
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,480
serious person I'm a data science right

110
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,180
every now and again I'll have a certain

111
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:16,978
crowd where I feel like I've talked to

112
00:04:16,978 --> 00:04:18,418
the organizers and I say well I could

113
00:04:18,418 --> 00:04:20,639
probably mention it in passing right

114
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,380
just as kind of like a fun fact thing

115
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:24,240
but I'm always very quick to say but

116
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,460
also I'm still very serious

117
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:28,979
I was so excited when Dale asked me to

118
00:04:28,979 --> 00:04:31,500
speak at this event because he said yeah

119
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,240
yeah data science that's fine but what

120
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,160
we really want to hear about are these

121
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,199
other two things and how they influence

122
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:39,900
data science and I'm going to also offer

123
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:42,240
how data science influences these two

124
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,860
things I wouldn't say the best way to

125
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:45,540
get into stand-up comedy is through data

126
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:47,220
science but if you are a data scientist

127
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:50,160
I promise you it will help so we are

128
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,080
going to talk today about how doing

129
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,120
things in other fields that seem very

130
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:57,060
unrelated can actually help in whichever

131
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:58,919
one field it is that you're trying to

132
00:04:58,919 --> 00:05:01,080
improve in so luckily for all of us

133
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:03,180
however we are not going to just talk

134
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:05,280
about me I could do that for many hours

135
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,720
feel free to find me at the bar and I

136
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,800
will tell you everything's ever happened

137
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,560
to me but I'm going to talk about the

138
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,660
case for getting weird for going outside

139
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:14,820
the box in a number of different ways

140
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:15,900
first

141
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:18,180
I'm going to talk about how it increases

142
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:20,280
adaptability

143
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,740
and I'm going to do that using logic

144
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:25,020
thank you so much thank you

145
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:26,699
then

146
00:05:26,699 --> 00:05:28,560
I'm going to talk about how going

147
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,479
outside the box getting weird can

148
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:31,979
improve Innovation and I'll give some

149
00:05:31,979 --> 00:05:33,720
examples of my favorite research that's

150
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,880
out there that combines two unexpected

151
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,199
worlds

152
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:39,840
finally a term I learned for this

153
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,820
presentation thank you so much mutualism

154
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,740
which is a term in biology that means

155
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:45,960
that two species exist and they do

156
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,520
things that mutually benefit one another

157
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,620
so I want to talk from my own life about

158
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:51,780
how science has helped my arts and

159
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:54,660
comedy career and vice versa

160
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:57,180
so let's start with logic let's start

161
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:59,220
with math nothing says 9 A.M like math

162
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:01,199
right we're talking math we're talking

163
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:04,500
logic and what better place to go to

164
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:07,259
talk about logic than the most logical

165
00:06:07,259 --> 00:06:10,860
place on Earth Las Vegas Nevada nothing

166
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:13,500
bad has ever happened nothing weird has

167
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,840
ever gone on what happens in Vegas you

168
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,160
tell everyone about because it's

169
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,900
perfectly logical thank you so much

170
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:21,240
you're welcome Las Vegas for your brand

171
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,280
new slogan all right we're headed to Las

172
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,100
Vegas I will see you there do we have

173
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,539
any gamblers in the audience Make Some

174
00:06:27,539 --> 00:06:28,979
Noise if we Gamble

175
00:06:28,979 --> 00:06:31,440
this is like a risk security no one here

176
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,759
is gambling a couple people all right

177
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:34,560
very good mayor or you're a bunch of

178
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,000
liars all right

179
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,580
all right so suppose we're all getting a

180
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:40,319
little wild and we forgot that the house

181
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:42,600
always wins and so we go up to these uh

182
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,819
slot machines and we say well I have a

183
00:06:44,819 --> 00:06:47,699
hundred pools of these uh slot machines

184
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:49,440
I don't know the expected payoff for any

185
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,460
of these I don't know if they're all the

186
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:51,960
same I don't know if one is better I

187
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,880
have no idea so I'm going to approach

188
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,319
these and say well what am I going to do

189
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:58,500
to maximize my potential payoff as I

190
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,360
approach these slot machines well I'm

191
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:03,180
gonna probably try each one unless I

192
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:04,800
have like a cool Instinct about it right

193
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,199
so I'm going to try each one ah I made

194
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:09,600
thank you so much okay noted I'm gonna

195
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,940
try again let's do one more round one of

196
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:14,340
each let's pull this next one uh oh all

197
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:16,560
right two in a row for this one for the

198
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,360
rest of my set I'm going to just pull

199
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:21,599
the remaining 90 some times for this one

200
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:24,180
what I have just demonstrated is a

201
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:27,300
strategy called exploration and a

202
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:30,360
strategy called exploitation and we do

203
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:33,060
this all of the time we do this when we

204
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:34,979
Face any decision where we don't know

205
00:07:34,979 --> 00:07:36,900
what the possible outcomes are going to

206
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:38,880
be we probably try a few things you try

207
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,500
different classes in college and you say

208
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,000
this is the one I want to do and then

209
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,099
you exploit

210
00:07:44,099 --> 00:07:46,680
the problem in real life and when we

211
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,180
think about the problems that we are

212
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:50,160
concerned with whatever it is in our own

213
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,860
field is that these are never just three

214
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:54,900
problems that you could have some finite

215
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:56,699
number of Trials over and get to some

216
00:07:56,699 --> 00:07:58,080
idea about how these things are working

217
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,539
right and not only are there many many

218
00:08:00,539 --> 00:08:01,919
options but they can be really

219
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:04,319
consequential just to over share some of

220
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:06,060
my thinking I could say well maybe I

221
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:07,680
should go back to school I'm not going

222
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,000
to go back to school but maybe I should

223
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,819
right uh maybe I should go all in on my

224
00:08:11,819 --> 00:08:13,440
career forget all my silly stuff I'm

225
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,880
going to go all in on data science I

226
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,319
think that sometimes and then the next

227
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:17,520
day I wake up and say I'm going to quit

228
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,960
my job that's what I'm going to do I'm

229
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,479
going to quit my job okay or I'm from

230
00:08:21,479 --> 00:08:23,340
New York so uh obviously whenever

231
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:24,660
anything is not going the way I wanted

232
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:26,639
to I say I'm going to move to LA it's

233
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:27,840
all going to be better for me at La

234
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,759
that's where I'm gonna go all right I

235
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,379
assume other people move other places

236
00:08:31,379 --> 00:08:32,700
but I don't know where those places are

237
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:34,919
maybe Miami all right or and I've

238
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:37,260
already done this once I might just move

239
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:39,299
to China right now maybe not but I did

240
00:08:39,299 --> 00:08:41,820
live in China for several years uh

241
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:43,679
because I am a troubled person but it

242
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:46,200
was wonderful and so I may I may go back

243
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,480
so these are high stakes and I don't

244
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,920
know what the payoff is obviously the

245
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,300
payoff has moved to LA I got to get out

246
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:52,620
of here all right I'm gonna turn my life

247
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:54,420
around you'll see all right but I don't

248
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:55,980
know and those aren't even all the

249
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:57,360
choices that I face and those aren't all

250
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,279
the choices that you face we all face

251
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:01,500
tons of choices and we don't know the

252
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,060
potential payoffs I'm working with a

253
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:05,339
career coach right now thank you uh and

254
00:09:05,339 --> 00:09:07,380
she would say that we create the payoffs

255
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,580
and so it doesn't matter what you choose

256
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:11,100
and I say sorry but this is how I think

257
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,540
about the world all right there are

258
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:14,220
paths that I could choose and I don't

259
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,959
know the expected payoff what am I going

260
00:09:15,959 --> 00:09:19,800
to do well especially when uh these

261
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,899
payoffs uh these these options are

262
00:09:21,899 --> 00:09:26,160
numerous and changing all of the time

263
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,440
in addition to causing an existential

264
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:31,440
crisis in me every waking moment what I

265
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,839
have just described is a very famous

266
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:35,760
problem in reinforcement learning

267
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,680
reinforcement learning among humans and

268
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:38,940
reinforcement learning in machine

269
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:40,320
learning which is an area that I work

270
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,540
and it is called the K armed Bandit

271
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:45,420
problem or the multi-armed Bandit and it

272
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:47,160
is used for a lot of data science

273
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,320
research and interesting applications

274
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,880
out there in the world where basically

275
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,339
you program a computer to seek rewards

276
00:09:53,339 --> 00:09:55,019
and figure out how to optimize those

277
00:09:55,019 --> 00:09:56,519
rewards when you don't know the possible

278
00:09:56,519 --> 00:09:58,860
outcomes and they do it through a mix of

279
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:00,540
exploring the universe exploring their

280
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:02,519
space and then zooming in on what seems

281
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:05,220
to work generally this has been used all

282
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:07,440
over the place in robotics I must say I

283
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,240
do not work for Boston Dynamics I do not

284
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,100
know if they use this I just wanted to

285
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:13,080
put up a nice robot all right also they

286
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,459
don't have fingers I never noticed that

287
00:10:14,459 --> 00:10:16,620
until now all right so KR Bandit is used

288
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:18,060
in robotics

289
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:19,920
people on the internet are asserting

290
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,060
that it is also used in search

291
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:23,339
algorithms and Netflix employees have

292
00:10:23,339 --> 00:10:25,080
made some uh presentations even about

293
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,300
using Karen Bandit under here and it's

294
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:29,339
used in financial forecasting portfolio

295
00:10:29,339 --> 00:10:32,339
allocation and many other things

296
00:10:32,339 --> 00:10:35,040
when we program this uh this

297
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,240
reinforcement learning algorithm

298
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,600
generally it depends but generally in a

299
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,880
changing environment you want to land on

300
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:44,880
some balance between explore and exploit

301
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:48,180
I get concerned when humans face

302
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:50,339
uncertainty they face constant change

303
00:10:50,339 --> 00:10:52,920
they face potentially hugely different

304
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,720
payoffs and they don't know which one to

305
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,600
choose we tend and organizations do this

306
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,180
too we tend towards exploit not always

307
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:02,880
but we tend to We tend towards exploit

308
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,620
for all kinds of interesting social

309
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:07,079
science reasons so maybe it's just a

310
00:11:07,079 --> 00:11:09,000
habit I pull that right lever right

311
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,100
maybe I have a preference for pulling a

312
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,899
particular slot machine maybe I have an

313
00:11:12,899 --> 00:11:14,579
area of expertise over here on the right

314
00:11:14,579 --> 00:11:16,560
maybe there are costs associated with

315
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,540
changing my strategy maybe I'm biased

316
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:20,760
for some other reasons and this I do

317
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:23,100
this too I'm stuck in my ways just as

318
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,959
much as all the other people out there

319
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:26,760
in the world so this is uh actually me

320
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:29,279
this Emoji is me you can obviously so

321
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:31,140
this is how I feel when I realize I've

322
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:33,540
been over indexing on exploitation so

323
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:35,220
the next time as you go out and think

324
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:36,899
about the work that you're doing or your

325
00:11:36,899 --> 00:11:38,940
own life choices and you're faced with

326
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:41,519
ah should I keep doing what I know or

327
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:44,519
should I try something new remember the

328
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:46,019
robots suggest

329
00:11:46,019 --> 00:11:47,880
we ought to try something new

330
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,740
all right that concludes the math

331
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:51,360
portion of this presentation and I know

332
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,459
what you're thinking was that math I

333
00:11:53,459 --> 00:11:55,019
don't know I don't know if that was math

334
00:11:55,019 --> 00:11:57,240
there's math in there I promise all

335
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:59,279
right

336
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:01,800
so I want to talk now about three

337
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,440
examples of what I think are extremely

338
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,480
cool bodies of work that have come about

339
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,120
as a result of scientists getting weird

340
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,500
all right

341
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,540
so uh first

342
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:15,500
I would like to assert a rather

343
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:18,420
controversial hypothesis with you all

344
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:20,700
how ominous does this sound right here's

345
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:22,980
my controversial hypothesis air

346
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:24,360
pollution

347
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,820
might be bad all right I don't know I'm

348
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,380
not trying to get political I'm gonna

349
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:29,700
try to do anything all right I just

350
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:31,980
gonna say suppose we wanted to find out

351
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:35,040
if air pollution is

352
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,320
well and of course bad how Divine air

353
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,399
pollution but get let's go with the

354
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:39,600
broader issue

355
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,420
from a scientific perspective the ideal

356
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:44,519
gold standard way to figure this out

357
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:47,519
would be to randomly assign some people

358
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:50,700
to a treatment of polluted air and

359
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:52,500
randomly assign other people to a

360
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:55,680
control of clean air and then we see

361
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,360
what happens and have a look right so

362
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,579
like randomly Miami gets pollution Fort

363
00:12:59,579 --> 00:13:00,959
Lauderdale gets clean Is that real I

364
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:01,560
don't know that might be what's

365
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,540
happening all right it's beautiful air I

366
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:06,000
love it all right we can't do that right

367
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,920
we obviously can't move people around

368
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,079
and assign people to bad air and the two

369
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:12,480
big reasons that come to mind for me uh

370
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,700
not to be like a real Downer here but I

371
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:17,100
would say the ethics of it uh or iffy

372
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:19,500
and in a distant second it also would be

373
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:22,680
rather expensive so we can't do that so

374
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,240
how can we figure out if air pollution

375
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,220
is bad in a way that gets us past just

376
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:28,560
observational data well

377
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,980
one of my all-time favorite studies

378
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:32,880
focuses on this city do we know what

379
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,360
city this is

380
00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:38,040
Beijing I heard it yes all right this is

381
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:40,260
Beijing Beijing has like many cities

382
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:42,839
around the world a big traffic problem

383
00:13:42,839 --> 00:13:45,000
and a lot of air pollution

384
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,760
these researchers realized based on

385
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,220
their local knowledge of Beijing that

386
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:52,800
they could exploit that's fun uh play on

387
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,420
words there they could exploit the fact

388
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:57,060
that Beijing has a policy in place to

389
00:13:57,060 --> 00:14:00,120
control traffic that allowed them to act

390
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,920
as though there was a treatment and a

391
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,420
control and I think London and other

392
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:05,100
cities have this as well where on

393
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:06,600
certain days of the week depending on

394
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,700
what license plate number you have what

395
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:10,500
number it ends with you can drive into

396
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,839
the city or not

397
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:14,940
right with those those policies exist

398
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:16,620
around the world well it turns out

399
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:19,440
in Chinese culture numbers have very

400
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,620
special meaning the number four is

401
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:25,560
highly avoided because Su is a homonym

402
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,360
homonym is that the word the same sound

403
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,360
as the word for death so people will go

404
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,860
out of their way to not get the number

405
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:34,320
four in their license plates

406
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,019
and number eight is very auspicious one

407
00:14:37,019 --> 00:14:38,399
of the main things I picked up by living

408
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:40,079
in China for three years is now anytime

409
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:41,339
I see a number eight I'm like here we go

410
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:42,839
this is gonna be good right and no one

411
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:43,860
knows what I'm talking about but it is

412
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:46,139
very auspicious there so that means on

413
00:14:46,139 --> 00:14:48,360
half of the week you have much fewer

414
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,220
cars going into the city if you have a

415
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:52,560
four license plate and way more if you

416
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,480
have an eight license plate and so they

417
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,459
were able to take advantage of this

418
00:14:56,459 --> 00:14:58,920
local knowledge and conduct a study that

419
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:01,380
showed that indeed on days when the

420
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:04,199
eights were going in uh versus days when

421
00:15:04,199 --> 00:15:06,060
the fours were going in there were a lot

422
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:07,740
more trips to the hospital for uh

423
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:10,500
respiratory problems at that time so

424
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,240
this is an amazing example to me of a

425
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,339
very fancy public health statistics all

426
00:15:14,339 --> 00:15:16,320
this stuff that took advantage of

427
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,360
knowing something about local culture

428
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:20,699
local history and local belief systems

429
00:15:20,699 --> 00:15:22,740
and I think this is awesome that's my

430
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:24,360
awesome seal of approval not air

431
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:27,420
pollution the study

432
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:30,180
does anyone know who this is

433
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:32,940
I'll be amazed and delighted if you do

434
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:34,320
all right you're being modest I think

435
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,420
you all know who this is uh you probably

436
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:39,600
don't this is Regina barziele she is a

437
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,120
computer scientist at MIT she's a recent

438
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:44,220
recipient of the MacArthur genius Grant

439
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:46,440
and all kinds of other Awards she was

440
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:49,320
doing all kinds of amazing high-level

441
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,240
Cutting Edge data science Computer

442
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,040
Engineering type of work

443
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,440
and then about 10 years ago she was

444
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,120
diagnosed with breast cancer she's fine

445
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,160
now she was diagnosed with breast cancer

446
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:02,100
she goes to Mass General Hospital and

447
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:03,779
and the doctor prescribes a treatment

448
00:16:03,779 --> 00:16:05,459
for her

449
00:16:05,459 --> 00:16:08,220
she asks a reasonable question which is

450
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:10,560
all right how effective has this

451
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,779
treatment been for your patients in the

452
00:16:12,779 --> 00:16:15,839
past for those who've had the same type

453
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:18,000
of cancer as me

454
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,220
and he said I'm not quoting directly but

455
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:23,339
he said well I guess I have the

456
00:16:23,339 --> 00:16:25,560
information in all of these paper files

457
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:28,800
but I have to say I couldn't tell you

458
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:32,220
and she like any of us thought this was

459
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:34,079
disappointing

460
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:35,519
and

461
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:37,800
that we should be able to do better and

462
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,600
meanwhile she's at MIT you know getting

463
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,420
robots to to sing songs and speak to us

464
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:43,500
I don't know what she's doing right

465
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,420
she's at MIT doing all this fancy stuff

466
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:47,820
and then meanwhile there's all this data

467
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:49,740
that hasn't been digitized that's just

468
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:52,380
sitting there that she could use or

469
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:53,940
someone could use if you could digitize

470
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:56,459
it get past the Privacy uh resolve all

471
00:16:56,459 --> 00:16:58,320
those sorts of security issues call all

472
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,660
of you right and make sure that it is

473
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:02,940
secure then you would have so much more

474
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:05,339
data outside of just relying on clinical

475
00:17:05,339 --> 00:17:07,140
trials around the world for how

476
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:08,459
different treatments and how they're

477
00:17:08,459 --> 00:17:11,160
different outcomes trans turned out so

478
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,859
she partnered with her doctor at Mass

479
00:17:13,859 --> 00:17:16,439
General and she uh and he have now

480
00:17:16,439 --> 00:17:18,959
co-authored many papers and they have

481
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:21,299
turned all of these medical records and

482
00:17:21,299 --> 00:17:22,140
they're using things like natural

483
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:23,699
language processing to process like the

484
00:17:23,699 --> 00:17:25,799
written records and all of this stuff to

485
00:17:25,799 --> 00:17:28,199
really make a difference in treatments

486
00:17:28,199 --> 00:17:30,120
of cancer and she's been doing this ever

487
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,980
since so she is one of the rare examples

488
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:34,740
out there of at least the ones we hear

489
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:37,500
about of people using Ai and machine

490
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,179
learning for really really great

491
00:17:39,179 --> 00:17:40,440
outcomes right we always hear about the

492
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,360
bad news

493
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,700
importantly for her she has shared with

494
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:47,039
me that she already had tenure at MIT so

495
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:48,960
she was able to kind of move away from

496
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,360
what counted as Cutting Edge and do this

497
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,039
other project that actually wasn't as

498
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:55,919
technical as her original work and for

499
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:57,840
most of us who are not tenured and don't

500
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,059
have that luxury in our jobs I like to

501
00:18:00,059 --> 00:18:01,679
think about what could we change in the

502
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:03,780
system to incentivize going down these

503
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:05,580
paths that aren't necessarily the peak

504
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:07,440
of the mountain but are all kinds of

505
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,200
interesting areas to explore

506
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,539
so Regina barzilla very much worth

507
00:18:12,539 --> 00:18:14,640
looking into

508
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:18,900
last one Jeffrey West is a physicist he

509
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:21,419
is at the Santa Fe Institute and he

510
00:18:21,419 --> 00:18:22,919
recently wrote a book called scale has

511
00:18:22,919 --> 00:18:24,660
anyone read this book

512
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:26,880
one person yes all right oh a few in the

513
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,039
back there we go so scale is a fantastic

514
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:30,960
book it came out a handful of years ago

515
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,120
and as you can see it's about the

516
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,980
universal laws of growth Innovation

517
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:36,299
sustainability the pace of Life

518
00:18:36,299 --> 00:18:38,460
organisms cities economies and companies

519
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:41,940
basically he realized that the math that

520
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:43,860
drives things like how big a whale is

521
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:46,919
also drives how big a company gets or

522
00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:49,200
how big a city gets and he got to this

523
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,960
realization as a physicist because every

524
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:54,960
Friday for a very long time he got

525
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,000
together with a biologist and they would

526
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,120
sit for hours and literally just talk at

527
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:02,039
each other about what was going on in

528
00:19:02,039 --> 00:19:03,780
their field how they think about the

529
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:05,340
world what some of the open questions

530
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:08,460
are and so on and because he took the

531
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:10,500
time to sit with this biologist and

532
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,780
learn about their field he was able to

533
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:15,660
form this whole new theory that unites

534
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:17,640
all these disparate areas of the world

535
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,620
so I like this example a it's a cool

536
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:22,440
book you got to read it uh B it's an

537
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:24,600
example of even if you don't have it in

538
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,580
you to say I'm a physicist I'm going to

539
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:29,880
now get a PhD in biology think about who

540
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:32,100
you know in your network or literally go

541
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:34,020
out on LinkedIn and look for people who

542
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:35,760
you're not connected to who study

543
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,020
something unrelated to you don't be

544
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:38,520
creepy when you reach out but find a way

545
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:40,919
to find these people all right you don't

546
00:19:40,919 --> 00:19:43,080
have to study the other thing right so

547
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:45,240
in the first example we saw local

548
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,679
knowledge that maybe the researchers

549
00:19:46,679 --> 00:19:48,539
already had through their life

550
00:19:48,539 --> 00:19:50,520
experience applied to science in the

551
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:52,559
second example it's kind of an upsetting

552
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:54,780
one where your Regina was forced into

553
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:56,220
another field by virtue of having to

554
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:58,020
take care of her health but she took on

555
00:19:58,020 --> 00:19:59,820
both of those fields and now does work

556
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:01,620
in those fields with others and this is

557
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:02,700
an interesting one because you don't

558
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:04,799
actually have to become a medical doctor

559
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:07,320
to work with one yes he also has a TED

560
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:09,720
Talk highly recommended have at it all

561
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,700
right

562
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:13,500
finally

563
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,360
we will now turn to the part we've all

564
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,220
been waiting for what's going on with

565
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:19,559
Andrea's life I'll tell you all right so

566
00:20:19,559 --> 00:20:21,840
I want to talk about how my different

567
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:25,080
areas help me get better at the other

568
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:27,600
areas yes all right

569
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,400
so I want to start with the two that

570
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:32,039
maybe seem the furthest apart

571
00:20:32,039 --> 00:20:36,539
so data science and circus

572
00:20:36,539 --> 00:20:38,520
when people think about data science or

573
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,320
they make assumptions about what I do in

574
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,940
data science or even on a good day when

575
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:44,340
I think about my own thinking in data

576
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:45,960
science I think about it as a field

577
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,520
that's precise

578
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,380
it's rigorous you want to have

579
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:52,200
discipline and you need math as we saw

580
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,820
whereas when I tell people I'm a circus

581
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:55,860
performer or I think about life as a

582
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:58,020
circus performer or or people describe

583
00:20:58,020 --> 00:20:59,880
circus they come up with words like this

584
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:02,160
right it's about creativity maybe you

585
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,900
have to be bold or Brave to do some of

586
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:05,940
the the things that you do flexibility

587
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:09,480
comes up a lot and of course costumes

588
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,520
I would like to share that while this is

589
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,980
true for each of these two Fields it's

590
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:16,380
also the case that those skills have

591
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:18,900
helped me in the other one

592
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:21,000
so let's talk about circus for a second

593
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,500
where my circus performers at Make some

594
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:23,880
noise

595
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,740
okay we'll be doing a circus lesson on

596
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:28,020
the beach uh this evening so so come by

597
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:32,280
so circus is absolutely positively all

598
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,780
about all of these things right we think

599
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:35,640
of circuses as like crazy and unhinged

600
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:38,460
they are among the most precise people I

601
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:40,500
know and the reason for that is because

602
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:43,440
if you are not precise you will die all

603
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,179
right very high stakes in data science

604
00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:47,039
if I'm not precise I'll just get an

605
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:49,380
error in my code right lower Stakes

606
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:52,620
uh this is a photo of me from the day

607
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:55,860
before lockdown in New York city so

608
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:57,720
literally I'm though like this is fine

609
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,760
guy right like we'll be fine we'll be

610
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,100
fine we're all going home uh when you do

611
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:03,960
fire we wanted to do fire here and not

612
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,640
surprisingly the hotel was like we don't

613
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,080
think no good

614
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,760
they're like we're not even thinking

615
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,620
about it do not do that okay

616
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:12,780
but so when you hold a whole bunch of

617
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:14,039
fire and by the way if you want to kind

618
00:22:14,039 --> 00:22:15,419
of picture what this looks like in real

619
00:22:15,419 --> 00:22:17,520
life think of any fire you've ever seen

620
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,799
it's just that right so whenever you're

621
00:22:19,799 --> 00:22:21,960
manipulating fire of course you have to

622
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,880
be very precise I do something called

623
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,679
body burning where you take the fire and

624
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:27,539
you move it up and down various parts of

625
00:22:27,539 --> 00:22:29,580
your body and I do fire eating where you

626
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:31,559
put the fire out in your mouth people

627
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:33,539
always ask if there's a trick sometimes

628
00:22:33,539 --> 00:22:35,340
people say is it shake fire it's like if

629
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:37,380
I could invent fake fire

630
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:38,940
that was this awesome do you think I'd

631
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:40,740
be here with all of you like

632
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:42,480
on my own Island that's what I'd be

633
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,980
doing right so it's not fake fire and

634
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:45,179
then other people say yeah do you put

635
00:22:45,179 --> 00:22:46,559
something in your mouth what am I

636
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:47,820
putting in my mouth that's disgusting no

637
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:50,220
so it really is just the fire and if you

638
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:52,080
get it at just the right angle and close

639
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,940
your mouth around it you don't set your

640
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:55,919
face on fire you have to be precise

641
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:57,720
that's the takeaway

642
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:00,360
you also need rigor now hats off to Dale

643
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:02,100
who spent approximately the better part

644
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:03,720
of the last six months trying to figure

645
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:06,900
out how to rig a trapeze here uh also

646
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:10,140
not uh uh not possible so I present to

647
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:12,780
you a picture of me on trapeze uh you

648
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:14,280
absolutely need rigor now I should have

649
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:15,419
chosen a picture of me doing something

650
00:23:15,419 --> 00:23:16,860
slightly more impressive than sitting

651
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:18,299
but if you're going to be high up and

652
00:23:18,299 --> 00:23:19,740
you're going to rely just on your own

653
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:22,320
strength to not fall to your death you

654
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,280
do need to make sure that you're

655
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:27,720
exercising and rather rigorously at that

656
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,940
of course you need discipline

657
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:33,419
now I'm the person on the uh bed of

658
00:23:33,419 --> 00:23:35,820
nails here and what I'm doing right now

659
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:38,039
in this picture is disappointing my

660
00:23:38,039 --> 00:23:41,400
parents all right that's what I'm doing

661
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,080
yes this I just wanted to share that

662
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:45,299
with all of you thank you for applauding

663
00:23:45,299 --> 00:23:46,799
that

664
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:49,559
but I'm also I am disappointed in my

665
00:23:49,559 --> 00:23:52,440
parents but I'm also meditating yes

666
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:54,480
thank you I am meditating

667
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,640
because the way you do bed of nails or

668
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,080
the way I was taught to do bed of Nails

669
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,000
by someone named bendy bendini he is a

670
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,220
contortionist uh and Sideshow artist in

671
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:03,539
London he's amazing you should look him

672
00:24:03,539 --> 00:24:05,520
up bendy bendini told me right before I

673
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,140
went on stage for my first ever bed of

674
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:08,700
nails act which might have been this one

675
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:11,100
he said when you're out there

676
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:13,020
just tell yourself

677
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:16,200
it's just pain

678
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,240
I was waiting for like a second half of

679
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,820
that like but it's not that bad and

680
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:22,860
you'll be fine like they're like but

681
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:25,020
that was it it's just pain and I don't

682
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:26,280
want to diminish pain and of course

683
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:27,780
there's pain that's physical and

684
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:28,860
emotional and all those things that's

685
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:30,179
really very very serious and it's

686
00:24:30,179 --> 00:24:31,260
something you should pay attention to in

687
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:33,360
the context of a bed of nails however

688
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,700
it's actually

689
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:37,020
it's just pain

690
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:39,840
it's not going to kill me probably and

691
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:42,360
and it's not gonna really affect me once

692
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:43,980
I get up off this bed of nails and that

693
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:45,120
has been one of the pieces of advice

694
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,799
that has stuck with me throughout my

695
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:48,059
whole life more than anything I ever

696
00:24:48,059 --> 00:24:49,620
learned in grad school or wherever else

697
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:51,720
anytime I'm in a situation that's tough

698
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,580
that's scary that's nervous I say

699
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:56,299
it's just pain

700
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:57,960
you might be wondering where the math

701
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:00,059
fits in I'll be pleased to tell you that

702
00:25:00,059 --> 00:25:02,039
in order to do circus you need to have

703
00:25:02,039 --> 00:25:04,200
pretty good spatial awareness and you

704
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,179
need to have an ability to move your

705
00:25:06,179 --> 00:25:07,620
body through space now that I've said

706
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:09,240
all of this I'm gonna mess this up but

707
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:11,159
here's my physics demonstration for you

708
00:25:11,159 --> 00:25:12,780
all

709
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:15,000
thank you so much thank you very much

710
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,500
if we have any physicists in the house

711
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:17,880
my apologies there's a little bit more

712
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:20,700
to physics than that but that's the idea

713
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:22,620
all right so what about all these other

714
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:25,080
uh adjectives over here on the data

715
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,880
science side of things

716
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,980
well of course we're going to need

717
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:30,840
creativity in data science we saw some

718
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:31,740
examples of the importance of

719
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:34,440
exploration interdisciplinary work and

720
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:36,000
I'm not going to offer solutions to any

721
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,320
of these problems because if I had them

722
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:39,179
I would have all the Nobel prizes there

723
00:25:39,179 --> 00:25:40,980
ever were but if we're going to address

724
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:44,039
all these complicated thorny difficult

725
00:25:44,039 --> 00:25:47,400
uh Timeless frankly issues out there in

726
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,140
the world we are going to have to get

727
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:50,880
creative by the way I realized after I

728
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,080
sent these slides in that the way I've

729
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,159
written it it makes it seem like health

730
00:25:53,159 --> 00:25:56,159
is a problem so we need to uh that

731
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:57,360
should have said illness or something

732
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:58,740
like that something less conflict and

733
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:00,240
less Health there's a there's a place in

734
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,679
New York City called the Center for

735
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:03,900
Children and poverty and that always

736
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:05,159
just rubs me the wrong way because it's

737
00:26:05,159 --> 00:26:07,559
like are we four children and poverty or

738
00:26:07,559 --> 00:26:09,539
are we against children and poverty all

739
00:26:09,539 --> 00:26:11,700
right no one you all work there what's

740
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:13,200
happening here all right

741
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,820
Center for Children poverty I love it I

742
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:16,440
love it all right and if we can't get

743
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:17,880
creative about these problems you know

744
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,260
what we've been doing obviously isn't

745
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:20,580
enough so we've got to think outside the

746
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:22,559
box if we can't get creative we've got

747
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:24,179
to figure out how to get to Mars fast

748
00:26:24,179 --> 00:26:25,919
all right we gotta go we can't just

749
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:27,360
leave it to a couple people right we

750
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,220
gotta all get involved

751
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:31,080
do data science we must also be bold

752
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,820
look at this person in a field being

753
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:33,659
bold

754
00:26:33,659 --> 00:26:37,620
this is the top search result if you do

755
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:40,620
a Google image search for happiness how

756
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:42,779
disappointing is that

757
00:26:42,779 --> 00:26:44,220
I don't think I've ever been in a field

758
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:45,779
like that in my life

759
00:26:45,779 --> 00:26:47,460
have I never been happy what is this

760
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:50,220
right one of the best ways Dale talked

761
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:51,659
about this in his opening keynote and I

762
00:26:51,659 --> 00:26:54,120
couldn't agree more measurement turning

763
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:56,220
the world into Data is the most

764
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:58,620
overlooked yet important step in the

765
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:01,020
data science process I think and I'm

766
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:03,600
particularly interested in turning

767
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,179
various abstract things like happiness

768
00:27:06,179 --> 00:27:09,419
belonging trust in government trust in

769
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:12,299
each other uh justice belief systems I

770
00:27:12,299 --> 00:27:13,980
am so interested in turning all of those

771
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:16,020
things into numbers and one of the best

772
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:18,600
ways to understand how far along we are

773
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,760
at doing that is to do a Google image

774
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:22,260
search for the thing that you are

775
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:23,820
looking for so there is good data out

776
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:25,860
there on happiness but we can always do

777
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:28,260
a lot more but until then I cannot tell

778
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:30,740
you how many women just floating around

779
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:32,700
there's gotta we gotta have a better

780
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:34,440
understanding of Happiness it's a field

781
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:37,320
again it's like a sunset they're in a

782
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:39,299
dress and then I realize that there's

783
00:27:39,299 --> 00:27:41,520
just like a lot of balloons

784
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,559
like a lot of the makeup artists had a

785
00:27:43,559 --> 00:27:44,580
single balloon I was like you're on the

786
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:46,200
right track like this all I know about

787
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,940
happiness is more balloons all right I

788
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:49,799
don't never held that many balloons in

789
00:27:49,799 --> 00:27:51,360
my own there is a beach we can all go

790
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,620
and fill it with balloons and see if it

791
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:54,900
makes us happy I don't know but it does

792
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:56,940
raise important questions

793
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:58,799
these are the kinds of questions that

794
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:00,840
matter that we need to be asking all

795
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:03,480
right are they necessary or sufficient I

796
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:06,059
have neither let's step it up

797
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:09,600
it's Relentless if I were uh somehow

798
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,740
knew how to get a hold of these balloons

799
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:12,240
I would like run on with them now but I

800
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,799
don't have them but everyone get

801
00:28:13,799 --> 00:28:15,539
balloons that's my big headline uh for

802
00:28:15,539 --> 00:28:17,400
this so okay we need to be bold so we

803
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,679
can improve on this situation all right

804
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:22,080
of course in science we need to be

805
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,640
flexible and to talk about that let's

806
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:26,580
turn to none other than shout it out

807
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:29,220
Carl said again looking very Mr Rogers

808
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:31,740
here but I love it either way Carl Sagan

809
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:35,039
reminds us that modern science has been

810
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:37,320
a voyage into the unknown with a lesson

811
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:39,600
in humility waiting at every step it's

812
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,159
like Einstein's saying that if we knew

813
00:28:41,159 --> 00:28:42,720
what we were doing it wouldn't be

814
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:43,980
research of course we have to be

815
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:46,620
flexible science gets stuck when we get

816
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:48,179
obsessed with our own theories when

817
00:28:48,179 --> 00:28:49,740
we're unwilling to understand counter

818
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:50,820
arguments when we're unwilling as Adam

819
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:53,159
Grant says to rethink what we think we

820
00:28:53,159 --> 00:28:55,080
know science this is the engine of

821
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:57,600
Science of course we need flexibility

822
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,220
now you're probably wondering what I've

823
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:01,220
got for you in the costumes Department

824
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:03,840
this is a more controversial take it

825
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,460
hasn't taken off in my field of data

826
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:08,159
science I will say but I would like to

827
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:11,039
assert that data science and really that

828
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:13,320
stem I'm sure you everything that you

829
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:15,720
all are up to would be vastly improved

830
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:19,380
if we all wore costumes and and to

831
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:22,200
support my claim I will offer a costume

832
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:24,960
demonstration now uh this is going to be

833
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:27,419
awkward and weird and uh you're all

834
00:29:27,419 --> 00:29:28,799
going to be uncomfortable but don't

835
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:30,779
worry you're not as uncomfortable as I

836
00:29:30,779 --> 00:29:32,580
am all right

837
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:34,260
you know like the dream I was thinking

838
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:35,340
about this this morning when you're like

839
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:36,960
oh I showed up at school without my

840
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,700
clothes on it's like oh I'm about to go

841
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:40,320
do that this is

842
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,480
this is horrible uh

843
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:45,960
or here we go

844
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:48,240
uh you know not wearing any clothes it's

845
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,980
like I'll picture myself don't worry all

846
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:53,059
right this is I got it

847
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:57,740
straight I'll make it weird

848
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:00,980
but don't

849
00:30:02,039 --> 00:30:04,500
don't tear away clothes is what I need

850
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:07,080
that would be cool there we go

851
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:10,639
all right all right

852
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:13,260
the important thing is speed all right

853
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:15,659
you want to make sure it's very fast and

854
00:30:15,659 --> 00:30:17,279
no one is just you're not you're not in

855
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:18,899
a room with a thousand people looking at

856
00:30:18,899 --> 00:30:21,739
you are you Andrea

857
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:26,179
a thousand very serious people

858
00:30:27,059 --> 00:30:31,460
my parents are disappointed again

859
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:36,720
I I thought that would be faster here we

860
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,779
go

861
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:42,539
[Applause]

862
00:30:42,539 --> 00:30:44,860
thank you so much

863
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:49,500
[Applause]

864
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:51,659
the cameras are useful for my hair so

865
00:30:51,659 --> 00:30:54,179
had I done my entire presentation I

866
00:30:54,179 --> 00:30:55,500
wasn't going to and I'm not going to do

867
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:57,720
it had I done my entire presentation in

868
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,279
this costume I think we all would have

869
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:00,960
had more fun again don't make it weird

870
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,700
but if we're trying to get more people

871
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:04,620
into data science this sort of thing

872
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:06,720
might help I'm just saying all right I'm

873
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,100
just saying

874
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:09,659
all right

875
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:12,179
so so costumes maybe tomorrow everyone

876
00:31:12,179 --> 00:31:13,559
comes in costume whatever you want all

877
00:31:13,559 --> 00:31:15,299
right there we go

878
00:31:15,299 --> 00:31:17,039
so you might all be wondering at this

879
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:19,320
stage Andrea

880
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:21,840
uh not that part you might all be

881
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,279
wondering is it an art and science yes

882
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:24,960
it is but you also might be wondering

883
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:27,299
where does stand up fit into all of this

884
00:31:27,299 --> 00:31:29,520
nothing that we've seen seems to have

885
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:31,260
anything to do with any of the stand-up

886
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:33,179
stuff that I've seen

887
00:31:33,179 --> 00:31:35,880
right uh well I will tell you when I

888
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,260
come to speak at conferences like this

889
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:40,200
especially one with such smart important

890
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,179
people doing smart important things and

891
00:31:42,179 --> 00:31:44,220
it's a field I don't know about OT ICS I

892
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:45,600
don't know what that means right I get

893
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:48,480
very scared and very nervous and then

894
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,860
I'm still scared I'm still nervous but

895
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:52,020
the reason I kind of got through it and

896
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:53,700
showed up here today is because I

897
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:55,860
remember that I do stand-up comedy in

898
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:58,320
Greenwich Village in New York City

899
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,840
which on a Saturday night at one in the

900
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:03,120
morning sounds like this

901
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:05,159
even somehow in The Comedy Room all

902
00:32:05,159 --> 00:32:07,159
right there's just parties going on

903
00:32:07,159 --> 00:32:10,500
there's women screaming and I'm trying

904
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:12,059
to say oh what's the deal with the

905
00:32:12,059 --> 00:32:15,960
subway and it's just an entire group of

906
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:18,059
girls who are in the front row and

907
00:32:18,059 --> 00:32:19,559
they're at a bachelorette party and they

908
00:32:19,559 --> 00:32:21,240
do not know that they are at a comedy

909
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:23,640
show all right and they're laughing but

910
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,440
they're not laughing at me they're not

911
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,240
laughing with me They're laughing at

912
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:28,320
stuff on their phone that they're

913
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:29,580
passing around and talking to each other

914
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:32,279
so if I can perform at one in the

915
00:32:32,279 --> 00:32:33,899
morning for a bachelorette party from

916
00:32:33,899 --> 00:32:36,120
Tucson I can show up today all right

917
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:38,418
that's

918
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:47,580
I'm not sure if I just offended Tucson I

919
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:49,140
may have but that's all right

920
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:50,880
so so okay

921
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,860
I'm just just running out of time in

922
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:54,059
fact I'm past time but I'm gonna get out

923
00:32:54,059 --> 00:32:56,100
of here uh but I think before I go I've

924
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:58,919
thrown a lot out here so I thought uh

925
00:32:58,919 --> 00:33:01,320
perhaps it might be worth a quick review

926
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:03,000
shall we review

927
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,460
yes if you said no I'd be all right just

928
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:07,380
go see you on the beach with the

929
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:10,279
balloons all right let's review
