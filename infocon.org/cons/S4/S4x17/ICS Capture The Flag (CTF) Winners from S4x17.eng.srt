1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:08,160
[Music]

2
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,920
for the past two and a half days teams

3
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:12,600
have been working hard to hack and

4
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:15,110
secure ICS and the s4 capture-the-flag

5
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:17,550
competition here to announce and

6
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:19,860
interview the winners is the man who put

7
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:23,250
the CTF together Reed Whiteman Reed is a

8
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:25,169
digital bond alum and currently is the

9
00:00:25,169 --> 00:00:28,259
founder and CEO of Revit security

10
00:00:28,259 --> 00:00:30,840
please welcome Reed Whiteman to the s4

11
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:39,630
main stage yeah so we ran the s4 CTF

12
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:43,200
last year and this year and this year we

13
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,290
expanded it quite a bit so first off I'd

14
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:48,210
like to thank the sponsors of the CTF

15
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:49,620
without them this wouldn't have been

16
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:52,230
possible oh s I so often been sponsoring

17
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:54,990
us for a few years now and not only that

18
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:56,580
but they love to put their equipment in

19
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:59,850
harm's way so they put PI servers a

20
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:02,100
couple of them on the CTF Network and

21
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:04,470
gave people some clues as to how to hack

22
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:06,600
into their servers so my hat's off to

23
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,720
them always rata flow is a sponsor as

24
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,640
well as here they make security products

25
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,049
and they also put their security

26
00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:15,810
products in harm's way and had made some

27
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:17,729
really neat city lighting simulation

28
00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:21,719
flags and then RSA also sponsored us and

29
00:01:21,719 --> 00:01:23,729
ran some of their aging software on our

30
00:01:23,729 --> 00:01:25,409
network and they were even able to

31
00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:27,539
detect people doing some attacks that we

32
00:01:27,539 --> 00:01:29,520
hadn't anticipated if you haven't

33
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,079
checked these guys out I would I would

34
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:32,969
roll up to the CTF area I hope they're

35
00:01:32,969 --> 00:01:35,490
still there but you know talk to these

36
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:37,759
folks and chat with them about security

37
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:42,179
so our network this year was a quite a

38
00:01:42,179 --> 00:01:44,850
bit expanded from last year's this year

39
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:47,549
we had 43 flags we had 17 contributed

40
00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:50,999
from OSI soft one from rata flow we had

41
00:01:50,999 --> 00:01:53,189
a whole bunch of disparate challenges

42
00:01:53,189 --> 00:01:55,799
and the real goal of the CTF this year

43
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:57,420
was players were breaking into a

44
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:59,700
fictitious company called killer robots

45
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:02,459
incorporated so in order to do that they

46
00:02:02,459 --> 00:02:04,709
have to do a variety of missions from

47
00:02:04,709 --> 00:02:07,799
you know reconnaissance to exploitation

48
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:09,810
and they even had to do forensic

49
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:12,690
analysis of some other exploits so we

50
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:15,209
had a pretty large variety of challenges

51
00:02:15,209 --> 00:02:17,550
and we had quite a few field devices you

52
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:18,780
won't be able to see this network

53
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:20,790
diagram very well but this is this is a

54
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:21,470
big

55
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:23,420
take structure of what our CTF network

56
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:26,960
looked like our players were primarily

57
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:30,710
up on this this wireless network up here

58
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:32,180
and they were attacking all of the

59
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:35,210
systems that were associated with this

60
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:37,790
this company we simulated everything

61
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:39,620
from a corporate domain controller and

62
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:43,400
email server to a web server to to you

63
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:46,220
know everything from a control land to

64
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:50,150
PLC field devices so it was hopefully

65
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:52,130
pretty interesting this is a graph

66
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:54,709
showing what teams were up to throughout

67
00:02:54,709 --> 00:02:56,870
the challenge when they were solving

68
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:59,030
challenges is kind of interesting to us

69
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:01,070
because in in prior years we shut down

70
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:02,959
the scoreboard at night this year we

71
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:04,820
decided to leave the scoreboard up so

72
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:06,380
that players could still work on these

73
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:08,330
forensic analysis challenges and things

74
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:11,090
at night and they did teams were up

75
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:12,890
until you know 12:00 or 1:00 o'clock in

76
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:14,570
the morning solving challenges and

77
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:19,060
submitting flags to our scoring system

78
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:21,950
so right there were a lot of a lot of

79
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:24,890
things on the network in total we had 19

80
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:27,200
teams register 14 of them scored at

81
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,750
least one flag teams were working all

82
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:31,610
hours of the day I was a little bit

83
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:33,380
surprised at how light the network

84
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:34,910
traffic was we actually did through

85
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:36,890
traffic captures of the network this

86
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:39,470
year and we only had about two gigabytes

87
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:41,030
of network traffic capturing well we

88
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:43,160
were only capturing traffic that crossed

89
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,200
Network boundaries so it would have to

90
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,880
be network traffic crossing you know

91
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:50,000
corporate to DMZ or DMZ to control or so

92
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,370
forth but that it does include all of

93
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:54,650
the normal ICS network traffic you know

94
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:56,930
OPC servers polling field devices and

95
00:03:56,930 --> 00:03:59,150
other things pulling those OPC servers

96
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:01,220
and that sort of thing but to me this is

97
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:02,570
kind of an interesting lesson just

98
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:03,890
because you know here it is we're

99
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:06,230
simulating a process control system and

100
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:07,880
it's not a whole lot of traffic going on

101
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:10,040
so to me that's kind of interesting and

102
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,810
it says something beneficial about ICS

103
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:13,489
monitoring there's not as much data as

104
00:04:13,489 --> 00:04:16,430
you think out there so our top five

105
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:19,040
teams were old glory robot insurance

106
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:23,570
that was mostly Cisco Talos guys we had

107
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:26,270
a team JL which was a folks from SPAWAR

108
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:28,880
I used to work for SPAWAR so definitely

109
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,370
a fan of them and then we had two two

110
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:33,140
individuals that were ran their own

111
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:34,840
teams of one that were also

112
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,280
the top five that's Curtis Schilling

113
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:38,080
from ABB and Blake Johnson and I

114
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,550
actually didn't catch for Blake Johnson

115
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:43,180
works so these are some pictures of the

116
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:44,979
CTF area if you haven't checked it out

117
00:04:44,979 --> 00:04:46,750
we'll we'll probably start tearing it

118
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:49,330
down around 1:00 or 1:30 but you might

119
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:50,710
want to go and take a look at it because

120
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:53,139
we have a lot of interesting stuff this

121
00:04:53,139 --> 00:04:54,820
is one of the lock pick challenges that

122
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:57,669
we had we also had this motor which was

123
00:04:57,669 --> 00:05:00,280
kind of fun this was a challenge where

124
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:02,979
people had to solve solve what the

125
00:05:02,979 --> 00:05:04,690
critical speed of this motors drive

126
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:06,580
shaft was so we could actually operate

127
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:08,770
this thing and let it you know run some

128
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:11,220
damage on the motors bearings for a bit

129
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:13,570
so lots of people like seeing that

130
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:15,310
because it makes lots of noise

131
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:17,380
you know these lots of teams were

132
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:19,330
hanging around in the area working

133
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:21,610
really hard on challenges like all the

134
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:24,490
time so we surprised that people come to

135
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:27,010
s4 and then spend all of their time in

136
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:29,710
the CTF area staring at a laptop screen

137
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:31,750
it's it's kind of really it's really fun

138
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:33,550
to me to watch that because I'm like hey

139
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:35,229
you should go watch some talks too but

140
00:05:35,229 --> 00:05:37,240
hey I'm stuck up there so I guess they

141
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,070
can be stuck up with her with me

142
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:41,410
so the winner this year was we hacked

143
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:43,090
for booze there are a bunch of booze

144
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:45,130
Allen Hamilton guys and I guess come on

145
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:47,039
out guys

146
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:50,220
so yeah congratulations to these folks

147
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:55,419
yeah yeah so these guys were we're up

148
00:05:55,419 --> 00:05:57,250
these were the team that were up all

149
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:59,770
night long solving flags and they they

150
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:00,970
solved a lot of really hard ones

151
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:03,099
including some some pretty crazy reverse

152
00:06:03,099 --> 00:06:05,380
engineering flags but you guys just kind

153
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:07,240
of introduce yourselves say say you know

154
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:10,240
who you are I know you probably don't

155
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,479
want to say much more than that but sure

156
00:06:13,479 --> 00:06:15,789
so I'm so I'm Kyle Miller I'm obviously

157
00:06:15,789 --> 00:06:17,380
with Booz Allen Hamilton I'm with a

158
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:18,880
strategic innovation group and my

159
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,979
backgrounds in industrial cyber so I was

160
00:06:20,979 --> 00:06:22,599
really just kind of a industrial guy

161
00:06:22,599 --> 00:06:24,550
helping out our real hackers that are

162
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:27,430
sitting next to me yeah my name is Tim

163
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:29,289
nari I'm a penetration tester and

164
00:06:29,289 --> 00:06:30,700
security researcher without it with a

165
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:32,860
Booz Allen's dark labs and I do not have

166
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:35,169
an ICS background but it was fun to

167
00:06:35,169 --> 00:06:38,740
learn I'm Tom Georgian I'm also with

168
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:40,360
Booz Allen stock labs and have a

169
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,620
background and a little bit of

170
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:43,210
everything mostly mobile application

171
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:46,659
security and pen testing cool so did you

172
00:06:46,659 --> 00:06:48,610
guys have like any favorite flags

173
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:52,689
you really enjoyed working on so I think

174
00:06:52,689 --> 00:06:53,979
my favorite challenge was probably the

175
00:06:53,979 --> 00:06:55,870
software-defined radio challenge there

176
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:57,669
was a challenge where you had to tune

177
00:06:57,669 --> 00:07:00,939
the SDR into the right frequency and you

178
00:07:00,939 --> 00:07:03,159
could actually pull pager messages right

179
00:07:03,159 --> 00:07:05,289
out of the air and the pager messages

180
00:07:05,289 --> 00:07:06,729
had some encryption on them so you had

181
00:07:06,729 --> 00:07:08,830
to figure out the key in order to

182
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:10,569
decrypt it properly so it was sort of a

183
00:07:10,569 --> 00:07:12,460
two-step process and it was my first

184
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:13,379
time playing around with

185
00:07:13,379 --> 00:07:16,180
software-defined radio but I found a few

186
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:18,310
tutorials online and was able to tune

187
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:22,840
into it and pull the messages so yeah my

188
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:23,889
favorite challenge was one of the

189
00:07:23,889 --> 00:07:25,930
reverse engineering ones so we were

190
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:27,909
provided with a network pcap file that

191
00:07:27,909 --> 00:07:30,069
had a PI server explicit login

192
00:07:30,069 --> 00:07:32,830
authentication so we saw a username and

193
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:34,689
an encrypted password and we were also

194
00:07:34,689 --> 00:07:36,759
given this little binary executable

195
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:39,909
which showed how the encryption was done

196
00:07:39,909 --> 00:07:41,080
and we had to do some reverse

197
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:43,659
engineering on that and I kind of found

198
00:07:43,659 --> 00:07:45,490
a pattern and how it was generating that

199
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:46,599
and I ended up writing a brute-force

200
00:07:46,599 --> 00:07:48,669
script and was able to recover the

201
00:07:48,669 --> 00:07:50,439
password which opened up quite a few

202
00:07:50,439 --> 00:07:52,090
challenges for us then on the the PI

203
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:56,710
section of the CTF yeah I think being

204
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:58,629
more on the industrial side my favorite

205
00:07:58,629 --> 00:08:00,610
challenges were on the actual plc

206
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:01,900
challenges there was one where we had to

207
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:04,240
manipulate some ladder logic to have a

208
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,099
couple physical lights that were there

209
00:08:06,099 --> 00:08:08,860
with an HMI show that the you know turn

210
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:10,419
off the light while the HMI was still

211
00:08:10,419 --> 00:08:12,129
showing that the lights were on and not

212
00:08:12,129 --> 00:08:14,110
setting off the alarms to uh to alert

213
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:15,729
the other plc that that was happening so

214
00:08:15,729 --> 00:08:17,080
it's always fun for me and I think it's

215
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,189
eye-opening to a lot of people when they

216
00:08:18,189 --> 00:08:20,110
see that hey you know what you're

217
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:21,729
looking at on the HMI is maybe not

218
00:08:21,729 --> 00:08:25,479
always what's actually happen so you

219
00:08:25,479 --> 00:08:27,039
know next year obviously we'll be

220
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:28,839
running a CTF again or at least I hope

221
00:08:28,839 --> 00:08:30,639
we will would you have any advice for

222
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:32,349
teams that are playing next year and how

223
00:08:32,349 --> 00:08:35,589
they might take you guys down sure so

224
00:08:35,589 --> 00:08:37,299
this year you guys ended up tweeting

225
00:08:37,299 --> 00:08:39,490
quite a few hints which provided a lot

226
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:41,198
of insight into the network so we had an

227
00:08:41,198 --> 00:08:42,669
idea of what kind of things to research

228
00:08:42,669 --> 00:08:44,740
ahead of time and that was definitely

229
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:50,350
helpful sure I really enjoyed in the CTF

230
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:51,579
feather was sort of like an Arg

231
00:08:51,579 --> 00:08:53,380
alternate reality game component to it

232
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:54,850
and we actually had a fake Twitter

233
00:08:54,850 --> 00:08:56,829
account for the killer robot sink so we

234
00:08:56,829 --> 00:08:58,449
were monitoring that and from that you

235
00:08:58,449 --> 00:08:59,870
could figure out

236
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:02,120
some of the challenges sort of in

237
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,560
advance if you were looking carefully at

238
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:06,260
things and the best way to prepare for

239
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:08,630
CDF's mostly is to just play lots of

240
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:12,680
CDF's Tim and I compete in CTF C around

241
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:16,430
and the practice helps a lot so do you

242
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:18,710
have any favorites ETFs that you you

243
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:21,410
really enjoy playing each year I really

244
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:23,270
enjoy the seesaw CTF that comes around

245
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:26,510
it's based out of NYU and it's a pretty

246
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:28,280
big online CTF with a variety of

247
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:33,680
challenges okay so do you guys have any

248
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,330
grapes for me about things that went

249
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:37,250
badly on the network this is it this is

250
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:39,050
your chance to excoriate me on the

251
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:41,660
public stage I mean all in all things

252
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:43,310
are pretty good it was an impressive

253
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:45,110
amount of infrastructure behind it and

254
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:46,910
to have so few kind of issues that's

255
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:48,650
actually a compliment to you guys in the

256
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:49,700
organizers and how much they put

257
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:50,240
together

258
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,310
the biggest issue we had was the back

259
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:54,200
net challenges because I guess there was

260
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,430
a firewall rule that was kind of

261
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:57,890
blocking access so it wasn't we weren't

262
00:09:57,890 --> 00:09:59,180
sure if we weren't doing it right or if

263
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:01,220
we were supposed to kind of pivot into

264
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:02,900
another machine before we could get that

265
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:05,780
network but I mean today once all that

266
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:07,010
was resolved we were able to get those

267
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:09,230
flags pretty quickly so yeah did you

268
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:11,060
actually solve the hardest back net

269
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:13,790
challenge I didn't think so

270
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:15,410
so there were a few challenges in there

271
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:16,700
that we didn't expect people to solve

272
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:17,870
and one of them was a back that

273
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:19,040
challenge where there was a read-only

274
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,560
firewall in front of an HVAC system so

275
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:24,050
we didn't expect people to solve it but

276
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:25,520
we thought if somebody did that would be

277
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,750
pretty amazing it would give them lots

278
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:30,200
of points and some praise we're glad you

279
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:33,080
didn't yeah I think we look at that one

280
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,790
for a few minutes and tried a couple

281
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:36,590
things and I think we decided it wasn't

282
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:41,030
worth our time this morning at least all

283
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:42,860
right well one more hand for the Booz

284
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:45,200
Allen Hamilton team they they're the

285
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,750
winners of a black badge so they get big

286
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:50,480
at the free entry to s4 so I hope that

287
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,610
we'll see them back and hopefully

288
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:54,860
they'll be working at one o'clock in the

289
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:56,540
morning on the next Seath yeah but we'll

290
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:58,370
see thanks so much guys really

291
00:10:58,370 --> 00:11:01,360
appreciate you playing yeah

292
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,459
you
