[Music]

2
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:10,230
yes four-stage Steve thank you so we are

3
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:13,410
here to talk about Exxon Mobil's open

4
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:16,109
process automation program and I know a

5
00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:18,029
lot of the audience is familiar with it

6
00:00:18,029 --> 00:00:20,100
but probably a good place to start so

7
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:22,289
everyone's on the same page is just you

8
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:24,000
know give them a you know 3-minute

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,650
overview on what it is and what you're

10
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:28,230
trying to achieve yeah okay great thanks

11
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:28,529
Dale

12
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:30,779
so the programs are going on for a few

13
00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:33,260
years so I'll do my best to convince

14
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:35,219
Anderson to stop getting it it's going

15
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:37,350
to be a challenge so that so the program

16
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:39,510
started I guess a while back eczema will

17
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:41,309
realize we have a significant percentage

18
00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:43,260
of refinery and chemical plant control

19
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:46,760
systems that are facing obsolescence so

20
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:49,050
we had a chief engineer of process

21
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:50,430
control and automation downbar to

22
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:53,270
Jacques he led a program back in 2010

23
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:55,559
related to this area of replacement and

24
00:00:55,559 --> 00:00:57,449
he was challenged by the management of

25
00:00:57,449 --> 00:00:59,730
ExxonMobil and they said listen if

26
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:00,449
you're going to go through the trouble

27
00:01:00,449 --> 00:01:02,520
to replace all these systems can you

28
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,870
place them with something it makes us

29
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:06,869
more competitive and that I think was

30
00:01:06,869 --> 00:01:09,030
the genesis of this entire program now I

31
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:12,570
got involved in 2012 but I was working

32
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:15,630
on other things around 2013 I put

33
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:17,159
together a skunkworks team I got some

34
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:19,140
very clever people inside ExxonMobil I

35
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:21,060
got some outside an industry consultants

36
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:25,830
and we we focused in on really what are

37
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:27,570
the what are the business problems and

38
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:29,369
we thought from that we would be able to

39
00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:30,930
develop the functional characteristics

40
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:32,220
of the system we want to see and then

41
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:36,829
after that would probably the form so we

42
00:01:36,829 --> 00:01:39,630
we really appreciated the good things

43
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:41,070
about the system it's reliable its

44
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:42,600
deterministic it does what it's supposed

45
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,670
to do serve the industry very well but

46
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:45,840
there are things that really bothered us

47
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:50,159
so some examples the wholesale

48
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:51,869
replacement cost was just exorbitant

49
00:01:51,869 --> 00:01:54,299
very expensive it's sort of like someone

50
00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:55,320
coming to your office from the IT

51
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,450
organization saying Gail here's a new

52
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:59,490
laptop it's a thousand times more

53
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:02,399
powerful but there's a catch you have to

54
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:04,320
rewrite all your powerpoints your Excel

55
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,090
spreadsheets your Word documents and

56
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:07,590
from scratch and they're going to look

57
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:08,818
exactly the same okay

58
00:02:08,818 --> 00:02:10,288
that's the world we live in there was

59
00:02:10,288 --> 00:02:11,580
the integration of third-party

60
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:12,930
components

61
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:15,030
that was problematic as well for us so

62
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:17,879
no one gets a Verizon cell phone plan

63
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:19,680
expecting that they can't talk to

64
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,629
someone on the AT&T t-mobile Sprint

65
00:02:21,629 --> 00:02:22,920
networks but that's the nature of

66
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:25,049
proprietary protocols then of course

67
00:02:25,049 --> 00:02:27,540
there's a security side which is somehow

68
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:29,549
the guise and designing systems in the

69
00:02:29,549 --> 00:02:32,549
70s didn't see the internet coming so we

70
00:02:32,549 --> 00:02:34,620
have this sort of bolted on approach to

71
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:36,120
protect ourselves rather than it being

72
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,129
intrinsic and we we think there's a an

73
00:02:38,129 --> 00:02:41,129
opportunity cost for that so so we

74
00:02:41,129 --> 00:02:42,569
needed a vision we put a vision together

75
00:02:42,569 --> 00:02:45,780
around 2014 or so and this was an open

76
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:48,329
and secure platform and interoperable

77
00:02:48,329 --> 00:02:51,569
portable extensible reliable scalable

78
00:02:51,569 --> 00:02:53,879
and we had some constraints we said

79
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:57,959
listen we we want to make sure it's not

80
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:02,400
an exxon mobil only project so it had to

81
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,200
be commercially available on the open

82
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,480
market had to be applicable to

83
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,150
greenfield in brownfield facilities and

84
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:11,549
and also we didn't want to compromise or

85
00:03:11,549 --> 00:03:13,950
lose any of the reliability or

86
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:15,599
determinism we have in today's systems

87
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,459
right so we took the idea we took this

88
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:19,079
vision we shopped it around to the dcs

89
00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:22,500
suppliers and we sort of knew what kind

90
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,449
of reaction we'd get but I can sum it up

91
00:03:24,449 --> 00:03:26,400
like this they said but we love

92
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,609
everything about open process automation

93
00:03:28,609 --> 00:03:33,540
except the open bit and we accepted that

94
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:35,250
that was you know that was

95
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:37,229
understandable yeah we're challenging a

96
00:03:37,229 --> 00:03:38,819
business model that works well serve

97
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:40,319
them well I was it was relatively

98
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:42,150
uncomfortable so that's the point in

99
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:43,379
which we said listen we have to go

100
00:03:43,379 --> 00:03:46,259
outside of Industry to really affect

101
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:48,569
this change and catalyze a shift and in

102
00:03:48,569 --> 00:03:51,629
a business model so we approached

103
00:03:51,629 --> 00:03:55,680
Lockheed Martin and we like Lockheed for

104
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,909
a couple of reasons one is there's an

105
00:03:56,909 --> 00:03:58,560
undeniable connection between control

106
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,280
systems and avionics platforms so both

107
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,109
an HMIS both have control surfaces and

108
00:04:04,109 --> 00:04:06,720
control valves and Lockheed also led

109
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,009
this kind of transformation from

110
00:04:08,009 --> 00:04:10,349
stovepipe proprietary systems to open

111
00:04:10,349 --> 00:04:11,669
interoperable ones and we thought we

112
00:04:11,669 --> 00:04:15,540
could leverage that so so we really in

113
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:17,130
the last just to some sum it up my three

114
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:20,488
it's a three minute answer right is that

115
00:04:20,488 --> 00:04:22,290
we've been really working on we want to

116
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:24,180
build a prototype next year or this year

117
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:26,190
sorry working on that last year an OPA

118
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:29,130
prototype in a lab and we also want to

119
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:31,320
kind of continue this effort of building

120
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,540
a Coalition of the Willing and that

121
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:36,180
pretty much brings us up to today okay

122
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:39,510
Edie so you know I think I became aware

123
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:42,630
of it about a year ago when ExxonMobil

124
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:45,090
went public with this and started to

125
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:47,940
bring other people in so you've been out

126
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:51,960
in the public for about a year what has

127
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,670
been the what would you say is your

128
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:57,000
biggest success in that first year yeah

129
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,180
so that that's easy so the the OPA forum

130
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:02,540
the open process automation forum is

131
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:05,370
without a doubt our single most

132
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:07,230
important metric and our biggest success

133
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:10,110
so the open group is helping us in this

134
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:11,430
effort they facilitate the development

135
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:14,310
of standards to the custodians of the

136
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:16,830
UNIX standard on the face standard as

137
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:19,980
well so in just a matter of several

138
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:21,360
months I mean I think less than four

139
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,030
months we have 37 member companies that

140
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:26,700
have joined eight of them are users five

141
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:29,280
our major DCs suppliers and we're

142
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,980
focusing in on well on the pain points

143
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:33,690
you know we're finding out that there's

144
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:35,160
a lot in common amongst industry and

145
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,390
we're not just talking about chemical

146
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:38,730
oil and gas but pulp and paper food and

147
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:40,740
beverage pharmaceutical mining in metal

148
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,540
we've got a lot of interest from broad

149
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:44,940
industries as well as suppliers and end

150
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:47,730
up the focus now is what's the win-win

151
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:49,230
scenario of the business model that

152
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:51,330
everyone feels comfortable with that

153
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:53,220
there's a pathway to profitability and

154
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:55,560
before putting end to any pen to paper

155
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:58,050
the objective is to make sure everyone's

156
00:05:58,050 --> 00:05:59,550
comfortable with that we have a level

157
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:01,710
playing field and then we'll start to

158
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:04,919
work on the standards so I think that's

159
00:06:04,919 --> 00:06:08,790
a fair first year measure but it's a

160
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:10,919
little bit we have these efforts in

161
00:06:10,919 --> 00:06:13,830
industry like cyber storm and logic and

162
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:16,560
things where they almost from the start

163
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,180
they're viewed as successes because

164
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:20,160
people talked who weren't talking to

165
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,050
each other talk to each other and that

166
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:23,820
was what they were really trying to

167
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:26,850
achieve and obviously that was important

168
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:28,620
to kick this thing off and create this

169
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:31,169
but what are you looking at for measures

170
00:06:31,169 --> 00:06:33,750
in your two or three

171
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,130
you know or four how do you determine

172
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:37,410
whether this effort has succeeded or not

173
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:38,190
yeah

174
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:40,050
so I mean it really ties back into the

175
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:41,520
form I think I would look at there could

176
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,380
be a hundred metrics on this program I

177
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:46,290
think a single most important one is the

178
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:48,600
the reaction of the users the suppliers

179
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,040
and the systems integrators to the

180
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:53,970
program I can't tell you the next set of

181
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:55,680
metrics are still related to that but to

182
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,380
give an example we had an industry day

183
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:01,740
for suppliers in January last year

184
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:03,840
I'm Bethesda Maryland at the Lockheed

185
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,230
Martin facilities and it was it was I

186
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:08,760
think one of the worst snow days in that

187
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:12,060
area in year and everything was snowed

188
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:13,350
in nearly everything was shut down and

189
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:16,140
still we had 30 to 40 companies come 60

190
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:18,840
some people at 10 we had an industry day

191
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:21,600
for users in Houston we had 50 attendees

192
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,070
there we've had hundreds of folks dial

193
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:26,430
into our webinars and and of course you

194
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:28,140
know the Opa Opa forum and conferences

195
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:30,150
like this and the kind of interaction

196
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:32,250
with other folks so what we're getting a

197
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:36,419
result and on our our success based on

198
00:07:36,419 --> 00:07:38,190
really the interaction those key groups

199
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:41,580
and you mentioned I think a few minutes

200
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:42,870
ago that there was going to be a

201
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:45,960
prototype in a lab at some point I would

202
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,280
think that would be a pretty big

203
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,050
milestone very wouldn't when you

204
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:51,330
actually have components from would this

205
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:52,260
be components from different

206
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:54,860
manufacturers with different vendors

207
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:57,720
working together to create a dcs of some

208
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:00,330
sort or what is does that prototype have

209
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:02,669
any definition around it yet yes so

210
00:08:02,669 --> 00:08:05,130
we've been very specific we want to test

211
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:08,780
interoperability portability reliability

212
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:11,910
flexibility we can't test everything so

213
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:14,340
we sent an RFP out in December and went

214
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:16,050
out to all the suppliers and we're

215
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:17,910
looking forward to responses in February

216
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:20,669
and we'll try to start to assemble a

217
00:08:20,669 --> 00:08:22,380
system will put wrappers around it to

218
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:23,430
create the interoperability

219
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:25,169
characteristic we want Lockheed will

220
00:08:25,169 --> 00:08:27,479
lead this effort and we'll try to get

221
00:08:27,479 --> 00:08:29,280
that prototype built and done and test

222
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,219
these quality attributes of the open

223
00:08:32,219 --> 00:08:35,549
system by the end of this year and when

224
00:08:35,549 --> 00:08:38,130
you talk about this forum or this OPA

225
00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:41,219
forum are the mainly vendors or have

226
00:08:41,219 --> 00:08:45,750
other asset owners come in and put their

227
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,600
purchasing power behind

228
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,160
potential is potential purchasing power

229
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,640
behind this effort so we have eight

230
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,980
end-user companies manufacturers there

231
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:58,950
are eight of the 37 it's not good enough

232
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:01,230
for us we would like to we like to

233
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:02,640
roughly triple that number we like to

234
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,130
see into the 20s and we think we'll be

235
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:08,370
successful I think there's just there's

236
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:09,990
a little bit of a lag in getting all the

237
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:11,520
user companies to join in there's still

238
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:14,190
some other majors that chemical oil and

239
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:15,660
gas integrated then we know we know

240
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:16,650
we're going to join but they just

241
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:20,670
haven't yet so you've been and I didn't

242
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:21,990
realize this till we talked you've been

243
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:24,840
at this you know for six or seven years

244
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:28,950
now but one year public and more people

245
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:32,640
involved what have you learned what went

246
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,100
maybe differently that you plan that you

247
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:37,980
had to adjust your approach or your plan

248
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:40,530
in the last year or so or has it all

249
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:43,440
been perfect that the challenges in this

250
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,220
area are partly technical but a big

251
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:50,010
chunk of it is commercial and that's

252
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:51,540
very different than a traditional you

253
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:53,160
know breakthrough Rd program where

254
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,360
there's usually something very

255
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,710
complicated on the table it's

256
00:09:55,710 --> 00:10:00,170
technically related I think in terms of

257
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:04,260
learnings it's been a real eye-opening

258
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:05,850
it's this isn't a Eureka moment but over

259
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:07,110
the course of time we sort of learned

260
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:09,330
that everything that we want to do has

261
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:10,830
already been done most of its been done

262
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:13,170
by adjacent industries so you take a

263
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:16,560
look at telecom for example I think I'm

264
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:17,820
guessing that they got very tired of

265
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:19,230
getting guys and pickup trucks to drive

266
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:20,730
out to the cellphone towers and change

267
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:22,440
out the accelerators and the switches

268
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,630
and and whatnot makes it look we need to

269
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:25,920
start virtualizing some of this

270
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,170
technology but it has to be real-time it

271
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:30,510
has to be highly available and it turns

272
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:31,470
out there commercially available

273
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:34,320
solutions today for virtualization of

274
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,520
those components plus the

275
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,500
software-defined networking and have the

276
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,840
same availability requirements as an

277
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:42,180
industrial control system albeit for

278
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:44,400
different reasons but we don't care like

279
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:47,120
five-nines availability is five nights

280
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:52,110
so it's really surprising to see that

281
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:53,970
the IT industry as well the sort of

282
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:55,500
hardware root of trust concepts where

283
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,570
you have the encryption key embedded in

284
00:10:57,570 --> 00:10:59,310
the microprocessor and authenticates the

285
00:10:59,310 --> 00:10:59,980
boot and then

286
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:01,690
operating system in the application and

287
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:03,460
the device itself and intrusion

288
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:05,590
detection prevention systems all these

289
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:07,600
things are all out there and the face

290
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,840
standard the one used by the avionics

291
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:12,670
industry defense industry for billing is

292
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:14,470
open interoperable environments for

293
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:16,150
avionics platforms for the Department of

294
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:19,480
Defense so we just it's really a very

295
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,550
welcome to see that all the technology

296
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:23,050
and solutions are out there already we

297
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:24,310
just have to be pretty careful in

298
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:26,700
picking and choosing and integrating

299
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:30,550
well you've probably thought of some of

300
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:32,230
the hard questions and probably had to

301
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:34,890
talk about them internally a lot as to

302
00:11:34,890 --> 00:11:37,720
what might cause this program to fail

303
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:40,920
and I think one of the obvious ones that

304
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:43,720
comes up is the idea that if I'm a

305
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:46,300
vendor right now let's say dcs vendor

306
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:48,790
selling to a large company whether it's

307
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:51,070
yours or someone else and i have the

308
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:53,920
whole project and it's very difficult to

309
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,270
move away from me the things that you

310
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:57,460
were explaining at the beginning that as

311
00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:00,040
a customer are not your ideals are

312
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:02,320
actually very positive oftentimes for

313
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,090
the vendor right they have customer

314
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:06,760
lock-in for decades they have a huge

315
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:10,360
advantage in any next rollout why would

316
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,430
I guess what's your strategy or why

317
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:16,270
would a large dcs vendor want to have

318
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:20,350
this program succeed we get asked that

319
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:22,510
question a lot not not just externally

320
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:25,390
but internally RIA yeah all the time

321
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:33,730
so this so the way we approach this we

322
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:35,080
take this very seriously immediately

323
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,670
except that this is really the first

324
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:38,560
port of call in the OPA form we have to

325
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,150
define that business model that everyone

326
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:43,300
believes gives them a path to a slice of

327
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:47,650
the pie to succeed and you know the

328
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:49,390
conversations we have in the OPA forum

329
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:51,700
are sort of about they're like this we

330
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:53,920
all will all agree that there's a lot of

331
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,780
non-productive cost in the system that

332
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:57,070
we have to take out the cost of

333
00:12:57,070 --> 00:12:58,600
wholesale replacement of integrating

334
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,070
third party components because of the

335
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:02,440
proprietary protocols and those cost

336
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,790
could be seen by the supplier and then

337
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:05,860
passed on to the user we also asked some

338
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:07,279
other hard questions for

339
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:11,089
example why would a supplier want to

340
00:13:11,089 --> 00:13:12,499
build every single component in the

341
00:13:12,499 --> 00:13:15,019
system I mean why not just build the

342
00:13:15,019 --> 00:13:16,790
components you're good at building well

343
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:17,480
why not

344
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,220
look at your resources and capabilities

345
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:20,720
and focus those on building the things

346
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,339
to provide your shareholders with a high

347
00:13:22,339 --> 00:13:26,509
profit margin and and and of course you

348
00:13:26,509 --> 00:13:28,730
know that proves your your profitability

349
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:30,559
and there's another sort of argument we

350
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:32,089
talked about that was kind of popular

351
00:13:32,089 --> 00:13:33,589
wait winter meeting in San Francisco

352
00:13:33,589 --> 00:13:35,720
with the forum which was there's an

353
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,970
argument that the PI is going to grow so

354
00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:39,589
we always we talk often about this

355
00:13:39,589 --> 00:13:41,180
services business that's starting to

356
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:44,660
expand any emerge and today we say it's

357
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:47,589
in the context of big data analytics and

358
00:13:47,589 --> 00:13:49,879
condition monitoring equipment support

359
00:13:49,879 --> 00:13:51,350
house things like that we don't know

360
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:53,149
what it will be but something is going

361
00:13:53,149 --> 00:13:55,069
to come out of this openness and this

362
00:13:55,069 --> 00:13:56,990
connectivity and there's an opportunity

363
00:13:56,990 --> 00:13:59,360
to gain more revenue through those sorts

364
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,709
of new industries that emerge and those

365
00:14:00,709 --> 00:14:01,699
that are on the leading edge you're

366
00:14:01,699 --> 00:14:03,550
going to be able to capitalize on that I

367
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:10,189
think in summary wherever the users want

368
00:14:10,189 --> 00:14:13,430
to go the suppliers they will eventually

369
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:15,259
fall how many of the invisible hand of

370
00:14:15,259 --> 00:14:17,870
Adam Smith is still still very much here

371
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:19,220
and then users we're really I think

372
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:22,189
drive this future well they certainly I

373
00:14:22,189 --> 00:14:24,019
mean it's going to have to happen that

374
00:14:24,019 --> 00:14:27,439
way right it won't happen if the vendors

375
00:14:27,439 --> 00:14:29,389
don't see that they're going to have to

376
00:14:29,389 --> 00:14:31,990
make this change to make a lot of money

377
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:35,930
but you know one of the things that when

378
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:38,809
you talk about this idea of getting rid

379
00:14:38,809 --> 00:14:41,059
of the non-productive part of what you

380
00:14:41,059 --> 00:14:42,439
do is a part you know then they're

381
00:14:42,439 --> 00:14:45,139
getting rid of what helps them focus on

382
00:14:45,139 --> 00:14:46,639
what makes them money get rid of the

383
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:48,980
others and that someone else make money

384
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:52,160
in that area it makes a lot of sense the

385
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,889
only thing is in the DCS world today and

386
00:14:54,889 --> 00:14:56,300
maybe this is going to change but in the

387
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:58,189
DCS world a lot of these projects are

388
00:14:58,189 --> 00:15:01,279
very semi-custom projects you know

389
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:03,079
there's a tremendous amount of services

390
00:15:03,079 --> 00:15:05,059
just to get everything to connect

391
00:15:05,059 --> 00:15:07,639
together and work and a lot of times the

392
00:15:07,639 --> 00:15:09,559
companies are organized the vendors are

393
00:15:09,559 --> 00:15:12,259
organized around providing that type of

394
00:15:12,259 --> 00:15:15,800
overall project as opposed to and in

395
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,329
theory they're buying a product but

396
00:15:17,329 --> 00:15:19,459
really they're buying a project to run a

397
00:15:19,459 --> 00:15:20,840
plant or a refinery

398
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,790
or something I mean that to me that

399
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:25,130
would be a pretty different business

400
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:27,050
model than for a dcs vendor if they

401
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:30,380
really are getting in the business of

402
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:33,140
selling equipment have they as they

403
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:35,450
talked to you at all about that or have

404
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:36,890
you have you gotten any feedback from

405
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:38,870
especially from the large players I can

406
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:40,940
see the small players loving this but

407
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,250
the large players I would say is this

408
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:44,870
would really change through their life

409
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:46,580
if you were successful in doing this

410
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:51,530
you're huge business model change so you

411
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:52,850
know I I don't know the percentage of

412
00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:56,150
components with a saint's a main

413
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:57,590
automation contractor that comes and

414
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:59,090
works for an EPC in a Greenfield

415
00:15:59,090 --> 00:16:00,650
facility I don't know what percentage of

416
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:02,110
equipment actually comes from that

417
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:04,580
contract or maybe it's half maybe the

418
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:07,940
other bits are PLC's and third party

419
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:09,740
equipment analyzers and sensors and

420
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:11,720
actuators and valves but we're really

421
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,610
talking about moving that boundary from

422
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:16,730
whatever it is 50 40 percent to a much

423
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:18,080
smaller number but they've

424
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,850
responsibility for integration and the

425
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:22,040
accountability still stays the same this

426
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,720
will be one individual entity that's

427
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,250
still responsible for procuring the

428
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:26,990
right equipment making sure that it

429
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:28,490
operates together when they built the

430
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:30,770
system and also the ongoing support as

431
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:33,680
well you need an entity to do that okay

432
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,150
so yeah that was those one of the other

433
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:37,580
things that you know in talking to

434
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:40,340
people I've heard some concerns is today

435
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:44,630
ExxonMobil and other large global asset

436
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:47,330
owners have pretty stringent support

437
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:49,730
requirements on these large vendors that

438
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:52,610
have dominated their installations over

439
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:55,130
the years over the decades you know

440
00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:57,140
being able to provide people and in

441
00:16:57,140 --> 00:17:00,380
answers for everything in the system at

442
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:02,840
anytime anywhere in the world I mean

443
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:05,359
it's if you actually read the support

444
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:08,150
contracts they are quite rigorous I mean

445
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:09,890
and for good reason that you need that

446
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:12,290
kind of support so now you buy this

447
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:14,240
component from this you buy your HMI

448
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,520
here you buy your PLC here you buy your

449
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:21,200
OPC server here how do you get that

450
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,030
support right I mean how do you get

451
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:24,589
people not to end when it doesn't work

452
00:17:24,589 --> 00:17:26,000
well you need to call him you need to

453
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,990
call them yeah this is one of the most

454
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:31,370
that's probably the single most common

455
00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:33,080
question that I get and

456
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:35,520
well I can tell you our position now is

457
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,440
this is really we think the answer is

458
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,660
centered around accountability and

459
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:42,960
contractual obligation so you do need a

460
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,790
single throat to choke single point of

461
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:46,500
contact someone has to be accountable

462
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:47,700
for the overall performance of the

463
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:50,520
system it gets tricky because the core

464
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,380
components of the system ensure a stable

465
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:54,270
operation of the plant of the HMI of the

466
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:56,940
controller and the i/o and to your point

467
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:59,670
if we break those up and procure those

468
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:02,910
from separate sources you've introduced

469
00:18:02,910 --> 00:18:03,780
another twist

470
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:08,040
so we think the right answer to mitigate

471
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:10,650
that that conservative that risk is very

472
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:12,840
crisp and well defined standards number

473
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,690
one right for interoperability number

474
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:17,400
two that's not good enough you will also

475
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:20,070
need sort of an independent and

476
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:21,720
comprehensive verification and from

477
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,970
conformance method so if that product

478
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:26,460
ends up on the marketplace in the OPA

479
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:28,680
repository as OPA conformant that it's

480
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,930
truly conformant and the other thing

481
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:32,490
we've been thinking about is there's

482
00:18:32,490 --> 00:18:35,220
probably a need for more comprehensive

483
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:39,270
test harness technology to work out the

484
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:43,250
bugs earlier and minimize the surprises

485
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:48,060
it's probably you know maybe the best I

486
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:49,350
maybe that's the best answer I can give

487
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:50,850
you right now because it is quite a

488
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:52,830
concern and it's new area we're delving

489
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:55,560
into but it's not that much different

490
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:56,880
than what's happening in the avionics

491
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,530
space the commercial military space

492
00:18:58,530 --> 00:18:59,810
where you're mixing and matching

493
00:18:59,810 --> 00:19:01,620
hundreds of components from different

494
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:04,260
suppliers yet there's one key systems

495
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:05,580
integrator that's responsible for

496
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:07,260
putting them together and ensuring that

497
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:09,930
they all work in harmony yeah because a

498
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:11,630
lot of what you were describing there

499
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:15,480
were efforts to reduce the support

500
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:18,930
burden right if you better testing clear

501
00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:20,640
interfaces things like that should

502
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:24,450
reduce the number of support calls that

503
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:26,700
you have but if things break I mean

504
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:28,020
things are not perfect there you're

505
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:30,810
going to need that support so do you see

506
00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:33,150
like this is this going to be a new

507
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:36,210
market where there's going to be someone

508
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:38,910
that's just responsible for support for

509
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:40,800
the next you know 10 years on this

510
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:43,890
system or do you think this is whoever

511
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:45,840
is the prime vendor or this integrator

512
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:46,559
you talk about

513
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,149
how do you see that market playing out

514
00:19:48,149 --> 00:19:49,980
obviously what will happen will happen

515
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,690
but you have any vision for that right

516
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:51,870
now

517
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:55,049
well the model that works today I would

518
00:19:55,049 --> 00:19:56,639
imagine it's probably the template will

519
00:19:56,639 --> 00:19:59,850
will will work off so the systems

520
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:02,549
integrator might be a DCF supplier they

521
00:20:02,549 --> 00:20:04,470
just may not give you all of their

522
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:07,740
homegrown kit and it's likely to view

523
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:09,499
the systems integrator you understand

524
00:20:09,499 --> 00:20:11,669
much about the system you'll be in a

525
00:20:11,669 --> 00:20:13,379
great you have a great competitive

526
00:20:13,379 --> 00:20:14,879
advantage to carry on with the ongoing

527
00:20:14,879 --> 00:20:16,769
support the model we use today and

528
00:20:16,769 --> 00:20:19,080
that's probably the that we my best

529
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:21,029
guess right now now who enters the

530
00:20:21,029 --> 00:20:23,159
market clearly we have what five seven

531
00:20:23,159 --> 00:20:24,749
major DCF suppliers

532
00:20:24,749 --> 00:20:27,029
there'll be key candidates to be systems

533
00:20:27,029 --> 00:20:28,919
integrators open systems integrators and

534
00:20:28,919 --> 00:20:30,090
there will be some new entrants coming

535
00:20:30,090 --> 00:20:31,710
in you know we have you know the

536
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:34,619
interest in in the defense space as well

537
00:20:34,619 --> 00:20:37,379
the complex systems integrators like

538
00:20:37,379 --> 00:20:39,240
Lockheed Martin there's also Boeing and

539
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,559
Northrop Grumman and the others that

540
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:42,809
would be candidates to enter the market

541
00:20:42,809 --> 00:20:45,330
if they see valuing them and I hadn't

542
00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:46,740
really thought about that but you know

543
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:48,330
it almost goes back to that business

544
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:51,119
model we were talking about for a dcs

545
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:53,669
vendor you could the dcs vendor could

546
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:55,470
say i'm going to really focus on my

547
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:58,200
product and not worry about all this

548
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,580
installation or they could go the other

549
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:02,220
way they could say yeah well we'll offer

550
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:03,629
a little product but we're really going

551
00:21:03,629 --> 00:21:05,460
to try to make our money being this

552
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:08,100
person this entity that connects all

553
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,509
these open systems together and

554
00:21:09,509 --> 00:21:12,389
maintains them that'll be interesting to

555
00:21:12,389 --> 00:21:16,649
watch on the 37 companies and the others

556
00:21:16,649 --> 00:21:18,299
that haven't joined but have expressed

557
00:21:18,299 --> 00:21:20,549
interest are there many new players

558
00:21:20,549 --> 00:21:22,799
people that you know haven't been able

559
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:25,769
to get into potentially selling to a

560
00:21:25,769 --> 00:21:27,869
company like ExxonMobil that have said

561
00:21:27,869 --> 00:21:31,019
you know I can develop a part of this

562
00:21:31,019 --> 00:21:34,409
solution that you know I wasn't part of

563
00:21:34,409 --> 00:21:37,110
before it not only new decks i mobile

564
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:38,460
but that's a even new to the whole

565
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:40,860
industry you're people coming in yeah so

566
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:43,919
it reminds me of two things so one of

567
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:45,389
the things Lockheed Martin told us about

568
00:21:45,389 --> 00:21:47,639
their move from stovepipe proprietary to

569
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:49,409
open was that they had this great

570
00:21:49,409 --> 00:21:51,659
concern that they were going to have

571
00:21:51,659 --> 00:21:53,249
their competitors beating to replace

572
00:21:53,249 --> 00:21:54,629
their own components but at the same

573
00:21:54,629 --> 00:21:55,799
time they realize now they have an

574
00:21:55,799 --> 00:21:58,590
opportunity to sell components in other

575
00:21:58,590 --> 00:21:59,940
markets they were shut out

576
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:02,519
the dcs supplier is I hope look at it

577
00:22:02,519 --> 00:22:03,899
that way but there are a lot of

578
00:22:03,899 --> 00:22:05,489
suppliers that are coming in saying look

579
00:22:05,489 --> 00:22:07,469
we've been previously completely shut

580
00:22:07,469 --> 00:22:10,169
out of this market and we'd very much

581
00:22:10,169 --> 00:22:12,179
like to have an opportunity an

582
00:22:12,179 --> 00:22:15,449
opportunity to sell chip manufacturers

583
00:22:15,449 --> 00:22:17,069
have mentioned to us that you know I

584
00:22:17,069 --> 00:22:18,599
might make this almost a nearly

585
00:22:18,599 --> 00:22:20,399
identical chip for three or four

586
00:22:20,399 --> 00:22:21,479
different customers it's almost

587
00:22:21,479 --> 00:22:24,179
identical but slightly different and if

588
00:22:24,179 --> 00:22:26,549
I could just standardize on one single

589
00:22:26,549 --> 00:22:28,649
chip I can save a ridiculous amount of

590
00:22:28,649 --> 00:22:30,149
money and pass that on to you pass that

591
00:22:30,149 --> 00:22:31,889
on to the users as well so it's kind of

592
00:22:31,889 --> 00:22:33,749
a it's a mixed bag

593
00:22:33,749 --> 00:22:35,249
but there are a lot of new entrants that

594
00:22:35,249 --> 00:22:37,289
really want an opportunity to play in an

595
00:22:37,289 --> 00:22:38,849
open marketplace where they can compete

596
00:22:38,849 --> 00:22:42,629
so this is interesting so if you have

597
00:22:42,629 --> 00:22:44,339
all these new components from

598
00:22:44,339 --> 00:22:47,249
potentially new vendors and and probably

599
00:22:47,249 --> 00:22:50,099
in the perfect world improving their

600
00:22:50,099 --> 00:22:51,929
product year after year so let's say

601
00:22:51,929 --> 00:22:53,429
three to five years from now you have a

602
00:22:53,429 --> 00:22:56,549
much better component of the system that

603
00:22:56,549 --> 00:22:59,249
was available five years before do you

604
00:22:59,249 --> 00:23:01,019
see

605
00:23:01,019 --> 00:23:03,119
ExxonMobil or other people that are

606
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:04,949
involved you see the model that they'll

607
00:23:04,949 --> 00:23:08,339
be upgrading their systems every you're

608
00:23:08,339 --> 00:23:09,869
looking to upgrade every three to five

609
00:23:09,869 --> 00:23:11,819
years parts of it or do you still see

610
00:23:11,819 --> 00:23:13,799
you take this open solution put it in

611
00:23:13,799 --> 00:23:17,190
and then 15 years late or 20 years or

612
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:19,739
years later you put in a new open system

613
00:23:19,739 --> 00:23:22,049
which which model do you see so here's

614
00:23:22,049 --> 00:23:23,699
the vision I don't know if we'll get

615
00:23:23,699 --> 00:23:25,440
there okay division is this an

616
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,909
abstraction of the hardware and the

617
00:23:26,909 --> 00:23:29,190
software so that when I write my

618
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:31,769
application code to do something the

619
00:23:31,769 --> 00:23:33,449
physical kit in the field stays the same

620
00:23:33,449 --> 00:23:35,249
why wouldn't my controls stay the same

621
00:23:35,249 --> 00:23:37,019
so we don't want to touch we want to

622
00:23:37,019 --> 00:23:38,879
write and set and forget the process

623
00:23:38,879 --> 00:23:42,659
controls the underlying hardware we only

624
00:23:42,659 --> 00:23:44,219
want to change under ten conditions

625
00:23:44,219 --> 00:23:45,719
either the hardware itself is obsolete

626
00:23:45,719 --> 00:23:49,049
or maybe the idea I have for a new

627
00:23:49,049 --> 00:23:50,849
application requires more memory more

628
00:23:50,849 --> 00:23:53,219
compute power something that allows me

629
00:23:53,219 --> 00:23:54,719
to extract some more evaluate all

630
00:23:54,719 --> 00:23:58,019
positive and PD opportunity and in our

631
00:23:58,019 --> 00:23:59,519
hope and this is what I this is really

632
00:23:59,519 --> 00:24:01,799
the stretch goal is it not only is the

633
00:24:01,799 --> 00:24:03,509
software open but the hardware

634
00:24:03,509 --> 00:24:05,219
interfaces are open so the pin

635
00:24:05,219 --> 00:24:08,190
configuration is standardized for a

636
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:10,079
setup for a particular controller design

637
00:24:10,079 --> 00:24:12,230
so that the columns the power

638
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:14,750
can be allow us to interchange the

639
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:17,809
hardware so I might replace the hardware

640
00:24:17,809 --> 00:24:20,480
as a routine maintenance activity but I

641
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:23,210
I can take a checkpoint or a copy of a

642
00:24:23,210 --> 00:24:24,769
software and just download it to the new

643
00:24:24,769 --> 00:24:27,110
the new system without any modification

644
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:29,840
so you know we you know commodity

645
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,789
businesses they have a philosophy and a

646
00:24:31,789 --> 00:24:33,590
strategy that believes a low-cost supply

647
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:35,419
or win so of course we're going to hold

648
00:24:35,419 --> 00:24:37,460
on to our kit and minimize the capital

649
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:39,320
investment for as long as we can I might

650
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:42,080
change depending on different industries

651
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,820
you know the upstream organizations may

652
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:45,559
say I just set it and forget it maybe

653
00:24:45,559 --> 00:24:46,700
the downstream where you have a lot of

654
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:48,440
degrees of freedom of optimization might

655
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:50,779
say I would like more processing power

656
00:24:50,779 --> 00:24:52,429
to make more money I want to spend more

657
00:24:52,429 --> 00:24:56,149
to make more that that seems though

658
00:24:56,149 --> 00:24:59,590
wooden that so right now ExxonMobil is a

659
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:02,269
little unique in the in the degree that

660
00:25:02,269 --> 00:25:04,789
you standardize your deployments right

661
00:25:04,789 --> 00:25:08,000
you add not all companies try to do this

662
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,529
or most companies try to do this but

663
00:25:09,529 --> 00:25:11,720
Exxon really it's very important that

664
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:14,419
this is like this it's like this for

665
00:25:14,419 --> 00:25:16,789
support and all other reasons if you

666
00:25:16,789 --> 00:25:18,830
have this open system where you're

667
00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:20,269
putting one in now and then you're

668
00:25:20,269 --> 00:25:21,559
putting another one in three years and

669
00:25:21,559 --> 00:25:23,179
you decide to pick the best thing there

670
00:25:23,179 --> 00:25:25,850
and the best thing in six years you're

671
00:25:25,850 --> 00:25:28,220
introducing probably a variability that

672
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:32,000
is very unusual to your company yet do

673
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:32,659
you see

674
00:25:32,659 --> 00:25:34,429
setting a standard for ten years or do

675
00:25:34,429 --> 00:25:36,289
you actually see changing that

676
00:25:36,289 --> 00:25:40,840
philosophy so if that back to this point

677
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:44,659
the process control code right

678
00:25:44,659 --> 00:25:47,179
configurations we want to remain static

679
00:25:47,179 --> 00:25:48,590
only change them if we need to the

680
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:50,570
underlying hardware we're happy to

681
00:25:50,570 --> 00:25:52,760
change it out if there's a reason to you

682
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:54,559
know that that comment about a

683
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:58,700
standardization it commonality is is

684
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:01,130
valuable oh yes and and you know you see

685
00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:02,659
like Southwest will claim that's one of

686
00:26:02,659 --> 00:26:04,669
the core reasons why they're

687
00:26:04,669 --> 00:26:06,500
continuously profitable over the decades

688
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:08,299
is that you know they sticking with the

689
00:26:08,299 --> 00:26:12,409
737 but and so in our world what does

690
00:26:12,409 --> 00:26:15,649
that mean you have you have commonality

691
00:26:15,649 --> 00:26:18,370
we are very good at it and you end up

692
00:26:18,370 --> 00:26:20,419
having advantages like application

693
00:26:20,419 --> 00:26:22,159
readings you're right wants and deploy

694
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:23,629
too many but you know that comes at a

695
00:26:23,629 --> 00:26:24,590
cost

696
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:26,419
and the cost is related to marketplace

697
00:26:26,419 --> 00:26:28,700
competition things like pricing and

698
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:30,649
vendor responsiveness and innovation but

699
00:26:30,649 --> 00:26:32,600
but if you have a heterogeneous fleet

700
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:36,110
you know the other extreme you do get

701
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:37,940
the marketplace competition advantages

702
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:39,860
but you don't get the application reuse

703
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:42,230
so those are two extremes on that

704
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:44,029
spectrum I have different advantages and

705
00:26:44,029 --> 00:26:46,940
disadvantages but but the OPA framework

706
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:48,710
he's designed will allow you to have

707
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:51,289
that mixed fleet but to be able to

708
00:26:51,289 --> 00:26:52,970
create a common software operating

709
00:26:52,970 --> 00:26:54,830
environment you get the advantages of

710
00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:56,929
application reuse and you can drop the

711
00:26:56,929 --> 00:26:58,279
same application in every plant

712
00:26:58,279 --> 00:27:01,210
regardless of the underlying platform so

713
00:27:01,210 --> 00:27:03,740
the portability an opera operability

714
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:06,409
that comes with OPA can could give both

715
00:27:06,409 --> 00:27:08,899
parties both extremes and a real

716
00:27:08,899 --> 00:27:11,779
advantage and introduce some interesting

717
00:27:11,779 --> 00:27:13,460
support things as well that right grows

718
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:15,499
because you have consistent support at

719
00:27:15,499 --> 00:27:18,049
one level and very different support you

720
00:27:18,049 --> 00:27:20,749
know at the infrastructure or the non

721
00:27:20,749 --> 00:27:22,490
application level could could very well

722
00:27:22,490 --> 00:27:25,249
be now I just had we're almost out of

723
00:27:25,249 --> 00:27:26,840
time here but I just had one more

724
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:29,809
question you know as I was thinking

725
00:27:29,809 --> 00:27:30,980
about this I was saying well this sounds

726
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:33,200
this is really interesting you're taking

727
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:37,730
the existing DCs and saying how can we

728
00:27:37,730 --> 00:27:40,940
do better with this have you thought or

729
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:42,559
are you concerned about the fact that

730
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:44,629
three to five years from now it may look

731
00:27:44,629 --> 00:27:47,330
completely different if a lot of this

732
00:27:47,330 --> 00:27:50,480
becomes cloud services and and that your

733
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,850
or what is your strategy to not be

734
00:27:52,850 --> 00:27:56,149
building a much better obsolete system

735
00:27:56,149 --> 00:27:58,730
how are you going to deal with those

736
00:27:58,730 --> 00:28:01,279
kind of changes that some are predicting

737
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:02,749
some are saying we'll never happen but

738
00:28:02,749 --> 00:28:04,129
have you have you looked at that future

739
00:28:04,129 --> 00:28:07,519
possibility so that's this is the

740
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:10,850
hardest question you've asked so there's

741
00:28:10,850 --> 00:28:12,860
a there's an old Danish proverb that

742
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:14,480
says be careful about making predictions

743
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:17,690
especially about the future so we try to

744
00:28:17,690 --> 00:28:20,600
subscribe to that and the OPA forum we

745
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:22,519
try to develop a very forward-thinking

746
00:28:22,519 --> 00:28:24,649
strategy and approach because we just

747
00:28:24,649 --> 00:28:26,240
don't know what the future will hold so

748
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,799
we're very careful not to specify a

749
00:28:27,799 --> 00:28:30,169
network architecture a topology we're

750
00:28:30,169 --> 00:28:31,669
not supposed to find hardware we're not

751
00:28:31,669 --> 00:28:33,379
specifying application software

752
00:28:33,379 --> 00:28:35,799
we're only requiring

753
00:28:35,799 --> 00:28:40,299
public AP is publicly available API

754
00:28:40,299 --> 00:28:42,499
communication protocols and data models

755
00:28:42,499 --> 00:28:44,179
everything that we can do to avoid

756
00:28:44,179 --> 00:28:46,940
blocking our kick into the future and

757
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:48,470
that's probably the best you know the

758
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:50,419
best we can do right now we have a lot

759
00:28:50,419 --> 00:28:51,950
of smart minds from a lot of different

760
00:28:51,950 --> 00:28:53,570
industries making sure that we don't do

761
00:28:53,570 --> 00:28:55,129
anything that boxes this into a corner

762
00:28:55,129 --> 00:28:57,950
not now everyone is welcome to join the

763
00:28:57,950 --> 00:28:59,989
Opa forum and if anyone has ideas you

764
00:28:59,989 --> 00:29:01,509
know the open through post this and

765
00:29:01,509 --> 00:29:03,350
we've been more than happy to have

766
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:05,869
helped answer in that question well this

767
00:29:05,869 --> 00:29:07,309
has been great it really appreciate your

768
00:29:07,309 --> 00:29:10,129
time and I think it's we get I didn't

769
00:29:10,129 --> 00:29:11,479
say it at the beginning but this project

770
00:29:11,479 --> 00:29:13,399
is part of ExxonMobil's breakthrough

771
00:29:13,399 --> 00:29:17,720
group which means it's recognized is a

772
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:20,629
radical solution right it's not just an

773
00:29:20,629 --> 00:29:24,470
evolution it's a jump and and it's not

774
00:29:24,470 --> 00:29:26,659
an easy thing to do and we I think it's

775
00:29:26,659 --> 00:29:28,399
great that companies like yours are

776
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:31,309
trying these difficult things and and

777
00:29:31,309 --> 00:29:32,840
we'll be watching it so thank you very

778
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:36,549
much Steve thank you

779
00:29:43,049 --> 00:29:45,110
you
