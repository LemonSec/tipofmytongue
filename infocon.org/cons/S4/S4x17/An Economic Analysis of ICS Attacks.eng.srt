00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,610
colleagues so Carlos beretta who is my

19
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:12,689
PhD student and Jennifer Holmes who's a

20
00:01:12,689 --> 00:01:16,259
professor in political science augustine

21
00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:18,750
paulo who is her PhD student and then

22
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:21,060
one carlos Restrepo who is them chief

23
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:26,400
security officer of the main Colombian

24
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,500
Independent System Operator or DG of the

25
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:32,220
order ISO of Colombia and this is a

26
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:35,250
project funded by NSF and we're dealing

27
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:37,200
with some of the issues that that we

28
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,700
have or the lessons that we have learned

29
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:41,100
from years of experience of physical

30
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,850
attacks in in Colombian infrastructure

31
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:47,790
so let me see so yeah so to give you a

32
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:50,130
little bit of a background on why like

33
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:52,430
why are we looking at Colombia so

34
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:54,840
Colombia has a service has suffered

35
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:58,110
decades of civil war now there are

36
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:01,500
basically two main guerrilla groups

37
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,000
there there are a couple of more but

38
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,210
they decided to be biggest ones so the

39
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:08,818
FARC who is the Revolutionary Armed

40
00:02:08,818 --> 00:02:10,649
Forces of Colombia and the ELN

41
00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:13,440
or the National Liberation Army so these

42
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,340
are the two main

43
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:15,870
groups that have been fighting the

44
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:17,970
government and also they're mostly

45
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:19,950
left-wing groups they fight the

46
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:21,900
government and they also fight like

47
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:24,629
right-wing illegal groups and they

48
00:02:24,629 --> 00:02:26,580
started basically as revolutionary

49
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:29,400
movements around 60s in the in the 60s

50
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,930
and they originated yeah because there

51
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:33,269
was a lot of political violence in

52
00:02:33,269 --> 00:02:36,390
Colombia social dissatisfaction you know

53
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:40,110
the the difference between like the

54
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:42,810
elite and the public and then communist

55
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:44,700
influence there was a I guess at the

56
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,680
time the Cuban Revolution and then the

57
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,690
Soviet Union was like really interested

58
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:53,549
in expanding the communism in in Latin

59
00:02:53,549 --> 00:02:55,500
America so they were trying to fund or

60
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:58,260
motivate groups to grow to appear and

61
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:02,760
like take over the government and and

62
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:05,430
why and these are these groups have been

63
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:07,500
attacking basically the Colombian

64
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:10,019
infrastructure for at least three

65
00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:13,680
decades so they reconciled by the

66
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,180
National Memorial Institute for

67
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:17,700
prevention of terrorism like had a

68
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:19,290
summary and they said that among all

69
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:21,269
terrorist attacks to the electricity

70
00:03:21,269 --> 00:03:24,139
infrastructure between 1994 and 2004

71
00:03:24,139 --> 00:03:26,880
sixty-seven percent of them happened in

72
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,769
Colombia and the rest of the country

73
00:03:28,769 --> 00:03:30,840
like each country accounted for less

74
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,180
than seven percent each and yeah there

75
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:35,130
was a recent report also that basically

76
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:37,500
counted and it was still like we were

77
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,569
actually growing in the eighties or

78
00:03:39,569 --> 00:03:43,470
something in the last up to 2011 so so

79
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:47,160
that was so yeah basically Colombia has

80
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:50,609
the most attacks in the world in against

81
00:03:50,609 --> 00:03:51,959
the power system so basically they

82
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:55,859
destroy electricity transmission towers

83
00:03:55,859 --> 00:03:58,190
distribution towers substations and

84
00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:00,120
there was a couple of times that they

85
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:05,250
also try to destroy a generator and the

86
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:07,500
largest operational experience they have

87
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,810
so you can imagine that the people

88
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:11,579
working on operating in these systems

89
00:04:11,579 --> 00:04:12,989
have the largest operational experience

90
00:04:12,989 --> 00:04:14,519
with dealing and responding to physical

91
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:18,180
attacks to critical infrastructures so

92
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:20,488
there is an example of attacks to the

93
00:04:20,488 --> 00:04:22,440
transportation so there's a bridge like

94
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,030
for example they destroy the bridge and

95
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:25,800
then they have sort of like criminal

96
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,599
books that teach you what is sort of

97
00:04:27,599 --> 00:04:28,110
like the up

98
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:30,000
way to destroy a bridge so that it

99
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,120
delays people trying to repair it these

100
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,319
are attacks against the oil

101
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:37,919
infrastructure so they and depending on

102
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:40,020
the group if you remember there were two

103
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:42,629
groups the FARC and the ELN like they

104
00:04:42,629 --> 00:04:44,639
they have a little bit of a different

105
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:48,750
ideologies like the ELN thinks a lot or

106
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:52,139
or cares a lot about securing the sort

107
00:04:52,139 --> 00:04:53,099
of like the natural resources of

108
00:04:53,099 --> 00:04:55,050
Colombia from foreign influence so they

109
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:58,439
say well these like companies like BP or

110
00:04:58,439 --> 00:05:00,300
Occidental Petroleum they come here and

111
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,580
then this they take all our oil so we're

112
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:03,960
gonna shut them down and that's where

113
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,819
they do the FARC it's more against the

114
00:05:05,819 --> 00:05:08,069
government so they try to destroy the

115
00:05:08,069 --> 00:05:11,120
power grid so these are the examples of

116
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,159
like attacks that have happened against

117
00:05:14,159 --> 00:05:16,219
the power grid so they put basically

118
00:05:16,219 --> 00:05:19,169
they dynamite the the transmission

119
00:05:19,169 --> 00:05:22,439
towers and they bring them down and and

120
00:05:22,439 --> 00:05:24,319
yeah throughout history there has been

121
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:27,629
hundreds of attacks thousands of attacks

122
00:05:27,629 --> 00:05:28,889
actually I think they're one of the

123
00:05:28,889 --> 00:05:31,409
largest years it was an attack almost

124
00:05:31,409 --> 00:05:33,889
one per day to these transmission towers

125
00:05:33,889 --> 00:05:40,740
on average and and yeah so this

126
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:43,740
experience has led to a lot of lessons

127
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:45,419
learned well what happened when you

128
00:05:45,419 --> 00:05:47,219
operate a system under constant attacks

129
00:05:47,219 --> 00:05:49,789
so statistical information we can

130
00:05:49,789 --> 00:05:52,110
statistical information of what happens

131
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:54,419
to an attack for example and tax on the

132
00:05:54,419 --> 00:05:56,430
power grid that leaves city without

133
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:59,039
water attacks to a bridge that leaves a

134
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:00,719
city without food supplies like

135
00:06:00,719 --> 00:06:02,430
therefore the prices of the food

136
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:04,830
increase attacks to the power grid which

137
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:06,599
are used as a distraction for cocaine

138
00:06:06,599 --> 00:06:08,550
smuggling so a lot of the times they

139
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:10,020
don't want to destroy the power grid

140
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:11,580
because they want to create black a

141
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:13,379
blackout this is early but because for

142
00:06:13,379 --> 00:06:14,819
example they want to distract the

143
00:06:14,819 --> 00:06:16,789
military forces because they know that

144
00:06:16,789 --> 00:06:20,759
when they destroy a tower the military

145
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:22,169
forces have to come to the tower and

146
00:06:22,169 --> 00:06:24,210
protect basically the workers that are

147
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:26,069
gonna come be coming and repairing that

148
00:06:26,069 --> 00:06:29,819
tower and so the government basically

149
00:06:29,819 --> 00:06:32,099
the military forces have to be deployed

150
00:06:32,099 --> 00:06:34,319
to this region and then they can sort of

151
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:36,089
like smuggle cocaine through the region

152
00:06:36,089 --> 00:06:40,560
that was cleared and then and then the

153
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,729
the topic of this

154
00:06:41,729 --> 00:06:44,219
talk was an interesting case in the last

155
00:06:44,219 --> 00:06:47,099
one the last bullet point between 2005

156
00:06:47,099 --> 00:06:50,490
and 2008 they found that that a company

157
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:52,319
in charge of repairing these towers

158
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:57,089
actually bribed or nor or had a deal

159
00:06:57,089 --> 00:06:58,919
with the guerrilla so that will give you

160
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:01,889
money and so that we get more business

161
00:07:01,889 --> 00:07:04,050
and this is basically the story that

162
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:06,629
happened I'm gonna go into more details

163
00:07:06,629 --> 00:07:08,550
a little bit later on but yeah so these

164
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:10,680
are just a summary of attacks that

165
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,620
happened according to the years they

166
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:16,499
have been decreasing recently the worst

167
00:07:16,499 --> 00:07:18,270
years were late in the 90s and early

168
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:21,719
2000s as you can see there we have one

169
00:07:21,719 --> 00:07:24,029
of the worst years in 2000 we had almost

170
00:07:24,029 --> 00:07:26,759
300 basically Towers Towers destroyed

171
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:28,680
and these are yeah towers that were

172
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:33,870
taken down by attacks so ISA or ISA we

173
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:36,180
call them it's the is the ISO basically

174
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:38,580
the main power system operator in in

175
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:40,020
Colombia basically trans the

176
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:41,939
transmission operators are they the I

177
00:07:41,939 --> 00:07:44,399
deal with the transmission system and

178
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:48,569
these issues and and the the other ones

179
00:07:48,569 --> 00:07:50,219
are attacks against the other power

180
00:07:50,219 --> 00:07:52,289
companies so the main one the main the

181
00:07:52,289 --> 00:07:56,060
main source of attacks are is a because

182
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:59,039
yeah they have these transmission towers

183
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:00,240
are in the basically in the middle of

184
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,379
nowhere and they're really hard to

185
00:08:01,379 --> 00:08:03,209
protect and they have the most sort of

186
00:08:03,209 --> 00:08:04,889
like return of benefit for attack if you

187
00:08:04,889 --> 00:08:07,439
take down a distribution tower at the

188
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:09,509
end of a line then it doesn't have the

189
00:08:09,509 --> 00:08:13,199
same impact but yeah these are other

190
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:15,419
companies are also dealing with that but

191
00:08:15,419 --> 00:08:18,629
our main point of contact for this talk

192
00:08:18,629 --> 00:08:20,939
was ISA because they were the ones who

193
00:08:20,939 --> 00:08:25,050
suffered from this attack so this is

194
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:28,860
what happens when we're gonna attack

195
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:31,919
when a tower goes down the first thing

196
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:33,328
that happens is that the military has to

197
00:08:33,328 --> 00:08:35,940
come and secure the site because the

198
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:39,328
guerrilla usually leaves mines landmines

199
00:08:39,328 --> 00:08:42,510
so to slow down repairs so the military

200
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:45,050
has to come make sure that there's no

201
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:47,519
like remove the land miles first the

202
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:48,839
land mines and then make sure that

203
00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:50,480
there's no sniper or anything around

204
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,060
once the military has come and taken

205
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:55,350
control of the of the

206
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:57,630
place where the tower was destroyed then

207
00:08:57,630 --> 00:08:59,460
the contractors start coming in usually

208
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:00,840
by helicopter back again because they're

209
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,520
in the middle of nowhere so they have to

210
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:06,270
come with ya with the materials and

211
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:07,920
transport the contractors then the

212
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,450
contractors have to destroy what remains

213
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:11,940
of the tower and then they start

214
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:13,530
building it again and this is a team

215
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:18,030
usually of around 18 people - 25 people

216
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:20,250
that come and basically destroy the old

217
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:23,370
tower and start building a new one at

218
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:24,990
when the attack started they like

219
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:28,890
rebuilding a new tower took like a week

220
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:30,900
or two no two weeks actually around two

221
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:33,570
weeks and then after they became so

222
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:35,670
proficient I forgot now I think it takes

223
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:37,770
them about four days only to just do all

224
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:40,080
this because they have so much

225
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,060
experience with destroying and building

226
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:44,160
towers that there they become very

227
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:49,590
efficient at that and yeah and so this

228
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:52,820
is so as I was saying before so we're

229
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:55,140
we're gonna be focusing on an example of

230
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:58,160
a contractor that decided to basically a

231
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,120
services company that was fixing these

232
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:02,280
towers that decided to pay the gorilla -

233
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:05,250
to destroy more towers and what was

234
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:07,080
happening here this is like doing

235
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:09,360
showing the top here but these are the

236
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,390
years 2000 5 6 7 & 8 and that's a map of

237
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:15,210
Colombia and the orange dots are the

238
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:17,880
number of attacks that electric towers

239
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:20,130
destroyed by the guerrilla members and

240
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:24,060
in 2000 5 6 7 & 8 you start seeing this

241
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:28,050
region here that starts getting many

242
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:30,150
more attacks than usual and it's

243
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:32,010
basically yeah we did some statistical

244
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:33,320
analysis and it's a clear outlier

245
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:37,110
compared to other factors we talked to

246
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:39,210
the main security officer of this

247
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:40,800
company and he said yes that's what

248
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,480
happened we started looking at these

249
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,670
reports they were like all of us all and

250
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:46,410
this region started here getting more

251
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:48,060
and more attacks and we're trying to

252
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:50,070
wonder why because the like real

253
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:51,510
activity was not higher in that region

254
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:54,150
it was just sort of like popped and then

255
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:55,560
he started looking at the reports like

256
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,990
the company repairing those towers was

257
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:00,090
basically the same one and he started

258
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:01,590
getting suspicion suspicious he

259
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:04,530
contacted the police and they

260
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:06,480
infiltrated the company they they post a

261
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,190
cell as a repair worker and then

262
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:12,490
went through like as an undercover agent

263
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:14,890
sorry undercover and started analyzing

264
00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:16,390
what was going on and then yeah they

265
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:19,060
found out that the contractor was

266
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:21,220
actually hiring guerilla members to

267
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:23,050
destroy more towers because in the

268
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:25,060
region of operation so so they had these

269
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:26,710
contractors usually had regions and this

270
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:28,870
particular contractor was in charge of

271
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:31,330
repairing any towers that went down in

272
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:33,130
this place so they told okay Kara let me

273
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:35,260
embrace please we'll give you some money

274
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:37,660
and then you help us destroy more towers

275
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:40,480
and and this is funny because they were

276
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,430
asking for example oh yeah we don't want

277
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:44,200
you to blow at our towers on the

278
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,930
weekends because we don't want to pay

279
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:51,430
overtime also we hate going like through

280
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:52,660
they have some more pictures that I

281
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:54,610
wasn't cleared to show for this because

282
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:56,320
this presentation was being recorded but

283
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,340
there were some more pictures that show

284
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:58,870
like how hard it is to get to see these

285
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:01,150
Mali terrains and and they were saying

286
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:05,370
well we want easier access and we also

287
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:08,040
yeah basically nothing nothing out of

288
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:13,300
yeah try not to like the the like they

289
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,160
told him also like the way to destroy so

290
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:17,790
it was easier for them to continue so

291
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:21,970
anyway so so yeah basically that's what

292
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:25,030
was happening the contractor the company

293
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:28,450
the towers were down so the company pays

294
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:30,010
the contractor to repair it but then the

295
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:31,600
contractor was getting more attacks and

296
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,900
basically these attacks the number of

297
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:37,360
attacks happening per state in Colombia

298
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,420
for region and this is where this spike

299
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:44,170
was the region were where that was being

300
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:49,690
bribed and well going to the title of

301
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:52,120
the talk about economics well the

302
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:54,370
problem of course is that there was a

303
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:57,220
financial incentive for the services

304
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:59,650
company to basically spend money on the

305
00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:01,000
guerrilla so that they would get more

306
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,780
more business so the repair contracts

307
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:07,000
are assigned using an option basically

308
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:12,220
so you have a basically the price that

309
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:14,230
is the profit that the each contractor

310
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:15,790
makes and he's the bid that they are

311
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:19,150
gonna say well we're we're going there

312
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:20,980
the electric companies as well we need a

313
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:22,899
new services company for this region and

314
00:13:22,899 --> 00:13:24,850
multiple companies bid and they say well

315
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:27,430
we can repair it and with this with

316
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:30,189
these costs and then the contractor

317
00:13:30,189 --> 00:13:33,009
basically they using economic so usually

318
00:13:33,009 --> 00:13:34,420
they're gonna go for the one that is the

319
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:36,670
cheapest one and they go for the

320
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:39,879
cheapest one and so that's how

321
00:13:39,879 --> 00:13:42,279
contractors work the data from reports

322
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:43,920
on average one attack per week

323
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,970
approximate payment to the gorilla was

324
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:47,920
about four thousand dollars that they

325
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:51,129
paid per Tower and the repair contract

326
00:13:51,129 --> 00:13:55,559
was around these two it was so this is

327
00:13:55,559 --> 00:13:58,269
yeah I forgot if this were numbers place

328
00:13:58,269 --> 00:14:00,189
I think this was the word numbers taken

329
00:14:00,189 --> 00:14:02,050
with the dollar exchange rate at the

330
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:04,929
time because in Colombia they the range

331
00:14:04,929 --> 00:14:06,970
between the dollar u.s. ratio changes a

332
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:08,889
lot of the time so this might not be

333
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:09,970
exact

334
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:11,589
the left but at the time there was a

335
00:14:11,589 --> 00:14:16,149
price in dollars and so so yeah

336
00:14:16,149 --> 00:14:17,649
basically we analyzed this story in

337
00:14:17,649 --> 00:14:20,470
detail we have a paper in a in a

338
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:21,970
workshop called why's there workshop on

339
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:23,319
economics on security and we have

340
00:14:23,319 --> 00:14:25,240
another on their submission that has a

341
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,800
lot more details I'm not gonna bore you

342
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,300
with the details just gives you the high

343
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:32,079
level intuition of what would what's

344
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:34,509
happening so intuitively you have sort

345
00:14:34,509 --> 00:14:37,749
of like this theta is the number of at

346
00:14:37,749 --> 00:14:38,860
like the number of towers that are

347
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:40,629
attack normally without this extra

348
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:43,120
incentive then these are the number of

349
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,970
attacks that are basically hired the

350
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:47,709
guerrilla hires are hired to destroy

351
00:14:47,709 --> 00:14:51,100
them and then this and here's how much

352
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:53,499
this is basically how much the company

353
00:14:53,499 --> 00:14:55,059
wins the services company so the

354
00:14:55,059 --> 00:14:57,610
services company gets a profit every

355
00:14:57,610 --> 00:14:59,679
time they repair a tower and then they

356
00:14:59,679 --> 00:15:02,740
get an extra profit based on the extra

357
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:04,839
ones and it can change a little bit

358
00:15:04,839 --> 00:15:07,360
depending on like how much lower can I

359
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:12,100
send my bid but - how what I pay for the

360
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:14,079
for the deal with the guerrillas so I

361
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:16,029
mean I have to pay something for the

362
00:15:16,029 --> 00:15:18,100
guerrilla so this is what it goes in

363
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:19,899
there and ideally well I'd for the

364
00:15:19,899 --> 00:15:21,429
services company at least this is higher

365
00:15:21,429 --> 00:15:25,240
than this and yeah we model this this

366
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:27,910
ideally the pile the price you pay to

367
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:30,939
bring that Tower down it increases it

368
00:15:30,939 --> 00:15:32,199
has a fixed cost and then it increases

369
00:15:32,199 --> 00:15:34,839
by the number of towers that you want to

370
00:15:34,839 --> 00:15:36,520
bring down because it's higher

371
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:39,690
it's a scarce resource you don't have a

372
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:41,650
limited number of gorillas that you can

373
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:44,470
find and hire so so you have to it

374
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:46,780
increases like if you want one is

375
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:50,250
cheaper than if you want 100 destroyed

376
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:52,960
so we created a model an optimization

377
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,340
problem so basically the attacker wants

378
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:58,210
to find how many the attacker wants to

379
00:15:58,210 --> 00:16:00,040
figure out how many attacks how many

380
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:01,390
extra towers should I bring down that

381
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:04,470
maximizes my profits and well we haven't

382
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:06,370
optimization problem and then we find

383
00:16:06,370 --> 00:16:10,600
also thinking so economics is there is

384
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,340
the pro is there is the problem so the

385
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:14,170
attackers has sort of like the optimal

386
00:16:14,170 --> 00:16:15,850
attack the number of attacks that they

387
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:17,650
have to bring down but economics and

388
00:16:17,650 --> 00:16:19,990
also be the solution and one one idea is

389
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:23,440
that how can we change this optimization

390
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,900
problem so that the incentives of the

391
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:28,870
attacker are not there so that they

392
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:30,550
don't get any benefit or their

393
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:32,140
motivation for attacking more it's not

394
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:33,580
there

395
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:35,200
so that brings us to the next part of

396
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,390
the presentation so and this is actually

397
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:40,030
how the electricity power company

398
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:42,340
changed their contracts how they were

399
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:44,500
awarding them based on this so they said

400
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,300
okay well what we're doing now is bad

401
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:48,340
because we're incentivizing all these

402
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:51,130
companies to potentially hire a guerilla

403
00:16:51,130 --> 00:16:52,660
members so this time we were lucky

404
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:54,250
because these people were just greedy

405
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:55,990
right I mean they it was an anomaly a

406
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:57,820
clear anomaly and we caught them but

407
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:59,320
maybe in the future some other companies

408
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,750
are going to start hiring more more at

409
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:05,200
more attacks and and we might not be

410
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,030
able to detect them so how can we make

411
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:11,589
sure that they are they don't have the

412
00:17:11,589 --> 00:17:14,260
incentive to do this attack so there I

413
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:17,380
mean intuitively it makes sense so and

414
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:20,560
so instead of assigning one only one

415
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:22,660
repair company for one particular region

416
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:25,660
they said well we're gonna take n so

417
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:28,569
we're gonna we're gonna have n companies

418
00:17:28,569 --> 00:17:30,520
servicing that region and then we're

419
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:33,250
gonna choose randomly one the problem is

420
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:35,670
that the bits obviously are not gonna be

421
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:38,710
I'm not gonna be is there's gonna be an

422
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:41,620
overhead before the electric company was

423
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:43,870
paying this for each server for each

424
00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:46,300
service contract and now they're

425
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:47,740
basically paying the maximun of this

426
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:49,080
every time this

427
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:51,179
they ask company right they have an

428
00:17:51,179 --> 00:17:53,250
overhead because they're not selecting

429
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:55,440
the the one that is most competitive but

430
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,909
they're basically saying okay we're

431
00:17:56,909 --> 00:18:01,049
gonna just hire ten of you and then and

432
00:18:01,049 --> 00:18:03,600
then yeah basically have a fixed price

433
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,279
for all of you right so whenever you go

434
00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:08,669
and repair we're gonna ascend so there's

435
00:18:08,669 --> 00:18:09,990
so there's an overhead so they pay more

436
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:14,039
but because because the game is now or

437
00:18:14,039 --> 00:18:16,529
the incentives are on average the

438
00:18:16,529 --> 00:18:19,380
probability that I'm selected to repair

439
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:21,240
if I'm a malicious service company and I

440
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,980
go to the gorilla and ask them to bring

441
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:25,559
down a tower the chances that I'm going

442
00:18:25,559 --> 00:18:27,779
to be called to repair that is one over

443
00:18:27,779 --> 00:18:29,760
N where n is the number of services

444
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,309
companies repairing that area so so now

445
00:18:32,309 --> 00:18:34,289
I'm and I still have to pay the gorilla

446
00:18:34,289 --> 00:18:35,399
so it doesn't matter if they don't call

447
00:18:35,399 --> 00:18:38,850
me I still have to pay them so so then

448
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:42,240
the profit here is the is decreased and

449
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,659
I guess the question was like like how

450
00:18:45,659 --> 00:18:47,909
many services companies do we need so

451
00:18:47,909 --> 00:18:49,740
that they don't have that incentive so

452
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:52,559
that they don't have so that the optimal

453
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:56,730
theta tilde which is the extra number of

454
00:18:56,730 --> 00:18:58,830
I mean they're the ones that I have to

455
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:01,620
pay to bring down it's one or close to

456
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:04,799
one so basically that was what what we

457
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:06,330
did and this is the economic analysis

458
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:09,529
that we did and yeah basically we found

459
00:19:09,529 --> 00:19:12,299
the number of contractors this is the

460
00:19:12,299 --> 00:19:14,070
number of at the optimal number of

461
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:15,929
attacks and it decreases really fast

462
00:19:15,929 --> 00:19:18,419
when the contractors are around addleson

463
00:19:18,419 --> 00:19:21,860
when you have a about like a dozen

464
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:24,029
services company then they really don't

465
00:19:24,029 --> 00:19:26,159
have any incentives in reality now I

466
00:19:26,159 --> 00:19:28,529
forget how much they told me they have I

467
00:19:28,529 --> 00:19:30,679
think it's around here but we think that

468
00:19:30,679 --> 00:19:33,870
basically with the reduced expected

469
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:36,480
benefits and the risk of getting cut

470
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,950
there's this prolly it's like it's not

471
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:39,809
worth it it's not worth to go through

472
00:19:39,809 --> 00:19:41,519
the extra travel to bring down the gray

473
00:19:41,519 --> 00:19:42,380
lesson

474
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:45,210
yeah and basically yeah this is another

475
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:47,940
graph that shows this is without so this

476
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:49,830
would be the profit for example of like

477
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:53,010
the services company when like it starts

478
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:54,090
decreasing like the number of towers

479
00:19:54,090 --> 00:19:56,429
that they bring down it decreases a lot

480
00:19:56,429 --> 00:19:59,789
because again they have to pay more for

481
00:19:59,789 --> 00:20:02,370
more towers brought down

482
00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:06,090
if you have more services companies then

483
00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:09,720
they're really operating at the margin

484
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,970
and if they pay for more they pay for

485
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:14,159
more attacks they actually go into the

486
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:19,409
negative into red so that was basically

487
00:20:19,409 --> 00:20:21,000
the intuition that the details of the

488
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,679
contracts are a little bit more detail

489
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:27,210
so this the power company also changed

490
00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:29,520
the way that the the services company

491
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,820
hired the local population so they said

492
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:34,679
okay so we have services company

493
00:20:34,679 --> 00:20:36,510
actually and they're not from that

494
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:38,399
region so that was another detail of the

495
00:20:38,399 --> 00:20:40,080
contract we're not gonna hire if you're

496
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,309
from that region you have to be a

497
00:20:41,309 --> 00:20:43,440
services company from somewhere else and

498
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,169
you have to bring your own personnel so

499
00:20:46,169 --> 00:20:48,059
we'll pay and that's part of the

500
00:20:48,059 --> 00:20:50,640
increased costs so now we'll pay for you

501
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,080
to bring your own personnel but you

502
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,399
cannot hire locally and the reason for

503
00:20:53,399 --> 00:20:55,770
that was that they also didn't want the

504
00:20:55,770 --> 00:20:58,559
local population to to be motivated to

505
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:02,399
bring down towers and I was asking them

506
00:21:02,399 --> 00:21:05,220
if that happened and they said we don't

507
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:08,610
know if it has happened I was talking to

508
00:21:08,610 --> 00:21:11,429
another people that work in a company in

509
00:21:11,429 --> 00:21:13,470
like like a defense company that ones

510
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:15,360
that gives intelligence to the military

511
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,070
officers and they said in the oil

512
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:18,960
industry this has happened so so people

513
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,899
who are local and repair the pipeline's

514
00:21:20,899 --> 00:21:24,450
they have been found to like actually be

515
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:27,809
the ones putting some of the explosives

516
00:21:27,809 --> 00:21:29,909
to destroy the pipelines because then

517
00:21:29,909 --> 00:21:31,799
the services company comes and they say

518
00:21:31,799 --> 00:21:34,380
well we need five more people or ten

519
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:35,970
more people to help us repair and and

520
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:41,250
and they hire them so so yeah basically

521
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:44,820
the part of the dealings is so first you

522
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:47,370
yeah first you don't it's you you're

523
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:49,590
gonna be selecting and companies not

524
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:51,630
just one second you're not gonna be a

525
00:21:51,630 --> 00:21:54,299
company from their region and third you

526
00:21:54,299 --> 00:21:56,909
basically have to bring your own your

527
00:21:56,909 --> 00:21:58,380
own personnel you cannot hire local

528
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:04,320
people so that's how the contracts were

529
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,789
changed and this is how basically its

530
00:22:05,789 --> 00:22:08,789
operating nowadays to making sure that

531
00:22:08,789 --> 00:22:12,899
this is not not happening now

532
00:22:12,899 --> 00:22:16,320
in terms of just briefly

533
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:19,080
talking about they're gonna make impacts

534
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,940
of these attacks and we've been trying

535
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:24,389
to figure out so what are the damages of

536
00:22:24,389 --> 00:22:25,889
these systems I mean obviously the

537
00:22:25,889 --> 00:22:28,590
utility has to repair pay for the repair

538
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:29,610
services I mean that the government

539
00:22:29,610 --> 00:22:33,240
doesn't give them any any any money for

540
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:35,429
this and also there's no insurance

541
00:22:35,429 --> 00:22:37,380
companies I was asking them if they they

542
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:38,639
were like insurance companies saying

543
00:22:38,639 --> 00:22:42,210
well maybe they can I can I can protect

544
00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:44,580
a tower and they say no there's no no

545
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:45,929
insurance company that is willing to

546
00:22:45,929 --> 00:22:48,029
accept that risk so basically they go

547
00:22:48,029 --> 00:22:50,659
and they have to pay for all the repairs

548
00:22:50,659 --> 00:22:53,610
but the the losses are more than for the

549
00:22:53,610 --> 00:22:58,350
for the electricity company ups there's

550
00:22:58,350 --> 00:23:00,509
also losses for the government because

551
00:23:00,509 --> 00:23:02,159
they have sort of like military forces

552
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:04,470
that have to go and deploy to secure the

553
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:07,139
area the system is also not in optimal

554
00:23:07,139 --> 00:23:09,480
power flow configuration and it's more

555
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:12,929
expensive you have to use more expensive

556
00:23:12,929 --> 00:23:15,000
sources of power sometimes or the way

557
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,009
their system operates so customers have

558
00:23:17,009 --> 00:23:18,600
to pay higher prices

559
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:20,730
there's also impacts of manufacturing

560
00:23:20,730 --> 00:23:25,649
impacts to like spoil goods and then and

561
00:23:25,649 --> 00:23:27,720
there's also social costs of lower power

562
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:32,929
quality interruptions and blackouts

563
00:23:32,929 --> 00:23:37,620
so yeah finding out the problems of this

564
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:42,480
uh of attacks in these systems it's it's

565
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:46,200
it's been very it's it's sort of like a

566
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,730
science that it hasn't been very well

567
00:23:47,730 --> 00:23:50,250
defined one of the most popular ways is

568
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:52,279
something called the value of lost load

569
00:23:52,279 --> 00:23:54,990
but depending on the methods we found

570
00:23:54,990 --> 00:23:56,370
that depending on the methods and

571
00:23:56,370 --> 00:23:58,440
depending on how like how you're valuing

572
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,299
electricity these estimates range

573
00:24:00,299 --> 00:24:03,120
extremely wildly so it's it's really

574
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,220
hard to figure out what is the cost like

575
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:09,629
the social cost of blackouts and also

576
00:24:09,629 --> 00:24:12,000
notice that a blackout is not the only

577
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,559
way that you can damage or have problems

578
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:18,299
with the economy you also have power

579
00:24:18,299 --> 00:24:20,580
quality because it can for example a

580
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:22,500
voltage sags can affect manufacturing in

581
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:26,010
other sectors so there's been a lot of

582
00:24:26,010 --> 00:24:29,880
real-world outages and it's been

583
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:33,390
like the the estimates for each cost for

584
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:35,970
the costs are again very different

585
00:24:35,970 --> 00:24:39,450
depending on what happens then one of

586
00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:41,549
the most repeated ones is the North

587
00:24:41,549 --> 00:24:44,280
America Northeast blackout and Canada

588
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:46,860
between the u.s. and Canada it affected

589
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:49,020
50 million people for one to four days

590
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:51,480
and the cost that the OEM keeps

591
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:54,570
mentioning is six billion dollars but we

592
00:24:54,570 --> 00:24:56,820
also found several reports saying well

593
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:58,679
it was less it was much more so it's

594
00:24:58,679 --> 00:25:00,539
it's it's really difficult to figure out

595
00:25:00,539 --> 00:25:04,020
what is the precise expenses of attacks

596
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:05,520
and and that makes us that makes it

597
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,750
really difficult to figure out what is

598
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:08,820
there like what is the risk right

599
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:11,429
because well utilities know what is the

600
00:25:11,429 --> 00:25:14,970
cost but not the social cost so I think

601
00:25:14,970 --> 00:25:18,809
I am already time up so I'm gonna

602
00:25:18,809 --> 00:25:20,340
quickly go through the through the

603
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:22,799
remaining slides one of the biggest

604
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:25,020
problems of finding also the impact of

605
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:27,419
attacks is the analysis the of long-term

606
00:25:27,419 --> 00:25:29,610
impacts so people in general don't

607
00:25:29,610 --> 00:25:31,140
understand what is the long-term impacts

608
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:33,809
because you have well you know what is

609
00:25:33,809 --> 00:25:35,039
the immediate impact but the long-term

610
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:36,809
impact for example reduced confidence of

611
00:25:36,809 --> 00:25:40,350
investors and and like and and social

612
00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:45,630
security might be some problems so so

613
00:25:45,630 --> 00:25:47,070
far I have been focusing on physical

614
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:48,809
attacks just quickly the last two slides

615
00:25:48,809 --> 00:25:51,510
so what happens in cyber so one of the

616
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:52,950
biggest difference is that in physical

617
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:54,900
attacks is really difficult to be an

618
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:56,880
like a strategic adversary so you

619
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:59,220
basically attack more on opportunity

620
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:01,500
than like okay like that's sitting down

621
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:03,750
and saying well this is the main power

622
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:05,820
grid and I'm going to attack this this

623
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:08,190
and these points simultaneously and that

624
00:26:08,190 --> 00:26:11,190
will bring down the grid in the in cyber

625
00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:13,350
you can scale through a single point of

626
00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:14,669
entry so you only need one point of

627
00:26:14,669 --> 00:26:17,299
point of entry and potentially escape

628
00:26:17,299 --> 00:26:21,000
cost higher damages and this is related

629
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,720
to Ukraine I guess I missed the talk on

630
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:28,320
Tuesday I was in another meeting but as

631
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,809
marina was mentioning I guess this is it

632
00:26:30,809 --> 00:26:32,520
was not they haven't been terribly

633
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:34,280
disruptive compared to previous

634
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:36,929
blackouts or or a lecture like the major

635
00:26:36,929 --> 00:26:40,169
ones and there were I on Tuesday I think

636
00:26:40,169 --> 00:26:41,250
they were saying well maybe they're

637
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:42,840
using it as a training ground not as I

638
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:43,620
like okay

639
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:45,770
want to create massive chaos in Ukraine

640
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:48,150
so I've been working with Professor Ross

641
00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:50,790
Baltic to try to model the same thing

642
00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:53,040
the same type of attack seen in Texas

643
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,420
because Texas is sort of like their own

644
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:55,620
power grid and it's actually been really

645
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:58,770
difficult to figure out so professor

646
00:26:58,770 --> 00:27:00,690
Baltic has a simulator for cascade

647
00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:03,000
attacks and he's been using it for to

648
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,800
predict the impact of damages like

649
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:08,610
storms and things like that but to take

650
00:27:08,610 --> 00:27:10,200
over sort of like a utility and make

651
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,730
sure that for example open all the

652
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:13,050
relays as what they were doing in

653
00:27:13,050 --> 00:27:15,059
Ukraine it turns out to be a little bit

654
00:27:15,059 --> 00:27:16,770
tricky and it we were still working on

655
00:27:16,770 --> 00:27:21,660
it but that's for future work just gonna

656
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:23,309
glance through this so I mean it's our

657
00:27:23,309 --> 00:27:25,050
cyber attacks and physical attacks are

658
00:27:25,050 --> 00:27:26,400
not the only problem I mean there's

659
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,500
actually a website that keeps track of

660
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:31,040
for example the number of attacks that

661
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,910
squirrels cause or the number of

662
00:27:32,910 --> 00:27:34,440
blackouts that squirrels cross in the

663
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,179
u.s. is full it's called cyber squirrel

664
00:27:36,179 --> 00:27:38,100
and squirrels are not even the main

665
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:41,070
source of lot of small blackouts are the

666
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:45,690
main sources trees so yeah I was reading

667
00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:46,830
him before this presentation that

668
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:48,600
actually a monkey cost a nationwide

669
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:54,929
blackout in Kenya in 2016 so in summary

670
00:27:54,929 --> 00:27:57,210
basically what we're trying to do is the

671
00:27:57,210 --> 00:27:59,850
main message is we want to figure out

672
00:27:59,850 --> 00:28:02,040
what is the risk so that we know how to

673
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:04,650
better protect these systems and it's

674
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:06,750
still ongoing work it's really hard to

675
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:08,809
figure out what are the consequences of

676
00:28:08,809 --> 00:28:11,490
physical and cyber attacks we're trying

677
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:13,679
to model what's gonna happen in Texas on

678
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:16,170
this so we can try to figure out to

679
00:28:16,170 --> 00:28:18,990
reproduce Ukraine style attack in Texas

680
00:28:18,990 --> 00:28:21,630
with using our real simulator of the

681
00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:24,420
Texas power system and this will help us

682
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:26,700
solve some of the most challenging

683
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:28,470
problems such as like how to figure out

684
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:31,470
for cyber insurance how much we need how

685
00:28:31,470 --> 00:28:33,179
dealing with catastrophic risks because

686
00:28:33,179 --> 00:28:34,890
some some things are not going to be

687
00:28:34,890 --> 00:28:38,360
worth it for insurance companies and

688
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:40,170
potentially because it's this is going

689
00:28:40,170 --> 00:28:42,870
to be sort of like a market failure what

690
00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:45,090
is the role of the government in in in

691
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:47,220
market interventions how to maybe

692
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:49,050
subsidize some of the insurance

693
00:28:49,050 --> 00:28:53,220
companies to to get more involved in

694
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:55,500
this with the help of the government so

695
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:57,300
there are some of the questions for the

696
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:57,580
future

697
00:28:57,580 --> 00:29:01,090
so with that yeah I'll be open to

698
00:29:01,090 --> 00:29:05,380
questions thank you thank you Alvaro a

699
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:07,630
bit over time but we might have time for

700
00:29:07,630 --> 00:29:10,390
one or two short questions are any

701
00:29:10,390 --> 00:29:15,580
questions another question from the

702
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:17,970
audience I have one question

703
00:29:17,970 --> 00:29:22,630
naturally if you just talked about this

704
00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:25,630
but your model is an economic one

705
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:29,080
yeah and so it deals in your example if

706
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:32,160
people are trying to to maximise where

707
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:37,510
yeah win yeah to try to earn as much

708
00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:39,940
money as we can write if you model a

709
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:41,710
nation-state attacks

710
00:29:41,710 --> 00:29:43,960
yeah can just be modeled in a similar

711
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:46,260
way or has supposed to be done very

712
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:49,060
different yeah that's really challenging

713
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:50,980
question because yeah these are

714
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:53,680
basically industry they're like whatever

715
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:56,260
what would benefit them foreign nation

716
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:58,900
attacks it's it becomes very political

717
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:00,460
right and as well as social you want to

718
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:02,110
create unrest you you might want to

719
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:04,000
create your yeah your motivation might

720
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,760
not be only like economical gains but I

721
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:08,730
mean there's some work on that I mean

722
00:30:08,730 --> 00:30:11,290
there's a economics it's not only about

723
00:30:11,290 --> 00:30:12,640
money but it's also about social

724
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:15,610
dynamics basically so there could be

725
00:30:15,610 --> 00:30:17,320
there are ways that we can try to model

726
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:19,240
it but we yeah we haven't started yet

727
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:20,860
but that's an interesting it's a good

728
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:23,140
question yeah or a good direction okay

729
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:25,530
thank you
