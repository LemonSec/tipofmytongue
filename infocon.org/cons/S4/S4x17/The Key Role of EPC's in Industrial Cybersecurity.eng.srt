2
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:16,500
thank you it's as you can imagine being

3
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:19,710
a Spanish having a Cuban wife and living

4
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:22,680
in United Arab Emirates it's always a

5
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:27,119
pleasure to be Miami so first of all now

6
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:32,130
that you know something about me I would

7
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:34,290
like to know something about you how

8
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:37,140
many of you work in an EPC please raise

9
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:43,230
your hand and how many of you know what

10
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:48,450
an EPC is okay good so the first

11
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:51,210
conclusion about this is that we are

12
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:54,059
missing an important player today here

13
00:00:54,059 --> 00:00:56,910
because I will try to describe during

14
00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:00,690
the next 30 minutes what the role of the

15
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:03,059
EP sees how the EP sees the engineering

16
00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:05,339
procurement and construction companies

17
00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:08,040
have a key role in the industry

18
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:10,950
establish security in how to improve our

19
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:14,570
security posture and for that I will use

20
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:19,049
an example of a movie old movie by the

21
00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:22,439
way some sounds should be sounding well

22
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:25,409
now about the the good the bad and the

23
00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:27,869
ugly in this movie there are three men

24
00:01:27,869 --> 00:01:30,479
that know where some gold is hidden one

25
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:33,000
of them know that what cemetery it's in

26
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,210
the other one know which brave and the

27
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:38,930
last one know that it says and that's

28
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:41,880
basically something similar to what's

29
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:44,430
happening to our industrials have a

30
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:47,189
security ecosystem because I think that

31
00:01:47,189 --> 00:01:50,009
most of us at least the ones that are

32
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:52,229
attending today to this conference know

33
00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:55,470
that the goal our goal is to inject

34
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:58,939
cyber security in all of our industrial

35
00:01:58,939 --> 00:02:01,619
infrastructures in our industrial

36
00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:03,719
infrastructure life cycle from the very

37
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:06,119
beginning from the conceptual design the

38
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:08,550
initial specifications including what we

39
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:09,869
need and what we want

40
00:02:09,869 --> 00:02:11,849
through the front engineering and the

41
00:02:11,849 --> 00:02:13,350
detail engineering

42
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:15,510
perfectly designing the proper

43
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:17,670
architectures and the solution that we

44
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:20,460
need including cybersecurity in the

45
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:22,290
procurement language and of course

46
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:25,620
testing how this is being implemented

47
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:27,600
through the factory acceptance testing

48
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,340
through the integrated factory

49
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:31,290
acceptance testing the site are set and

50
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:33,390
testing all everything this is a

51
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:35,970
challenge of course and especially if we

52
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:39,360
look at the duration we'll focus in this

53
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,000
presentation on big industrial projects

54
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,890
on what it's called mega project so the

55
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:48,510
general duration for these stages for

56
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:49,860
the requirements usually in this project

57
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:53,220
takes between 6 months and one year

58
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:55,710
sometimes more than that two years the

59
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:59,040
design phase may take until probably up

60
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,980
to two years to three years and the

61
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:04,530
construction depends on the industry

62
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:07,350
infrastructure but for sure we'll take

63
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:09,510
more than two years three years four

64
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:13,320
years so even assuming that the critical

65
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,210
infrastructure that the industrial

66
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:16,980
company is doing the right thing that is

67
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:19,500
basically requiring cyber security at

68
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:22,230
the very beginning of the project from

69
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:24,510
that time to the time that we are

70
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:27,000
commissioning the infrastructure will

71
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,910
pass something like six seven eight

72
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:32,790
years nine years so as you can imagine

73
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:35,220
even those requirements and the

74
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:37,290
solutions at the threat landscape is

75
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:40,650
changing a lot during this year so we

76
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:42,600
will be facing important challenges on

77
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:46,140
how to adapt during this project and we

78
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:49,020
know where the goal is but we don't

79
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:51,540
really know who's the good who's the bad

80
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:53,790
or who's the ugly in in this industry

81
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:56,160
every security is consistent and let me

82
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:59,280
try to describe in this plane which are

83
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,950
the main players for that of course we

84
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:03,870
have the government's and governments

85
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:05,880
want to protect the in critical

86
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,710
infrastructure and the essential

87
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:09,780
services for the society and usually

88
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:12,870
published regulations and require cyber

89
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:15,090
security to the critical infrastructure

90
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:16,850
to the different sectors and then

91
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:19,048
industrial companies and critical

92
00:04:19,048 --> 00:04:21,358
infrastructures when they want to build

93
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:23,370
a new industrial plan on it includes

94
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:25,620
cyber security in their infrastructures

95
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:27,630
they usually hire

96
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:29,250
the eyepieces the engineering

97
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:31,440
procurement and construction companies

98
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,770
these companies execute the whole

99
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:37,350
project as a turnkey project including

100
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:39,270
everything I will talk about this later

101
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:42,330
but basically for that they hire

102
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:44,460
additional players basically the

103
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:45,750
management I work with industrial

104
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:48,450
vendors they manage and they hire a

105
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:50,190
different system integrators in the

106
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:52,710
greatest missions also the cybersecurity

107
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:55,530
and IT vendors and a bunch of third

108
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:58,050
parties in these products so we are

109
00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:00,660
talking about Troy at six seven eight

110
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:02,670
nine years with a lot of different

111
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:05,280
players with different objectives and

112
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,320
honestly at this time of representation

113
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:10,650
I can I cannot say who can be the good

114
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:12,990
who can be the bad or who can be the

115
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:15,960
ugly in this ecosystem I'm sure that you

116
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:19,140
probably cannot do that either so let me

117
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:21,990
focus now on the ABCs as I already

118
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:25,410
mentioned species executes industrial

119
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:27,660
mega projects as turn cane projects for

120
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,580
the industrial companies and this

121
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:32,460
includes everything I'm simplifying here

122
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:35,640
this this relationship because sometimes

123
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,650
there is an additional pressure between

124
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:39,810
the industrial company and a PC that is

125
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:41,970
the PMC the project management

126
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:44,160
consultant that is an independent plot

127
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,830
independent player that oversees how the

128
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:50,040
EPC is executing the work but basically

129
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:52,980
pcs include everything in this project

130
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:55,710
from the engineering the procurement the

131
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:57,660
construction the implementation of

132
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:00,630
technologies system integration testing

133
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:02,940
and of course all the solutions how to

134
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:05,940
make some instrumentation piping safety

135
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:10,020
o te ITI cyber security everything they

136
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:12,300
have to deal with everything and they

137
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:13,800
have to manage all of the diviners

138
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,510
industrial vendors cyber security

139
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:18,960
vendors third-party vendors and I'm sure

140
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,840
that you know a lot of you pieces here

141
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,790
I'm representing as an example some of

142
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:25,710
the main pieces in the oil and gas

143
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:28,800
sector and as you can see these are not

144
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,140
a small companies yes the opposite these

145
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:33,660
are some of the biggest companies in the

146
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:34,050
world

147
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:38,280
with more than 1,000 employees and a lot

148
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:40,350
of millions of revenues so there are

149
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:41,280
companies with

150
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,500
strong capabilities on automation on

151
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:46,139
piping on the industrial processes but I

152
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:48,450
anticipate that the reality these days

153
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:50,400
is that the lack of the right

154
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,860
capabilities on cybersecurity

155
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:56,910
generally speaking usually we talk about

156
00:06:56,910 --> 00:06:59,190
the interdependencies of the different

157
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:01,830
sectors oil and gas water transport etc

158
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:04,919
but I want to highlight here that EP

159
00:07:04,919 --> 00:07:05,370
seas

160
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:08,070
play a crucial role and the impact of

161
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:09,990
insufficient cyber security in the

162
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:13,830
project is now affecting and can be

163
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:15,990
devastating to the protecting of our

164
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:18,540
critical infrastructures to our national

165
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:20,940
security because they are the ones that

166
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:23,940
are building they that are designing and

167
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:26,220
constructing the oil and gas

168
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:28,380
infrastructure the superstations

169
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:34,770
the water desalination plants yes the

170
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:36,510
asset orders are recurring cybersecurity

171
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:39,690
but sometimes the way that EP sees are

172
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:41,430
addressing these requirements are not

173
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:47,490
the right way so let me now that we know

174
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:49,229
something about the pieces let me share

175
00:07:49,229 --> 00:07:51,540
with you what's the reality what are the

176
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:54,150
challenges that they as business as

177
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:56,580
companies are facing these days first of

178
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:58,550
all they have important technical

179
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:01,950
challenges because we have talked a lot

180
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:04,530
about the convergence about IT and ot

181
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:07,169
and this is new for them because they

182
00:08:07,169 --> 00:08:08,490
are accustomed and have a strong

183
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:11,310
capabilities some of the topics but they

184
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:13,229
are lacking of important ones on the

185
00:08:13,229 --> 00:08:16,770
others of course the cost is an

186
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:18,479
important challenge for them because

187
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:21,150
they manage the project has lump sum

188
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:24,030
projects in other words as fixed price

189
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:27,810
they are awarded with a project for this

190
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:30,660
amount of money and the staff to execute

191
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:33,030
the project within this budget the

192
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:35,880
product with that is that due to their

193
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:38,549
lack of knowledge and capabilities on

194
00:08:38,549 --> 00:08:40,860
cybersecurity sometimes they agree to

195
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:43,589
some requirements that then later on

196
00:08:43,589 --> 00:08:46,380
they discover that they there are some

197
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:48,630
deviations of the scope and of course

198
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:50,700
the quality is also a challenge because

199
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:52,740
they are managing a lot of different

200
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,630
locations they are managing different

201
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:55,160
provide

202
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,910
and again due to the lack of

203
00:08:57,910 --> 00:09:00,560
cybersecurity capabilities sometimes

204
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,680
they can not differentiate about

205
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,970
providers industrial cybersecurity

206
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:08,090
service providers another challenge is

207
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:10,730
the schedule the schedules these days

208
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:14,390
for the PCs are more tannin that they

209
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:15,410
were in the past

210
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:17,240
they are shortened in time so they are

211
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:20,330
very worried and they have concerns

212
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:22,220
about the cybersecurity activities

213
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:24,440
because the cybersecurity activities are

214
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,060
new activities that they don't know and

215
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:28,970
the Year afraid that some delays can't

216
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:31,400
happen due to those those activities of

217
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,680
course the size of the project I will

218
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,570
talk much more about this in the next

219
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:37,790
slide is one of the biggest challenges

220
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:40,580
because they are managing make really

221
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:43,070
big projects where the cyber city

222
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:45,380
security is only a small part a small

223
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:47,210
part of the project but the impact of

224
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:49,070
cyber security is very big in the

225
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:51,470
private safety as you can imagine

226
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:55,790
managing safety of more than 25,000

227
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:57,560
people in this project it's very

228
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:00,380
difficult but they have a strong

229
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:02,840
capabilities on safety the problem comes

230
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:05,060
with the convergence between the cyber

231
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:06,350
and the physical world

232
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:09,080
so the half also to manage these things

233
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:12,260
and this is something new for them one

234
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:13,880
more thing that they have to deal with

235
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:17,600
is the competition usually this mega

236
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,810
projects are awarded to an EPC work on

237
00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:24,170
sourcing manasa pieces what today is a

238
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:26,600
partner for the EPC in the next pro year

239
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,910
will be a competitive so some of the

240
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:30,590
challenges that they have to face is to

241
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:33,320
how to share only the minimal

242
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,420
information with his partner or their

243
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:37,430
opponent because in the next project

244
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:40,340
probably they will have a new competitor

245
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:42,950
for that and the last but not least is

246
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:45,470
the capabilities the surface strong

247
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:47,810
capabilities in lot of topics but

248
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:50,180
unfortunately most of them they lack of

249
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:53,680
the proper cybersecurity skillsets and

250
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,900
knowledge so summarizing about the

251
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:59,240
pieces they are facing a lot of

252
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,220
challenges in their business cyber

253
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:03,980
security challenges are new for them and

254
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:07,130
they need to adapt now to this reality

255
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:08,779
to the evolving

256
00:11:08,779 --> 00:11:11,540
threat landscape to the new regulations

257
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:13,160
coming for cybersecurity to the

258
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:15,290
certifications as we have been talk in

259
00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:18,860
the previous presentations and they need

260
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:21,199
to build a new body proposition to

261
00:11:21,199 --> 00:11:23,000
empower their business so it's key for

262
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,139
them but they are not here most of them

263
00:11:26,139 --> 00:11:29,079
to address the cybersecurity challenges

264
00:11:29,079 --> 00:11:33,519
so now that we know how an EPC is

265
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:36,230
working and what are the challenges let

266
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:38,750
me share with you how a real Mir project

267
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:41,600
looks like usually and this is based in

268
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,839
a real project that I'm working on it's

269
00:11:44,839 --> 00:11:48,259
a eight years project with more than 3.5

270
00:11:48,259 --> 00:11:51,199
billion dollars budget it's good looks

271
00:11:51,199 --> 00:11:53,300
good for cybersecurity right in the

272
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:57,259
design stage it has been used more than

273
00:11:57,259 --> 00:12:01,009
4 million man-hours and more than 50,000

274
00:12:01,009 --> 00:12:03,079
design grounds have been produced and

275
00:12:03,079 --> 00:12:06,379
what about the construction more than 20

276
00:12:06,379 --> 00:12:09,769
million man-hours with 10,000 workers

277
00:12:09,769 --> 00:12:13,540
have produced an infrastructure that is

278
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:17,329
66 thousand tons in weight with more

279
00:12:17,329 --> 00:12:20,410
than six six thousand volts more than

280
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:23,750
250 kilometres of piping more than more

281
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:27,920
than 225 kilometers of cable big numbers

282
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,800
impressive at least for me first time

283
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,449
that I started to work with this mega

284
00:12:32,449 --> 00:12:36,319
project I was really impressed but I am

285
00:12:36,319 --> 00:12:38,720
much more impressed for the next number

286
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,019
that I will share with you based on some

287
00:12:42,019 --> 00:12:45,470
analysis that we have done 64 percent of

288
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:47,870
these mega projects are facing cost

289
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:51,350
overruns 73 percent of this money

290
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:53,449
opponents are reporting schedule delays

291
00:12:53,449 --> 00:12:56,540
and all of them are facing budget

292
00:12:56,540 --> 00:13:00,920
overruns so as you can imagine if you

293
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:03,769
are an EPC you are dealing with really

294
00:13:03,769 --> 00:13:07,189
big challenges and then we are coming

295
00:13:07,189 --> 00:13:09,589
and you as at owners are coming with new

296
00:13:09,589 --> 00:13:11,720
challenges we cyber security something

297
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:15,740
will you so how cyber security looks

298
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:19,880
like in this real mega project I told

299
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,420
you that I'm coming from Abu Dhabi

300
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:24,720
so let's assume that this the budget of

301
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,089
the project is like the Burj Khalifa the

302
00:13:27,089 --> 00:13:29,730
tallest building in the world in Dubai

303
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:32,760
okay so how do you think the

304
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:36,390
cybersecurity budget will be maybe like

305
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:41,820
the Trump Tower the Petronas Towers this

306
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:47,130
theater an idea cybersecurity budget

307
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:52,050
looks like that can you see that no is

308
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:58,920
there it's here but what I wanted to

309
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,560
share with you is that this

310
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:04,709
representation is oversized to be

311
00:14:04,709 --> 00:14:06,690
visible the reality is that

312
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:10,440
cybersecurity is a really really a small

313
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,899
part of these mega projects from the

314
00:14:12,899 --> 00:14:15,620
budget perspective but the impact of

315
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:17,700
cybersecurity in these projects can be

316
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:21,420
devastating I'm based on some safety

317
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:24,420
analysis and cyber safety analysis I'm

318
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:26,339
sure that you are aware of some of these

319
00:14:26,339 --> 00:14:29,040
studies cybersecurity should be taking

320
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,290
more seriously from the very beginning

321
00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:33,440
of the project and I will try to explain

322
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:36,990
something else about that for the sound

323
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:39,029
technician I would appreciate if you can

324
00:14:39,029 --> 00:14:41,100
activate the sound in the in the slides

325
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:46,440
so from this small piece of war that is

326
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,300
the cyber security against the Bush

327
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:51,120
Khalifa what are the things that usually

328
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,370
are included in this scope of work for

329
00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:56,940
cyber security basically the activities

330
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:58,920
are focused on the detail engineering so

331
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:02,430
basically reviewing the architecture

332
00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:04,529
doing a risk assessment of cybersecurity

333
00:15:04,529 --> 00:15:07,290
assessment all of the drawings of the

334
00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:11,040
the time design or the from design

335
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,190
engineering everything and then testing

336
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:15,870
the capabilities implemented during the

337
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:16,500
f80

338
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:19,620
during the integrated SAT and SAT and

339
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:22,199
these are the numbers that reflects a

340
00:15:22,199 --> 00:15:24,600
real cybersecurity study for these mega

341
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,310
projects usually we are talking about

342
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:29,040
about 70 I'm talking about oil and gas

343
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:33,329
here about 70 main systems from them for

344
00:15:33,329 --> 00:15:35,130
are they

345
00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:36,780
part of the integrated control safety

346
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:41,040
season this year CSD furring us six more

347
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,690
or less the electric assistance the

348
00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:45,210
power management systems 20 telecom

349
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:49,310
system and 40 and ciliary systems I call

350
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:52,650
I call a silly resistance those systems

351
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:55,560
are something like auctioneer to support

352
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:57,300
some of the projects all of these

353
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:59,910
systems at the end are coming from 20

354
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:03,210
industrial vendors four of them are some

355
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:05,760
of the ones that we have here that have

356
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:08,070
been working a lot during the last years

357
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:10,290
to have a strong capabilities on cyber

358
00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:12,630
security to have good solutions and to

359
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:16,250
have good approaches but honestly the 16

360
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:19,230
father are really small industrial

361
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:21,690
vendors some from Italy from Spain from

362
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:24,720
different countries that the reality of

363
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,340
this industrial vendors is completely

364
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:28,050
different from the ones that you know or

365
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:29,970
the from the big ones sometimes they

366
00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:33,090
don't have a cybersecurity guy so when

367
00:16:33,090 --> 00:16:35,640
you come to them with the results of a

368
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:36,960
risk assessment or a cybersecurity

369
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:39,300
assessment and ask them about the

370
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:41,580
capabilities that their solution their

371
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:43,110
approach their architecture or the

372
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:46,320
device is providing they don't know they

373
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,720
don't understand you so it's a big

374
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,000
challenge I'm talking about the more

375
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,310
they the technical part we are talking

376
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:56,280
about more than 1,000 IP addresses more

377
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:58,590
than 600 documents to be revealed from

378
00:16:58,590 --> 00:17:00,330
the cybersecurity perspective and more

379
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:06,450
than 220 thousand pages so let me now

380
00:17:06,450 --> 00:17:10,290
talk about how these look like during

381
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:13,410
the life of the project what I had tried

382
00:17:13,410 --> 00:17:15,930
to represent here is how the scope of

383
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:18,750
work for the cyber security evolves

384
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:21,390
during the project so at the very

385
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:23,400
beginning and we are talking about seven

386
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:26,430
years ago the industrial company issues

387
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:29,700
an RFP reporting a number of things for

388
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:33,720
cybersecurity then the EPC replies to

389
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:37,830
that RFP understanding I would not say

390
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:39,270
maliciously but understanding the

391
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:40,800
difference copper for that is the red

392
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:43,340
one that you can see that okay but

393
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:47,070
contractually they EPC agree to the

394
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:48,990
original scope of work

395
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:51,660
dumb-bunny why because they really

396
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:54,900
didn't understand this this scope of

397
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:57,690
work and of course EPC as the industrial

398
00:17:57,690 --> 00:17:59,340
vendor to provide the solutions by the

399
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:00,990
understood that it had to provide the

400
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:04,650
plug at the band's during five six years

401
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:07,470
and then they involve an industrial

402
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:10,710
cybersecurity independent adviser to do

403
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:14,040
this cybersecurity activities and what

404
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:16,620
happens is that we discover that most of

405
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:17,970
the things that industrial company is

406
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:19,380
required from the cyber security

407
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:22,490
perspective have not been included so

408
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:26,040
they start a negotiation or how to adapt

409
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:29,070
the scope of work so the apt need to

410
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:32,040
start growing the original scope of work

411
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,929
to comply with the original scope of

412
00:18:33,929 --> 00:18:35,520
work of the industrial company and

413
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,960
something is an industrial company

414
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,450
decrease a little bit because based on

415
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:41,640
the risk and the investment maybe it

416
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:42,900
doesn't make sense to include some of

417
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:44,640
the activities of course industrial

418
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,010
vendor today especially the big ones are

419
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:49,410
ready to reply to that to respond in a

420
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:51,450
good way so tell me what do you need

421
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:55,320
I will give you what I have these at the

422
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:58,740
end of the project as you can see gives

423
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:02,040
a important scope deviation for the EPC

424
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:05,280
and this has important financial impact

425
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:08,760
for the for the company so my question

426
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:13,880
um I have a dupe if a piece is

427
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,929
industrial vendors and industrial

428
00:19:15,929 --> 00:19:18,090
companies can work together to improve

429
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:21,000
the protection because basically

430
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,340
industrial companies want the

431
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:25,800
infrastructure to be secure EPC

432
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:28,380
want to the project to be closed and

433
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:30,450
basically the industrial vendors want to

434
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:32,280
know what they the others want really

435
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:34,320
want to reply and and to offer the

436
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:37,080
solutions that they have so let me try

437
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:39,750
to explain to you some of my advice

438
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:42,809
first of all always starts by harnessing

439
00:19:42,809 --> 00:19:44,940
collaboration coordination and

440
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:48,900
commitment it's completely important to

441
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:51,540
build trust and confidence relationships

442
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:54,720
between these three players and my

443
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:57,030
advice is to establish an industrial

444
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:59,160
industrial cybersecurity wardrobe or

445
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:01,530
committee during the whole life of the

446
00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:02,670
project

447
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:05,310
because in in in this way we will

448
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:07,410
include relevant stakeholders in the

449
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:09,240
project for the cybersecurity and we

450
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,670
will address things that have to be

451
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:13,500
addressed from the very beginning what

452
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:16,920
should not happen is that happened to me

453
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:20,310
in some project that the EP sees the

454
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:22,350
industrial company and the industrial

455
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:25,260
vendors sit together for the first time

456
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:26,400
in the project to talk about

457
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:29,820
cybersecurity six years after the

458
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:30,870
beginning of the project

459
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:34,500
honestly first time on this mega project

460
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:37,140
eight nine years made a profit for the

461
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:38,820
three players to sit together to talk

462
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,830
about cybersecurity six year from the

463
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:43,230
beginning of course then the skoda be

464
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:49,200
Asians appear what about the PCs you

465
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,910
already mentioned and share with you at

466
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:52,710
the very beginning I think that the lack

467
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:54,630
of the right cybersecurity skillsets and

468
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:56,610
capabilities and they need them and they

469
00:20:56,610 --> 00:20:57,750
need it now

470
00:20:57,750 --> 00:21:01,830
so first I think that they should build

471
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:04,110
and their industrial cybersecurity power

472
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:08,040
capabilities because these will strength

473
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:10,350
their offering and will help them

474
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:12,420
understand the reality of a scope of

475
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:14,430
work and the reality of the needs of

476
00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:16,920
their clients and as important as

477
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,480
building their own industrial

478
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,430
cybersecurity capabilities is to

479
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:22,350
integrate them with their sixth

480
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:25,910
abilities of automation safety etc and

481
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:28,950
another thing that they should do is

482
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:31,020
establish a permanent industrial

483
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:33,960
cybersecurity role for exploit it's

484
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:37,350
completely needed because basically

485
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:40,890
different things are appearing as they

486
00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:42,330
procure the banks and it's very

487
00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:44,370
important to have a clear accountability

488
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:46,320
of the cybersecurity throughout the

489
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:49,230
trial lifecycle so first bill industrial

490
00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:50,550
cyber security capabilities and

491
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:53,400
integrate them with their existing

492
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,620
capabilities about safety automation etc

493
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:58,020
and second establish a permanent role

494
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:00,270
for industrial cyber security in its

495
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:03,000
project what about the industrial

496
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,120
companies they have to do what I think

497
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:08,040
that most of them are starting to do

498
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:10,290
basically ensuring that cyber security

499
00:22:10,290 --> 00:22:12,630
is injected and properly managed

500
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:14,040
throughout all the infrastructure

501
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:16,559
lifecycle so basically finding the go

502
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:19,889
that we are looking for in all of the

503
00:22:19,889 --> 00:22:24,659
infrastructure lifecycle and based on

504
00:22:24,659 --> 00:22:26,879
this discussion and what I have shared

505
00:22:26,879 --> 00:22:31,080
with you you can see that there are very

506
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:34,919
complex relationships multiple supply

507
00:22:34,919 --> 00:22:38,519
chains and really deep supply chains and

508
00:22:38,519 --> 00:22:41,070
completely different objectives so my

509
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:44,070
advice is that an independent industrial

510
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:47,220
cyber security trusted contractor should

511
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:51,570
help them to come together and to work

512
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:53,850
together and to look at the project in a

513
00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:55,710
similar way that the PNC the project

514
00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:57,539
management consultant is doing from the

515
00:22:57,539 --> 00:22:59,159
overall project from the cybersecurity

516
00:22:59,159 --> 00:23:03,119
but this independent trusted contractor

517
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:05,759
so that as a catalyst and oversees the

518
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:07,409
cybersecurity activities throughout the

519
00:23:07,409 --> 00:23:10,259
whole life cycle of the project should

520
00:23:10,259 --> 00:23:12,029
manage the interfaces with the key

521
00:23:12,029 --> 00:23:13,919
stakeholders reduce prior and

522
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:16,799
implementation risk and at the app this

523
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:20,809
would empower the PC business and would

524
00:23:20,809 --> 00:23:24,119
put a better security posture for the

525
00:23:24,119 --> 00:23:25,980
industrial company so its benefits for

526
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:31,820
all of the players based on this I

527
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:34,470
started the presentation talking about

528
00:23:34,470 --> 00:23:37,679
who's the good who can be the bad who

529
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:41,850
can be the ugly and I good after you

530
00:23:41,850 --> 00:23:44,490
hook who is the who's who here who's the

531
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:46,440
good cause the bad for you and who's the

532
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:49,139
army but the reality is that D doesn't

533
00:23:49,139 --> 00:23:51,119
matter it doesn't matter who's the good

534
00:23:51,119 --> 00:23:54,419
because we are not looking for guilties

535
00:23:54,419 --> 00:23:56,879
we are looking for solutions and the

536
00:23:56,879 --> 00:24:01,039
only way to advance and to protect our

537
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:03,600
infrastructures is to come together to

538
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,749
work together to collaborate to be

539
00:24:06,749 --> 00:24:08,940
coordinating and to establish commitment

540
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:11,580
between all of them my advice is that

541
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:15,570
you should not wait until next project

542
00:24:15,570 --> 00:24:18,810
you should not wait until

543
00:24:18,810 --> 00:24:20,940
next week and you should start in

544
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:23,280
tonight's party so go for it

545
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:26,149
thank you so much

546
00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:30,769
