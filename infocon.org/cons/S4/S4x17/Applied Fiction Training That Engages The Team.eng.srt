00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:09,880
[Applause]

3
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:12,949
[Music]

4
00:00:13,269 --> 00:00:16,580
so I'm Chris from Metta mythic this is

5
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:19,730
Lisa from Arizona public service Lisa

6
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:20,930
and I have been working together for

7
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:23,990
about 2-3 years on an initiative that is

8
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:26,689
really near and dear to our hearts and

9
00:00:26,689 --> 00:00:28,340
at this point really near and dear to

10
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:30,439
the hearts of several thousand people in

11
00:00:30,439 --> 00:00:32,390
the industry we want to tell you the

12
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:34,760
story this story and we also want to

13
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:36,200
encourage you to join the rebellion

14
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,270
before I talk about what the rebellion

15
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:40,640
is I want to talk about this conference

16
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,000
because this conference has been we went

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:44,929
out to dinner last night where time

18
00:00:44,929 --> 00:00:46,850
about how energizing this conference

19
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:48,890
incredibly energizing so many new ideas

20
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:50,780
actually this time right I mean I feel

21
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:52,489
like I walked in with this energy level

22
00:00:52,489 --> 00:00:54,320
and I'm leaving with an energy level up

23
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,359
here every person I sit down and talk to

24
00:00:56,359 --> 00:00:58,760
is a thinker or somebody putting new

25
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:00,649
things into practice and I think that

26
00:01:00,649 --> 00:01:03,409
really that's a really a core thread of

27
00:01:03,409 --> 00:01:07,430
s4 is that we are we're systems people

28
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:09,080
and we are building amazing systems

29
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:11,390
we've got better tools I mean we can we

30
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:13,460
can counter drone threats at this point

31
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:16,280
we've got better technology we've gone

32
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:18,620
through that decade of kind of a lost

33
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:20,330
decade that we've heard several speakers

34
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:22,130
talk about and things are accelerating

35
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:23,990
and we have better algorithms and

36
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:25,220
machine learning was that not an

37
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:27,320
interesting presentation earlier today

38
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:30,260
and so with with all these things

39
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:32,330
there's this thread but when when we

40
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:33,830
were talking last night Lisa brought up

41
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:35,870
something to me of another thread that

42
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:37,430
she feels is happening at this

43
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:39,860
conference and when she presented to me

44
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:40,970
I thought you know I think you're right

45
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:44,390
and it's it's almost a subversive thread

46
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:46,190
it's it's something that's a little

47
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:47,570
uncomfortable because it feels like

48
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:49,040
there's a change a new way of thinking

49
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,770
that's coming and I think Dale Peterson

50
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:53,420
maybe kicked it off when he used the

51
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:55,460
word connect and he talked about

52
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:57,680
connecting ot NIT but then you also

53
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,600
start talking about some new ideas

54
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,150
connecting operations people with the

55
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:04,550
board because you know what people are

56
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:06,560
interested in the work that we are doing

57
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,508
as security professionals there's that

58
00:02:08,508 --> 00:02:10,429
new awareness and so we've got to learn

59
00:02:10,429 --> 00:02:12,410
a new language how do you teach

60
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:14,150
technical things to board members how do

61
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:15,650
you have that dialogue with them it

62
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:17,510
requires empathy but then further

63
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:19,040
there's that connection with other

64
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,769
groups and that one's more of a humility

65
00:02:21,769 --> 00:02:23,689
connection right because we're not going

66
00:02:23,689 --> 00:02:24,980
to those other groups whether it

67
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:26,870
clinical psychologists or these

68
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:28,730
different these different speakers that

69
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:30,800
are bringing new ideas and from outside

70
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,060
disciplines we're not going to them and

71
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:34,370
saying hey here's what we want you to

72
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:35,780
know we're actually going to them and

73
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:38,150
saying hey what can you teach us and so

74
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:39,110
this connection thread is really

75
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:41,720
interesting and I think we're going to

76
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,280
ride that thread a little bit with this

77
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,050
presentation because there's another

78
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:47,120
group of people that I don't know that

79
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,160
we've really connected with and we want

80
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,660
to point point that out because when I

81
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:52,489
talk about our systems there's a part of

82
00:02:52,489 --> 00:02:55,190
the system so I've I've run EMS teams

83
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:57,080
operations technology departments and

84
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,390
one of the things my operators have

85
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:01,610
always taught me is that the control

86
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:03,950
system is an extension of them it's an

87
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:05,510
extension of their body it's their so

88
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:08,180
their hands their eyes their ears out in

89
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:09,560
the field they can reach a hundred feet

90
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:12,290
away or a hundred miles away and control

91
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:14,480
something and so when you think about

92
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:17,000
systems that way you realize humans are

93
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,620
really part of the system they're not

94
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:20,599
divorced from the system they're a part

95
00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:22,730
of it and so we have to ask the question

96
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:24,349
when we're advancing all of our

97
00:03:24,349 --> 00:03:26,930
technology and systems so quickly are we

98
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:30,440
upgrading our wetware software hardware

99
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:32,299
but what about the stuff in our heads

100
00:03:32,299 --> 00:03:34,030
what about the stuff in the users heads

101
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:36,290
specifically because these people are

102
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:37,549
out in the field and if you look at any

103
00:03:37,549 --> 00:03:40,250
security attack just about every one of

104
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:42,829
them involves these people so what are

105
00:03:42,829 --> 00:03:44,810
we doing to upgrade them and I've seen a

106
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:47,680
couple things one is in one case we

107
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,260
don't we look at them as as stupid right

108
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:53,630
how those users they burned me like they

109
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:55,519
they didn't use the system right or they

110
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:58,459
allow that vulnerability to happen oh no

111
00:03:58,459 --> 00:04:01,100
like keep them out of the system we not

112
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:02,450
only can we not upgrade then we think we

113
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:04,730
just need a new model right yeah can we

114
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:07,670
get them out entirely and then maybe

115
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:10,160
further along you've got an idea of well

116
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,569
maybe maybe they need to know something

117
00:04:11,569 --> 00:04:13,040
so let's give them some awareness but

118
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,109
awareness it's a good word but it's not

119
00:04:15,109 --> 00:04:17,660
an end it's a means to an end so is

120
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:19,519
there something more is there something

121
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:22,160
more and that's the space that we got to

122
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,349
journey in and play in a little bit and

123
00:04:24,349 --> 00:04:26,840
so Arizona Public Service had a problem

124
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,130
with upgrading the wetware

125
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:31,070
of their people and that was really the

126
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:33,320
beginning of our story so let's start

127
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:33,860
there

128
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:35,900
I wanted to share with you with that

129
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,849
that problem that we were facing so we

130
00:04:37,849 --> 00:04:38,690
can talk about

131
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:40,310
we took an approach to upgrade that

132
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:42,230
wetware a couple of years ago we found

133
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:44,420
ourselves in a place where we were

134
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:46,700
facing new Newark city regulations for

135
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:48,080
those of you not part of the energy

136
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,790
sector it's a cybersecurity regulation

137
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:53,120
focused on the grid and like many

138
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,560
companies we were looking at very

139
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,600
significant changes my role was to

140
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,370
secure a number of power plants

141
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:00,380
dozens of high-voltage substations and

142
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:02,120
multiple control centers both from a

143
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,800
physical security standpoint as well as

144
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,250
an electronic security standpoint

145
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:08,210
technologically speaking it was a very

146
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:10,340
short period of time it was a tremendous

147
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:12,920
amount of work but all of that work made

148
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:15,890
sense to us the piece that was going to

149
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:19,400
be so hard for us is that we needed to

150
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,380
introduce two thousand people to

151
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:23,690
security for the very first time and

152
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:25,760
certainly there's a few folks in the

153
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,980
control center in the IT and the OT

154
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:29,480
world that absolutely knew what we were

155
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,610
doing what the largest number of our

156
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:34,370
employees had no idea security had never

157
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:36,560
been part of their lexicon for 10 or 20

158
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,610
or 30 or 40 years so we knew that that

159
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:41,450
was going to be one of our greatest

160
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:43,340
challenges we set about to do all of the

161
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:45,080
cool technological things and at the

162
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,910
same time we said all right let's not

163
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:48,530
forget about the wetware let's not

164
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:50,690
forget about the people we have all

165
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:52,820
these things this content this

166
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:55,460
information we need to get this to a

167
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:58,100
group of people with varying levels of

168
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,720
technological understanding from

169
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:02,900
absolute zero power plants in the middle

170
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:06,560
of nowhere to fairly savvy although

171
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,270
that's the minority and then the space

172
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:10,880
in between we had not space in between

173
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:14,510
with natural disengagement why first of

174
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:17,180
all security is a fairly obscure term to

175
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:18,800
a lot of boots-on-the-ground folks and

176
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,750
second of all we're not just talking to

177
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:22,280
caridy we're talking compliance and

178
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:25,490
everybody hates that word I hate that

179
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:27,919
word and it's part of my role compliance

180
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:30,440
just dish's is dread not only are we

181
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,820
going to try to protect against hackers

182
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:33,410
if you screw that up and you know to the

183
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:34,880
paperwork right now you're fine millions

184
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:35,870
of dollars and there was actually no

185
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:38,300
damage done so this level of

186
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:40,280
disengagement that was already there we

187
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,960
recognized it was there but we've been

188
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:44,090
training for a long time I want to share

189
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:45,350
with you what we were doing from a

190
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:47,570
training perspective this is what I like

191
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:50,390
to call a multi-purpose training

192
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:51,889
platform

193
00:06:51,889 --> 00:06:53,749
this particular binder is full of

194
00:06:53,749 --> 00:06:56,539
numerous quality processes and

195
00:06:56,539 --> 00:06:58,249
procedures to tell you how to do

196
00:06:58,249 --> 00:07:00,110
important things like hatch mission

197
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:02,120
critical systems vulnerability

198
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:05,210
assessments background checks things

199
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:06,560
that we should be doing good from a

200
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,999
security standpoint and again

201
00:07:07,999 --> 00:07:10,009
multi-purpose we also regularly use it

202
00:07:10,009 --> 00:07:11,240
to hold up a projector in a conference

203
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,099
room that exact binder has been there

204
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:16,789
for five years without moving so not

205
00:07:16,789 --> 00:07:18,800
only do we provide this as a wonderful

206
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,870
training guide we also but wait there's

207
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:23,990
more give you an amazing power point

208
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:26,750
presentation forty or fifty of the most

209
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:29,000
scintillating slides you have ever read

210
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,629
pillow included bullet after bullet

211
00:07:32,629 --> 00:07:36,310
after boring bullets and at the end

212
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:39,620
because this is important we're going to

213
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:42,229
quiz you ten really important questions

214
00:07:42,229 --> 00:07:44,779
that will assure us you are now fully

215
00:07:44,779 --> 00:07:47,810
prepared to spend our most critical of

216
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:49,430
critical infrastructure so is this what

217
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:50,810
your people looked like after this kind

218
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:53,150
of training a little bit a little bit a

219
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:54,710
little bit yeah except for there's

220
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:56,509
probably one on the ground somewhere

221
00:07:56,509 --> 00:07:58,400
there that road might be missing yeah

222
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,189
okay so how do you know that we

223
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:03,199
essentially know what the engagement

224
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:04,550
look like for this training so I'd like

225
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:06,069
to share our engagement numbers with you

226
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:08,870
when we're talking about engagement the

227
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:10,789
Patrick model of engagement tells us

228
00:08:10,789 --> 00:08:12,409
that at the bottom level we have a level

229
00:08:12,409 --> 00:08:14,899
called disengaged disengage actually

230
00:08:14,899 --> 00:08:18,620
implies active I am actively trying to

231
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:20,870
get away from you this actually happens

232
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:22,219
to me in the elevator at work by the way

233
00:08:22,219 --> 00:08:23,870
people know what I do and actually

234
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:26,629
sometimes leave when they see me active

235
00:08:26,629 --> 00:08:28,669
disengagement I've opened the training

236
00:08:28,669 --> 00:08:30,199
on my computer I have moved it to my

237
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:32,029
second third fourth or a screen

238
00:08:32,029 --> 00:08:33,679
depending on if you work in operations

239
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,779
or not I have minimized it and it is

240
00:08:35,779 --> 00:08:36,979
going to run over there when I am all

241
00:08:36,979 --> 00:08:40,849
done I will click yep I'm trained and I

242
00:08:40,849 --> 00:08:42,919
will move on that is an active level of

243
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:45,079
disengagement I have tried to not

244
00:08:45,079 --> 00:08:47,600
participate anybody ever done that I've

245
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,209
done that totally done that one third of

246
00:08:50,209 --> 00:08:52,760
our workforce is essentially at this

247
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:55,579
level of active disengagement so these

248
00:08:55,579 --> 00:08:57,640
are people who have found actual

249
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:01,310
motivation in avoiding training it's

250
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:02,870
pretty phenomenal only we could turn

251
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:04,399
that to something else so the next level

252
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:05,420
not engage

253
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:06,650
not engage seems like it's the same

254
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:07,700
thing but it's not it's a bit more

255
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:10,280
passive not engaged is I've open to the

256
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:12,590
PowerPoint I know there's ten questions

257
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:14,930
at the end I am a click so fast through

258
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:16,220
this PowerPoint you have never seen

259
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:18,230
anybody click this fact I will pick up

260
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:19,880
the smallest amount of information that

261
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,980
is necessary and I will take that test

262
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:23,900
BAM and I will get back to whatever it

263
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:27,110
was I was doing almost two-thirds who

264
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:29,300
does that leave it leaves my favorite

265
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:33,140
people the four percent who are engaged

266
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:35,990
the people who have opened the

267
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:38,960
PowerPoint and said boy security looks

268
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:42,230
like an important thing I'm going to sit

269
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:44,810
here and learn something valuable I love

270
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:46,940
these guys and I'm going into battle

271
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:50,240
with four percent of my workforce sixty

272
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,590
percent of the folks don't know we're at

273
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:54,040
war and 36 percent of them have deserted

274
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:57,230
this is not great oz you guys this is

275
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:59,480
where Chris and I came together we said

276
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,640
this traditional way of training is not

277
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,560
working for us we've got to do something

278
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:06,140
different we need a new solution yeah so

279
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:07,700
this is a space meta mythic likes to

280
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:09,740
work in and I can describe how it works

281
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:11,450
but I think it might be easier if you

282
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:12,470
describe it for me

283
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:16,280
so let's get ready to safe to say things

284
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,540
okay let's get ready to interact I know

285
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:19,610
it's your favorite part okay call out

286
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:21,890
first person just call out as soon as

287
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:23,870
you know what I'm talking about okay I'm

288
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:25,640
going to describe something okay

289
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:29,150
current TV show on two parties on one

290
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:32,450
side people with shotguns and machetes

291
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:37,400
on the other side the walkers walking

292
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,090
dead

293
00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:40,910
wow that was holy Wow how did you know

294
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:42,410
that okay I didn't even give you all the

295
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:44,330
facts so let's go let's just go back a

296
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:45,410
little more in time so let's go back

297
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:49,100
maybe ten years there's a book series

298
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:51,770
it's a movie series it's a boy with

299
00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:55,070
round glasses hey I haven't even gotten

300
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:58,070
all my facts okay good job okay let's go

301
00:10:58,070 --> 00:11:01,730
a long time ago yeah way back like 30

302
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:03,530
years a long time ago in a movie theater

303
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:05,810
far far away there is a there's a boy

304
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:07,280
and a father who has a breathing problem

305
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:10,640
what is just okay let's make it harder

306
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:13,720
with a father's name

307
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:15,880
my gosh you guys are so good I mean that

308
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:19,600
was a long time ago so what's the secret

309
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,580
here right these are facts and if you

310
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:23,590
think about it these are random facts

311
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:24,580
that we're remembering if you think

312
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:27,150
about it there's there's a clue in

313
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:29,830
storytelling because we just had the

314
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:31,390
holidays did you sit around your table

315
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:35,170
and just say Lisa we I guess got off the

316
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:38,230
airplane I drove here at a you know a

317
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:40,420
good forty five point six miles per hour

318
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:43,030
turkey is a fantastic 127 degrees

319
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:44,440
Fahrenheit do we to convert that to

320
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,270
Celsius freezing okay that's not how we

321
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:47,650
talk to each other right but we put that

322
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:49,240
stuff in our powerpoints and we put that

323
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,100
stuff in our bullet points we expect

324
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:52,720
people to engage what do we do around

325
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,220
the table we tell stories

326
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:55,780
what do we've been doing for 500 years

327
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:58,480
with fables we're telling fictional

328
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,910
stories that teach children truths go

329
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:02,920
back 2,000 years you've been to Sunday

330
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,720
school the Good Samaritan do you know

331
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,700
that story it's a fictional story that

332
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,650
teaches a truth we could keep going back

333
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:10,660
and there's this common thread so it's a

334
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:13,180
it's a new problem that you had but it's

335
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:16,570
an old solution so the thing that we do

336
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:18,700
is we tweak it just a little bit so

337
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:20,080
instead of the entire story being

338
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:23,080
fiction we apply fiction to reality and

339
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,610
so where did the reality come in and

340
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:26,440
that's the heroes of the story so our

341
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:30,190
heroes are these people okay it's the

342
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:31,870
people out using these systems and you

343
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:33,280
might say well what is our role as

344
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,900
security professionals it's a very

345
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:38,230
important role it's the sage okay you

346
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:40,300
all are the people who have the 10,000

347
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:41,890
plus hours of expertise so these people

348
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:44,050
will not ever have you are the ones out

349
00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:45,520
fighting the battles who have had the

350
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,560
battle scars but there's not enough of

351
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:49,360
you okay you can't stand over the

352
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,070
shoulders of every single person out

353
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:53,290
there you need more people walking by

354
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:54,880
your side they don't need the same skill

355
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,290
level as you but they need some skill

356
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:58,060
level so they can understand and walk

357
00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:00,100
with you that's these people and Star

358
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:02,230
Wars makes a great metaphor right think

359
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:04,330
of yourself as obi-wan Kenobi or Yoda or

360
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:06,370
your favorite Jedi Master and think of

361
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:07,839
these people as Luke Skywalker because

362
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:11,290
they start out a little bit whiny and a

363
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:13,570
little bit reluctant but you know what

364
00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:15,220
if you can call them to a higher purpose

365
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:17,200
they can really do some amazing things

366
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,510
and so that's the fundamental we make

367
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:22,030
the learner the hero of the story every

368
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:25,140
hero needs enemies and we have them

369
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:27,630
yeah don't get scared okay so there's a

370
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:28,800
lot of enemies out there from script

371
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,600
kiddies to nation-states so instead of

372
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,540
trying to pick and choose we use fiction

373
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:35,459
so this lady looks like one of your

374
00:13:35,459 --> 00:13:37,110
employees we'll tailgate into your

375
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:39,149
physical security perimeters you're

376
00:13:39,149 --> 00:13:41,910
where you have your protected assets and

377
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:44,459
then do damage or this robot character

378
00:13:44,459 --> 00:13:46,440
is really good at attacking physical

379
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:49,019
defenses and then everybody knows the

380
00:13:49,019 --> 00:13:50,670
flash drive and this one actually is

381
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:52,500
equipped with legs we'll walk up to your

382
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:53,600
employees

383
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,040
issue siren calls and get them to pick

384
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,560
it up and plug it in okay this is just a

385
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:59,850
few of the characters but the idea is

386
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:02,310
that every hero needs to learn by

387
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:04,560
building their skills against characters

388
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,500
okay so what do we call that applied

389
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:10,920
fiction we take truth story we make the

390
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,540
learner the hero of that story teach

391
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:14,310
them why things are important show them

392
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:16,740
the respect of teaching them why and it

393
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:19,110
suddenly magic happens the problem is

394
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:20,700
the way we did this in the past that

395
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:22,310
meta mythic was instructor-led training

396
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:24,810
theatrical type experience is what

397
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:27,390
people were involved physically around a

398
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:29,160
table and learning and being involved in

399
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,410
acting and things like that that was

400
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:34,079
going to be a problem for APS so can you

401
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:36,149
talk about that absolutely we think over

402
00:14:36,149 --> 00:14:38,459
the best training you've ever had it

403
00:14:38,459 --> 00:14:40,529
likely had three elements there was

404
00:14:40,529 --> 00:14:42,180
probably an instructor in the room with

405
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:43,920
you imparting some kind of wisdom and

406
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,600
knowledge on you also giving you

407
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,690
feedback helping you guiding you correct

408
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:50,360
answers you get positive reinforcement

409
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,680
incorrect answers you get reasoning why

410
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:55,019
an instructor is a huge part of our

411
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:56,760
learning which is why electronic

412
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,019
learning doesn't typically work very

413
00:14:58,019 --> 00:14:58,260
well

414
00:14:58,260 --> 00:14:59,399
the second thing that you had is

415
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:00,209
probably an immersive learning

416
00:15:00,209 --> 00:15:03,240
environment you were brought fully into

417
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,949
the learning in that space and the third

418
00:15:04,949 --> 00:15:06,570
thing you likely had with some form of

419
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:08,250
simulation it could literally be a

420
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:10,320
simulator it could be a whiteboard it

421
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,600
could have been simply a tabletop

422
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,640
exercise but something that allowed you

423
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:17,160
real-world application those are the

424
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:19,829
three things that were the keys having

425
00:15:19,829 --> 00:15:21,690
been a former trainer myself that I was

426
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:23,370
extremely worried about when we talked

427
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:24,630
about online training because my

428
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:26,040
experience was a terrible power point

429
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,630
and we needed to do online learning

430
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:28,769
because you had so many distributed

431
00:15:28,769 --> 00:15:30,510
locations and people to train throughout

432
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:31,920
the year we couldn't do the theatrical

433
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,209
time you know we're having thousands of

434
00:15:33,209 --> 00:15:35,040
square miles and of course new employees

435
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,510
come on all the time it was impossible

436
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:38,760
so that's how we let it on the elect

437
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:41,220
we're moving now into the best part of

438
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:42,420
this where you guys get to actually see

439
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:44,370
pieces of the training so as we move

440
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:45,990
into that I wanted to keep those three

441
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:48,450
things in mind look how we solved those

442
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:49,980
three problems as you go through this

443
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:53,220
the instructor the immersive experience

444
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:56,960
and that simulation piece

445
00:15:57,150 --> 00:16:08,390
[Music]

446
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:11,970
welcome to work or the system is ready

447
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:12,900
for login

448
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:17,490
I will now access your records your user

449
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:19,830
has not logged in before you'll be

450
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:21,660
quarantined until your authorization

451
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:25,380
records are confirmed I'll send for the

452
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:29,310
work or authority now alerting Stanly I

453
00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:32,160
was laying in my desk ready for a boring

454
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,920
training and I went war Pam I'm

455
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:37,650
awake so that first moment of immersion

456
00:16:37,650 --> 00:16:39,990
has just happened because everybody is

457
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:41,310
extremely confused they wonder if

458
00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:42,450
they've clicked on the wrong training

459
00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:44,760
and if somebody from IT is going to come

460
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,080
after them now we've been trained to

461
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,580
disengage with training so we needed to

462
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:49,260
shock people into paying attention so

463
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:51,300
they didn't immediately disconnect us so

464
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:53,370
where do we go from here now we need to

465
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:54,960
really bring them into the training each

466
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:57,600
individual that's the next piece so

467
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,000
suddenly I see on the screen my name my

468
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,830
power company something that says

469
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:04,530
recruit and a clearance level that means

470
00:17:04,530 --> 00:17:06,420
absolutely nothing to me but color me

471
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:09,119
intrigued I'm in but we want to continue

472
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:11,970
to really engage and interact with them

473
00:17:11,970 --> 00:17:14,220
so the next step is to engage them

474
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:16,230
further by allowing them to personalize

475
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:19,980
this training ok we'll give them a call

476
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:22,440
sign the training can give them a call

477
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:26,490
sign for them or it would allow them to

478
00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:28,140
type in their own their favorite

479
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:30,390
nickname this happens to be an operator

480
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:32,340
and all of his buddies call him the chud

481
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:35,670
so the chub gets his own callsign and

482
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:38,880
becomes a piece of the story right

483
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,470
because this is all about identity right

484
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:41,910
if we're going to have people take on

485
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:43,920
the mantle hero and we start to adopt

486
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:46,050
the term defender now and if they're

487
00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:47,670
going to take on that identity they need

488
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:49,500
to make they need to make choices they

489
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,670
need to make decisions they need to

490
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:53,190
apply themselves into the training and

491
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:55,920
that lets them take on that identity and

492
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,720
at this point most of the people are

493
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,400
like maybe I won't turn my speaker's off

494
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,950
I'm kind of interested right so we've

495
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:03,690
brought them in and they now fill a

496
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:05,160
piece of it they still don't quite know

497
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:07,310
what recruit means but they have an idea

498
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:09,240
all right so we get them on their

499
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:11,010
journey there they are funneled into the

500
00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:12,660
system and then we load the simulator so

501
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:13,830
I'm going to I'm going to load the

502
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:15,049
simulator and give you a guided

503
00:18:15,049 --> 00:18:18,049
or power works the simulator is loaded

504
00:18:18,049 --> 00:18:20,629
track your progress to the episode here

505
00:18:20,629 --> 00:18:23,929
now we just need a facility okay so the

506
00:18:23,929 --> 00:18:27,049
little round guy was talking to us that

507
00:18:27,049 --> 00:18:28,639
goes back to that instructor-led

508
00:18:28,639 --> 00:18:30,649
training routes that we have and the

509
00:18:30,649 --> 00:18:32,239
values that we've seen with good

510
00:18:32,239 --> 00:18:35,450
training so many times I'm sure all of

511
00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:36,259
you have done it you've gone through

512
00:18:36,259 --> 00:18:39,440
training and you're you're listening to

513
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,239
somebody repeat the slide deck to you if

514
00:18:41,239 --> 00:18:42,860
there's any kind of audio this is

515
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:44,779
Stanley he has a personality he's a

516
00:18:44,779 --> 00:18:46,009
character he's an artificial

517
00:18:46,009 --> 00:18:47,749
intelligence he follows us through the

518
00:18:47,749 --> 00:18:50,029
training and he encourages he inspires

519
00:18:50,029 --> 00:18:52,820
he challenges us and he teaches us along

520
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:54,889
the way he becomes that sage that

521
00:18:54,889 --> 00:18:58,039
extension of our security people here in

522
00:18:58,039 --> 00:19:00,830
the in the simulator once we have the

523
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:02,659
simulator loaded the first choice people

524
00:19:02,659 --> 00:19:04,279
get is a facility to depend a critical

525
00:19:04,279 --> 00:19:04,850
infrastructure

526
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:06,769
let's pick either a substation emulator

527
00:19:06,769 --> 00:19:10,299
is load a plant or a control center

528
00:19:10,299 --> 00:19:12,440
this will sell it good I'm glad that's

529
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:19,700
wise removed was a second breaker I gave

530
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:23,769
you the boiler once she was hot

531
00:19:32,990 --> 00:19:35,700
excellent choice cadet this is one fine

532
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:38,490
facility so brain psychology teaches us

533
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:40,350
that if we engage in motion at the same

534
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:42,179
time that we're learning or far more

535
00:19:42,179 --> 00:19:44,940
likely to remember and recall what we

536
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:47,490
learned and so one of those emotions

537
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:48,660
that we want to take advantage of is

538
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:51,240
humor so I heard some laughs out there

539
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,880
we have humor through this technical

540
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,799
humor geek humor but we also have some a

541
00:19:55,799 --> 00:19:57,090
lot of blue-collar humor it's all been

542
00:19:57,090 --> 00:20:00,900
approved by your HR department snuck a

543
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:03,360
few things in there but the idea is that

544
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,190
if you are laughing and smiling those

545
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:06,750
are positive emotions they will help you

546
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:08,760
remember so we have a facility we've

547
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,289
made our first choice now we're going to

548
00:20:10,289 --> 00:20:12,179
inspect the assets of that facility and

549
00:20:12,179 --> 00:20:14,070
then we're going to add defenders to the

550
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:15,480
facility people who are in that facility

551
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,130
that we're going to learn about and

552
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:19,559
learn from now touching on a couple

553
00:20:19,559 --> 00:20:22,140
points here one is if I'm an operator I

554
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:24,450
may have made might I may have never

555
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:27,419
been inside of a data center and so the

556
00:20:27,419 --> 00:20:28,740
nice thing about a virtual simulator is

557
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:30,960
I can actually see what a data center

558
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,030
looks like I can explore the assets that

559
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:34,440
people are protecting that I'm also

560
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:36,419
responsible by extension for protecting

561
00:20:36,419 --> 00:20:39,210
as well suddenly things that we may have

562
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:42,210
taught people as facts just for you we

563
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:44,309
now see how we all connect together to

564
00:20:44,309 --> 00:20:46,340
sustain security for our organization

565
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:48,659
and so I'm going to go ahead and add

566
00:20:48,659 --> 00:20:49,890
some of the defenders the other

567
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:51,390
interesting thing about this about

568
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:54,390
adding characters to the facility is

569
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:56,280
that people don't connect HQ building

570
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:58,679
you have this long all right Stanley

571
00:20:58,679 --> 00:21:00,419
thank you all right so people don't

572
00:21:00,419 --> 00:21:03,299
connect necessarily with physical things

573
00:21:03,299 --> 00:21:05,940
some engineers will write but most

574
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:07,440
people connect with other people so

575
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,059
putting these characters in it gives

576
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:10,980
people a connection point with what

577
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:12,030
they're learning and you think that's

578
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:13,679
kind of silly we've actually had

579
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:15,510
examples where people have come back and

580
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:17,580
said they identify actually remember the

581
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:19,110
characters remember the names of the

582
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:20,669
characters and I think especially

583
00:21:20,669 --> 00:21:22,860
appreciated things like with the HR

584
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:25,200
department there we have management we

585
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,720
have control rooms of IT and people

586
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:30,390
start to see that we actually all have a

587
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:31,950
role which I don't think any of them

588
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:35,250
connected to before right so now the

589
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:38,840
attack what if an attack look like

590
00:21:43,849 --> 00:21:45,839
all right so this is the kettle head

591
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:47,879
anytime we introduce an enemy character

592
00:21:47,879 --> 00:21:49,829
we do what we call a slam down screen

593
00:21:49,829 --> 00:21:53,309
and that's to let our heroes learn about

594
00:21:53,309 --> 00:21:55,109
who they're who they're protecting a

595
00:21:55,109 --> 00:21:56,789
facility from when the facility is first

596
00:21:56,789 --> 00:21:59,159
loaded it has no defenses installed and

597
00:21:59,159 --> 00:22:01,529
so the robots whenever they teach a new

598
00:22:01,529 --> 00:22:03,779
attack they do lots of damage to the

599
00:22:03,779 --> 00:22:05,129
facility and so we'll see what happens

600
00:22:05,129 --> 00:22:07,979
here ready yourselves this is one of the

601
00:22:07,979 --> 00:22:12,029
advanced force robots everyone run a

602
00:22:12,029 --> 00:22:19,799
lock on the door why must the universe

603
00:22:19,799 --> 00:22:23,609
punish the good simulated halls all

604
00:22:23,609 --> 00:22:25,019
right so that robot there's no physical

605
00:22:25,019 --> 00:22:27,179
access controls the robot just walked in

606
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:29,789
and damaged the facility okay what are

607
00:22:29,789 --> 00:22:30,929
we going to do about this well let's

608
00:22:30,929 --> 00:22:33,659
teach people about the defences and so

609
00:22:33,659 --> 00:22:35,099
we'll teach them what what are the

610
00:22:35,099 --> 00:22:37,139
defense is that that that we use and so

611
00:22:37,139 --> 00:22:38,759
somebody who may have badge din every

612
00:22:38,759 --> 00:22:40,440
day for the past twenty years actually

613
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:42,659
has a why now why is that why is that

614
00:22:42,659 --> 00:22:44,190
badging in process important why does

615
00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:45,809
that system even exist why is it

616
00:22:45,809 --> 00:22:48,059
important not to let people tailgate me

617
00:22:48,059 --> 00:22:50,099
and what is my role in that so we've got

618
00:22:50,099 --> 00:22:51,779
three systems we can install we've got a

619
00:22:51,779 --> 00:22:54,299
badge reader the how 9000 eye scanner

620
00:22:54,299 --> 00:22:57,209
and a crack in body shape sensor latest

621
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:59,789
technology don't tell anybody about it

622
00:22:59,789 --> 00:23:02,249
yet still top-secret DoD stuff okay I

623
00:23:02,249 --> 00:23:05,369
need a vote just call out if you want

624
00:23:05,369 --> 00:23:09,419
the badge scanner nobody okay how about

625
00:23:09,419 --> 00:23:11,069
the hell 9000 what they're going to vote

626
00:23:11,069 --> 00:23:15,269
for couple Hal 9000 right good all right

627
00:23:15,269 --> 00:23:19,889
let's try the Kraken yeah okay oh the

628
00:23:19,889 --> 00:23:23,819
Kraken so cool yeah robots and water the

629
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:26,269
good mix

630
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:31,200
so this is a identification system and

631
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:43,140
an alerting system access denied

632
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:47,010
ooh looks like the robots are trying

633
00:23:47,010 --> 00:23:58,470
again illicit and defended rest in peace

634
00:23:58,470 --> 00:24:01,590
robots so show the attack teach the

635
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:03,150
defense let the person customize our

636
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:04,799
facility so we we roll through these

637
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:06,900
fairly frequently we have about 12

638
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:09,030
attacks that we teach I'll show you two

639
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:11,580
more examples one is the classic USB

640
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:13,820
Drive

641
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:19,399
you

642
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:26,659
[Music]

643
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:31,810
no no no don't be fooled by that

644
00:24:31,810 --> 00:24:37,839
[Music]

645
00:24:40,050 --> 00:24:42,140
[Music]

646
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:44,200
me

647
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:59,069
[Music]

648
00:25:04,419 --> 00:25:06,580
these robots are taking control of the

649
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:08,769
operator console and the overloading of

650
00:25:08,769 --> 00:25:13,239
transmission lines simulator pause all

651
00:25:13,239 --> 00:25:14,679
right so two physical attacks maybe

652
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:16,359
those seem easy but the nice thing about

653
00:25:16,359 --> 00:25:18,210
a simulator is you can actually teach

654
00:25:18,210 --> 00:25:20,559
abstract things like how does a firewall

655
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:22,299
work something I can't do I can't just

656
00:25:22,299 --> 00:25:24,070
crack off the cover of a firewall and

657
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:26,230
say hey look at the packets in there so

658
00:25:26,230 --> 00:25:29,080
let's see how we teach firewall attacks

659
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:31,899
with our electronic attacks in a way

660
00:25:31,899 --> 00:25:33,279
that respects our technical people

661
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:36,220
raises them up but also is accessible to

662
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:43,299
everybody when computers communicate

663
00:25:43,299 --> 00:25:45,220
with each other they send messages in

664
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:48,639
small packets called when they're called

665
00:25:48,639 --> 00:25:51,129
packets right um here's a packet now

666
00:25:51,129 --> 00:25:53,259
before this packet would have gone

667
00:25:53,259 --> 00:25:55,090
straight through to our service their

668
00:25:55,090 --> 00:25:57,129
first beliefs hello I'm from the

669
00:25:57,129 --> 00:25:58,690
corporate report and server and I'm

670
00:25:58,690 --> 00:26:02,859
headed to the control server even if the

671
00:26:02,859 --> 00:26:04,690
communication is authorized the

672
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:06,549
intrusion prevention system will check

673
00:26:06,549 --> 00:26:09,639
the contents of the packet open up ha

674
00:26:09,639 --> 00:26:12,309
what are you hiding no contraband a

675
00:26:12,309 --> 00:26:16,299
proceed that wasn't approved packet all

676
00:26:16,299 --> 00:26:17,590
right so it's a good path we'll see what

677
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:21,700
an attack looks like ah here's a packets

678
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:25,509
in biorobot hacker vapors beliefs um

679
00:26:25,509 --> 00:26:29,590
well you see I'm from the internet and I

680
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:31,330
kind of want to communicate with your

681
00:26:31,330 --> 00:26:33,190
control system that's okay with you

682
00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:35,409
these papers got a full name I must

683
00:26:35,409 --> 00:26:38,080
destroy you now happen I stayed happy

684
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:45,480
yeah man he wasn't on the list

685
00:26:46,930 --> 00:26:50,570
the robots trying again some attacks can

686
00:26:50,570 --> 00:26:52,400
trick the firewall into letting a packet

687
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,980
through vampires beliefs and you can

688
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:57,290
trust me I'm from the corporate archival

689
00:26:57,290 --> 00:26:59,930
server going to the control system he's

690
00:26:59,930 --> 00:27:02,390
not through yet give the secrets to me

691
00:27:02,390 --> 00:27:07,960
what are you hiding I respond

692
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:16,980
Hey oh that's mark oh yeah

693
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:20,790
Oh terminated nice job firewall I'm not

694
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:23,850
in the chapter it's duty time so now we

695
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:26,550
have accessible training for every level

696
00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:29,130
of employees that has to deal with these

697
00:27:29,130 --> 00:27:31,020
system so they understand why each

698
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:33,120
chapter covers a topic and at the end of

699
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,790
the chapter we get into a testing side

700
00:27:34,790 --> 00:27:37,470
really so no more 10 question quiz at

701
00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:39,510
the end we now actually gage learning

702
00:27:39,510 --> 00:27:42,090
all the way through in in 40-plus

703
00:27:42,090 --> 00:27:43,800
moments of learning where they

704
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,360
accumulate points as you go which helps

705
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,250
you to level up to the next level so

706
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:49,650
there's interesting and the terrible

707
00:27:49,650 --> 00:27:51,360
answers there's feedback when you get an

708
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,310
answer correct you get points after each

709
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:55,410
one of these and instead of just 10

710
00:27:55,410 --> 00:27:57,360
questions I now have data behind each

711
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,310
one of these to see if employees in a

712
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:01,290
certain employee group or in a certain

713
00:28:01,290 --> 00:28:03,570
location might need reinforcement on

714
00:28:03,570 --> 00:28:05,670
some specific concepts that are perhaps

715
00:28:05,670 --> 00:28:07,680
more foreign to that group than another

716
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:09,810
group this piece of it has been very

717
00:28:09,810 --> 00:28:11,880
significant for us we also chose to not

718
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:14,430
have a passing score a certain threshold

719
00:28:14,430 --> 00:28:16,320
you had to cross to measure learning

720
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,910
because we were getting the data that we

721
00:28:17,910 --> 00:28:21,390
needed to reinforce ongoing for the long

722
00:28:21,390 --> 00:28:23,820
term that training so we've taken a fear

723
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:26,070
factor away from people which to me is

724
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:27,240
actually very important they're no

725
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,680
longer afraid of this training they can

726
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:30,840
simply engage in it this screen is what

727
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:32,640
you ended up with at the end of each one

728
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,740
of these chapters fun fact at the bottom

729
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:36,240
you get to see every place that you have

730
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,400
a choice what did your colleagues - how

731
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,080
many chose a power plant or a control

732
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:42,300
center or the Krakken sensor or the

733
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:44,340
hollow eye scanner most people chose the

734
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:46,110
Kraken Kraken is incredibly popular

735
00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:48,420
especially in IT circles not as much

736
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:49,770
maybe in the power plant circle but

737
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:55,050
certainly nit so let's go back to our

738
00:28:55,050 --> 00:28:57,570
engagement 1,800 people have taken this

739
00:28:57,570 --> 00:28:58,740
training now and I want to share with

740
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:00,900
you our engagement numbers i this was a

741
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:02,640
pretty radical concept I sort of was

742
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,350
hoping that if I could hit 40%

743
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:06,180
engagement I wouldn't be fired that was

744
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:10,290
my goal i lofty goal disengaged numbers

745
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:14,790
were at 4% I swapped my engaged in my

746
00:29:14,790 --> 00:29:17,940
engage it disengaged 4% essentially 5%

747
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:18,660
of people are going to hate every

748
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:21,150
absolutely everything you do engaged not

749
00:29:21,150 --> 00:29:23,610
engaged at 13% here's the number that

750
00:29:23,610 --> 00:29:24,120
matters

751
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:26,150
engaged

752
00:29:26,150 --> 00:29:28,980
3% of our employees engaged we were

753
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:31,170
blown out of the water by that statistic

754
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:33,150
not only do they think that they

755
00:29:33,150 --> 00:29:34,530
understood the training it was the best

756
00:29:34,530 --> 00:29:36,150
training that they'd actually ever taken

757
00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:37,470
for many of them so they're interested

758
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:39,240
in it did they take on that identity

759
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,290
absolutely

760
00:29:40,290 --> 00:29:41,790
it became who they are I got text

761
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:43,170
messages and phone calls where people

762
00:29:43,170 --> 00:29:44,460
regularly say to me

763
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:46,140
I'm a defender they've joined our

764
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:47,520
rebellion I actually got this tech

765
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,620
message from a senior executive it's

766
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:50,850
been an incredible experience for

767
00:29:50,850 --> 00:29:55,170
employees so wrapping this up what are

768
00:29:55,170 --> 00:29:56,429
the robots not want you to remember

769
00:29:56,429 --> 00:29:59,160
three things your systems include your

770
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:02,400
people upgrade them - it is possible and

771
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,110
it's possible especially if you use what

772
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:06,990
is innately human to us story and blend

773
00:30:06,990 --> 00:30:09,600
fiction in to fill in the gaps and then

774
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,870
finally you are the sage your people are

775
00:30:12,870 --> 00:30:15,150
the heroes so if you walk out of this

776
00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:18,720
theater with those three concepts then

777
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,280
we would welcome you to the learning

778
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:23,010
rebellion with open arms or fist bumps

779
00:30:23,010 --> 00:30:26,309
or whatever is natural to you I'll leave

780
00:30:26,309 --> 00:30:27,210
you with one thing

781
00:30:27,210 --> 00:30:28,950
you're still not persuaded or if you

782
00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:31,860
want to see more join the rebellion on

783
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:33,660
your way out one of our colleagues is

784
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:35,220
going to be passing out these access

785
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:38,250
cards we've made this training available

786
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:40,470
online to try it out to go through it

787
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:42,450
see how it works see all 12 attacks and

788
00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:45,390
defenses and and become a defender

789
00:30:45,390 --> 00:30:48,210
yourself so thank you for your time

790
00:30:48,210 --> 00:30:48,840
thank you

791
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:51,230
China

792
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:54,600
you
