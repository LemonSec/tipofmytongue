1
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:10,620
please welcome to the s4 mainstage Dale

2
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:18,960
Peterson thank you very much it's really

3
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,910
good to see so many familiar faces out

4
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:22,590
there and smiling in the morning that's

5
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:23,160
great

6
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:27,300
welcome to the 2017 edition of digital

7
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:30,570
bond s4 and I just really want to thank

8
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:32,880
you for coming here I know your time is

9
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,000
your most valuable commodity I really

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,590
appreciate you coming here for three

11
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:39,180
days and we're going to try to deliver

12
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:42,000
great value for your time here over the

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,750
next three days now our theme for this

14
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:53,460
year's s4 is come together and at the

15
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:55,230
beginning of s4 every year I stand up

16
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:56,940
here and give a little mini keno try to

17
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:00,120
introduce what's going to happen where I

18
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:03,320
think the ICS security market is and

19
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:06,930
most years I look like that you know

20
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:09,869
very angry very frustrated a little bit

21
00:01:09,869 --> 00:01:12,540
depressed you know five years ago at s4

22
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:16,700
12 and s4 13 yeah we had gone through

23
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:19,140
what a lot of us called The Lost Decade

24
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:21,420
where we didn't make any progress or any

25
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:24,030
substantial progress on securing our

26
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:27,180
control systems in literally 10 years we

27
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:31,049
had level 1 devices PLC's are to use

28
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:34,140
that were insecure by design and our

29
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:37,100
asset owners were basically stuck with

30
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:40,470
having a good perimeter keeping the bad

31
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:42,780
guys out and maybe detecting if they got

32
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:45,360
in but really not being able to secure

33
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,280
their system and you see the other

34
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,820
problems there you know no SPL I think

35
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:53,640
at s4 2012 there were actually 50

36
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:57,570
different 0 days and we had a lot of

37
00:01:57,570 --> 00:01:59,280
brilliant researchers there but it

38
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,930
wasn't because they did brilliant work

39
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:03,299
it was just because the stuff was so bad

40
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:06,899
and I think the most frustrating thing

41
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:09,000
to me back 5 years ago and why I was so

42
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,239
pessimistic is the ICS security

43
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:13,060
community

44
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:15,700
to accept this you know that this was

45
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:17,830
the way it is get over it it's going to

46
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:19,630
be this way for the next ten or fifteen

47
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:22,569
years so it was it was not I guess it

48
00:02:22,569 --> 00:02:24,580
was a time for me to vent when I came on

49
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:27,910
stage five years ago whereas now I'm

50
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:30,610
completely optimistic it's all rainbows

51
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:33,760
and unicorns and sunshine and and

52
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,730
everything is really great and there's a

53
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:39,090
lot of good reasons for this optimism I

54
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:42,190
mean most important and you know this is

55
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:44,769
my hot button but we're finally getting

56
00:02:44,769 --> 00:02:48,700
rid of insecure by design we had a panel

57
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:51,459
session at s for Europe in Vienna last

58
00:02:51,459 --> 00:02:54,280
June with a lot of the major PLC and our

59
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,709
two vendors and believe it or not

60
00:02:56,709 --> 00:02:59,440
they're adding things like signed

61
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:04,390
firmware secure boot even secured ICS

62
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:06,370
protocols with authentication and

63
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:10,720
authorization enforced at the PLC so

64
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,260
this is just a huge step and really

65
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:17,590
brings us two main things first of all

66
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:19,989
if you're an asset owner you now have a

67
00:03:19,989 --> 00:03:23,980
choice you can decide what is my risk

68
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:25,720
today should I spend the money to

69
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:28,510
upgrade to this new secure system to

70
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:31,209
reduce my risk before you didn't have a

71
00:03:31,209 --> 00:03:32,620
choice you had to live with it because

72
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:33,940
they were all that way now you have a

73
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:37,660
choice and secondly we can stop digging

74
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:41,290
this hole you know we even over the last

75
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:43,150
15 years we've been putting in brand new

76
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:44,769
systems that were insecure but I

77
00:03:44,769 --> 00:03:48,220
designed now we can put in secure system

78
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:50,500
so this is really good and and that's I

79
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,000
think the most important thing but you

80
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,280
see up to on the list there on the slide

81
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,660
a lot of other things for example

82
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:59,500
training we now have training programs I

83
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,540
know Mike Asante from Sands is speaking

84
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:04,420
this morning fans can train thousands of

85
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:08,190
people now on ICS security as can is a

86
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:10,750
some of the more boutique trainers like

87
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,489
Joel and Jill who's speaking this

88
00:04:12,489 --> 00:04:16,029
afternoon on the sponsor stage you know

89
00:04:16,029 --> 00:04:17,978
before he could only teach 30 students

90
00:04:17,978 --> 00:04:19,779
at a time now we have online training

91
00:04:19,779 --> 00:04:21,909
from Joel and others they can teach

92
00:04:21,909 --> 00:04:24,970
thousands so we have better training we

93
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:26,570
have people understanding

94
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:28,460
that security is more than just buying

95
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:31,310
equipment you see things like the NIST

96
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:33,770
cybersecurity framework or Ralph

97
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:36,050
langner's ot security framework where

98
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:37,310
you're actually looking at putting

99
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:40,040
together a whole program instead of just

100
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:44,030
buying a widget and really I could go on

101
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:46,070
and on a lot about the last bullet but

102
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:48,110
we're in a very exciting time not only

103
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:49,940
from security but what you're going to

104
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:52,460
see in the next generation of ICS so

105
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:54,350
this is a fantastic time I think

106
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:57,020
actually the best time to be an ICS

107
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:59,360
security and I would even broaden that

108
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,520
it's a great time to be in the ICS

109
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:06,710
community as a whole so we are at this

110
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:08,900
time with all this possibility now where

111
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:11,390
the technology and the will is coming

112
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:13,130
around to actually do the right thing

113
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:15,890
and to build more secure and reliable

114
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:19,220
and efficient and better control systems

115
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:22,250
and the way we what we need to do to

116
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:24,620
take advantage of that is we need some

117
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:26,930
groups that typically don't talk to each

118
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:29,210
other to come together to work on this

119
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:32,240
problem if we don't do that we're

120
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,610
actually going to lose our opportunity

121
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:37,430
that we have right now and there's three

122
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:39,680
different groups that I want to just

123
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,240
touch on briefly that need to come

124
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:44,990
together now the first one o T NIT

125
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:46,850
you know I always say this is an

126
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:48,560
advanced audience you don't need skata

127
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,600
SEC 101 you have all heard this for a

128
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,120
long time that ot NIT need to get

129
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:57,470
together the good news is it's happening

130
00:05:57,470 --> 00:05:59,780
I mean there are many success stories

131
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:02,510
with companies of different sizes medium

132
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:04,490
and large companies where this has

133
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:05,840
already happened it's a done deal

134
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,240
they're doing it and there's a variety

135
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,120
of ways to solve this problem but

136
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,280
there's a few things I think that you

137
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,930
know I wanted to just highlight shortly

138
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:16,820
that people don't understand that seem

139
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:20,540
to be getting in the way of this the

140
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:23,390
first thing is a lot of times OT when

141
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:25,430
they say we can't work with IT they're

142
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:27,440
thinking of desktop management and

143
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:31,100
you're right ot and desktop management

144
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:33,230
should never get together you know you

145
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:35,570
do not want to manage your control

146
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:37,940
system like you manage your thousand

147
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:40,220
user desktops or 10,000 users

148
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:42,770
tops but when you think of it and if you

149
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:45,050
have any experience working with

150
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:48,230
mission-critical IT the type of system

151
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:50,270
where if it's down for 10 seconds the

152
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:52,700
company can say we lose this much money

153
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:56,660
that is almost identical in terms of how

154
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:59,420
you how you install and maintain an OT

155
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:01,370
system and how you install and maintain

156
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:03,100
and mission-critical

157
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:07,970
IT system and I know in the audience

158
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:09,680
because I know a lot of you we have some

159
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,600
even skeptics still about the need for

160
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:16,070
ot NIT to get together even if you are

161
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:18,410
skeptic and you say I T should stay

162
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:22,550
completely away from OT you still need

163
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:25,640
IT you just need the IT skills so

164
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,620
somehow we have to bring the IT skills

165
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:30,980
to this equation we made the mistake in

166
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:32,840
past years when people were installing

167
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:35,450
Active Directory without domain admins

168
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:37,760
people are running managed switches with

169
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:40,720
no idea how to actually manage them the

170
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,040
world is getting much more complicated

171
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:46,130
now your next control system or the one

172
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:47,900
you put in the last couple of years is

173
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,760
going to be running on a virtualized

174
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:52,940
platform you are going to need people

175
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:55,700
with those IT skills on how to install

176
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:58,250
and maintain a virtual environment or

177
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:00,530
you will fail

178
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:02,540
same thing with storage area networks

179
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:05,090
cloud services so there's no getting

180
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:08,570
around it if even if you want to keep ot

181
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:11,030
separate you need IT you're just going

182
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:14,080
to be building your own IT department

183
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:18,680
now the real reason I think why ot has

184
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:21,020
been so hesitant to get involved with IT

185
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:28,490
is that ot has basically been a pile of

186
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:33,409
crap I mean you you know it was nothing

187
00:08:33,409 --> 00:08:36,080
that IT could do I mean 10 year old

188
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,110
operating systems you know hubs instead

189
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:41,150
of switches no one understanding

190
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:42,919
anything about management it was

191
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:45,800
installed incorrectly it hasn't been

192
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:48,380
maintained for a decade there really was

193
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:49,990
not much you could do to come together

194
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:52,740
now fortunately

195
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,450
especially the people in this room that

196
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:56,310
I think are more forward-thinking asset

197
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:58,649
owners but I think across the board

198
00:08:58,649 --> 00:08:59,940
we're seeing this change

199
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:02,279
so you're seeing most of the systems now

200
00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:04,350
either today or in the next five years

201
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:06,510
will be new systems that can be

202
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:10,560
supported now I've been kind of hard on

203
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:14,600
ot IT is also going to need to step up

204
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,800
I'm sure you've run into the situation

205
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,680
where IT says what we do support 9:00 to

206
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,959
9:00 to 6:00 Monday through Friday

207
00:09:21,959 --> 00:09:24,630
you know they can't work with ot if they

208
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:27,390
have those requirements and it is a fact

209
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:30,720
that a lot of a lot of these companies

210
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,170
that have control systems are not used

211
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:36,380
to running mission-critical IT

212
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:38,700
so they don't actually have the

213
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:40,050
experience on how to do it they are

214
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:42,270
going to need to step up and understand

215
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:45,140
how they can provide the services needed

216
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:47,820
of course there's there's culture

217
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,709
there's language there's what's

218
00:09:49,709 --> 00:09:51,450
important to an ICS there's some

219
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:53,610
learning involved but I actually think

220
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:55,740
the biggest thing beyond understanding

221
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:57,529
that these are mission critical systems

222
00:09:57,529 --> 00:10:00,660
that require different than desktop

223
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:02,370
management I think the biggest thing is

224
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:07,620
is respect a lot of times if you're and

225
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:09,000
I know we have some people coming from

226
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,100
the IT world you go into ot and you see

227
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:13,680
this old stuff that's may not maintained

228
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,839
and you think these people are really

229
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:17,790
stupid they have no idea what they're

230
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:20,670
doing they're incompetent but what they

231
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:22,770
don't realize is that actually putting

232
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:25,110
together and making a control system

233
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:28,770
work the number of points two displays

234
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:31,529
the complexity all the things that have

235
00:10:31,529 --> 00:10:33,360
to be built in to allow a couple of

236
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,060
operators in a control room to manage a

237
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:38,610
factory or a huge process is truly

238
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:40,829
amazing it's actually much much harder

239
00:10:40,829 --> 00:10:43,740
than anything an IT or IT security so

240
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:45,900
we're talking about smart people that

241
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:48,120
need to be treated with respect and I

242
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,920
think what you just have to realize if

243
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,890
you're coming at it from that side is

244
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:55,020
that these people that went to school to

245
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:56,790
be electrical engineers or chemical

246
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:59,160
engineers really didn't do want to do

247
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:05,180
patching of servers or workstations so

248
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:08,029
the OT NIT one coming together I think

249
00:11:08,029 --> 00:11:10,190
that is well understood I hope that's a

250
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:11,779
little flavor as to how we can be more

251
00:11:11,779 --> 00:11:13,850
effective there the next two though are

252
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:18,260
a little different so the next two pair

253
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:19,550
that needs to come together is

254
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:24,140
operations and senior management whether

255
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:25,880
it be your board of directors or your

256
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:30,110
c-level people I don't know how many of

257
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:31,880
you are familiar with a gentleman by the

258
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,680
name of Peter teal he was one of the

259
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:37,730
PayPal co-founders he has a really

260
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:39,589
interesting question he said tell me

261
00:11:39,589 --> 00:11:41,330
something that's true that almost nobody

262
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:43,700
agrees with you on it's actually a fun

263
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:45,350
question to ask someone sometime or to

264
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:47,720
think about yourself you know what are

265
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,370
you absolutely convinced is true that

266
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:52,010
everyone else thinks you're crazy my

267
00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:55,190
answer for the last two years is that

268
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:56,779
the board of directors and the sea

269
00:11:56,779 --> 00:11:59,420
levels are ready and willing to spend

270
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:03,700
substantial money on ICS securities I

271
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:07,130
contend that getting budgets to improve

272
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:09,890
the security and reliability of your ICS

273
00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:12,140
is not an issue at the board or sea

274
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:16,250
level right now the reason I say that

275
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:18,430
and we have a lot of data points on this

276
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:21,440
but believe it or not over the last two

277
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,050
years we've been having to slow down

278
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:26,779
senior management they want to spend

279
00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:28,790
more money that can then can be

280
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:31,070
effectively spent they want everything

281
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:32,959
fixed in three months once they learn

282
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:35,690
about how bad it is and what risk they

283
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:39,620
had unknowingly accepted they say how do

284
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:41,360
we fix this what is it going to cost how

285
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,660
do we do it who can we get and of course

286
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:47,150
you can only implement so much change at

287
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:49,370
a time I'm sure some of you have been

288
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:51,470
involved in safety programs it's like

289
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:54,080
that you can't just throw unlimited

290
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:56,000
resources and accomplish it in three

291
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,010
months but that's a very positive

292
00:12:58,010 --> 00:13:01,779
indicator when you talk to them they

293
00:13:01,779 --> 00:13:04,700
understand risk and they actually

294
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,260
understand that the money we're talking

295
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:08,120
about is relatively small compared to

296
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,800
the risk that they're accepting and

297
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,810
compared to the things that they spend

298
00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:16,310
on their other budgeted items and I

299
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:17,900
guess one thing I like to do if you

300
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:19,010
really run into a

301
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:23,090
with this is pull out the list of the

302
00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:26,330
funded projects in IT and look at what

303
00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:27,680
they're funding and how much money

304
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:30,740
they're spending and then look at the

305
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:33,890
criticality of the control system I mean

306
00:13:33,890 --> 00:13:35,930
most of these companies they are in

307
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:38,540
business to produce a product to deliver

308
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:42,050
water to to refine oil you know the

309
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:43,730
control system is the reason they exist

310
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:47,390
and yet the idea that they wouldn't

311
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:48,980
spend a certain amount of money on these

312
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:51,290
systems as opposed to putting you know

313
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:53,210
upgrading let's say their internet

314
00:13:53,210 --> 00:13:55,220
server that provides their benefits to

315
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:55,820
the employees

316
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:58,640
it's just laughable it is a really easy

317
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:03,260
sell at the right level now the

318
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:05,350
challenge when I say come together is

319
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:07,970
the plant managers and I know we have

320
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:10,100
some out there and the VP of operations

321
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:12,710
as well as the subject matter experts

322
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:15,890
who advise them they really need to step

323
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:19,280
up they need to be bringing the case to

324
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:22,880
these high-level executives as to why do

325
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,320
we need to spend this money

326
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,810
what risk we currently have how we will

327
00:14:26,810 --> 00:14:29,870
reduce that risk and this is very new

328
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:32,840
because they're typically used to adding

329
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:35,240
or coming up to the board or the C

330
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:38,060
levels every 15 20 years asking for a

331
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:40,130
big capital expenditure to put in a new

332
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:42,530
system and then going away and saying

333
00:14:42,530 --> 00:14:45,170
you know we won't will bother you you

334
00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:46,820
won't bother us just leave us alone for

335
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:48,110
15 20 years

336
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:52,880
okay that's changed and if you are the

337
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,740
plant manager it's a little bit

338
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:57,710
embarrassing to go to your bosses and

339
00:14:57,710 --> 00:15:00,560
say by the way we have this huge risk

340
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,630
that we haven't addressed for years and

341
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:05,270
we need to spend this money now it's a

342
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:07,700
little bit embarrassing but I think you

343
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:09,410
can handle that because it's a problem

344
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:11,330
across the industry and if they talk to

345
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:13,250
their peers they'll see this as an issue

346
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:16,490
everyone's dealing with and it really is

347
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:19,190
better than the alternative the

348
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:22,160
alternative if you as a plant manager

349
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:25,040
don't initiate this coming together is

350
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,650
that the board or the sea levels are

351
00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:30,680
somehow going to learn of the risk that

352
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,540
you have not told them

353
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:35,450
about that you are accepting and it is

354
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:37,360
not going to be a career enhancing

355
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:40,340
activity for you and I have two examples

356
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:43,970
up there one we had a food and beverage

357
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:47,720
company that just was you know they were

358
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,280
one of the ones going as fast as they

359
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:51,280
could to do as much as they could

360
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:54,260
because it was pushed and I asked well

361
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:57,590
why you know what caused this I'm sure

362
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:59,090
we have some consultants out there

363
00:15:59,090 --> 00:16:02,080
usually it's one of two things either

364
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:05,150
there's been an incident and they're

365
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:06,500
there all of a sudden reacting to the

366
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:09,350
incident or someone got religion and in

367
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:12,490
this case the food and beverage Co

368
00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:15,140
happened to be in an event it wasn't s

369
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,880
for but he happened to be at an event

370
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:20,690
and sat next to the coca-cola Co and the

371
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:23,630
coca-cola co o said oh this is what

372
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:25,340
we're doing and here's the risks we have

373
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:27,200
and we're you know we put this program

374
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:30,260
together and then our clients went back

375
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:32,120
to his company and started asking

376
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:34,520
questions and got some really ugly

377
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:38,210
answers so you don't want that to happen

378
00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:40,160
you want to bring the issues up rather

379
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,080
than have them push down the other

380
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:44,360
examples is pretty similar

381
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:47,210
you probably recognize that's the front

382
00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:52,040
page to a Chatham House report a board

383
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:54,680
member of an electric utility client

384
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:58,040
read that passed it out passed the

385
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,630
executive summary to all the other board

386
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:02,840
levels board members all the c-level

387
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:05,210
executives and all of a sudden the same

388
00:17:05,210 --> 00:17:06,410
thing happened they started asking

389
00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:09,470
questions they were I don't think

390
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:11,150
horrified is that strong but they were

391
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:13,910
very concerned about the risk that they

392
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:16,190
had and they you know they went flat out

393
00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:19,670
to try to address it so you want to

394
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:22,940
again you want to push the the VP of ops

395
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:24,800
the plant manager you want to initiate

396
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,420
the coming together because it's going

397
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:28,610
to happen either way and you want to

398
00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:33,230
control that now the third area and

399
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:34,820
final area I want to talk about coming

400
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:36,380
together it really has a lot to do here

401
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:37,850
with what you're going to see on the

402
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:39,560
main stage over the next couple of days

403
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:44,990
and that is our ICS community needs to

404
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:46,040
bring in role

405
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:48,200
dated field now you could you could say

406
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:51,080
IT is a related field but there's a lot

407
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:53,300
more that we need to consider and I just

408
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:56,840
put some of them up on this list machine

409
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:58,310
learning is going to have a dramatic

410
00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:01,790
impact on control systems over the next

411
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:04,550
five years we need to understand it we

412
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:05,960
need to incorporate it into our

413
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:08,680
strategies we have a great session on

414
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:11,870
Thursday morning with Katherine Hume

415
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:14,120
from fast forward labs that is just

416
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:16,670
going to blow your mind I mean it is

417
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:17,990
amazing what we're going to be doing

418
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:20,150
with machine learning and the same thing

419
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:22,460
with cloud services of course there's

420
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:24,350
risk to these so we need to find the

421
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:26,000
right way to do them how to use this

422
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,060
technology how to use it securely and

423
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:31,070
reliably and I actually have a session

424
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:34,850
Thursday afternoon on how we can

425
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:40,640
approach to that psychology related

426
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,770
field how would that apply we have a

427
00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:46,370
great talk from clinical psychologist

428
00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:49,490
dr. Eric Shaw who used to work in an

429
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:52,460
Intelligence Agency and you know one of

430
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:53,530
the problems you always hear about

431
00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:56,450
disgruntled insiders being the toughest

432
00:18:56,450 --> 00:18:57,950
ones they're the ones that can hurt you

433
00:18:57,950 --> 00:18:59,660
most and it's very difficult to find

434
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:03,460
them you can use clinical psychology

435
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:07,190
statistics and email to proactively

436
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:10,460
identify disgruntled insiders and the

437
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:13,100
numbers are amazing and then it's not

438
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:15,280
theoretical it's actually happening

439
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,420
conflict theory to understand your

440
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:19,310
threat environment we have Dick Clark

441
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:24,050
keynoting on Thursday we have one Renee

442
00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:26,660
Turin from NSA and Mary McCord coming up

443
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:30,260
from the Department of Justice we added

444
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:33,020
Ben Buchanan he's speaking later today

445
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:35,540
and in do a book signing at the Cabana

446
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:37,400
sessions but you'll get a lot of

447
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,290
information on how to think about threat

448
00:19:39,290 --> 00:19:42,170
how to understand how cyber weapons will

449
00:19:42,170 --> 00:19:44,300
be used and defended against and and

450
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:46,070
whether you like to term or not how

451
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:48,590
cyber warfare will take place and we

452
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:51,050
have economics and a variety of other

453
00:19:51,050 --> 00:19:54,710
things so we really want to embrace

454
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:57,380
these related fields bring in the best

455
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:59,810
people understand what they are figure

456
00:19:59,810 --> 00:20:01,970
out how we can use them and bring them

457
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:07,790
in sensibly into the ICS world now this

458
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:09,710
audience here a lot of you we don't have

459
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:12,320
every leader in ICS in ICS security here

460
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,000
but we have a lot of them I mean this is

461
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,840
a very good representation and I went

462
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,730
through this in the crypto world back a

463
00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:22,220
couple of decades to go too long ago

464
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:24,290
where you have a group where maybe

465
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:26,300
there's a hundred to 500 people and

466
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:30,650
everyone knows everyone and to a certain

467
00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:32,600
extent sometimes people like it that way

468
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,850
it's like well we're the ones that know

469
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:37,250
it you outside or stay out and and there

470
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:39,230
can be a tendency to be a little petty

471
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:42,620
about who knows what or insular and not

472
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:45,910
let others in I think we really have to

473
00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:49,340
work hard to avoid that you know we need

474
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:52,610
to encourage people not only to come

475
00:20:52,610 --> 00:20:55,310
into ICS security proper but to bring

476
00:20:55,310 --> 00:20:57,140
knowledge from related fields in we need

477
00:20:57,140 --> 00:21:00,110
to open their arms and and bring that

478
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:03,410
knowledge into ICS security and my hope

479
00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:07,010
here at s4 the next three days is we can

480
00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:10,630
play some small part on that we have

481
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:13,850
three stages going on so you have the

482
00:21:13,850 --> 00:21:15,680
main stage where you'll have advanced

483
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:18,530
sessions but not deep technical sessions

484
00:21:18,530 --> 00:21:22,520
for the most part on ICS and related

485
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:26,570
fields we have Stage two which has the

486
00:21:26,570 --> 00:21:29,360
gory technical stuff and I've seen the

487
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,130
presentations a they brought it this

488
00:21:31,130 --> 00:21:33,650
year there's a lot of technical details

489
00:21:33,650 --> 00:21:35,300
if you want it you'll see it on stage

490
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:38,500
two and then we have the sponsor stage

491
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:41,000
we moved up for those of you who are

492
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,220
here last year

493
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:44,950
we moved the sponsor Stage two right

494
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:47,270
right on the first floor right when you

495
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:49,670
walked into the place the sponsor stage

496
00:21:49,670 --> 00:21:52,580
is right there and we challenge the

497
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:54,970
sponsors issue we said look you know

498
00:21:54,970 --> 00:21:57,230
there's a lot of times ask well how many

499
00:21:57,230 --> 00:21:58,880
people will come to our session how many

500
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,160
people should we expect and said well it

501
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:03,470
depends how good your session is right

502
00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:05,690
there's there's two other stages going

503
00:22:05,690 --> 00:22:07,700
on they have choices you need to bring

504
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:10,450
it or you're going to have an empty room

505
00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:13,250
I'm proud to say that the sponsor is

506
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:13,670
really

507
00:22:13,670 --> 00:22:16,400
stepped up this year you have people

508
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,050
that are keynote or speaking on the

509
00:22:18,050 --> 00:22:20,540
sponsor stage you have very technical

510
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:23,090
talks on the sponsor stage and I'd

511
00:22:23,090 --> 00:22:24,770
encourage you to definitely check out

512
00:22:24,770 --> 00:22:26,750
that agenda as well as stage two in the

513
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:29,990
mainstage so one of the one of the ways

514
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:31,010
we're going to get you to come together

515
00:22:31,010 --> 00:22:32,660
is we're going to bring you a lot of new

516
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:35,090
information but probably the more

517
00:22:35,090 --> 00:22:38,420
important way is this is a really good

518
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:41,480
group of people here and we want to set

519
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:43,700
up and we always set up s4 so that you

520
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:46,430
have time to establish and re-establish

521
00:22:46,430 --> 00:22:48,650
your relationships with people that you

522
00:22:48,650 --> 00:22:51,680
need to be talking to so of course you

523
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,420
have the hallway con you have After

524
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:55,220
Hours and South Beach which is always

525
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:57,740
fun but we have a lot of social events

526
00:22:57,740 --> 00:22:59,600
where you'll have time to sit down and

527
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,020
literally meet almost everyone here

528
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:04,910
tonight after the last session we go

529
00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:06,830
over to the Botanical Gardens just a

530
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:08,900
short walk and we have a welcome party

531
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:11,210
that's going to be really fun Liz Daly

532
00:23:11,210 --> 00:23:12,920
does a great job on the food and

533
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,570
entertainment and she's got some real

534
00:23:14,570 --> 00:23:17,600
surprises there and if you happen to

535
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,670
have a spouse or guests they're welcome

536
00:23:19,670 --> 00:23:23,030
to come and then tomorrow we have the

537
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:24,890
Cabana sessions and that's really the

538
00:23:24,890 --> 00:23:27,620
time that a lot of people liked last

539
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:30,440
year we set aside the afternoon to enjoy

540
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:33,290
the Miami Sun around the pool and you

541
00:23:33,290 --> 00:23:34,880
really have time to interact with your

542
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:38,450
other attendees and the sponsors and out

543
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:40,790
at the Cabana sessions this year there's

544
00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:42,980
there's some virtual reality there's

545
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:45,950
robot challenges Cisco brought their

546
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:48,320
kegerator so you can try to hack it to

547
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,100
get a beer

548
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:51,740
there's awed mented reality and all

549
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:53,870
sorts of other entertainment and food so

550
00:23:53,870 --> 00:23:55,220

551
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:57,200
there but I also want you to really

552
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,220
