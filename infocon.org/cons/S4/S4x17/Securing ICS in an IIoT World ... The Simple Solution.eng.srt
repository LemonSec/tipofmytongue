[Music]

2
00:00:08,269 --> 00:00:12,120
to the s4 mainstage Dale Peterson of

3
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:15,780
Digital bond so the title of my talk is

4
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:18,840
the simple solution to securing ICS in

5
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:22,500
an IOT world and I was tempted to just

6
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,650
say don't connect them and drop the mic

7
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:28,890
and walk offstage who's that yeah but I

8
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:32,460
had to fill some time so no so I that

9
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:33,930
would be fighting the future we know

10
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:37,620
that our ICS at least some of them are

11
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:39,600
and I would argue most of them will be

12
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,840
connected to external devices to cloud

13
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,090
services and other things and and how

14
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:46,590
are we going to do that and how are we

15
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:48,140
going to get in front of this challenge

16
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:52,410
I think one of the problems we have and

17
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:54,270
we need to get our heads around is the

18
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:57,600
terminology because terminology can be

19
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,859
helpful and unhelpful a real good

20
00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:04,799
example of this is is Joe Weiss who I

21
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:08,729
like to call the Paul Revere of our ICS

22
00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:10,799
security community because last decade

23
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:13,439
he was a guy you know we have a problem

24
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:15,540
we have a problem he did tremendous work

25
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:19,409
on awareness but he likes to point to

26
00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:22,280
the NIST definition of a cyber incident

27
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:25,320
that says not only is a cyber incident

28
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,060
when someone attacks your system or you

29
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:29,220
get malware on your system but if for

30
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:32,130
example you reprogrammed your PLC

31
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:34,259
database and didn't scan it and it

32
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:36,780
caused a problem or you miss configure

33
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:39,810
to switch it's a cyber incident anything

34
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:42,150
that is happening over a communication

35
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:45,060
channel on an ICS that causes a problem

36
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:48,750
fits in this cyber incident category and

37
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:52,079
in a sense he's right I don't disagree

38
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:55,170
with that but then when we make that

39
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:58,770
term that global and that encompasses it

40
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:02,549
tends to be less useful to us and what

41
00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:04,200
you really need underneath that is a

42
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,350
taxonomy of types of cyber incidents so

43
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:09,628
we can begin to decide how to protect

44
00:02:09,628 --> 00:02:11,530
against them

45
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:13,240
and I think the same thing has happened

46
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:16,480
to us with the industrial Internet of

47
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,340
Things or whatever you want to call it

48
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:22,500
industrial internet industry 4.0 we have

49
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:25,900
basically included anything that could

50
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:28,540
possibly do monitoring and control in

51
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:33,970
this definition I was at the AARC event

52
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:36,640
in Orlando I guess it was about three

53
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,940
years ago when they first began using

54
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:43,150
this term and I'd go to a talk from an

55
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:44,620
asset owner who had a very traditional

56
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:46,690
SCADA system that had been deployed

57
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:49,090
eight years ago and they were calling it

58
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:52,120
IIT you know and what is your i io t

59
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,910
strategy and every dcs was that and and

60
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:57,250
eventually I talked to Sid who does some

61
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:59,350
of the cybersecurity work for a RC and I

62
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:02,470
asked him flat out I said are you saying

63
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:05,050
that I IOT is everything that we called

64
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:07,840
ICS plus everything new and and the

65
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,180
answer was yes so it has this same

66
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:12,340
problem where it is just all

67
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:15,010
encompassing and so if we ask the

68
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:17,049
question how are we going to secure a

69
00:03:17,049 --> 00:03:20,950
IOT or industrial internet it's very

70
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:22,660
difficult to come up with a useful

71
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:25,930
answer and I'd even take it a step

72
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:28,870
further I'd say when we look at how are

73
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:31,810
we going to secure our ICS we have a

74
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:33,459
tendency to look at them to

75
00:03:33,459 --> 00:03:36,760
monolithically so for example everyone

76
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:40,299
tends to jump to the most dramatic case

77
00:03:40,299 --> 00:03:43,030
the nuclear power plant or something

78
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:45,579
that if it's out for a minute could cost

79
00:03:45,579 --> 00:03:47,739
tremendous amount of money great

80
00:03:47,739 --> 00:03:50,530
inconvenience affect the economy or the

81
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:52,959
environment we tend to jump to this and

82
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:55,780
and certainly it's important that we

83
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:58,510
secure the nuclear power plant but the

84
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:01,090
way we secure that nuclear power plant

85
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:03,190
is probably very different than the way

86
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:06,989
we secure a chewing gum factory a

87
00:04:06,989 --> 00:04:09,730
factory like this maybe runs two

88
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:11,680
eight-hour shifts Monday through Friday

89
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,739
and a one shift on Saturday and if

90
00:04:14,739 --> 00:04:17,738
they're down for seven days it's not

91
00:04:17,738 --> 00:04:20,168
that big of a deal now they're not gonna

92
00:04:20,168 --> 00:04:21,820
be happy about it but they just run

93
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:23,590
three shifts till they catch up and they

94
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:25,590
produce their product

95
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:28,620
so securing this is going to be very

96
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:31,320
different than securing a nuclear power

97
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:34,380
plant and then if we look even at a

98
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:36,990
different I guess dimension think about

99
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:40,830
all the small ICS we have this is a

100
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:45,870
small municipal water system and in this

101
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:48,510
example they have two people in their IT

102
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:51,870
department and that those two people are

103
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:53,850
responsible for the email server the

104
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:56,850
printers the VP's laptop that's

105
00:04:56,850 --> 00:05:00,680
constantly breaking and the SCADA system

106
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:04,200
okay so they have really no chance of

107
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:07,260
doing a good job with their ICS security

108
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:09,419
policy so we have a lot of different

109
00:05:09,419 --> 00:05:13,500
conditions but for this talk today I

110
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:16,470
want to focus on I want to use the term

111
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:18,120
that most of us have lived with for the

112
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,760
last three to five years ICS to mean

113
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:24,090
traditional DCs SCADA PLC based control

114
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:27,530
and tackle what is a simple solution for

115
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:32,100
connecting these ICS to external devices

116
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:34,050
in the example I'm going to use most is

117
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:38,100
the cloud so how do we take advantages

118
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:40,710
of these services while still protecting

119
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:47,760
our ICS before I mentioned when we talk

120
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,800
about ICS we tend to jump to the worst

121
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,440
most dramatic conclusion like a nuclear

122
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,690
power plant when we talk about things

123
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:57,630
like cloud services we tend to jump to

124
00:05:57,630 --> 00:06:00,060
the easiest one to secure and the one

125
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:02,389
you hear most often is this idea of

126
00:06:02,389 --> 00:06:04,860
predictive maintenance or efficiency

127
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:08,460
studies so the idea is you you have your

128
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:11,250
ICS it's creating all this data you send

129
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:13,950
it out to this third party vendor or

130
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:16,350
probably your ICS vendor or somebody who

131
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:19,110
knows the industry they crunch the data

132
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:21,389
and they say oh you know you were

133
00:06:21,389 --> 00:06:23,370
supposed to do this maintenance at six

134
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:25,470
months but it's been dirty or you need

135
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:26,940
to do it at three months to prevent

136
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:30,090
downtime or if you change this setting

137
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:32,940
you will generate more power and this is

138
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:35,099
really a tremendous service this is

139
00:06:35,099 --> 00:06:38,039
something that asset owners like because

140
00:06:38,039 --> 00:06:39,520
it allows them

141
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,740
to have less downtime and more

142
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:43,870
efficiency and of course the vendors

143
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:46,090
like it because they can make money from

144
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:49,300
this service and this is a real easy one

145
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:51,370
to secure I'm sure you've seen a lot of

146
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:54,720
you have seen this if you need the data

147
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,460
out in the cloud or wherever you want to

148
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:58,930
send it you can just send it through a

149
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:01,659
one-way device and that way they have

150
00:07:01,659 --> 00:07:04,870
the data they can offer the service but

151
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:06,849
you don't put the availability or

152
00:07:06,849 --> 00:07:09,819
integrity of your ICS at risk so this

153
00:07:09,819 --> 00:07:11,860
one is really simple and a lot of times

154
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:14,680
people jump to this but what we're

155
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:18,580
finding and these are anonymized

156
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:20,229
conversations that we've had over the

157
00:07:20,229 --> 00:07:23,470
last couple of years is they really want

158
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:24,960
to do more than predictive maintenance

159
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:30,039
so in this case our the the client was

160
00:07:30,039 --> 00:07:32,139
the asset owner and they wanted this

161
00:07:32,139 --> 00:07:34,240
predictive maintenance service and the

162
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,610
vendor says well we need to access this

163
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:39,520
server on your ICS to get the data you

164
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,560
say well no we don't want to let you

165
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,870
into our system we'll send you the data

166
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:46,590
through one of these one-way devices

167
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:49,360
vendor you know repeats no no we have to

168
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,099
get the data we send the data this goes

169
00:07:51,099 --> 00:07:53,530
back and forth back and forth literally

170
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:55,539
in the example I'm thinking of it was

171
00:07:55,539 --> 00:07:57,880
over 10 calls in over one year before

172
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:00,279
they finally agreed that we could send

173
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:02,500
them the data and it just seemed really

174
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:06,550
strange but then you look at the shoe on

175
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:08,830
the other foot so in this case the

176
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:11,620
vendor was a client the vendor who

177
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:13,060
wanted to provide this predictive

178
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:14,529
maintenance service was a client and

179
00:08:14,529 --> 00:08:17,889
they said hey we want to offer this

180
00:08:17,889 --> 00:08:19,630
service but we know we're gonna be asked

181
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:22,210
a security question so how do we have a

182
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:25,750
great answer when they say will our ICS

183
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:28,120
or our underlying process be at risk by

184
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,680
getting this predictive maintenance

185
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:33,789
service no problem you know we can have

186
00:08:33,789 --> 00:08:35,979
a variety of tiered options and the most

187
00:08:35,979 --> 00:08:38,169
secure option for your most

188
00:08:38,169 --> 00:08:40,510
security-conscious clients would be one

189
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:42,309
of these one-way devices we can

190
00:08:42,309 --> 00:08:44,649
guarantee them that we can provide the

191
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:46,870
service and we will not be able to get

192
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:48,699
on their network so we will not be the

193
00:08:48,699 --> 00:08:51,880
source of an attack and then you get to

194
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:52,840
the truth

195
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:57,640
the vendors say well we have visions for

196
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,230
the future where we want to do a lot

197
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:01,120
more than just predictive maintenance

198
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,670
where we actually want to be able to

199
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:06,850
access the ICS so they don't want to put

200
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:10,240
in this capability that restricts them

201
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,540
from offering future services and and my

202
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:17,290
my guess you know I heard rumblings in

203
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:18,610
the organization's but when we were

204
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:20,650
representing the asset owner the same

205
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:23,170
was thing was true the vendor wanted to

206
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:26,740
provide additional services and so I

207
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:29,470
think what we're going to find in action

208
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:31,270
it's happening today is vendors will

209
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:32,770
want to provide a variety of services

210
00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:35,010
much beyond predictive maintenance

211
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:37,690
including things like remote operations

212
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:41,230
remote engineers almost right in some

213
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:43,240
cases running almost everything remotely

214
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:47,020
and there are going to be cases and I

215
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:49,990
think the industry is under estimating

216
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:51,580
the number of them but there are going

217
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:52,930
to be many cases where it makes

218
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:56,380
financial sense for the owner operator

219
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:59,580
to take advantage of those services

220
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:01,960
either because they can do it with

221
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,820
acceptable risk or they're not doing a

222
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:05,020
good job on their own

223
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:07,839
so we need to come up with a way of

224
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:11,020
dealing with this and my simple solution

225
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:15,580
is four steps the first step is probably

226
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:19,450
the hardest in the most important there

227
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:22,089
needs to be a definition the vendor has

228
00:10:22,089 --> 00:10:24,460
to define in this case let's say the

229
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:25,930
cloud service provider needs to

230
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:28,030
specifically define the set of services

231
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:31,030
they are willing to offer remotely from

232
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:34,300
the cloud to the owner operator and this

233
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:38,470
has to be a very granular definition the

234
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:42,130
owner operator needs to understand what

235
00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:45,400
would be the impact if that cloud

236
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:48,820
service provider was compromised so if

237
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:50,890
he was able to do all the things that I

238
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:52,540
want to allow him to do what would be

239
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:54,820
the impact to my system and they need to

240
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:58,390
be able to live with that now this does

241
00:10:58,390 --> 00:11:00,640
not mean that you you you don't look at

242
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,280
the security of your service provider he

243
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:05,170
should be following best practices you

244
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:06,220
should be getting the certification

245
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:09,310
Haitians and in fact it's it's a little

246
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:12,460
bit scary because we're seeing a number

247
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:15,520
of vendors in this industry not learn

248
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:17,140
the lessons of what's already been done

249
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:19,090
they're basically creating these

250
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:21,250
services and trying to figure out what

251
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:22,930
is the appropriate way to secure them

252
00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:24,940
rather than taking what has already been

253
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:28,000
developed and proven but even with a

254
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,670
vendor providing good cloud services you

255
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:32,290
have to assume that they're going to be

256
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:34,780
compromised and then what could do what

257
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:36,550
are you going to allow them to do to

258
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:40,240
your system so for example you could

259
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,100
allow them to operate but not change the

260
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:44,620
logic or program you could allow them to

261
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,900
operate part of your plant you could

262
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:48,940
allow them to write to certain function

263
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:51,280
call or write to certain registers so

264
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:53,170
turn certain things on and off or change

265
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:55,390
certain settings but not others again

266
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:56,980
you're getting down to that level of

267
00:11:56,980 --> 00:12:01,660
granularity I put request Diagnostics on

268
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:04,870
there they're just almost as a as a

269
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:07,510
counterexample this would be something

270
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:10,120
that could be pushed out but if you are

271
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,830
going to allow the cloud service

272
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:15,070
provider access into your system then

273
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:17,140
the value of deploying a separate

274
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:19,360
unidirectional gateway or one-way system

275
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,250
or data diode whatever you want to call

276
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:24,880
it is much less so as soon as you're

277
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,350
allowing the cloud service provider

278
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:28,570
access into your system you might as

279
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:31,570
well Lao whatever you're going to permit

280
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:35,380
based on this agreement now I want to

281
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:37,870
take just a slight detour from my four

282
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:42,910
steps to talk about I think a really

283
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:46,450
exciting field and I think the the next

284
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:49,150
talk on the cyber PHA is really

285
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:52,120
applicable to this you know if we think

286
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:55,570
that we have agreed with our cloud

287
00:12:55,570 --> 00:12:57,190
service provider that they can do these

288
00:12:57,190 --> 00:13:01,300
things remotely into our system if a bad

289
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:02,950
guy is able to do these things they will

290
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:05,370
be able to have some level of impact

291
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:08,680
today one thing we could do to allow

292
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:13,210
remote services is relook at well is

293
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:15,340
there some safety control is there some

294
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:17,290
way we can change our control logics so

295
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:18,540
if

296
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:21,660
the bad guy gets into the cloud and if

297
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:23,760
he runs these commands the consequences

298
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,340
are lower so we can actually be re

299
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:28,100
looking at our safety and our protection

300
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:31,350
philosophies to reduce risk for remote

301
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:33,630
operations I mean this could be

302
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:36,960
deploying non cyber safety mechanisms to

303
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,970
prevent bad things from happening

304
00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:40,940
it could be processed based for example

305
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:43,380
maybe you'll allow them to run this

306
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:45,480
critical command but there's a physical

307
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:48,630
switch in your plant that you have to

308
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:50,010
flip before that command will be

309
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:54,600
actually actionable so I think this is

310
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,720
this is a real good area where if you're

311
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,130
going to want someone to do remote

312
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:00,540
services you're going to have to go back

313
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:03,990
and look at your safety philosophy and

314
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:08,060
and I would point you to Ralph langner's

315
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:10,740
presentation at last year's s4 where it

316
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:13,800
shows a real good example of modifying

317
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:17,100
safety the way we look at safety for a

318
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:21,930
nuclear feed water system so you may be

319
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:23,850
able to extend what you think is

320
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:26,730
possible with remote services or cloud

321
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:29,850
services if you adjust that okay so step

322
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:34,080
one define cloud service provider a

323
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:36,330
Sedona specifically what you're going to

324
00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:39,450
allow them to do number two then is to

325
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:42,180
find a way to enforce that so you're

326
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:43,830
going to need a security perimeter

327
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:47,070
device that restricts them to these

328
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:51,570
pre-approved items now the good news is

329
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:53,220
I'm sure a lot of you saw this if you

330
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:54,750
walked around the Cabana sessions

331
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:57,240
yesterday and we have even more vendors

332
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:02,490
as attendees anomaly detection gateway

333
00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:05,040
devices with deep packet inspection for

334
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:09,390
ICS is a very quick growing a very

335
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:11,490
competitive field with lots of options

336
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:15,060
out there so having something like this

337
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:18,540
should not be difficult it would require

338
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:21,930
the the cloud service provider to

339
00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:23,760
partner with one of these vendors and

340
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:26,730
say okay here's what we want here's the

341
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:28,620
let's say the menu that we want them to

342
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:30,090
be able to choose from and when they

343
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:32,310
choose this mem this menu item we need

344
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:32,700
to be

345
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:37,530
able to enforce it in your device this

346
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:39,530
also might be a great area for

347
00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:42,000
certification testing because once

348
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,540
you've once you've defined what's

349
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:47,520
allowed through what should be allowed

350
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,830
through put a device in place to enforce

351
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:51,450
that then steps three and four are

352
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:55,680
really just making sure it works so step

353
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,420
three would be making sure the perimeter

354
00:15:57,420 --> 00:16:01,430
security device works properly and

355
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:03,360
hopefully this would not be something

356
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,990
that each asset owner would have to do

357
00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:08,670
ideally this would be something that the

358
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:10,560
vendor would be able to say hey we we've

359
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,390
done this testing here you can look at

360
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:14,250
the test reports the system actually

361
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:17,130
works and and most asset owners might be

362
00:16:17,130 --> 00:16:19,650
willing to accept that of course you can

363
00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:21,390
test it if you have your own doubts and

364
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:23,790
then number four is a little bit

365
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:25,530
different and this is a number four is a

366
00:16:25,530 --> 00:16:28,980
little bit like fuzzing the idea is

367
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:30,660
you've agreed to allow this

368
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:32,190
communication through your security

369
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:35,400
perimeter from let's say a potentially

370
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,830
compromised site out on the internet or

371
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:40,890
in the cloud somewhere if that allowed

372
00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:43,590
traffic is allowed to reach a PLC or an

373
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:45,330
engineering workstation or whatever you

374
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:49,350
choose will that cause a negative action

375
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:51,870
let's say an unexpected action on that

376
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:54,960
server of course if you allow them to

377
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,760
send a command through that command is

378
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,890
going to be activated but this is really

379
00:16:58,890 --> 00:17:01,050
similar to fuzz testing and the nice

380
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:03,750
thing about this is if we've defined the

381
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:06,170
hole in our security perimeter tightly

382
00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:09,990
then this testing doesn't have the code

383
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:12,000
coverage problem that fuzz testing has

384
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,970
we should be able to actually test the

385
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:18,150
entire amount of what is allowed through

386
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:20,220
the security perimeter and validate that

387
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:22,050
it for example doesn't cause the end

388
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:26,160
device to crash so this is this is my my

389
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,950
four-step simple solution it's and in

390
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:30,120
the first step again it's the most

391
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:33,120
important the vendors needs to say these

392
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,070
are the remote services we offer the

393
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:36,780
asset owner needs to say yes I will

394
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:39,180
accept these services and and they're

395
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:40,050
well-defined

396
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:42,300
you put a security perimeter device in

397
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:45,720
place that restricts the cloud service

398
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:46,470
provider

399
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:50,630
to those services and the asset owner

400
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:52,860
understands the impact if that cloud

401
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:55,350
service provider is compromised and is

402
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:57,179
willing to accept it and then steps

403
00:17:57,179 --> 00:17:58,919
three and four verify that the thing

404
00:17:58,919 --> 00:18:01,110
actually works and those services will

405
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:03,240
not damage your system to an

406
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:10,140
unacceptable level now my fear is that

407
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:13,049
the ICS community we have we have a bad

408
00:18:13,049 --> 00:18:17,370
history of opening Pandora's Box without

409
00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:20,850
understanding the implications of it if

410
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:22,950
you think back to the 90s when we

411
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:25,230
started connecting corporate networks to

412
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:27,690
ICS we connected everything up and then

413
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:30,240
later on we decided we needed to start

414
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,309
worrying about how to secure it we bring

415
00:18:32,309 --> 00:18:33,960
windows in and then we start to worry

416
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,730
about how to secure it I mean we're

417
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:37,620
seeing this with virtualization all

418
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:41,190
sorts of technologies the the key thing

419
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:44,580
for us here is that we don't for example

420
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:47,990
start allowing a cloud service provider

421
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:50,730
unrestricted access to our ICS at the

422
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:53,309
beginning because it's very difficult to

423
00:18:53,309 --> 00:18:55,169
pull that back at the end this is

424
00:18:55,169 --> 00:18:58,080
something that we need to get in front

425
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:01,110
of and I'm hoping that this will give

426
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:03,900
you some ideas with your projects on how

427
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:07,289
to take advantage of these these great

428
00:19:07,289 --> 00:19:09,539
new services that are being offered at a

429
00:19:09,539 --> 00:19:11,400
risk level that's acceptable to you

430
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,750
thank you very much

431
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:28,500
you
