1
00:00:05,629 --> 00:00:08,639
please welcome mark black mayor to the

2
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:18,359
s4 main stage thanks good afternoon

3
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:20,640
now what we're gonna do is talk about

4
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:21,960
this project that we're working on it

5
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:24,330
what I want to emphasize is this is not

6
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:27,060
about a Cisco product this is not

7
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:29,849
something that we want to sell it is an

8
00:00:29,849 --> 00:00:33,000
approach to looking at IO T security and

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,730
really what I'm here to do is a give you

10
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:37,670
an update tell you what it's about and

11
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:41,040
number to invite your your participation

12
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:45,180
in the whole process so I wish I had

13
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:47,460
time to now I'm realizing I should have

14
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:50,610
had a spoon a spork and a fork up here

15
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:52,020
might have helped translate this picture

16
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:54,420
a little better but when we're looking

17
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:58,050
at the IOT we kind of see it in three

18
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:01,140
main areas so you've got traditional IT

19
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:03,989
data centers mobility cloud the stuff

20
00:01:03,989 --> 00:01:06,180
that you'd expect of course ot I don't

21
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:07,950
need to define that for this crowd here

22
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:10,500
and then the CT aspect of it which is

23
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,650
consumer technology so we think

24
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:15,420
connected home fitbit's all that kind of

25
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:18,030
fun stuff and I'll probably be more

26
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:21,119
focused in the itct space maybe we'll

27
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:23,189
talk about ot a little bit but I just at

28
00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:25,680
least one a level set there and I think

29
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,509
when we look at a IOT security there are

30
00:01:30,509 --> 00:01:33,540
two main things that stand out about IOT

31
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:36,689
to me than other realms of security I

32
00:01:36,689 --> 00:01:38,520
think in some ways what we're seeing

33
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,920
with the IOT is just more of the same

34
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:43,079
when we look at security I'm a big

35
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:46,409
believer in foundational best practices

36
00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:48,720
for example but I think there are two

37
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,820
distinct things that set the IOT apart

38
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:53,640
number one connected does not equal

39
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,979
smart I try not to use the term smart

40
00:01:55,979 --> 00:01:57,960
when I refer to these devices because

41
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,630
they're anything but smart what I see

42
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:02,909
them are vulnerabilities I see them as

43
00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:05,280
attack vectors so that's problem number

44
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,970
number one the next issue I see is

45
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:13,709
really around oh sorry let me expand on

46
00:02:13,709 --> 00:02:14,040
that

47
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,079
because when we're looking at these

48
00:02:16,079 --> 00:02:17,420
devices

49
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:21,180
you know the idea of should you connect

50
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:23,430
it just because you can doesn't mean you

51
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:25,709
should do we really need these things

52
00:02:25,709 --> 00:02:27,239
connected to the Internet do we need

53
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:28,469
light bulbs that are on there

54
00:02:28,469 --> 00:02:31,019
do we need health monitors baby monitors

55
00:02:31,019 --> 00:02:32,579
things like that do they really have a

56
00:02:32,579 --> 00:02:34,650
place there but what I would say for

57
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:36,810
those of us in this room who focus on

58
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:40,139
security really the the idea is just

59
00:02:40,139 --> 00:02:42,510
irrelevant it's gonna happen people

60
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:45,329
don't care there well that's the Jaden

61
00:02:45,329 --> 00:02:48,389
side of me speaking I think that there

62
00:02:48,389 --> 00:02:50,280
are great benefits that come from this

63
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,260
connectivity if they weren't there we

64
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:55,290
wouldn't have them but the reality of it

65
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:57,000
is really just everything's gonna get

66
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,500
connected we're gonna keep seeing it and

67
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,480
for us as defenders

68
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,870
that's just our reality so the next

69
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:06,209
thing that I wanted to talk about too is

70
00:03:06,209 --> 00:03:09,150
scale so I think that is one thing that

71
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:11,639
is unique to the IOT is just the sheer

72
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:15,030
scale of what's being connected Gartner

73
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:16,889
estimates that there will be twenty

74
00:03:16,889 --> 00:03:20,159
billion connected things by 2020 we at

75
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:22,290
Cisco estimate there'll be 50 billion

76
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:24,690
connected things but I think when you're

77
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:26,370
a network administrator when you're on

78
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:28,379
the security team it really doesn't

79
00:03:28,379 --> 00:03:30,359
matter which number turns out to be

80
00:03:30,359 --> 00:03:32,280
correct in the long run you're dealing

81
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,500
with a scale like we haven't seen before

82
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,780
it takes up a lot of time it takes up

83
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:39,599
resources that costs money and then of

84
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:41,819
course to really complexity is the enemy

85
00:03:41,819 --> 00:03:44,099
of security so those are the hallmarks

86
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:48,329
that I see here and we can talk a lot

87
00:03:48,329 --> 00:03:51,030
about the manufacturers of these devices

88
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:53,129
how mature they are from a security

89
00:03:53,129 --> 00:03:55,799
perspective what their intentions are I

90
00:03:55,799 --> 00:03:57,479
don't know if any of you has seen that

91
00:03:57,479 --> 00:04:01,139
the FTC is actually going after a maker

92
00:04:01,139 --> 00:04:04,409
of connected devices saying that they

93
00:04:04,409 --> 00:04:07,079
had misled customers as to the security

94
00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:09,000
of those devices so we do have that

95
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
element to contend with but there's the

96
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,699
reality of what manufacturers are up

97
00:04:14,699 --> 00:04:16,680
against they are in a commercial market

98
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:19,918
they do have price pressures competition

99
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:22,380
many of these devices of course are

100
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:26,730
commodity devices so can they even power

101
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:28,230
would be needed to run any kind of

102
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:31,020
decent security so aside from the

103
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:33,390
security maturity and the things there

104
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:35,700
are just some realities that make

105
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:37,380
defending these things as securing these

106
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:42,210
devices almost impossible and so when

107
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:43,950
we're looking at that too even if a

108
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:47,550
device is quote unquote secure how long

109
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:50,280
is it secure let's just even forget

110
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,960
about the definition of what secure

111
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:54,210
means how long is it going to be secure

112
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:56,880
and again from a connected device

113
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,950
perspective look at the sales model for

114
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:03,120
example on an Android phones not to pick

115
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,500
on them but I'd like to look at the

116
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:07,980
business model and really handset makers

117
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:09,720
are the ones putting the phones out

118
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,880
there so they make their money by

119
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:15,840
selling handsets so if a device actually

120
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,870
I have a tablet at home that I bought

121
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:21,330
and I realized that vendor never ever

122
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:25,350
ever pushes out updates so what I did is

123
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:26,520
finally when I realized that I let the

124
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,500
battery run out I put it away and moved

125
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,560
on because I don't want that in my home

126
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,790
but that's what we're looking at so the

127
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:35,460
thing is you have a device and maybe

128
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,500
secure in the beginning it goes end of

129
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,270
support but you're gonna use it a lot

130
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:40,950
longer and so when we look at that

131
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:44,400
across IOT devices connected devices we

132
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,030
have a problem with a time line of

133
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:52,200
devices remaining in use but insecure so

134
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:55,050
now that I've filled you all with shiny

135
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:57,480
rainbows and unicorns about the state of

136
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:00,210
things what can we do about it how do we

137
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:01,680
fix that and that's the thing that we're

138
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,760
here all to talk about and you know it

139
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,980
is it gonna take standards I hear people

140
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:09,920
talking about the need for new standards

141
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:12,630
I'm of the opinion they're great

142
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:14,850
actually my background and insecurities

143
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:18,420
around sim so pulling in multiple data

144
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:20,340
sources and trying to normalize data to

145
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:21,690
make sense of it so I appreciate

146
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:24,870
standards they do have a place the IOT

147
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:29,340
is just so vast so different throughout

148
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:32,910
that whole continuum if you will that no

149
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:34,560
one standard is going to work so we'll

150
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,000
have them they make sense I see it from

151
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,730
an interoperability perspective but

152
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:39,169
really

153
00:06:39,169 --> 00:06:41,509
you know not so much on really helping

154
00:06:41,509 --> 00:06:45,349
security all that much on the regulation

155
00:06:45,349 --> 00:06:48,409
side this is where my libertarian

156
00:06:48,409 --> 00:06:51,830
tendencies come through I tend to view

157
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:56,060
regulations as a symptom that we in the

158
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:58,279
private sector have failed to regulate

159
00:06:58,279 --> 00:07:01,430
ourselves so they do have their place

160
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:03,319
actually at lunch I was chatting with

161
00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:06,050
somebody about how Newark sip actually

162
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:09,439
really helped them improve their network

163
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:12,289
it allowed them to standardize under the

164
00:07:12,289 --> 00:07:14,599
guise of sip so I get it you know they

165
00:07:14,599 --> 00:07:16,759
do have their place and I think when we

166
00:07:16,759 --> 00:07:18,589
look at things like I mentioned the FTC

167
00:07:18,589 --> 00:07:21,080
case I think that makes a lot of sense

168
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:23,120
when they prompt companies to do the

169
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,759
right thing but for me they're not the

170
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:31,550
the be-all end-all so we get to thinking

171
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:33,919
and by we I mean a bunch of other people

172
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:37,370
at Cisco who are smarter than me and we

173
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:38,960
get to thinking so instead of just

174
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,360
really trying to reshape the world what

175
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,029
if we took a look at using existing

176
00:07:44,029 --> 00:07:46,430
standards using things that are already

177
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:49,580
there rather than trying to really just

178
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:51,139
reinvent the wheel we don't want to do

179
00:07:51,139 --> 00:07:52,969
that and then what if we leverage

180
00:07:52,969 --> 00:07:56,180
subject matter expertise in the

181
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:58,159
different areas the IOT so around

182
00:07:58,159 --> 00:08:00,339
networking around the devices themselves

183
00:08:00,339 --> 00:08:03,919
from the administrators in order to kind

184
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:07,219
of spread out the the security

185
00:08:07,219 --> 00:08:09,740
distribute security if you will to those

186
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:12,139
areas with those people the subject

187
00:08:12,139 --> 00:08:14,060
matter expertise and so that's what we

188
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:18,649
did so the idea around mud manufacturer

189
00:08:18,649 --> 00:08:22,300
usage description is that we look at

190
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:26,659
network security vendors as experts

191
00:08:26,659 --> 00:08:30,229
should be experts in that world device

192
00:08:30,229 --> 00:08:31,759
manufacturers they're gonna know what

193
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:35,419
their devices are meant to do they know

194
00:08:35,419 --> 00:08:37,219
how they're supposed to communicate

195
00:08:37,219 --> 00:08:40,429
that's their area of expertise and then

196
00:08:40,429 --> 00:08:42,769
the network administrator will know what

197
00:08:42,769 --> 00:08:45,050
is appropriate for that environment so

198
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:47,209
we looked at a way to kind of break this

199
00:08:47,209 --> 00:08:50,269
out amongst those three pillars such

200
00:08:50,269 --> 00:08:51,050
that

201
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:53,420
we use those together and then create a

202
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:56,030
really I guess more secure environment

203
00:08:56,030 --> 00:09:00,170
so well it works is like this so if we

204
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:02,810
take we have our intended communications

205
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:06,320
so anywhere on a network we know what is

206
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,050
supposed to happen we know what we want

207
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:12,080
to have happen but the reality of it is

208
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,240
you look at something like this is great

209
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,100
yes this is the whole thing about the

210
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:18,560
IOT you've got say a doctor in a remote

211
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,030
place and they go through some

212
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:21,620
cloud-based app that goes back in a

213
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:23,660
hospital and they do all these great and

214
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:26,000
wonderful things and everybody's happy

215
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,180
and there's rainbows and unicorns

216
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:31,970
but the reality of it is we don't know

217
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:34,760
what's going on many of you hear

218
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:37,490
consultants many of you here work in the

219
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:39,950
field so you know that a lot of times

220
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:41,120
when you're working with a customer

221
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,280
maybe even in your own environment that

222
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,560
you have what's intended to happen

223
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,780
what's what what you're trying to do and

224
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:50,210
then actually what is going on and so we

225
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:52,970
don't always know what that is and so

226
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:54,440
we're looking at it from a perspective

227
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,390
of we think the network is the right

228
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:59,980
place to mitigate that kind of

229
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:02,090
unintended consequence of fuel

230
00:10:02,090 --> 00:10:04,760
unintended communications and this is

231
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:07,280
where the manufacturer usage descriptors

232
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:09,440
come in or mud so being able to work

233
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,140
that into the network and so here's

234
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:15,440
here's how it works so the idea is in

235
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,080
this case if we take a DHCP environment

236
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:20,780
so we've got our our light bulb here so

237
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:22,660
it's gonna be looking for an IP address

238
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:25,160
so what we're proposing is a change to

239
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:27,590
the DHCP standard is just one extra

240
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:30,650
field and what happens in that field is

241
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:33,020
when this device requests an IP address

242
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:35,480
from the controller that field will

243
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,670
contain a URI and it's gonna look

244
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:40,520
something something like this where it's

245
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:43,280
gonna go out to its manufacturer based

246
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:45,890
on the manufacturers website the the

247
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:47,510
model and version number of the device

248
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:49,850
and what it's going to do is we'll take

249
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:53,120
that URI and then the network controller

250
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,970
will go in query the website of the

251
00:10:55,970 --> 00:10:58,010
manufacturer to pull down that file and

252
00:10:58,010 --> 00:11:00,980
so what we see next then is then the

253
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:02,780
manufacturer just returns with the file

254
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:03,590
and here's a

255
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:06,320
a sample mud file so basically it says

256
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,540
here's what that device is here's what

257
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:10,190
it should do it'll contain some other

258
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:12,710
information but we're then able to take

259
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:15,320
that bring that in and look at a more

260
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:18,170
detailed config and so within the

261
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:21,110
network itself basically it's working on

262
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:24,110
the idea of okay what does the file call

263
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:26,840
out specifically this device can do XY

264
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:29,090
and Z and then pretty much anything else

265
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:32,660
is implied as not being allowed so that

266
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:35,800
way we have that in it comes into the

267
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:39,290
the access list and that we have policy

268
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:42,080
on the network and so in that by the way

269
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:44,000
to the network administrator is the

270
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,360
final arbiter to say whether or not this

271
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,880
policy will be instantiated in their

272
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,860
environment because they know their

273
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:53,920
network they know their network the best

274
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:57,500
but what the end result here is that you

275
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:00,200
get basically putting devices in their

276
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:00,980
own swimlanes

277
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:04,400
so that way they are we're mitigating

278
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:07,450
the possibility of those being used for

279
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:09,950
being used as access points that kind of

280
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:11,630
toehold in the network trying to prevent

281
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:14,210
that lateral movement from a device

282
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:19,100
talking to to other devices and so one

283
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,570
of the things when this was first

284
00:12:20,570 --> 00:12:23,210
presented to me first question I had

285
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:25,220
around it was around the security of it

286
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:28,370
itself and so this is one of the reasons

287
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:30,020
- we're looking looking for assistance

288
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:34,100
as I'll get into more but in the DHCP

289
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:35,870
type of environment we have to trust the

290
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:37,910
the device that's making the request

291
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:41,260
that it is what it says it is we can see

292
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,940
working in some measures to prevent that

293
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:45,890
but when we're looking at a say an

294
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:49,220
eight-oh 2.1 AR type of environment they

295
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:51,380
were able to work with with signed certs

296
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:53,500
so that we have a better chance of

297
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:56,480
showing that or that there's proof that

298
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,360
the device and the manufacturers say who

299
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,920
they are that way there's a higher level

300
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,960
of confidence when the network

301
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:05,500
administrator pulls this information

302
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:09,670
so we're not pitching this concept as

303
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:12,070
the be-all end-all this is not one of

304
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:15,430
these things where we say once mud comes

305
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:17,320
to life you can throw everything out and

306
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,780
you just need this one thing that is not

307
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:21,550
at all what we're saying we're looking

308
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:23,950
at creating a standard here that is

309
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:26,380
another level of defense in depth so it

310
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:28,630
complements existing technologies we're

311
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:30,160
not really trying to replace anything

312
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:33,610
we're trying to augment and again as I

313
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:35,410
mentioned the idea here is to prevent

314
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:37,990
lateral movement so you see a lot of

315
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:39,790
attacks where that is you just find

316
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:41,440
something in the network that you can

317
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,210
get on and pivot from there so we're

318
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:45,460
trying to block that I think if you

319
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:48,010
think of the the Merai example you know

320
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:50,080
the idea that why would my IP enabled

321
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:53,130
camera be trying to go to a particular

322
00:13:53,130 --> 00:13:56,200
writers website that just doesn't make

323
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,580
sense it's just that kind of idea that

324
00:13:57,580 --> 00:14:00,310
just explicitly being able to say no

325
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:01,630
this only talks to its controller

326
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:03,820
thereby blocking that type of behavior

327
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:08,050
and then really it's about the scale how

328
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:09,970
do we conquer the scale I've certainly

329
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:11,890
seen customers who had to go around and

330
00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:14,140
find rogue access points for example on

331
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:16,380
a large campus and they would just go

332
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:18,400
building by building floor by floor

333
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,650
section by section just trying to find

334
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:22,450
devices that they knew or on their

335
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:23,920
network but they didn't know physically

336
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,680
so the idea here is that the the

337
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,240
administrators aren't going out having

338
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,700
to physically find these things that

339
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:32,500
this is actually mud helps them take

340
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:36,730
care of that now what it doesn't do this

341
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:38,980
is not an authentication method so

342
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:40,840
devices that are on the network would be

343
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:43,540
authenticated through any existing

344
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:45,640
existing measures now mud was not

345
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:49,510
intended to replace that and really it's

346
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:52,120
it's more about keeping the devices in

347
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:52,930
their swimlanes

348
00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:55,900
not so much about if something's already

349
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:57,520
popped we'll keep it in the right

350
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:59,980
direction but it's not really so much a

351
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:04,540
tool to replace an IPS for example now

352
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:05,830
the other thing that where we see it too

353
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:08,560
is actually where would you would deploy

354
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,730
this again we don't see this being

355
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:12,240
deployed for every type of environment

356
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,170
certainly in the healthcare industry

357
00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:16,240
with those types of devices we think it

358
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,610
makes a lot of sense

359
00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:20,370
we're looking more in dynamic types of

360
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:22,380
environments where things change on a

361
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:25,590
regular basis do I see this out in a

362
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:29,100
substation maybe not but then again

363
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:31,080
we've had some people come back to us

364
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,730
with some use cases that we had never

365
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:34,589
considered before because we had a

366
00:15:34,589 --> 00:15:36,570
specific idea when we went out it's one

367
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:37,800
of those things sometimes where somebody

368
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,480
will will surprise you and go oh hey

369
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,130
let's use it this way and we hadn't

370
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:44,400
thought of that so the benefit that we

371
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:48,450
see for end customers again is that

372
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:51,029
savings in effort so really that's an OP

373
00:15:51,029 --> 00:15:53,400
X type of thing so you don't want your

374
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:56,150
team of well-paid administrators in

375
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:58,830
engineers running around chasing rogue

376
00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:01,170
access points figuring out where all the

377
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:03,330
connected light bulbs are figuring out

378
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:04,890
how they behave all the things that go

379
00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:06,540
with what's now connected to a network

380
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:09,510
the idea is to stop having them do that

381
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:11,370
or at least really cut that down so

382
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:12,450
there's definitely an effects

383
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:15,540
perspective to this we're also where

384
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:17,100
we're pitching this we're trying to make

385
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:19,620
this a new standard the idea is to not

386
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:21,750
throw out everything that's already out

387
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:24,480
there a rip and replace of existing

388
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,450
infrastructure is not realistic it just

389
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:29,370
won't happen you're still going to have

390
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:30,900
dinosaurs on the network they may have a

391
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:34,710
service to use on there so we're not

392
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:36,120
talking about a complete rip and replace

393
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,910
if anything it's a software update and

394
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:41,820
in the case of 802 dot one AR there's

395
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:43,350
actually wouldn't be any coding changes

396
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:44,790
really needed it would be probably more

397
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:48,060
on your network security provider to

398
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:49,860
support the standard for the

399
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:52,200
manufacturers of devices themselves that

400
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:55,170
also gives them the opportunity to focus

401
00:16:55,170 --> 00:16:59,730
on their devices really at and I'm not

402
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:06,209
gonna go there the the yeah I think you

403
00:17:06,209 --> 00:17:07,140
know where I'm going I know some of you

404
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:09,900
telepathic you've heard me rant but no

405
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:12,599
the idea here being that they can focus

406
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:14,189
on doing what they need to do because

407
00:17:14,189 --> 00:17:16,829
either a they can't build security knew

408
00:17:16,829 --> 00:17:18,839
these things they won't build it well

409
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:20,670
into these things or they just don't

410
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:23,339
care so that kind of removes that off

411
00:17:23,339 --> 00:17:25,980
the off the table it's just basically

412
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:29,100
creating this file so what's next so why

413
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:29,750
am I tell

414
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:34,159
you all of this stuff well it's because

415
00:17:34,159 --> 00:17:37,669
this is an open approach it's an open

416
00:17:37,669 --> 00:17:40,640
standard that we're looking to create we

417
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:44,600
are with the IETF now to get that DHCP

418
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,669
update finalized and blessed and all

419
00:17:46,669 --> 00:17:48,500
that kind of good stuff so that's in

420
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:49,250
progress

421
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:52,270
now we are looking for other

422
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:55,900
organizations to help us refine the RFC

423
00:17:55,900 --> 00:18:00,049
we really don't want this to be a Cisco

424
00:18:00,049 --> 00:18:03,440
only thing as I mentioned this this is

425
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,000
more of a community thing we're looking

426
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,850
for input from others for use cases we

427
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:10,100
never thought of especially in the

428
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:12,530
security community we want you to poke

429
00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:14,630
holes it we know it's not perfect we're

430
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:18,260
not claiming that it's perfect we like

431
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:19,490
to think we've gone through a bunch of

432
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:21,289
scenarios but the more holes it can be

433
00:18:21,289 --> 00:18:23,360
poked into it then we can start filling

434
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,710
those things and it'll be that much

435
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:27,860
better there is online if you want to

436
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:29,330
check it out I know this is gonna go on

437
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:31,159
YouTube so don't put the URL up there

438
00:18:31,159 --> 00:18:33,860
come see me you can actually create your

439
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:36,440
own mud files one of the the architects

440
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:38,270
who came up with this stood up a server

441
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:40,370
where you can create your own mud files

442
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:41,840
so you can see what the process is like

443
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:44,030
and what the output is like so just feel

444
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:45,980
free to come see me later and I'll give

445
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:48,590
you that give you that URL and then

446
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:50,030
really the last thing if you're

447
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:52,039
interested in getting involved if you

448
00:18:52,039 --> 00:18:54,289
have more questions certainly I'll do

449
00:18:54,289 --> 00:18:56,630
what I can while I'm here but you can

450
00:18:56,630 --> 00:19:00,559
email us at mud at Cisco comm and that

451
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:03,200
goes directly to the the architecture

452
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,360
team that is working on this right now

453
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,220
so we are really looking for that kind

454
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:09,710
of input we've had some from some pretty

455
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:12,140
major players but again we're trying to

456
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:14,990
really broaden who gets involved so that

457
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:16,820
we really are more representative of

458
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:19,940
what the community needs so on that note

459
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:22,549
that was the last one that I had to talk

460
00:19:22,549 --> 00:19:26,809
about so just really to summarize again

461
00:19:26,809 --> 00:19:29,179
please see me afterwards we really would

462
00:19:29,179 --> 00:19:31,010
love to have your input on this and your

463
00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:33,950
participation and then also while we're

464
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:35,059
here there's a couple other things

465
00:19:35,059 --> 00:19:36,650
because we're not just done with this

466
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:39,320
tomorrow we have our Cabana session and

467
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:43,070
there is the kegerator so I don't know

468
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:44,809
how many hands are out there but if

469
00:19:44,809 --> 00:19:46,389
you're not familiar with the kegerator

470
00:19:46,389 --> 00:19:49,880
also known as apt or advanced persistent

471
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:53,240
thirst what it is is if you can hack

472
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:55,759
through the ICS that controls the

473
00:19:55,759 --> 00:19:57,019
handles on the keg

474
00:19:57,019 --> 00:19:59,659
you can pour yourself a beer so it is

475
00:19:59,659 --> 00:20:01,610
literally hacking for beer so there's

476
00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:03,320
that tomorrow tor Cabana session and

477
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:06,230
then I'll have a session in the sponsor

478
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:09,559
stage on Thursday called mentoring for

479
00:20:09,559 --> 00:20:11,870
fun and nonprofit and we'll talk about

480
00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:14,720
the work my nonprofit work with

481
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,970
interrupts and and how you can get

482
00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:18,590
involved potentially with that and

483
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:21,529
helping kids learn more about ICS so

484
00:20:21,529 --> 00:20:23,570
with that I'm a little ahead of schedule

485
00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:26,149
but thank you very much for your time

486
00:20:26,149 --> 00:20:27,409
and I hope to talk to you guys some more

487
00:20:27,409 --> 00:20:30,700
so thank you very much

488
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:39,639
you
