2
00:00:08,029 --> 00:00:12,059
well as I am Brazilian the introduction

3
00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:18,630
is a first kick of the soccer game well

4
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:21,119
I'm not going to tell things that you

5
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:23,939
guys already know so threats have

6
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:26,900
changed now we have advanced the text

7
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:31,890
I'm not talking only about apts but I'm

8
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:35,250
talking about things have changed the

9
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:37,860
last time I was here in this events

10
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,770
about it on 0 2 or 3 years ago and we

11
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:44,190
were talking about apts about nations

12
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:45,930
that take attacking nations and things

13
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:50,430
like this and this is ok but now the

14
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:53,460
threat has changed because money is

15
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:56,789
involved now the attackers want to make

16
00:00:56,789 --> 00:00:59,129
money they discovered how to make money

17
00:00:59,129 --> 00:01:04,080
and that's what I'll talk about here and

18
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,740
of course they also discovered that

19
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:13,650
skate and ICS are an easy target so well

20
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:17,729
all things that you guys know migration

21
00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:22,350
to IP protocol larger connectivity low

22
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:25,020
cybersecurity maturity uncommon

23
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:28,409
operating system patches and the

24
00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:30,570
sophistication of specific attack is

25
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:36,810
that now we have thousands of them this

26
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:42,210
is a research that we do every year on

27
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:47,220
in Brazil ok so what we do here we just

28
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:51,450
summarize the incident that we have

29
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:55,049
inside our customers our customers our

30
00:01:55,049 --> 00:02:00,479
main power companies and the less water

31
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:03,719
and then ways to steal mining companies

32
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:06,899
but all critical infrastructures and the

33
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:08,729
thing that should be shown is that the

34
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:12,239
last year and last year no two years ago

35
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:13,310
because we aren't too

36
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:19,280
70 now we had the 667 incidents it's

37
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:23,060
much more than three times all the years

38
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:26,540
pass it so this is a huge shift there

39
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:31,489
and finally companies in my country are

40
00:02:31,489 --> 00:02:34,790
waking up for the risk because now it's

41
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:36,440
feasible now it's happening it's

42
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:42,819
happening everywhere so in that in that

43
00:02:42,819 --> 00:02:46,880
summer and get summarized I had the data

44
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:50,420
of all kinds of malware but now we're

45
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,819
going to talk about the ransomware in

46
00:02:52,819 --> 00:02:58,099
cicada and ransomware is new for scada

47
00:02:58,099 --> 00:03:03,950
so things can become worse because the

48
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:06,590
attackers have figured out that ICS are

49
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:09,470
an easy target and started to attack

50
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:13,790
them okay about ransomware I believe

51
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:15,920
everybody here knows that Rancher is a

52
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,840
type of Maori that prevents the user

53
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,380
from assessing your data the user will

54
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:23,090
recover the data if he pays a ransom

55
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:27,260
okay and its effects direct direct Lee

56
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:29,870
the availability of ICS by blocking

57
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:32,630
access to vital information for its

58
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:36,799
operation rather is not new r answering

59
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:43,519
exists since 1989 so it has almost 30

60
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:47,810
years of existence the new thing is that

61
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:52,430
now we are finding ransom in critical

62
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:55,489
infrastructures inside plants this is

63
00:03:55,489 --> 00:04:01,730
new so this is something that I got from

64
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:05,810
the internet last year Channing that

65
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:07,910
Rancher will recover on critical

66
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:12,440
infrastructure that was March of 2016 so

67
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:17,209
almost one year ago and well I use it

68
00:04:17,209 --> 00:04:19,220
this slides in a presentation there in

69
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:23,300
Brazil by March and then nobody knew

70
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:26,300
what ransomware was and then I spoke

71
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,260
again

72
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:29,600
with this slides in the presentation on

73
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,450
November and another event in Brazil and

74
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:34,850
everybody near what r answer was about

75
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:38,180
because we had lots of attacks there i'm

76
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:40,370
going to show you to a text here but

77
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:43,130
this is common this is something that we

78
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:46,610
see all the time we seem obscure mainly

79
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:50,540
incorporate and IT networks but we see

80
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:54,620
lots in OT networks true it's not new

81
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:58,130
it's not something it's not trivial true

82
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:02,870
but it's not new one case that you guys

83
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:06,080
may know it was the first I saw the

84
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:09,170
Electricity Board of Israel Grippit by

85
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:11,270
ranch on cyber attacks causing

86
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:17,330
widespread panic and that happened it

87
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:21,710
last week here in in Vermont a random

88
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:26,630
attack ok the things that this ranch on

89
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:29,200
attack was charging for the ransom of

90
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:33,020
1000 bitcoins it's a lot of money 1,000

91
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:37,640
bitcoins about as you can see here nine

92
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:42,440
nine hundred thousand dollars so it's a

93
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:46,730
lot of my and this is the shift because

94
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:49,490
they discover that they can the cyber

95
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:51,320
attackers discover that they can earn

96
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:55,580
lots of money inserting ransomware

97
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:59,630
inside plants and starting them or

98
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:04,460
causing any kind of disruption and the

99
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:06,080
stereos

100
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,800
if you compare wrestling in OT against

101
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:13,729
restaurant in IT you can see that it's

102
00:06:13,729 --> 00:06:16,969
clear it's clear that rants are in IOT

103
00:06:16,969 --> 00:06:21,139
is much worse than renter in IT because

104
00:06:21,139 --> 00:06:24,889
it blocks access to em hm eyes it can

105
00:06:24,889 --> 00:06:27,139
ciphers windows key the supervision and

106
00:06:27,139 --> 00:06:29,419
programming machines it can cipher

107
00:06:29,419 --> 00:06:32,439
historians and production databases

108
00:06:32,439 --> 00:06:34,969
engineering stations it can spread to

109
00:06:34,969 --> 00:06:37,219
other plants through remote access or

110
00:06:37,219 --> 00:06:40,729
VPNs it can block access to utility

111
00:06:40,729 --> 00:06:44,120
systems all those risks are very common

112
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:49,639
and well what can I do how can I be sure

113
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:53,690
that people in other country making

114
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:57,289
remote access to my plant has a machine

115
00:06:57,289 --> 00:07:04,210
free of rental it's very hard to do so

116
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:07,610
let me talk about to ransom our cases to

117
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:14,330
study cases that happen at in Brazil the

118
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:20,719
first one is a Furniture Factory so it

119
00:07:20,719 --> 00:07:23,330
happened at in a state of goiás in in

120
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:26,330
Brazil and the middle of Brazil next to

121
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:31,430
our capital it was a crypto RSA 496

122
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:35,029
ransom and it infected some schedule

123
00:07:35,029 --> 00:07:36,979
supervision and programming machines

124
00:07:36,979 --> 00:07:39,710
inside the factory this is currently the

125
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:44,330
screen of one of the machines the

126
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:46,699
consequence the factory started working

127
00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:49,120
the company lost customer and supplier

128
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,740
registrations employee payroll and

129
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:54,020
machine supervision programming this

130
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:59,150
vehicle forth three 3061 dollars i dunno

131
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:03,099
why 61 but that's the the information

132
00:08:03,099 --> 00:08:05,629
but the financial loss was big because

133
00:08:05,629 --> 00:08:07,909
the factory stay 15 days stop it and

134
00:08:07,909 --> 00:08:11,270
lost about 100 thousand dollars due to

135
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:13,279
downtime in production and delays in

136
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:15,529
deliveries and you too has structure to

137
00:08:15,529 --> 00:08:17,830
return to normal routines

138
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:20,740
no ransom was paid for infected machines

139
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:22,600
that had to be fully recovered because

140
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,600
the OT team didn't have healthy and

141
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:29,680
updated backups ok so I have a little

168
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,230
this small factory it's just an example

169
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:09,310
what what can happen with larger plants

170
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:14,710
because the r answer is still a dump

171
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:17,070
piece of software it searches for

172
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:20,380
databases it searches for email servers

173
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:23,710
it searches for web servers but it

174
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:29,140
doesn't know what his ciphering so for

175
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:31,529
example it can cipher

176
00:10:31,529 --> 00:10:34,990
bapi database and how about the

177
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:38,790
consequences he can cipher lots of

178
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:41,350
supervision stations or even at k the

179
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:44,850
server and how about the consequences I

180
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:48,220
have another study case here and it's an

181
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:51,820
electrical company in Brazil it's a

182
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:54,839
global company that operates there and

183
00:10:54,839 --> 00:10:58,810
this case we work it together with the

184
00:10:58,810 --> 00:11:03,370
Palo Alto team in Brazil because it was

185
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:05,639
a very bad situation that they face it

186
00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:09,760
okay in this digital ethical company is

187
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:13,060
located in the south of Brazil and it

188
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:16,420
was infected by cryptolocker the

189
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:18,399
machines infected were some windows

190
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:21,040
SCADA supervision machines inside at

191
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:24,459
control center this is not the screen

192
00:11:24,459 --> 00:11:27,160
that that they had there but this is the

193
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:29,649
cryptolocker screen note that they give

194
00:11:29,649 --> 00:11:32,399
some time to pay the rent on there and

195
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:36,310
of course if you don't pay so they want

196
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:38,350
to give you the piece of software to

197
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:42,100
recover your files and even if you pay

198
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:45,250
they can give you the piece of software

199
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:48,160
to recover or they can't and they even

200
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:52,529
can give you a burger pittas faster so

201
00:11:52,529 --> 00:11:54,760
yesterday I was reading something about

202
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:57,220
a box where that it's the evolution of

203
00:11:57,220 --> 00:12:00,730
ransomware that is when the guys not

204
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:05,670
only take the size of the files but they

205
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:08,589
take the contents of the files and then

206
00:12:08,589 --> 00:12:12,250
they can sell this for the content for

207
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:15,010
other companies they can make lots of

208
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:20,019
things with this so the effectual vector

209
00:12:20,019 --> 00:12:22,990
was a pendrive and that is a Brazilian

210
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:25,839
thing so here is flash drive use it at

211
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:28,510
one aja mine when the rancher is

212
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:30,699
spreaded few files file shares and

213
00:12:30,699 --> 00:12:33,579
network method folders infecting other

214
00:12:33,579 --> 00:12:35,560
three supervising stations at the same

215
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:38,050
automation network segment the

216
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:40,029
consequence was the momentary loss of

217
00:12:40,029 --> 00:12:42,310
supervision and control of Power

218
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:45,270
Distribution they requested

219
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:47,160
three hundred dollars per machine so

220
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:50,490
it's pretty cheap okay and what shows

221
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:54,810
that this infection was not how can I

222
00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:56,520
say an intended in Section it was

223
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:59,430
something that just happened a normal

224
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:02,250
ransomware there was no financial loss

225
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:04,950
because the control was automatically

226
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:06,930
transferred to a secondary control

227
00:13:06,930 --> 00:13:09,600
center that wasn't physically connected

228
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,810
to the main control center no ransom was

229
00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:14,790
paid for infected machines that could be

230
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:18,210
resetted through healthy big clubs this

231
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:20,760
company was prepared they had another

232
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:23,130
control center and they just switches

233
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:25,560
the corporation's to the other cultural

234
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:29,010
center while they clean it the center

235
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:31,440
that was infected but I can tell you

236
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,990
that this company's I don't know ten

237
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:37,260
percent of the companies in Brazil of

238
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:40,050
the electrical companies energy

239
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:41,820
companies in Brazil because they are

240
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:43,620
prepared they have another control

241
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:46,080
center they have lots lost virtualized

242
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:48,840
machines there they test this and they

243
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:52,890
simply switch it so nothing worst happen

244
00:13:52,890 --> 00:14:00,270
it and what if the worst happens and how

245
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:03,270
to face this because it's a huge problem

246
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:07,530
sometimes a company is not sometimes

247
00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:10,020
almost most of the times the company is

248
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:13,310
not prepared for ransomware infections

249
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:17,670
so when mitigation fails it is important

250
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:19,980
for organizations or organizations and

251
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:22,260
individuals to consider all possible

252
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:26,190
responses to our ransom attack so the

253
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:28,080
first thing have a prepared incident

254
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:34,500
response team well I don't know of any

255
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,780
company in my country that have any

256
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:41,570
dance response team ready for ransom

257
00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:45,510
when this kind of situation happens it's

258
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:48,330
crazy they simply don't know what to do

259
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:51,570
and it's a very bad surprised to see

260
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:55,820
that screen charging for money and

261
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:58,050
sometimes they even don't know how to

262
00:14:58,050 --> 00:14:59,279
pay the ransom

263
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:01,350
because they don't know bitcoins they

264
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:03,060
don't know die crab they don't know how

265
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:04,980
to assess this and then don't know how

266
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:10,019
to do anything so this is a problem so

267
00:15:10,019 --> 00:15:12,079
this team this incident response team

268
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:15,060
must have previously planet a procedure

269
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:17,759
to follow in the event of a razor attack

270
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:20,490
during its risk assessment this

271
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:22,079
procedure should start notifying the

272
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:23,939
authorities regulators because range

273
00:15:23,939 --> 00:15:27,199
attacks are crimes prescribed by law

274
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:31,439
okay you know we have there in Brazil

275
00:15:31,439 --> 00:15:36,059
two of the 10 top cybercriminals group

276
00:15:36,059 --> 00:15:39,240
worldwide and they are fully prepared to

277
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:42,899
prepare a random attack but why are they

278
00:15:42,899 --> 00:15:46,110
so good so technically good no they are

279
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:48,749
not should perform a handsome attack is

280
00:15:48,749 --> 00:15:52,559
nothing not complicated it's easy you

281
00:15:52,559 --> 00:15:55,079
just have to download the software you

282
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:57,480
have lots of damage download change the

283
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:00,420
key and then you customize your ransom

284
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:03,930
it's easy and it's not so complicated to

285
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:07,100
insert a wrestler inside for example a

286
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:12,360
hydropower company in Brazil why because

287
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:15,629
we have about eighty five percent of our

288
00:16:15,629 --> 00:16:18,930
energy coming from hydropower and those

289
00:16:18,930 --> 00:16:21,180
hydropower is allocated in very very

290
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:24,029
remote locations in the middle of

291
00:16:24,029 --> 00:16:29,240
nowhere and people hire people hire

292
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:31,860
persons that live on those locations

293
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:35,160
that of course are not so well prepared

294
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:39,149
as people in the in Rio and Sao Paulo in

295
00:16:39,149 --> 00:16:42,629
Brazil in the major cities of Brazil so

296
00:16:42,629 --> 00:16:47,279
in the other and also those guys didn't

297
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:49,410
earn too much money to operate those

298
00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:53,160
things so they are easy to talk and then

299
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:55,800
offer them money to just own insert this

300
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,929
flash drive and double click here and

301
00:16:57,929 --> 00:17:00,600
I'll give you ten thousand dollars it's

302
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,939
not so complicated you're finding people

303
00:17:02,939 --> 00:17:08,280
to do this and security policies when

304
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:12,359
they exist they are most for IT networks

305
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:13,159
that are

306
00:17:13,159 --> 00:17:17,189
apply it to OT networks and of course

307
00:17:17,189 --> 00:17:21,480
they don't work so this is that so the

308
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,309
first the second thing that you can do

309
00:17:23,309 --> 00:17:25,260
is switch control to a secondary

310
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:27,990
cultural center as the energy company

311
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:31,830
did this is the best thing to do but as

312
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:34,169
I told this company is ten percent

313
00:17:34,169 --> 00:17:36,539
ninety percent don't have a secondary

314
00:17:36,539 --> 00:17:39,390
control center ready to switch things so

315
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:41,429
they have to face the attack and do

316
00:17:41,429 --> 00:17:45,649
something try to recover lost data

317
00:17:45,649 --> 00:17:48,690
system backup and recovery are the only

318
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:50,940
technical solution to reverse random

319
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:56,250
attacks okay great modern wrestler is

320
00:17:56,250 --> 00:18:00,149
able to find storages in the network so

321
00:18:00,149 --> 00:18:03,000
they can cipher the back caps true they

322
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,220
search for storages and these cypress

323
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:08,340
storages so if the guy makes the caps on

324
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:12,090
storages probably he lost the capture in

325
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:14,639
the other hand if we if the company

326
00:18:14,639 --> 00:18:16,769
makes the caps on tapes and things like

327
00:18:16,769 --> 00:18:21,149
this so most of the time nobody restores

328
00:18:21,149 --> 00:18:22,649
a bit capture see if it works and then

329
00:18:22,649 --> 00:18:27,779
Murphy's long does his work try to

330
00:18:27,779 --> 00:18:31,049
recover I do do nothing sometimes the

331
00:18:31,049 --> 00:18:33,659
machines that people lost are not so

332
00:18:33,659 --> 00:18:36,690
important so they can simply format it

333
00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:42,169
and we start from scratch and that's all

334
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:46,700
pay the redemption pay the ransom so

335
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:51,299
this is what people can do but there is

336
00:18:51,299 --> 00:18:55,370
a problem if you pay the ransom you have

337
00:18:55,370 --> 00:18:59,639
two things can happen first thing the

338
00:18:59,639 --> 00:19:01,380
attackers can ignore that you pay the

339
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:04,500
ransom and do nothing the second thing

340
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:07,260
they can give you the piece of software

341
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:11,460
to restore your system it can work or

342
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:14,970
not or it can be bigots I solve both

343
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:19,250
things happening that is another thing

344
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:23,820
some some managers some automation

345
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:26,909
managers hide those things

346
00:19:26,909 --> 00:19:29,039
so they try to pay the ransom very

347
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:31,919
quickly and restart things because they

348
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:34,049
don't want don't want people to know

349
00:19:34,049 --> 00:19:36,840
that their backups are not working or

350
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:39,090
even that they don't have the caps and

351
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:42,659
things like this but this is not good

352
00:19:42,659 --> 00:19:46,950
because when you pay the ransom so now

353
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:49,320
the attacker knows that you can pay more

354
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:51,659
you can pay other times and you are

355
00:19:51,659 --> 00:19:54,960
vulnerable and maybe he will try to

356
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,320
attack you more and more what most of

357
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,720
the companies do is a hybrid solution

358
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:05,070
that is to try to recover data in the

359
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:08,789
way they can and if it doesn't work then

360
00:20:08,789 --> 00:20:15,359
pay the ransom but that is an important

361
00:20:15,359 --> 00:20:18,779
detail modern hands where is able to

362
00:20:18,779 --> 00:20:20,820
search servers and makeup applications

363
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:23,070
running on networks and also encrypt

364
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:25,979
them in this case the only possible

365
00:20:25,979 --> 00:20:28,220
solution will be to pay the ransom

366
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:31,919
paying real redemptions can be easy for

367
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:34,349
private institutions but public

368
00:20:34,349 --> 00:20:37,379
companies government companies in Brazil

369
00:20:37,379 --> 00:20:41,039
they cannot simply pay things they must

370
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:43,619
build things they must make reverse

371
00:20:43,619 --> 00:20:46,859
auctions should buy things and this is a

372
00:20:46,859 --> 00:20:50,729
process that takes months so how to do

373
00:20:50,729 --> 00:20:54,799
in something that you gotta pay now

374
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:57,899
there is no way this is a huge problem

375
00:20:57,899 --> 00:21:01,950
there are some cyber insurance companies

376
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:05,220
in Brazil like Marsh that are already

377
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:09,119
offering insurance is for companies for

378
00:21:09,119 --> 00:21:12,869
Mauer so companies buy insurance is to

379
00:21:12,869 --> 00:21:16,950
have money to pay ransoms if they occur

380
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:20,759
so this is something that I don't know

381
00:21:20,759 --> 00:21:23,940
three years ago was unthinkable and now

382
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:27,960
it's happening and the the other thing

383
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:30,840
now that i can say that from this year

384
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:33,629
the next year the other year ramsauer

385
00:21:33,629 --> 00:21:36,779
will grow up will be more and more

386
00:21:36,779 --> 00:21:39,419
sophisticated and if we don't do

387
00:21:39,419 --> 00:21:40,850
anything now

388
00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:46,010
to protect our networks to make a very

389
00:21:46,010 --> 00:21:49,100
nice a very good defense in depth model

390
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:52,880
inside them then some companies will

391
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:58,600
face very very trouble on this

392
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:07,040
you
