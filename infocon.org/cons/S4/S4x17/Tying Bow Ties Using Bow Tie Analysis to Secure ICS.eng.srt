[Music]

2
00:00:08,179 --> 00:00:11,969
the first speakers are Harry Paul he's a

3
00:00:11,969 --> 00:00:13,799
cyber security adviser for customer

4
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:17,039
service and support at OSI soft and will

5
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:19,109
price is an independent security

6
00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:21,960
researcher for cyber synergetics they

7
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:25,109
will be presenting tying bow ties from

8
00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:26,760
PHA to the cloud

9
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,920
please welcome Harry and will

10
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:34,750
[Applause]

11
00:00:39,809 --> 00:00:43,289
so because suspense is overrated we're

12
00:00:43,289 --> 00:00:45,149
just going to go ahead and tell you the

13
00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:46,410
three problems that we're trying to

14
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:52,379
address if you feel counterintuitive to

15
00:00:52,379 --> 00:01:04,049
look at the cyberthreats pulse for

16
00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:08,970
example okay got the mic now so it can

17
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:11,190
be counterintuitive to juxtapose these

18
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:12,960
cyber and physical threats but since

19
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,030
ultimate we ultimately we can reduce

20
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:17,009
these two threats with defenses and

21
00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:19,140
impacts with reductions available

22
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:21,119
there's really no reason why we can't do

23
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:24,000
that comparison the second thing that we

24
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,259
want to do is we want to visualize

25
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:29,069
complex attacks often there is not a

26
00:01:29,069 --> 00:01:30,899
single channel used or a single

27
00:01:30,899 --> 00:01:33,210
mechanism used for an attack so how do

28
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:35,940
we look at these non-trivial attacks

29
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:38,039
without getting bogged down in the

30
00:01:38,039 --> 00:01:39,560
combinatorics of all the different

31
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:42,210
combinations we can run into and then

32
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:43,860
lastly we want to look at a more complex

33
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:46,369
look of security so instead of taking

34
00:01:46,369 --> 00:01:49,950
just a view of you know the network

35
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:52,530
diagram with the walls on fire we want

36
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:54,090
to look at the other factors in addition

37
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:58,649
to passwords and firewalls and at the

38
00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:00,110
crux of this we feel that bowtie

39
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:05,700
analysis is a technique that is well

40
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,469
suited for this type of visualization

41
00:02:07,469 --> 00:02:10,350
and communication and so bowtie

42
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:12,660
methodology was really made into an

43
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:14,760
industry standard for safety by shell in

44
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:17,730
the early 90s and essentially we have a

45
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:20,010
hazard which is anything with the

46
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:21,600
potential to cause harm it could be high

47
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,350
pressure steam in a pipe it could be

48
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:26,790
operating a web server on your network

49
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:28,579
it could be sipping a hot cup of coffee

50
00:02:28,579 --> 00:02:31,410
and then you have a top event where you

51
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:35,100
lose control over that hazard and bowtie

52
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:37,769
analysis allows us to enumerate the

53
00:02:37,769 --> 00:02:39,510
threats that could cause that top event

54
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:41,130
the defenses that we put in place as

55
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:44,190
barriers it shows the impacts and then

56
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:45,959
the barriers we can put in place to

57
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:49,110
reduce that impact should it occur so

58
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:51,180
I'm going to hand it over to will to

59
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:53,200
talk about an OT scenario

60
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,440
all right thanks Harry first one a thank

61
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:59,950
Dale and Harry and OSI soft team to

62
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:02,830
allow me to come and talk to you today I

63
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:04,959
think Dale nailed it when he talked

64
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:06,790
about the theme for the year come

65
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:08,739
together and I know we can all relate to

66
00:03:08,739 --> 00:03:10,390
that you know we need each other to help

67
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:11,620
us out in this space because we're

68
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:13,060
dealing with very difficult problems

69
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:15,760
when you talk about ot security and

70
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:20,049
reliability and safety especially when

71
00:03:20,049 --> 00:03:21,580
you talk about you look at the

72
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:23,980
operations folks and bringing them

73
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:26,410
together with the C Suites as well as

74
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:28,480
bringing together the plant managers the

75
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,329
VPS and the subject matter experts so

76
00:03:31,329 --> 00:03:33,010
it's pretty important that we come

77
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:34,900
together and work to solve these complex

78
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:38,410
problems all right so we get started off

79
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:40,950
I'm gonna just briefly touch on the

80
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:44,769
process hazard analysis or PHA basically

81
00:03:44,769 --> 00:03:47,380
what it is is an assessment of an

82
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:49,450
industrial process that's designed to

83
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:53,470
improve safety and reduce the unwanted

84
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:56,349
release of hazardous toxic or hazardous

85
00:03:56,349 --> 00:04:00,340
chemicals in the air here we have some

86
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:03,100
other examples of analysis is used in

87
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:06,310
oil and gas and chemical space hazards

88
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:09,940
hazard and operability study has ops

89
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:13,870
failure mode and effects mode or effects

90
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:16,959
analysis layer protection analysis lopa

91
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:19,329
and the fault tree analysis one other

92
00:04:19,329 --> 00:04:21,310
analysis is used in that space and the

93
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:24,160
chemical oil and gas refinery spaces was

94
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,560
called the fishbone pretty much like a

95
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,880
root cause analysis all right so for the

96
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,430
OT scenario that we chose we're

97
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:36,750
targeting chemical refineries or Lin gas

98
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:40,780
and manufacturing plants the equipment

99
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:44,050
considerations are infrared cameras and

100
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:47,320
sensors and the impacts are the gases in

101
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,150
the environment you know vapors and

102
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:51,700
toxins in the air pretty serious things

103
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:53,590
when you think about the nature what

104
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:55,720
goes on in these sites these plants and

105
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,490
what they're dealing with future

106
00:04:57,490 --> 00:04:59,800
opportunities we're going to be focusing

107
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,289
on the bow ties and how to bridge the

108
00:05:02,289 --> 00:05:04,600
gaps between a PHA

109
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,240
and the critical cyber security controls

110
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:10,480
within the OT operating environments so

111
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,310
bowties player a pretty significant role

112
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:14,770
as a tool that we can use to help us out

113
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:18,010
in analyzing and assessing what we have

114
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:19,720
to consider on top of your traditional

115
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:22,720
safety and regulatory things that you

116
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,200
have to deal with so our target

117
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:30,040
within the OT environment we focus we

118
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:32,200
decided to focus on what's called the

119
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:36,090
fluid catalytic cracking unit basically

120
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:39,730
with the FC our reference it as the FCC

121
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:43,740
and it's basically designed to convert

122
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:49,050
low value thick oil into high-value

123
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:52,960
gasoline by cracking the the large

124
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:56,710
molecules apart into small molecules so

125
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:58,540
you're basically talking about the whole

126
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:01,000
process in an oil and gas refinery you

127
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,500
have the dick oil and it goes through

128
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,760
the process and it comes out to

129
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:06,940
something usable and sellable to the

130
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:08,800
world you think about the gas in your

131
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,550
cars airplanes the travel boats ships

132
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:18,310
you name it and in addition to that this

133
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:22,030
diagram here depicts the critical items

134
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:23,770
that are involved you have your

135
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:27,520
regenerator reactor and fractionator

136
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,100
those are the core components of the FCC

137
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:35,320
and for our scenario in terms of what we

138
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:39,700
need to consider we we chose to research

139
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:44,460
and find an actual incident where the

140
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:48,970
FCC unit experienced vibrations and that

141
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:52,230
ultimately led to the ESP or

142
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:55,630
electrostatic precipitator to explode

143
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:58,020
within a natural oil and gas refinery

144
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:01,720
pretty serious stuff fortunately only

145
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:04,870
two people were injured and they were

146
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:07,660
able to get a control around the

147
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:08,980
processes that they were dealing with

148
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:13,570
and so it's pretty significant in

149
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:16,150
addition to that when you look at the

150
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:17,770
actual impact

151
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:19,660
to this particular incident it could

152
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:22,840
have been a lot worse right so within

153
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:28,180
the proximity of the refinery you have

154
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:30,370
the public receptors around that area

155
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:32,849
that span around a three mile radius and

156
00:07:32,849 --> 00:07:35,800
within that three mile radius they did

157
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,330
the analysis and found it there were

158
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:38,710
three hundred and thirty thousand

159
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:40,599
residents in that area

160
00:07:40,599 --> 00:07:44,620
71 schools and eight hospitals so

161
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:48,039
imagine what could have happened if the

162
00:07:48,039 --> 00:07:51,360
tank let's say got hit from the debris

163
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,520
with from that explosion of the ESP it

164
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,380
could have been very very catastrophic

165
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:58,330
when you talk about the hydrofluoric

166
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:00,639
assets that could have been released in

167
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:04,240
the air all right

168
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:08,080
so another did some research on another

169
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,599
oil and gas company that provided some

170
00:08:10,599 --> 00:08:14,099
great stats from an impact perspective

171
00:08:14,099 --> 00:08:19,419
they did an assessment on 500 the last

172
00:08:19,419 --> 00:08:21,849
500 oil and gas and chemical incidents

173
00:08:21,849 --> 00:08:24,880
so if you look at the cyber impact to

174
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,889
that it's pretty significant you can

175
00:08:26,889 --> 00:08:30,729
relate this from your traditional PHA

176
00:08:30,729 --> 00:08:33,250
analysis and to what actually goes on

177
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:37,479
into even the public the private energy

178
00:08:37,479 --> 00:08:41,429
sector right with the power utilities so

179
00:08:41,429 --> 00:08:44,649
what they found was there were

180
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:46,959
inadequate management and use of

181
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:50,320
engineering information that was the

182
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,350
root cause or contributing factor to 15%

183
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:56,170
of the last 500 incidents so we're

184
00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:59,170
talking around 75 incidents that's

185
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:02,290
pretty significant in terms of using the

186
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:03,550
engineering information that's available

187
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:06,730
to help you know mitigate the risks

188
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:08,560
within the environment when you talk

189
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,010
about releases of gases and air and

190
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:16,300
toxins the cost 800 and 180 million per

191
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:18,970
year now I know with the fluctuation of

192
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:20,980
gas prices some say well that's not a

193
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:23,230
lot of money but if you think about how

194
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:24,579
the prices have been fluctuating the

195
00:09:24,579 --> 00:09:27,880
last couple years that is significant so

196
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,920
we found some additional links and

197
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,150
research in terms of

198
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:33,160
you know with all these incidents that

199
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:36,520
have occurred you know the ISA has

200
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,410
stepped up their game to come up with

201
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:41,290
some new standards and guidance I know I

202
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:43,780
have here reference to I say 84 but

203
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:47,530
there's also the is a 62 for 43 and

204
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:48,610
they've released some new information

205
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:50,770
this year back in April May time frame

206
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:55,180
that talks to identifying safety

207
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:59,170
integrity areas and the bow ties can be

208
00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:02,770
used to identify and highlight some of

209
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:05,050
these critical pain points and you can

210
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:07,210
sell that to your management to to dig

211
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:09,490
deeper and come together like Dale was

212
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:11,080
saying with your subject matter experts

213
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,180
in the security space and helping to

214
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:16,120
improve the processes within you know

215
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:20,620
your operating environments Thanks

216
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:23,350
so here's the bottom line focus from a

217
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:26,860
PHA perspective we look at ways to the

218
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:29,590
PHA looks for ways to look at the

219
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:31,930
process and how it may deviate from the

220
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:35,080
original intended design it typically

221
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,640
doesn't look at the adequacy of the

222
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,860
design so here we have an opportunity as

223
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:40,690
I see our security professionals to help

224
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:42,720
them in that in that area from a

225
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,610
security perspective and usually doesn't

226
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:47,860
look at root cause or security threats

227
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:51,210
attacks or impacts to the ICS operation

228
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:53,470
you think about the revenues and a

229
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:56,080
company reputation in the event that a

230
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,570
cyber attack were to hit oil and

231
00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:00,460
refinery plant that would be pretty

232
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:05,620
significant so what we have here created

233
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:10,690
this visual display we wanted to do an

234
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:14,620
analysis to tie together the PHA and

235
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:17,110
some of the recent cyber attacks that

236
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:18,460
we've seen that happened in the last

237
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:20,650
couple years these are real threats on

238
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:22,480
an outer layer and an inner we have the

239
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,850
PHA this is typically what happens in a

240
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:26,790
PHA analysis it starts from the risk

241
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:31,330
understanding your risk and the middle

242
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:33,730
tier they ask the questions of what

243
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:36,520
impact is possible within your oil and

244
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,980
gas refinery environment or even in the

245
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:41,470
power utility sector what can go wrong

246
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:44,350
how likely is it to occur these are some

247
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:44,960
of the questions

248
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:48,700
the PHA is designed to ask or answer and

249
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:51,860
on the outer layer the top part staying

250
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:54,080
focused on that some of the big things

251
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,870
egress filtering do you really know

252
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:58,910
what's leaving your network this is

253
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:02,180
critical and the bow ties can help you

254
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:04,400
answer those questions and we'll get to

255
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,870
an example what a bow tie looks like in

256
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:08,120
a minute access and privilege controls

257
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:10,730
at the top right this is all about

258
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,500
understanding your wrist similarly to

259
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,900
how they do a PHA analysis within the

260
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:17,380
plans going about them we have

261
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:20,150
Foundation and risk assessment you look

262
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:22,640
at your historical experience it's good

263
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,680
to get a snapshot of the things that

264
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,540
have happened in the past in order to

265
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:27,770
determine the things that you need to

266
00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:30,650
work on for the future bottom right

267
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:33,380
knowledge and experience and I looked in

268
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:36,320
the improper input validation you know

269
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,350
they've been a lot of attacks lately

270
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:40,850
here that it happened you think about

271
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:46,310
the phishing ransomware and also web

272
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:48,920
obfuscation side-channel attacks there's

273
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:51,380
so many attacks that deal with this that

274
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:53,450
helped us to understand that says hey

275
00:12:53,450 --> 00:12:56,510
how how much do we trust the integrity

276
00:12:56,510 --> 00:13:00,470
of our data right and that ties in to

277
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:02,330
the PHA from analytical methods

278
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:04,550
perspective we're security professionals

279
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:07,460
we can help the OT engineers with

280
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:10,430
analyzing these types of things and to

281
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:12,860
the left bottom memory and firmware

282
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:15,440
exploits these are this is the crown

283
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,690
jewels right here if an attacker gets

284
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:20,690
access to your pocs or to use game over

285
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:24,140
so this is a great area where we as ICS

286
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:26,870
security professionals can help our PHA

287
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:30,500
and ot engineers and assessing what they

288
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:31,880
actually have in their environment and

289
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:35,840
how to defend against it the bottom

290
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:38,770
priorities people reliability and safety

291
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:41,090
ot architecture you always want to be

292
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:43,280
looking at your architecture to help you

293
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,830
understand where the pain points are I

294
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:47,750
would say to at least twice a year if

295
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:50,420
not once a quarter you know does our

296
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:53,230
existing ot architecture is it really

297
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:56,120
you know design and operating the way

298
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,910
that we wanted to operate and also

299
00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:01,819
routine ICS capability review this is

300
00:14:01,819 --> 00:14:03,769
something that we don't typically see

301
00:14:03,769 --> 00:14:05,620
too often where companies are really

302
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:09,050
digging deep in understanding what their

303
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:10,940
capabilities are really bringing to the

304
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:12,800
table are they within spec are they

305
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,720
meeting the requirements that they were

306
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,910
set up and designed to deliver when you

307
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:18,980
make investments in these technologies

308
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:20,959
and the bow ties can help us identify

309
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:24,230
all these things right here so we get

310
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:28,579
into our bowtie for ot here we have an

311
00:14:28,579 --> 00:14:33,410
example of a bowtie you know on the on

312
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:35,750
the left most part the blue boxes we

313
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:38,930
have the attacks and next to them in the

314
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:41,209
white boxes with the gray bars on top

315
00:14:41,209 --> 00:14:43,759
those are our defenses in the middle is

316
00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:46,160
our point of analysis which is the FCC

317
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:50,319
unit and to the right of that is

318
00:14:50,319 --> 00:14:54,800
basically our impacts and the boxes to

319
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,350
the left of that are our reductions so

320
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:59,569
this is the kind of analysis that we can

321
00:14:59,569 --> 00:15:03,019
use and do the homework in a hard core

322
00:15:03,019 --> 00:15:04,880
of research beforehand before an

323
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:08,470
incidents happen within our environment

324
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:15,130
so drill down we chose to focus on

325
00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:18,620
malicious firmware and PLC's and also

326
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:22,630
false or manipulated data configuration

327
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:25,579
in terms of the firmware and PLC's us a

328
00:15:25,579 --> 00:15:27,920
hot and heavy topic I'm sure a lot of

329
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,389
you are very familiar with the process

330
00:15:29,389 --> 00:15:31,730
that goes on and making sure that those

331
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:34,040
things are locked down from a defense

332
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:36,500
standpoint I know I have truck chaining

333
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:40,029
here that's really more so done upstream

334
00:15:40,029 --> 00:15:42,949
but I meant to have in here like

335
00:15:42,949 --> 00:15:44,949
firmware integrity verification

336
00:15:44,949 --> 00:15:47,689
validation validation of your check sums

337
00:15:47,689 --> 00:15:49,430
and we're always trying to find ways to

338
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:51,529
improve our network monitoring of the

339
00:15:51,529 --> 00:15:55,370
PLC's and embedded devices below that

340
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:58,910
false or manipulated data like you think

341
00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:01,009
about the Ukraine attacks and some of

342
00:16:01,009 --> 00:16:01,939
the other attacks that have happened

343
00:16:01,939 --> 00:16:04,130
that we've been reading about and and

344
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:07,069
still investigating we want to make sure

345
00:16:07,069 --> 00:16:10,370
that the data with one IHM eyes and on

346
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:12,350
our workstations on the OT side or true

347
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:12,649
to

348
00:16:12,649 --> 00:16:15,350
- actually showing us the data that is

349
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:18,579
really happening within our network

350
00:16:18,579 --> 00:16:21,980
improper input validation and there's

351
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:23,420
some other things that you can put in

352
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:25,879
here to really tell that story in terms

353
00:16:25,879 --> 00:16:31,160
of your your threats here I have a

354
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:34,879
visual on what I consider to be helpful

355
00:16:34,879 --> 00:16:35,869
from a bowtie

356
00:16:35,869 --> 00:16:39,559
I see a cybersecurity perspective you

357
00:16:39,559 --> 00:16:41,660
start with your PHA analysis at the

358
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:44,869
bottom and you work with your horrorcore

359
00:16:44,869 --> 00:16:48,079
ICS subject matter experts to make sure

360
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:49,939
that there are no security issues that

361
00:16:49,939 --> 00:16:51,980
that are not addressed in your HPA

362
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:54,769
there's real value in that and I've

363
00:16:54,769 --> 00:16:57,439
actually seen with where this is is been

364
00:16:57,439 --> 00:16:59,720
helpful in the oil and gas space I'm

365
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,129
constantly getting calls from different

366
00:17:01,129 --> 00:17:02,959
people asking the questions what are

367
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:04,779
some things that we need to consider

368
00:17:04,779 --> 00:17:07,309
when we're looking at our ot environment

369
00:17:07,309 --> 00:17:10,099
the middle tier to the work to the right

370
00:17:10,099 --> 00:17:13,819
we have advanced hunting I think it'd be

371
00:17:13,819 --> 00:17:15,648
a good idea to have people inside your

372
00:17:15,648 --> 00:17:18,589
ot environment working side by side with

373
00:17:18,589 --> 00:17:20,659
your ot folks to address the issues that

374
00:17:20,659 --> 00:17:24,109
they may incur in the middle incident

375
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:26,689
response you know this is the set up

376
00:17:26,689 --> 00:17:29,029
center and focal point there not very

377
00:17:29,029 --> 00:17:30,890
many people to really know and

378
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:33,320
understand how to dig deep and respond

379
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,870
to incidents that occur both whether it

380
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:38,179
be safety reliability related or

381
00:17:38,179 --> 00:17:42,320
cybersecurity related and Intel mapping

382
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:45,020
the things that come out a days are

383
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:48,380
whatever the threats may be and tying

384
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:50,539
that up to the bow ties the bow ties is

385
00:17:50,539 --> 00:17:53,179
that the advanced level it can help us

386
00:17:53,179 --> 00:17:55,580
to identify those things upfront before

387
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:58,669
something catastrophic happens within

388
00:17:58,669 --> 00:18:03,440
your environment and then I wrap it up

389
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:06,140
with the bow tie integration on the Left

390
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:08,029
we have with the bow ties designed to do

391
00:18:08,029 --> 00:18:10,640
reduce on authorize changes to your data

392
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:13,789
within your OT environment and make your

393
00:18:13,789 --> 00:18:16,070
systems data make sure that there's some

394
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:19,130
integrity with there with that and also

395
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:21,380
always finding ways to make sure your

396
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:22,960
ICS security controls are up-to-date

397
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:26,090
because the threat landscape as many

398
00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:27,950
of the keynote speakers have said it's

399
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:31,070
constantly changing and on the right

400
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:33,260
side I haven't seen too many people talk

401
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:36,890
about the supply chain you know I know

402
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:38,630
that the equipment within the OTA

403
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:40,250
environment and last for years and years

404
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:42,230
and years but there comes a point in

405
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:46,820
time when a unit will fail in the case

406
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:50,690
of our scenario when we look at the FCC

407
00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:55,040
unit it was destroyed so was the ESP so

408
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,990
you have to get a new unit to come in

409
00:18:56,990 --> 00:18:59,810
how good at you at assessing the

410
00:18:59,810 --> 00:19:02,120
integrity of your new systems when they

411
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:03,530
come in and make sure that they're

412
00:19:03,530 --> 00:19:06,020
operating at the levels they need they

413
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:08,810
need to be operating at from a supply

414
00:19:08,810 --> 00:19:13,820
chain perspective so with that I'll give

415
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:19,250
it back to Harry thank you we'll all

416
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:20,690
right so now that we've gone through a

417
00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:23,000
scenario in the OT environment with the

418
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,060
FCC unit I'll be talking about bowtie in

419
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:29,960
the IT space so we're going to be

420
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:33,470
looking at a analysis of running a web

421
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:35,570
server in an IT environment so this

422
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:37,820
could be something on Prem or in the

423
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:40,820
cloud but for the sake of this

424
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:43,450
presentation we're going to look at a

425
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:46,640
web application hosted in IAS

426
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,950
for data visualization and so a few

427
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:50,570
characteristics about it are that we're

428
00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:52,040
assuming there's an application pool

429
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,900
running with least privileges configured

430
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:56,120
the server is a member of an Active

431
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:59,240
Directory domain there's the normal

432
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,460
firewall rules to allow the web traffic

433
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:04,490
over for for 3d and the HTTP traffic

434
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:07,640
over 443 and regular updates are being

435
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:10,190
managed by the IT department and then a

436
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:11,600
last thing to note that's probably the

437
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,060
most important thing here is that the

438
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:18,140
data source for this web visualization

439
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:22,520
is tied in to eventually tie down to

440
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:26,960
devices on the OT network so that in

441
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,540
mind we'll go ahead so news in quotes

442
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:33,140
here because the bowtie analysis is

443
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:35,900
nothing new to the realm of safety but

444
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:38,930
it's a bit novel to apply it to a cyber

445
00:20:38,930 --> 00:20:39,890
security

446
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:42,380
and the point of analysis here is going

447
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:44,600
to be the operation of a software module

448
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,670
and then the top event is going to be

449
00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:50,810
the compromise of that module and so

450
00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:53,390
when we do each point of analysis we

451
00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:55,370
want to look at our threats and defenses

452
00:20:55,370 --> 00:20:57,680
and our impacts within there within the

453
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:00,950
context of the cyber kill chain so we

454
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:02,090
want to be thinking about our threats

455
00:21:02,090 --> 00:21:04,340
how are people doing reconnaissance how

456
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:06,200
are they weaponizing tools how are they

457
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:09,410
delivering them what our compromise

458
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:11,720
actually looks like is the exploitation

459
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:15,080
and the installation of the tools or the

460
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:17,420
exploit that they're performing and then

461
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:19,940
on the impact reduction side how are we

462
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:22,310
avoiding this command and control and

463
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:25,130
action on objectives that the MIS screen

464
00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:27,740
is trying to establish I will however

465
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:31,160
note that while we'll be focusing on

466
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:33,920
malicious actors and miscreants for this

467
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:36,110
talk this approach really focuses on

468
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:38,870
relying reliability and resiliency over

469
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:41,020
all we're trying to avoid loss of

470
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:43,850
control over these software modules but

471
00:21:43,850 --> 00:21:45,470
the last that loss of control could

472
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:48,380
occur because of an insider threat or

473
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:50,510
because of miss operation rather than

474
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:56,030
malicious intent so as I said with a

475
00:21:56,030 --> 00:21:58,100
bowtie methodology around a software

476
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:02,300
component we're looking at a compromise

477
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:05,150
of that component as our top event and

478
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:07,970
the context surrounding that is not just

479
00:22:07,970 --> 00:22:09,860
the software module itself but the

480
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:14,600
environment it resides in and so up here

481
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:17,540
we have a simple example where we have

482
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:21,230
our unauthenticated access as a threat

483
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:23,660
to our system and defenses that can be

484
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:25,160
in place to prevent that we can have

485
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:28,460
transport layer security to prevent

486
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:30,890
snooping and that some of the firewall

487
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:32,180
restrictions that you can put in place

488
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:36,610
can put a obstacle for attackers to

489
00:22:36,610 --> 00:22:40,400
exploit that and unauthorized access to

490
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:44,000
data is a potential impact of not having

491
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,590
those defenses in place and in those

492
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:47,660
cases you can have leased privilege

493
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:49,670
implemented at a point level if you're

494
00:22:49,670 --> 00:22:51,770
visualizing data at display level to

495
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:52,550
prevent access

496
00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:55,400
to the displays displaying the data or

497
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:57,290
if your app will set up with least

498
00:22:57,290 --> 00:23:00,050
privileges that min reduces the impact

499
00:23:00,050 --> 00:23:02,480
because it requires an attacker to

500
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,400
escalate privilege more so than if you

501
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,920
had it with a privileged account now

502
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:08,720
this example is a simple one-to-one

503
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:12,110
correspondence here but that's not true

504
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:14,240
in general with bowtie there could be

505
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:17,840
six threats and ten defenses and one

506
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,820
individual threat could result in all

507
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:25,400
the impacts enumerated so moving from

508
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:29,000
the point of analysis to a level two on

509
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,750
this bowtie we enumerate the various

510
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:36,560
threats to the system and the potential

511
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:39,880
impacts so a couple just to highlight

512
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,540
initially we talked about on

513
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:44,150
authenticated access but we also need to

514
00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:46,220
be concerned about authenticated access

515
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:50,870
and if somebody if credentials are

516
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:52,670
compromised upstream or we don't even

517
00:23:52,670 --> 00:23:53,990
have a credential compromised but we

518
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:57,350
have an insider threat then that's an

519
00:23:57,350 --> 00:23:59,300
entirely separate concern that we need

520
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:00,050
to be considered

521
00:24:00,050 --> 00:24:02,360
do we need to consider outside of the

522
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:05,630
unauthenticated vector and then another

523
00:24:05,630 --> 00:24:07,540
thing I wanted to highlight here is

524
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:09,680
there's a tip of a hat here to the

525
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:12,050
physical access to the server you know

526
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:13,700
one of the immutable laws of security is

527
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:15,260
it's not secure if they can physically

528
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:17,180
access the device so there's still

529
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:20,480
physical threats to the IT systems and

530
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,130
that's why we need to have the physical

531
00:24:22,130 --> 00:24:25,280
protections in place but in terms of the

532
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:28,160
other threats this is a smaller market

533
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,780
share of the threats compared to the

534
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:33,710
oco-2 space where in our PHA there were

535
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:37,880
a lot of a lot more physical a lot more

536
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,500
physical factors that we had to look at

537
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:44,930
in depth so moving from the layer 2 to a

538
00:24:44,930 --> 00:24:48,530
layer 3 here we start to flesh out our

539
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:50,680
defenses and so when we're generating

540
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:54,440
these barriers to put in place it's

541
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:56,990
typically a collaboration between the

542
00:24:56,990 --> 00:24:59,630
subject matter experts and the security

543
00:24:59,630 --> 00:25:01,880
team and putting ourselves in the

544
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:04,970
mindset of going through the cyber kill

545
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:05,779
chain and think

546
00:25:05,779 --> 00:25:07,909
about what an attackers trying to do and

547
00:25:07,909 --> 00:25:11,599
what opportunities we have to get in

548
00:25:11,599 --> 00:25:12,200
their way

549
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:14,779
and make their lives difficult something

550
00:25:14,779 --> 00:25:18,409
that so a very easy conceptual way to

551
00:25:18,409 --> 00:25:21,679
think about the bow tie in the context

552
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:23,239
of cyber security is on the left side

553
00:25:23,239 --> 00:25:25,249
you're working on keeping the bad guys

554
00:25:25,249 --> 00:25:27,710
out on the right side you're looking at

555
00:25:27,710 --> 00:25:29,409
limiting the damage when they get in and

556
00:25:29,409 --> 00:25:34,309
then you're this act of establishing

557
00:25:34,309 --> 00:25:36,889
this point of analysis and reducing

558
00:25:36,889 --> 00:25:39,200
impact you're trying to hunt for evil to

559
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:43,580
see where problems could arise another

560
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:45,679
thing that you'll note on this is that

561
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:47,179
there's some color coding on the

562
00:25:47,179 --> 00:25:51,339
barriers and in this case we try to

563
00:25:51,339 --> 00:25:54,200
highlight an important characteristic of

564
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,599
these barriers which is the effort to

565
00:25:56,599 --> 00:25:59,389
implement so the barriers in blue such

566
00:25:59,389 --> 00:26:04,039
as lost our presentation there I'll just

567
00:26:04,039 --> 00:26:05,479
keep talking and hopefully I'll come up

568
00:26:05,479 --> 00:26:09,529
in a minute the barriers in blue are the

569
00:26:09,529 --> 00:26:13,070
barriers that are in place automatically

570
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:14,659
and by automatically I mean they're

571
00:26:14,659 --> 00:26:15,950
either part of the development process

572
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:17,719
of the product or they're part of the

573
00:26:17,719 --> 00:26:20,779
architecture that its installed in so

574
00:26:20,779 --> 00:26:22,249
these are ones that an administrator

575
00:26:22,249 --> 00:26:25,369
doesn't have to take doesn't have to

576
00:26:25,369 --> 00:26:27,679
take initiative to put in place it's

577
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:30,710
it's kind of in place automatically the

578
00:26:30,710 --> 00:26:33,249
next tier up is in yellow which is

579
00:26:33,249 --> 00:26:35,200
barriers that are in place by

580
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,089
configuration so this requires some

581
00:26:38,089 --> 00:26:41,419
effort from an administrator to put

582
00:26:41,419 --> 00:26:43,279
these protections in place and configure

583
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:44,809
them for the network reality that

584
00:26:44,809 --> 00:26:46,969
they're defending and there's the

585
00:26:46,969 --> 00:26:48,589
potential for things to be misconfigured

586
00:26:48,589 --> 00:26:51,679
but it's a lower it's not a barrier for

587
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:54,139
end-users and then lastly in red

588
00:26:54,139 --> 00:26:55,969
probably the least reliable would be the

589
00:26:55,969 --> 00:26:59,089
ones that are in place by operation and

590
00:26:59,089 --> 00:27:02,269
so that would be something passwords are

591
00:27:02,269 --> 00:27:03,679
an example of this because you have to

592
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:07,339
rely on you users to to handle their

593
00:27:07,339 --> 00:27:08,989
credentials responsibly in terms of not

594
00:27:08,989 --> 00:27:10,369
writing them on sticky notes and not

595
00:27:10,369 --> 00:27:12,469
making really weak passwords if there

596
00:27:12,469 --> 00:27:14,659
isn't a complexity requirement built

597
00:27:14,659 --> 00:27:17,599
into the product so what I'm trying to

598
00:27:17,599 --> 00:27:19,789
highlight here with this color coding

599
00:27:19,789 --> 00:27:22,340
is one of the three main things we

600
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:24,409
talked about was giving a complex view

601
00:27:24,409 --> 00:27:26,119
of security beyond passwords and

602
00:27:26,119 --> 00:27:28,279
firewalls if we're just looking at the

603
00:27:28,279 --> 00:27:30,169
network architecture diagram with the

604
00:27:30,169 --> 00:27:32,600
walls on fire then we're only seeing

605
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:34,729
what's in blue here and there's whole

606
00:27:34,729 --> 00:27:37,580
swaths of territory uncovered like the

607
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:38,600
threat of if somebody gets

608
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:41,210
administrative access to the operating

609
00:27:41,210 --> 00:27:43,549
system what they can do to this

610
00:27:43,549 --> 00:27:49,009
particular module or the DLF the denial

611
00:27:49,009 --> 00:27:51,019
of service threat if they have a channel

612
00:27:51,019 --> 00:27:59,299
that they can contact the server with so

613
00:27:59,299 --> 00:28:00,950
right here I was trying to highlight a

614
00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:05,629
couple attacks where there's either not

615
00:28:05,629 --> 00:28:08,649
a lot of there's either not a barrier or

616
00:28:08,649 --> 00:28:12,379
insufficient barrier in place by default

617
00:28:12,379 --> 00:28:15,109
or by installation and so for example

618
00:28:15,109 --> 00:28:18,830
with this web application there's little

619
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:23,599
to no defense against the denial of

620
00:28:23,599 --> 00:28:26,210
service threat without doing some extra

621
00:28:26,210 --> 00:28:28,820
configuration the platform is has a lot

622
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:30,649
of opportunities for example

623
00:28:30,649 --> 00:28:33,529
establishing H a through a cluster of

624
00:28:33,529 --> 00:28:37,869
ARR and NLB nodes or by CPU throttling

625
00:28:37,869 --> 00:28:41,149
within the application pools now when

626
00:28:41,149 --> 00:28:42,919
you look at those two options one of

627
00:28:42,919 --> 00:28:43,940
them is probably going to require

628
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:45,710
bringing a couple extra servers on your

629
00:28:45,710 --> 00:28:47,749
network and the other one is a trivial

630
00:28:47,749 --> 00:28:49,580
you know couple clicks you can set it up

631
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:54,499
so bowtie analysis is great because you

632
00:28:54,499 --> 00:28:56,989
can drill down to say ok which ones do I

633
00:28:56,989 --> 00:28:58,700
not have barriers for and then what's

634
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:00,859
the what's the activation energy

635
00:29:00,859 --> 00:29:02,690
required for these individual barriers

636
00:29:02,690 --> 00:29:04,849
and some of them that are very quick you

637
00:29:04,849 --> 00:29:06,440
can identify as low-hanging fruit and

638
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:11,809
improve your security so as I talked

639
00:29:11,809 --> 00:29:14,749
about there's these two barriers that

640
00:29:14,749 --> 00:29:16,669
identified in this scenario I'm

641
00:29:16,669 --> 00:29:19,340
susceptible to and there's some things

642
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:21,349
upstream that have to happen in order

643
00:29:21,349 --> 00:29:23,840
for somebody to use these different

644
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:26,809
attacks for the authenticated access

645
00:29:26,809 --> 00:29:28,340
they need to compromise a user account

646
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:31,669
upstream and for the overloading the

647
00:29:31,669 --> 00:29:33,440
server resources their problem

648
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,700
going to need to compromise some

649
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:36,590
external resources that can contact this

650
00:29:36,590 --> 00:29:38,419
server if we're talking about a web

651
00:29:38,419 --> 00:29:40,220
server that's operating in a cloud

652
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:41,720
endpoint that's exposed to the Internet

653
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:43,820
and well that's pretty easy

654
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:45,980
but if it's something on your on your

655
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:48,169
network that's behind some protection

656
00:29:48,169 --> 00:29:49,970
then there's a little more effort

657
00:29:49,970 --> 00:29:51,919
required to achieve that pre this

658
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:54,259
prerequisite but let's focus on the

659
00:29:54,259 --> 00:29:59,830
stolen credentials here in a minute so

660
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:03,710
if they exploit one of those if they

661
00:30:03,710 --> 00:30:06,549
exploit one of those attack vectors

662
00:30:06,549 --> 00:30:08,889
there can be some bad results obviously

663
00:30:08,889 --> 00:30:12,529
if they're getting if there's incomplete

664
00:30:12,529 --> 00:30:14,690
or tainted data being delivered to users

665
00:30:14,690 --> 00:30:17,570
then or services downstream that's going

666
00:30:17,570 --> 00:30:19,759
to result in unexpected behavior either

667
00:30:19,759 --> 00:30:22,009
by software modules downstream or by

668
00:30:22,009 --> 00:30:23,809
people that are making decisions based

669
00:30:23,809 --> 00:30:26,840
on that data and then there can be a

670
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:28,970
loss of productivity or visibility if

671
00:30:28,970 --> 00:30:30,679
there's a denial service happening

672
00:30:30,679 --> 00:30:33,159
obviously and so while we have

673
00:30:33,159 --> 00:30:35,059
Diagnostics like performance counters

674
00:30:35,059 --> 00:30:37,129
and we have monitoring and backups to

675
00:30:37,129 --> 00:30:38,389
restore from we really want to prevent

676
00:30:38,389 --> 00:30:41,899
these in the first place so I talked

677
00:30:41,899 --> 00:30:44,149
about upstream so there's a concept a

678
00:30:44,149 --> 00:30:48,110
concept of chaining here so let's say we

679
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:51,470
have here I we have a user account

680
00:30:51,470 --> 00:30:53,029
getting compromised and then the web

681
00:30:53,029 --> 00:30:55,789
server compromised downstream so let's

682
00:30:55,789 --> 00:30:57,379
say there's mismanagement of credentials

683
00:30:57,379 --> 00:30:59,870
going on we've heard a lot about in the

684
00:30:59,870 --> 00:31:03,830
news a lot of databases whole user

685
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:07,190
database dumps occurring and then

686
00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:09,350
there's somebody who say their their

687
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:11,419
account for a social networking site has

688
00:31:11,419 --> 00:31:13,850
the same password as their login for

689
00:31:13,850 --> 00:31:16,220
another another account that they're

690
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:18,950
using so it's something that that can't

691
00:31:18,950 --> 00:31:21,909
happen and then the attacker can use

692
00:31:21,909 --> 00:31:23,990
that those credentials to pivot to

693
00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:26,120
another resource that resource being the

694
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:28,519
web server where they get authenticated

695
00:31:28,519 --> 00:31:31,070
access and then they use that access to

696
00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:35,029
gain unauthorized access to data so this

697
00:31:35,029 --> 00:31:38,600
is just a way to visualize a specific

698
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:41,240
attack path that someone can take from

699
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:44,269
one stage to the next and to look at it

700
00:31:44,269 --> 00:31:47,029
not in isolation because it's it's easy

701
00:31:47,029 --> 00:31:47,600
to

702
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:50,200
to talk about this particular scenario

703
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,400
but it's looking at it within the

704
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:54,530
context of all the other body of threats

705
00:31:54,530 --> 00:31:57,200
so that you don't overreact to one

706
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,840
specific attack path and neglect others

707
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:04,580
leaving them wide open so this is a

708
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:07,370
level three of the user account

709
00:32:07,370 --> 00:32:08,870
compromise I apologize for the eye chart

710
00:32:08,870 --> 00:32:12,130
this slide should be shared afterwards

711
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:14,510
but one thing that we noticed right away

712
00:32:14,510 --> 00:32:17,090
is that there's a common barrier for all

713
00:32:17,090 --> 00:32:18,289
of the different attacks that have at

714
00:32:18,289 --> 00:32:20,210
least been enumerated in this example

715
00:32:20,210 --> 00:32:22,010
which is multi-factor authentication so

716
00:32:22,010 --> 00:32:24,620
if someone is talking to their IT

717
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:27,380
department about protections that they

718
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:28,549
can put in place and how to prioritize

719
00:32:28,549 --> 00:32:30,230
them they could look at this and say you

720
00:32:30,230 --> 00:32:31,760
know we're really getting a lot of bang

721
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:32,929
for our buck by doing this particular

722
00:32:32,929 --> 00:32:40,370
mechanism over another and so sticking

723
00:32:40,370 --> 00:32:41,450
with the example of the mismanagement

724
00:32:41,450 --> 00:32:44,030
and credentials there's a lot of things

725
00:32:44,030 --> 00:32:48,140
that we can do to reduce to defend

726
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:50,030
against this we can do training to tell

727
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:52,190
our users not to reuse credentials and

728
00:32:52,190 --> 00:32:53,030
good luck with that

729
00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:55,970
but Federation for example if we're

730
00:32:55,970 --> 00:32:57,830
using SSO and there's fewer passwords

731
00:32:57,830 --> 00:32:59,750
that they actually have to use then we

732
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:01,850
have a better chance of them not reusing

733
00:33:01,850 --> 00:33:03,169
them because they don't have a hundred

734
00:33:03,169 --> 00:33:05,900
maybe they have a 12 instead but then we

735
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:07,460
come into the idea of having a reputable

736
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:09,140
password manager that they're using to

737
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:10,880
store those as opposed to sticky notes

738
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:14,260
or text files or anything else silly and

739
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:16,280
multi-factor authentication or

740
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:17,600
encrypting the disk so that can't be

741
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:22,460
stolen from the disk directly in terms

742
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:24,980
of reducing the ability for people to

743
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:27,309
pivot once they have those credentials

744
00:33:27,309 --> 00:33:29,960
there are protections that we can put in

745
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:34,400
place to help with that okay so will

746
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:37,669
gave a great example of the OT

747
00:33:37,669 --> 00:33:39,350
environment and how we can look at the

748
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:42,530
wide range of threats and both Cybermen

749
00:33:42,530 --> 00:33:45,669
physical then we talked about IT and how

750
00:33:45,669 --> 00:33:48,289
bowtie is not limited to safety and how

751
00:33:48,289 --> 00:33:50,270
it can really talk about cyber stuff so

752
00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:51,140
now how do we bridge the gap between

753
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:57,110
those so here we have an example of a

754
00:33:57,110 --> 00:34:01,309
simple architecture for a date data flow

755
00:34:01,309 --> 00:34:04,279
taking data from a device's on the OT

756
00:34:04,279 --> 00:34:06,289
network and giving it to the plant

757
00:34:06,289 --> 00:34:09,649
historian where it can be visualized so

758
00:34:09,649 --> 00:34:12,050
we have a PLC which could be a target of

759
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:14,690
an attack in a scenario like we'll

760
00:34:14,690 --> 00:34:16,879
talked about and then we have a web

761
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:19,940
server that we can look at with the

762
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:22,639
bowtie that I talked about earlier so

763
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:25,489
these are these are put up here to show

764
00:34:25,489 --> 00:34:27,918
where the bowtie resides in the network

765
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:29,869
so that we start with the architecture

766
00:34:29,869 --> 00:34:31,280
view with the firewalls and the zones

767
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:34,149
and then we can drill into the actual

768
00:34:34,149 --> 00:34:39,379
defenses and analysis now note that this

769
00:34:39,379 --> 00:34:42,949
here is we could have those individual

770
00:34:42,949 --> 00:34:46,609
sites piping up to an IT network a

771
00:34:46,609 --> 00:34:48,619
corporate network where the data is

772
00:34:48,619 --> 00:34:51,730
getting aggregated and visualized and

773
00:34:51,730 --> 00:34:56,030
this this diagram here is another course

774
00:34:56,030 --> 00:34:59,060
or another web server application and we

775
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:00,349
can use the same bowtie because we're

776
00:35:00,349 --> 00:35:01,940
looking at the same theoretical defenses

777
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:04,069
but our analysis of that bowtie is

778
00:35:04,069 --> 00:35:05,240
probably gonna be a little bit different

779
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:07,609
in the OT space we're gonna be focusing

780
00:35:07,609 --> 00:35:08,869
more on prevention we're probably gonna

781
00:35:08,869 --> 00:35:10,099
be looking more at the barriers on the

782
00:35:10,099 --> 00:35:12,319
left side in the IT space we might be

783
00:35:12,319 --> 00:35:13,760
more concerned about disaster recovery

784
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,560
and we might be thinking about it from

785
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:18,079
the mindset of you know a more hostile

786
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:20,119
territory so we're gonna be looking more

787
00:35:20,119 --> 00:35:22,369
on the right side so it's the same

788
00:35:22,369 --> 00:35:25,490
theoretical possibility and you evaluate

789
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:29,540
it within different Network realities so

790
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:31,940
we can identify critical critical

791
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:34,220
concern on one side our industrial

792
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:35,780
control system we can talk about the

793
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:38,359
attacks coming from the outside world

794
00:35:38,359 --> 00:35:40,520
and we want to chain from one to the

795
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:41,200
other

796
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,880
so a couple tack paths that can occur

797
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:45,800
through this network there's a thick

798
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:48,589
client attack path where we go from a

799
00:35:48,589 --> 00:35:50,540
client workstation to the historian an

800
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:53,599
interface node to the device and then we

801
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:55,280
see that there's three intermediate

802
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,930
layers that an attack has to go through

803
00:35:56,930 --> 00:35:58,430
and we call this like a thick client

804
00:35:58,430 --> 00:36:02,390
kill chain similar attack path but

805
00:36:02,390 --> 00:36:03,950
different is we're using a thin client

806
00:36:03,950 --> 00:36:05,900
architecture notice there's and there's

807
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:07,339
an extra loop here where it has to go

808
00:36:07,339 --> 00:36:10,369
through the web server and so the key

809
00:36:10,369 --> 00:36:11,839
difference here is that we have that

810
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:14,060
extra layer in the middle and we have

811
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:14,990
all the defenses

812
00:36:14,990 --> 00:36:17,180
the impact reductions available at that

813
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:20,600
layer and so you might be saying all

814
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:22,430
right well what did I actually gain

815
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:24,080
there I didn't gain anything over the

816
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,430
architecture diagram and you'd be right

817
00:36:25,430 --> 00:36:28,220
the power comes in when you can look at

818
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:30,770
everything within the context of where

819
00:36:30,770 --> 00:36:36,350
it sits relative to other attacks so

820
00:36:36,350 --> 00:36:39,410
here we can use the bowties to look at

821
00:36:39,410 --> 00:36:42,290
two parallel attack channels going on at

822
00:36:42,290 --> 00:36:45,080
the same time and in this case we could

823
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:47,320
have malware being used to pivot to the

824
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:49,850
web server where they're exploiting a

825
00:36:49,850 --> 00:36:52,010
vulnerable component to act as a client

826
00:36:52,010 --> 00:36:54,410
to overload the historian causing

827
00:36:54,410 --> 00:36:56,680
services to be delayed or unresponsive

828
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:59,930
so we could have a do s attack happening

829
00:36:59,930 --> 00:37:01,640
on one level and then we could have

830
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:03,320
stolen credentials being used to access

831
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:06,380
the web server and send tainted data to

832
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:08,660
the historian that then is being used

833
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:11,030
for some other purpose so you can easily

834
00:37:11,030 --> 00:37:13,220
imagine that we have a smoke screen here

835
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:14,960
in a do s attack and then something more

836
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:18,710
subtle happening under the surface and

837
00:37:18,710 --> 00:37:20,630
so basically we're trying to bring

838
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:24,770
together the approaches from both itno t

839
00:37:24,770 --> 00:37:27,619
to help inform our defenses and give a

840
00:37:27,619 --> 00:37:29,390
better picture and we really want to see

841
00:37:29,390 --> 00:37:32,030
people working together on this so to

842
00:37:32,030 --> 00:37:33,800
address some of the challenges and

843
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:36,170
opportunities that we have these

844
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:37,850
diagrams can can take significant

845
00:37:37,850 --> 00:37:39,380
resources to put together in terms of

846
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:41,630
time and getting subject matter experts

847
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:43,820
to work on them it's a large surface

848
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:46,310
area to cover to analyze all these

849
00:37:46,310 --> 00:37:50,630
modules and where we're using a threat

850
00:37:50,630 --> 00:37:52,190
and impact enumeration where we group

851
00:37:52,190 --> 00:37:54,290
attacks together into categories with

852
00:37:54,290 --> 00:37:55,970
actionable barriers that we can put in

853
00:37:55,970 --> 00:37:57,980
place but that's a subjective measure so

854
00:37:57,980 --> 00:37:59,750
there could be standardization put in

855
00:37:59,750 --> 00:38:02,330
place there but strengths and

856
00:38:02,330 --> 00:38:04,940
opportunities which we think are big are

857
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:08,119
visualizing with oti T and even the C

858
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:10,520
suite expanding the use of an

859
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:12,200
industry-standard technique to be used

860
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:14,050
not just with safety but also security

861
00:38:14,050 --> 00:38:18,650
and leveraging existing capabilities by

862
00:38:18,650 --> 00:38:20,690
that we mean whatever your maturity

863
00:38:20,690 --> 00:38:22,400
level is with your implementation you

864
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,080
can use this approach the bowtie

865
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:26,390
reflects the state of the art and the

866
00:38:26,390 --> 00:38:28,290
theoretical possible and then

867
00:38:28,290 --> 00:38:31,380
job for an asset owner is to determine

868
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:32,640
what they actually have in place and

869
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:34,860
what they want to do next and then

870
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:37,110
lastly a note about collaboration with

871
00:38:37,110 --> 00:38:39,300
asset owners and vendors like I said

872
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:41,550
there's a large surface area to cover so

873
00:38:41,550 --> 00:38:44,550
taking a distributed and collaborative

874
00:38:44,550 --> 00:38:46,800
approach to this would make it much more

875
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,890
feasible if the vendors were publishing

876
00:38:48,890 --> 00:38:52,020
you know if if there was a cooperation

877
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:53,280
to have vendors publishing the

878
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:55,110
theoretical bowtie then that would

879
00:38:55,110 --> 00:38:58,680
reduce the job for the asset owners to

880
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:00,600
just determining what actually exists on

881
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:01,920
their environment and what they want to

882
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,260
do next

883
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:06,960
so thank you if there's any questions

884
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:08,670
we'll do our best to answer them but

885
00:39:08,670 --> 00:39:19,200
thanks for coming out we have any

886
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:27,450
questions for the speakers where did

887
00:39:27,450 --> 00:39:30,000
swear does forensics fit in the bowtie

888
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,870
security cycle forensics could be part

889
00:39:33,870 --> 00:39:37,950
of the the reduction of impact but it's

890
00:39:37,950 --> 00:39:39,870
more likely going to be feeding into

891
00:39:39,870 --> 00:39:43,380
improving the bowtie so one approach to

892
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:46,080
generating a bowtie is that you can look

893
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:48,900
at historical attacks and barriers that

894
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:51,570
would have been useful there and you

895
00:39:51,570 --> 00:39:53,610
just as you add more and more case

896
00:39:53,610 --> 00:39:56,100
studies you get a larger superposition

897
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:59,490
of defenses and it starts to flesh out

898
00:39:59,490 --> 00:40:02,790
into an actual representation of your

899
00:40:02,790 --> 00:40:05,550
security posture so yeah I would say

900
00:40:05,550 --> 00:40:07,620
forensics is really in the creation of

901
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:10,759
the bowtie mostly

902
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:20,680
I just have a comment especially for the

903
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:22,630
digital forensics thing the boat time

904
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:27,610
model is is not for the attack side you

905
00:40:27,610 --> 00:40:31,180
can choose where you can very want to

906
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:33,610
put your money actually you can wear

907
00:40:33,610 --> 00:40:35,590
proactive way we can do it a reactive

908
00:40:35,590 --> 00:40:39,850
way you understand digital forensics IDs

909
00:40:39,850 --> 00:40:43,530
I don't see yeah you can put on the log

910
00:40:43,530 --> 00:40:51,190
log mythology's as a proactive thing and

911
00:40:51,190 --> 00:40:53,380
then you can use it as a kind of digital

912
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:58,240
forensic thing yeah up to the boat time

913
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:01,060
model I don't do you understand what I

914
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:04,170
mean I'm not sure your question is no

915
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:06,490
question it's opposed on that comment

916
00:41:06,490 --> 00:41:14,430
okay then I guess any other questions I

917
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:17,680
have one last question for you I guess

918
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:19,020
can you talk a little bit about

919
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:21,900
challenges of applying this approach on

920
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:25,410
in production already systems that maybe

921
00:41:25,410 --> 00:41:28,390
you don't necessarily have background on

922
00:41:28,390 --> 00:41:30,550
and maybe they're historical and they've

923
00:41:30,550 --> 00:41:32,260
been around for 10 years but what sort

924
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:34,180
of challenges have you seen when you try

925
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:38,380
to apply this approach there yeah so it

926
00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:40,990
I guess the challenge there are you

927
00:41:40,990 --> 00:41:43,690
talking about an asset are you talking

928
00:41:43,690 --> 00:41:44,260
about

929
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:46,690
well I can address both in the actual

930
00:41:46,690 --> 00:41:48,850
generation of the bowtie it can be

931
00:41:48,850 --> 00:41:50,950
challenging to assess what's actually in

932
00:41:50,950 --> 00:41:55,150
place in order to highlight what you

933
00:41:55,150 --> 00:41:57,670
have already implemented we're trying to

934
00:41:57,670 --> 00:41:59,820
do our part to help automate

935
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:02,560
identification of defenses so we

936
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:04,990
produced a set of scripts some audit

937
00:42:04,990 --> 00:42:09,030
tools that try to automatically identify

938
00:42:09,030 --> 00:42:12,550
you know what people using our software

939
00:42:12,550 --> 00:42:14,380
have in place for their defenses and

940
00:42:14,380 --> 00:42:16,840
juxtapose them against the best

941
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:18,910
practices and that's a project that we

942
00:42:18,910 --> 00:42:21,190
have on github the PI security audit

943
00:42:21,190 --> 00:42:24,340
tools so there are things like that that

944
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:28,680
can help with the identification phase

945
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:31,660
but as far as the generation of the

946
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:33,310
bowties that is an effort that requires

947
00:42:33,310 --> 00:42:35,020
getting subject matter experts in the

948
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:37,270
room and really doing some heads down

949
00:42:37,270 --> 00:42:41,830
analysis and that that's why it would be

950
00:42:41,830 --> 00:42:43,270
really great to have collaboration with

951
00:42:43,270 --> 00:42:45,310
asset owners imagine if Microsoft put

952
00:42:45,310 --> 00:42:47,710
out a bowtie for defending a sequel

953
00:42:47,710 --> 00:42:50,890
server and OS I saw put out one for the

954
00:42:50,890 --> 00:42:55,390
PI data archive and you know fill in the

955
00:42:55,390 --> 00:42:58,240
blank vendor with their product so it

956
00:42:58,240 --> 00:42:59,980
would really reduce that load that we're

957
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:02,080
talking about great thanks

958
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:03,940
okay so I guess I guess we can look

959
00:43:03,940 --> 00:43:06,250
forward to seeing OSI sophs bowtie

960
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:08,350
models right in fact if you want to see

961
00:43:08,350 --> 00:43:11,050
a sneak peek that on the on our PI

962
00:43:11,050 --> 00:43:13,720
square blog small plug there are some

963
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:15,790
posts that have some of these bow ties

964
00:43:15,790 --> 00:43:19,510
in place they're they're they're early

965
00:43:19,510 --> 00:43:22,240
early prototypes but they still have

966
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:24,190
been helpful to several people already

967
00:43:24,190 --> 00:43:31,380
so on the PI Square is the PI square com

968
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:34,459
