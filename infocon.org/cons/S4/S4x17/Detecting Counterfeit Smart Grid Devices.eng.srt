[Music]

2
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:14,390
professor in the Department of

3
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:15,980
Electrical and Computer Engineering at

4
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:18,380
Florida International University he'll

5
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:20,480
be presenting detecting counterfeit

6
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,590
smart grid devices

7
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:25,660
welcome seljuq please Thank You Zachary

8
00:00:25,869 --> 00:00:30,020
so hello everybody my name is Sal Cho

9
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:33,370
collage I'm a member of the faculty at

10
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:35,240
further the International University

11
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:36,670
it's actually University in Miami and

12
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:39,079
I'm also the director of cyber physical

13
00:00:39,079 --> 00:00:42,290
systems security lab and this is a joint

14
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:45,320
work with my postdoc dr. rockzo and then

15
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:48,710
my PhD student Leonardo the title is a

16
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:50,390
system level approach to detecting

17
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:54,949
counterfeit smart grid devices so I also

18
00:00:54,949 --> 00:00:56,780
need to acknowledge the fact that this

19
00:00:56,780 --> 00:01:01,239
is a US Department of Energy supported

20
00:01:01,239 --> 00:01:05,269
project so we have many projects under

21
00:01:05,269 --> 00:01:07,220
this consortium with so many other

22
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:10,250
collaborating universities so this is

23
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:13,640
one of the projects under that you know

24
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:18,170
under that side so so let me briefly

25
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:20,420
give you you know information about

26
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:22,549
first of all who I am and what we are

27
00:01:22,549 --> 00:01:24,950
doing in this lab and drif overview of

28
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:30,950
our activities so so basically in this

29
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:33,290
lab I founded this lab two years ago

30
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:35,840
when I found it when I moved from

31
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,490
Georgia Tech about two and a half years

32
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:42,860
ago and so we have about 10 you know

33
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:45,680
students in the lab and we're working in

34
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,469
the problems basically related to the

35
00:01:48,469 --> 00:01:51,079
security and networking of IOT systems

36
00:01:51,079 --> 00:01:55,070
GPS systems and so and we have you know

37
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:56,990
so many other different projects so this

38
00:01:56,990 --> 00:02:01,100
is just one of them and today's talk I

39
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:04,820
have three parts first I know you are

40
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:07,579
all maybe familiar with the background

41
00:02:07,579 --> 00:02:10,850
information for the smart grid but I'll

42
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:16,310
be I'll be giving you okay I need to

43
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:18,350
learn how to use this I'll be giving you

44
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:19,310
a little bit of background information

45
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:21,980
and then we're gonna be looking at the

46
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:24,140
technical approach for this work and

47
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:25,879
then finally I'm gonna be sharing the

48
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:26,480
results

49
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:30,830
we do so so this is a smart quick domain

50
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:36,319
and in this in this infrastructure it's

51
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:38,659
a complicated infrastructure with

52
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:41,629
heterogeneous interconnected so many

53
00:02:41,629 --> 00:02:44,090
different networking equipment and

54
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:48,799
applications so we have from you know

55
00:02:48,799 --> 00:02:52,459
basically you know three components from

56
00:02:52,459 --> 00:02:54,500
generation transmission to distribution

57
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,930
you know you know we have you know

58
00:02:56,930 --> 00:02:59,030
different power sources we have

59
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:03,579
transmission substations and micro grids

60
00:03:03,579 --> 00:03:07,220
etc and we have distribution network and

61
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:09,140
then we have the customer premises we

62
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:10,940
can also from the inverting perspective

63
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:13,060
we can also classify this infrastructure

64
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:18,379
based on neighborhood area networks wide

65
00:03:18,379 --> 00:03:22,310
area networks and home area networks so

66
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:24,470
let me look at this infrastructure what

67
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:26,769
we see here is that there are a lot of

68
00:03:26,769 --> 00:03:28,940
devices and there are a lot of

69
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:36,290
applications running so so for the

70
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:38,419
purposes of this work we are classifying

71
00:03:38,419 --> 00:03:40,639
the devices into - you know categories

72
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:43,310
one is resource-limited devices and the

73
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:44,739
other is resources which devices

74
00:03:44,739 --> 00:03:47,120
resource-limited devices are devices

75
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,680
with simple hardware and software

76
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:52,099
architecture on them and examples of

77
00:03:52,099 --> 00:03:54,980
these for example with low performance

78
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:57,260
CPUs and very limited memory resources

79
00:03:57,260 --> 00:04:01,220
like PLC's are to use etc and resources

80
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:05,660
devices we these are close to maybe full

81
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:09,530
scale computing systems they have faster

82
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:11,480
and even multi-core processors with

83
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:15,440
significant cash and RAM resources so

84
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:17,570
why are we you know interested in this

85
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:20,470
problem so currently counter feeding is

86
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:23,810
basically a big problem it amounts for

87
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:26,780
at least 7.5 billion in lost revenue for

88
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:31,970
u.s. semiconductor come companies so we

89
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:33,620
are looking at this problem in the smart

90
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:36,140
grid domain and this has not been you

91
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:38,960
know extensively studied and and also

92
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,240
our approach is really

93
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:47,590
a different from the others so just a

94
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:49,360
quick summary summary of our

95
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,669
contributions basically of this work we

96
00:04:51,669 --> 00:04:54,430
provide a system-level approach system

97
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:57,160
that will look at the counterfeiting

98
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:59,259
problem we're not solving the problem at

99
00:04:59,259 --> 00:05:01,270
the hardware we are looking at the you

100
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:05,729
know at the at the you know OS level and

101
00:05:05,729 --> 00:05:08,259
I'm gonna be explaining and talking to

102
00:05:08,259 --> 00:05:09,940
you about the adversity model and then

103
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:12,340
the details of the framework and I'm

104
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:14,590
gonna be also sharing the performance

105
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:17,770
overhead so let's talk about the details

106
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:25,330
of the approach so we mostly since I'm

107
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:26,740
coming from the academia but I was also

108
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:29,979
briefly in the industry you like you

109
00:05:29,979 --> 00:05:36,729
know first you know we like first

110
00:05:36,729 --> 00:05:38,080
talking about what we are dealing with

111
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,460
what problems so here we are addressing

112
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:45,699
when we have a contra via device we have

113
00:05:45,699 --> 00:05:48,630
an adversity model where we have a

114
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:51,009
counterfeit device can leak the

115
00:05:51,009 --> 00:05:53,380
information to another you know device

116
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:56,500
or outside third parties or the country

117
00:05:56,500 --> 00:06:00,520
twice can poison the measurements like

118
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:04,270
for example the station stages of the

119
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:06,130
network or the load and demand

120
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:10,270
information or a counterfeit device can

121
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:13,060
store the information and and and send

122
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:16,780
it to another third party later so these

123
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:19,770
are the different threats that we are

124
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:25,690
considering in our framework so as I

125
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:28,419
said told you before we you know have

126
00:06:28,419 --> 00:06:30,310
two different devices like

127
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:32,699
resource-limited devices and research

128
00:06:32,699 --> 00:06:35,530
rich devices so considering these two

129
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:38,110
device types and considering these three

130
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:42,940
different adversaries we have six

131
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:44,770
different country devices in our model

132
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:47,020
to deal with so each of these

133
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:49,300
counterfeit devices basically in our you

134
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:52,120
know framework they are messing up with

135
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,479
either

136
00:06:55,649 --> 00:07:00,369
the memory or you know the you know open

137
00:07:00,369 --> 00:07:02,499
extra communication challenge channels

138
00:07:02,499 --> 00:07:09,219
or they poison the measurements etc so I

139
00:07:09,219 --> 00:07:11,769
have to also you know let you know that

140
00:07:11,769 --> 00:07:13,839
you know we didn't have a actual

141
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:15,849
counterfeit device so since we didn't

142
00:07:15,849 --> 00:07:18,279
have an actual counterfeit device we the

143
00:07:18,279 --> 00:07:20,409
best approach that we could do it was to

144
00:07:20,409 --> 00:07:24,639
model the behavior of an attacker so we

145
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:27,610
for this we came up with a stochastic

146
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:30,669
process and we modeled the the

147
00:07:30,669 --> 00:07:32,949
adversaries behavior with Poisson

148
00:07:32,949 --> 00:07:34,839
distribution so basically the attacks

149
00:07:34,839 --> 00:07:36,849
happened according to the Poisson

150
00:07:36,849 --> 00:07:38,919
distribution well in reality they might

151
00:07:38,919 --> 00:07:41,169
be behaving more deterministic Li or

152
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:44,489
they might be behaving with another

153
00:07:44,489 --> 00:07:48,939
another another distribution they may be

154
00:07:48,939 --> 00:07:53,319
but on average Poisson allows us is a

155
00:07:53,319 --> 00:07:59,829
good you know stochastic approach so we

156
00:07:59,829 --> 00:08:02,469
built a small test per test but in fact

157
00:08:02,469 --> 00:08:07,599
it's a you know very tiny and at FIU we

158
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:10,360
have a very big smart grid testbed it's

159
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,249
like maybe the size of this room with

160
00:08:12,249 --> 00:08:14,949
different you know generators from

161
00:08:14,949 --> 00:08:17,019
generation to transmission and

162
00:08:17,019 --> 00:08:18,819
distribution where we can have different

163
00:08:18,819 --> 00:08:20,860
configurations but this one particular

164
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:23,050
for this study we wanted to you know

165
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:25,619
focus on the devices so we had a small

166
00:08:25,619 --> 00:08:29,829
very tiny testbed so what we did we use

167
00:08:29,829 --> 00:08:33,279
the open source version of the IIC 61

168
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:37,058
850 it's and then we - lies the

169
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:39,458
publisher subscribers to a communication

170
00:08:39,458 --> 00:08:42,808
model of the goos messages so basically

171
00:08:42,808 --> 00:08:45,370
here we had a Raspberry Pi for a

172
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:47,170
resource-limited device and he had a

173
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:50,579
laptop here for the more powerful with

174
00:08:50,579 --> 00:08:53,860
resurfaced device so they communicated

175
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:55,689
between each other Goo's publisher and

176
00:08:55,689 --> 00:08:58,860
go subscriber model

177
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:07,600
okay so in our framework we have three

178
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,850
steps well first step is the data

179
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:12,010
collection step the second step is the

180
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:14,140
data processing and the third step is

181
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:17,050
the decision whether the device is a

182
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:18,610
counterfeit device for a genuine device

183
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:22,180
in the data collection step we trace and

184
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:24,880
capture all the system calls associated

185
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:28,300
with the with the applications that are

186
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:32,110
running on the device then in the data

187
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:34,930
processing step we have three simple

188
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:38,980
detection approaches basically we are

189
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:42,130
utilizing correlation mechanisms like

190
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:45,790
statistical correlation as our future as

191
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:51,520
our is our main detection mechanism it's

192
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:54,100
simple you will be surprised even if

193
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:55,990
it's so simple like you could add maybe

194
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:57,430
other you know in the future are

195
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,370
actually you know thinking of other

196
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:02,200
other detection mechanisms as well but

197
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,580
even with this simple we were able to

198
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:07,510
you know catch a lot of counterfeit

199
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:11,980
devices in the detection module as I

200
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:15,130
said we are basically deciding whether

201
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:19,440
the device is genuine or a real device

202
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:26,110
so so in this first we compare the

203
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:30,670
system calls made from the counterfeit

204
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:34,510
device to the to the to the ground truth

205
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:36,700
device and based on the type of

206
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:39,070
frequency of the system calls we collect

207
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:40,960
that information and then we have for

208
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:44,920
resource-rich devices we have esta we

209
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:47,100
are applying as statistical correlation

210
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:50,760
in a simple way and then we apply the

211
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:55,480
same technique with a slight difference

212
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:58,000
from the simple one and on the

213
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,520
resource-limited devices so basically at

214
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:03,190
this step we look at the order of the

215
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:04,960
system calls that are triggered by the

216
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:09,970
system so just for as a reference this

217
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:12,180
is

218
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:17,910
this is the autocorrelation function and

219
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:21,520
definition and this is the for the

220
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,440
correlation for the counterfeit device

221
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:30,940
detection that we use so here we have

222
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,320
the genuine device and we have the

223
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,779
unknown device so for our framework we

224
00:11:34,779 --> 00:11:36,730
collect the data the system Falls

225
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:39,640
function calls etc all these new calls

226
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:43,209
and then then that information is passed

227
00:11:43,209 --> 00:11:45,490
to the data processing you know step

228
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:47,920
system call this comparison and then we

229
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,350
do the simple and advanced so we don't

230
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:52,779
do all these detection mechanisms all at

231
00:11:52,779 --> 00:11:55,420
once so we do it step by step so that

232
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:57,520
also allows us to save you know energy

233
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:01,540
and and then finally we decide whether

234
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:03,420
the device is counterfeit or genuine

235
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:06,130
here is the method that we utilize for

236
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:08,830
the to extract information for the

237
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:14,589
genuine device so let me discuss the

238
00:12:14,589 --> 00:12:16,839
results how this simple technique is

239
00:12:16,839 --> 00:12:25,089
really useful and we ran our model for

240
00:12:25,089 --> 00:12:28,000
you know 30 times for all these

241
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,680
different counterfeit devices and and

242
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:32,649
and in different settings and the result

243
00:12:32,649 --> 00:12:33,579
that I'm going to be sharing is

244
00:12:33,579 --> 00:12:35,950
basically the average of these 30

245
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:44,399
different instance of the experiments so

246
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:48,160
let's look at the your results so these

247
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,870
are the average amount of system calls

248
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:52,270
per type normalized against the system

249
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:54,850
call lists of the ground truth twice so

250
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:58,209
value over 1 indicates the presence of

251
00:12:58,209 --> 00:13:02,170
counterfeit device basically here we

252
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:04,390
have the P trace while here where the

253
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:06,160
library interposition so these are

254
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,070
system called techniques to capture the

255
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:12,490
the system calls that you can use and as

256
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:15,579
you see here these values for these for

257
00:13:15,579 --> 00:13:17,560
the counter a second counterfeit device

258
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:19,810
and the third counterfeit device for the

259
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:21,850
resource-limited case ours

260
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:23,589
you know simple method the first method

261
00:13:23,589 --> 00:13:26,499
is not really successful so

262
00:13:26,499 --> 00:13:28,449
I'm gonna show you how the correlation

263
00:13:28,449 --> 00:13:30,429
mechanism then comes into place and then

264
00:13:30,429 --> 00:13:32,589
actually makes it better I'm gonna show

265
00:13:32,589 --> 00:13:37,599
you here we apply it on the

266
00:13:37,599 --> 00:13:39,489
resource-rich devices again we have this

267
00:13:39,489 --> 00:13:41,439
you know you know this problem thick

268
00:13:41,439 --> 00:13:44,649
region and for about P trace and library

269
00:13:44,649 --> 00:13:47,079
interposition and as I was telling you

270
00:13:47,079 --> 00:13:49,149
this is really at the system level not

271
00:13:49,149 --> 00:13:51,399
at the hardware allows our assumption is

272
00:13:51,399 --> 00:13:53,889
basically for doing that whatever the

273
00:13:53,889 --> 00:13:56,409
hardware you know if it's you know a

274
00:13:56,409 --> 00:14:00,069
fake in you know components it's gonna

275
00:14:00,069 --> 00:14:02,139
either communicate or do something

276
00:14:02,139 --> 00:14:03,849
malicious that would be observable at

277
00:14:03,849 --> 00:14:07,319
the system level that's our assumption

278
00:14:07,319 --> 00:14:15,309
so so yeah let's continue and when we

279
00:14:15,309 --> 00:14:17,909
apply the simple correlation techniques

280
00:14:17,909 --> 00:14:22,659
you see that we are able to improve the

281
00:14:22,659 --> 00:14:26,439
results here that we haven't so here we

282
00:14:26,439 --> 00:14:30,819
have the on the resource-rich devices

283
00:14:30,819 --> 00:14:33,819
and here again there is some problematic

284
00:14:33,819 --> 00:14:35,829
region so the way that we do is is that

285
00:14:35,829 --> 00:14:37,839
we have a threshold value these are all

286
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:42,099
configurable values by the way 0.6 any

287
00:14:42,099 --> 00:14:46,720
value above 0.6 basically blue bar

288
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,839
refers to its ground truth device and

289
00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:52,149
these are basically the ones that are

290
00:14:52,149 --> 00:14:53,919
picked up by our system as the

291
00:14:53,919 --> 00:14:55,779
counterfeit devices here for the

292
00:14:55,779 --> 00:14:57,279
resource-limited device for the

293
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:00,549
interposition in case our simple

294
00:15:00,549 --> 00:15:03,999
correlation the first of the correlation

295
00:15:03,999 --> 00:15:07,720
doesn't identify the counterfeit devices

296
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:10,419
however when we applied our you know

297
00:15:10,419 --> 00:15:12,369
advanced statistical correlation

298
00:15:12,369 --> 00:15:15,089
technique on this you know on this one

299
00:15:15,089 --> 00:15:17,470
we see that our system is able to

300
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:21,099
identify these devices again so as I

301
00:15:21,099 --> 00:15:23,349
said we apply these in a cascading

302
00:15:23,349 --> 00:15:26,289
fashion not on only you know all of them

303
00:15:26,289 --> 00:15:30,759
at once and to be able to utilize their

304
00:15:30,759 --> 00:15:34,990
resources efficiently so finally

305
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:37,970
okay I good one good on time perfect

306
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:44,090
finally so we looked at the overhead on

307
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:46,790
the system resources on the on are you

308
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:49,730
know using our framework here on the

309
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:52,630
left you see the costs associated

310
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:55,070
real-time system time user time memory

311
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:58,190
CPU when there is no framework for the

312
00:15:58,190 --> 00:15:59,690
resource rich devices and resource

313
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:02,060
limited devices on the right you see

314
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:05,450
with the framework using the the

315
00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:07,370
techniques on the resource rich resource

316
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:09,740
limited devices as you see these are the

317
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:13,070
percent increases and we really do not

318
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:16,310
have a lot of you know impact on the

319
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:23,590
resources this even this is simple so

320
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:27,740
just to summarize with this simple

321
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:29,330
techniques with the correlation

322
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:31,130
statistical techniques we are able to

323
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:35,740
really pick up and identify the the

324
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:39,650
counterfeit devices in our with respect

325
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:42,230
to our you know adversity model the

326
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:46,340
overhead is not that high and we have

327
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:48,140
really a comprehensive adversary model

328
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:51,860
with different threats and and in fact

329
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:53,810
our model this framework could be

330
00:16:53,810 --> 00:16:57,710
applied to other settings as well not

331
00:16:57,710 --> 00:17:06,250
only here for the smart grid devices so

332
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:09,859
I think we could also improve our work

333
00:17:09,859 --> 00:17:12,109
by incorporating other detection

334
00:17:12,109 --> 00:17:15,290
mechanisms which at the moment we are

335
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:18,680
actually working on this is actually an

336
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:22,430
ongoing work so we could test it with

337
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:26,329
you know more devices or and I know it's

338
00:17:26,329 --> 00:17:28,760
hard to find a real counterfeit device I

339
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:32,270
know it's hard to find a fake iphone or

340
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:34,850
fake other you know phones or even you

341
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:37,250
can find fake routers or routers that

342
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:39,950
are leaking information to you know some

343
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:41,600
other entities that are not supposed to

344
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,000
be doing it but doing it but for Smart

345
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,020
Grid domain I think this is a

346
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:50,250
a kind of a unexplored yet not explored

347
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:53,520
problem and another thing is that I

348
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,350
think that I already mentioned to you is

349
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:59,970
that the adversary may be behaving not

350
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:01,920
according to the Poisson model Poston is

351
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:04,710
a good stochastic you know model on

352
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:07,740
average it's good you know to utilize it

353
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:13,500
and to you know to you know to to look

354
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,120
at the general and generic behavior

355
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,790
capture the generic behavior but in

356
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:20,550
realistic cases the adversary might be

357
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:23,010
you know more deterministic or even may

358
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:28,970
be using a different distribution to so

359
00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:33,420
so let me conclude control fate devices

360
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:34,950
consider a serious threat to healthy and

361
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:36,630
secure distribution of data in the smart

362
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:39,690
grid and we designed and implemented a

363
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:41,520
system level framework it's a system

364
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,130
level framework capable of monitoring

365
00:18:44,130 --> 00:18:45,720
and detecting counterfeit smart grid

366
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:50,330
device behavior we have a realistic

367
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:52,470
adversary model that would be able to

368
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:56,940
capture different threats and we have

369
00:18:56,940 --> 00:19:01,020
really good results and and and it

370
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:04,940
doesn't propose a significant overhead

371
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:07,440
in the future we will incorporate as I

372
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,540
said machine learning algorithms as a

373
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:13,860
detection mechanism and other detection

374
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:15,600
approaches like CPU and memory

375
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,400
utilization we will be also

376
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:21,330
incorporating that into our results some

377
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:24,710
references to in this one in work that I

378
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:31,680
noted and so I want to thank you very

379
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:32,370
much

380
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:35,100
Zachary and all if you have any

381
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:38,460
questions this is my aunt's light and so

382
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:41,990
I'll be happy to answer

383
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:49,620
hello is the mic on yet I can't tell

384
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:57,250
like it did you like it yeah

385
00:19:57,250 --> 00:20:03,130
can we show this less light I'm sorry I

386
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:10,540
can't hear ya can we put up the less

387
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:11,260
light yeah

388
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:25,240
thanks yeah hello are we checking the

389
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:37,150
mic it get a mic okay perfect what was

390
00:20:37,150 --> 00:20:39,850
the success rate yeah okay

391
00:20:39,850 --> 00:20:43,660
so yeah that's a good question like I

392
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:46,180
have the results for the accuracy we

393
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:49,570
have about like 98% accuracy but I

394
00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:51,940
didn't include into these slides it's

395
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:55,570
you know right now being you know

396
00:20:55,570 --> 00:20:58,540
published it's on the review so but we

397
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:01,300
have really good results the approach is

398
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:03,250
really simple like using some

399
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:05,530
statistical techniques from signals you

400
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:16,960
know teri DSP and yeah yeah thanks yeah

401
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:20,560
really great really great work but in in

402
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:22,870
your test bed I would say that you have

403
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:25,230
an idealized example of the level of

404
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:28,590
instrumentation that's available in a

405
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:32,500
practical system deployment and system

406
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:36,370
call level data is very very rare to be

407
00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:38,740
seen as an interface provided by vendors

408
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:41,200
and deployed industrial control systems

409
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,310
exactly yeah

410
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:44,470
what is your do you have a message maybe

411
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:46,810
for vendors of encouragement for

412
00:21:46,810 --> 00:21:48,880
providing this level of instrumentation

413
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,190
and forensic data both that process call

414
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:53,950
level process execution system you know

415
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:54,430
level

416
00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:55,900
yeah it's a great question yeah our

417
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:59,619
difficulty really was

418
00:21:59,619 --> 00:22:02,590
being able to you know have access to

419
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:06,549
the real smart grid devices and they're

420
00:22:06,549 --> 00:22:09,759
also it's really close source and closed

421
00:22:09,759 --> 00:22:10,359
you know

422
00:22:10,359 --> 00:22:14,679
everything closed in this realm and but

423
00:22:14,679 --> 00:22:17,259
the methods are as computer scientists

424
00:22:17,259 --> 00:22:18,970
or computer engineers we know how to

425
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:22,210
deal with the problem and gladly we were

426
00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:25,470
able to find open source version of the

427
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:27,730
substation protocols that are used by

428
00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:33,249
these devices the IEC 61 850 Lib it's

429
00:22:33,249 --> 00:22:34,779
called if you google it you'll be able

430
00:22:34,779 --> 00:22:36,429
to find it so it was really

431
00:22:36,429 --> 00:22:38,409
straightforward to install and you you

432
00:22:38,409 --> 00:22:41,649
know you know on a tiny device and have

433
00:22:41,649 --> 00:22:45,119
our own you know simple tiny you know a

434
00:22:45,119 --> 00:22:49,840
test bed like we do in other projects in

435
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,460
the you know in the rest of the other

436
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:54,519
you know like you know when we deal with

437
00:22:54,519 --> 00:22:56,950
the real world threats if you have the

438
00:22:56,950 --> 00:22:59,470
open source you know we deal with the

439
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:01,899
threats better because the code is you

440
00:23:01,899 --> 00:23:03,309
know watched and everybody is watching

441
00:23:03,309 --> 00:23:06,220
the code and so I think the message is

442
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:09,090
that if you have more open source

443
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:12,239
products then we would be able to

444
00:23:12,239 --> 00:23:15,759
academics students any enthusiasts

445
00:23:15,759 --> 00:23:18,970
anybody would be able to come and check

446
00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:20,710
it for you and then let you know and

447
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:22,509
then we would be able to have the same

448
00:23:22,509 --> 00:23:24,549
mechanisms that we have for the you know

449
00:23:24,549 --> 00:23:28,179
internet so that's my message actually

450
00:23:28,179 --> 00:23:32,200
so yeah because we know how to deal with

451
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:36,039
the problem yeah waiting from Pearl

452
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:38,249
Hawass I have two questions actually

453
00:23:38,249 --> 00:23:41,350
fundamentally so are you used six

454
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:43,899
counterfeit devices where did you catch

455
00:23:43,899 --> 00:23:47,879
the addresses and how do you know that

456
00:23:47,879 --> 00:23:51,429
the counterfeit devices are used

457
00:23:51,429 --> 00:23:54,279
different system costs compared to the

458
00:23:54,279 --> 00:23:56,259
genuine devices because you assume that

459
00:23:56,259 --> 00:23:58,419
implies that part fresh yeah that's a

460
00:23:58,419 --> 00:24:00,190
great question but as I explained in my

461
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:04,989
slides we assumed that you know so at

462
00:24:04,989 --> 00:24:07,149
the end of the day a counterfeit device

463
00:24:07,149 --> 00:24:10,179
is going to do something okay it's gonna

464
00:24:10,179 --> 00:24:12,220
either store the information

465
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:14,440
it's gonna steal the information which

466
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:18,220
in the you can Google and even you can

467
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:21,039
come up you know some real examples like

468
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:23,049
there were some labs that they're

469
00:24:23,049 --> 00:24:25,270
discarded their routers because that

470
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:27,610
were manufactured by a specific you know

471
00:24:27,610 --> 00:24:30,640
you know specific vendor so they were

472
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,289
leaking information so at the end of the

473
00:24:32,289 --> 00:24:36,520
day a company a you know a device a

474
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:38,169
vendor basically is going to be doing

475
00:24:38,169 --> 00:24:41,679
when it has a corrupt you know hardware

476
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:43,870
components at the end it's gonna do

477
00:24:43,870 --> 00:24:47,549
those one of those three things steal or

478
00:24:47,549 --> 00:24:52,840
leak poison and in order to do these

479
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:54,640
things you have to mess with the memory

480
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:57,549
you have to you know open ports and you

481
00:24:57,549 --> 00:24:59,350
have to communicate you have to do some

482
00:24:59,350 --> 00:25:01,750
secret things so we incorporated all

483
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:04,150
those things in our model and we are

484
00:25:04,150 --> 00:25:05,679
able to catch them at the system level

485
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:10,990
so that way you know in realistic cases

486
00:25:10,990 --> 00:25:12,340
we would be able to catch all these

487
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:14,950
attacks I don't know if this but you're

488
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:17,980
right and I also told you we don't have

489
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:19,960
an example of a counterfeit device you

490
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:23,320
only the only are you know that's one of

491
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:25,539
the problems we only know how it would

492
00:25:25,539 --> 00:25:28,720
behave basically so are we talking about

493
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,640
Holloway's right we are talking about

494
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,860
hardware's so next example you're

495
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:35,260
leaking some message okay so the Janu

496
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:39,429
interests talk to the reg happy address

497
00:25:39,429 --> 00:25:42,520
but a counterfeit device is talking to

498
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:44,710
another IP address but for the system

499
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:46,620
call parts maybe the exactly the same

500
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:50,020
I'm sure I didn't get it I mean if you

501
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:52,210
are considering that some counterfeit

502
00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:54,370
devices speaking the information

503
00:25:54,370 --> 00:25:56,470
yeah right so maybe the truth u.s.

504
00:25:56,470 --> 00:25:59,320
devices are talking to set off for the

505
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:01,990
two IPS and the counterfeit device is

506
00:26:01,990 --> 00:26:05,919
talking to another IP maybe user is but

507
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:08,740
for a system car parts okay they should

508
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:10,630
be the same just IP address that's work

509
00:26:10,630 --> 00:26:13,570
like your HTTP out being as part may be

510
00:26:13,570 --> 00:26:16,720
different but system cost maybe say yeah

511
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:19,330
I I understand what you're asking but we

512
00:26:19,330 --> 00:26:21,100
are I didn't go into the details this is

513
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:23,289
really high level of what we are doing

514
00:26:23,289 --> 00:26:26,050
but we are incorporating all those

515
00:26:26,050 --> 00:26:28,000
you know things into the in the

516
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,310
framework like yeah we are looking at

517
00:26:30,310 --> 00:26:33,340
where this guy is communicating to where

518
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:35,440
is this you know what is this guy doing

519
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:40,180
etc but if you are as closed you know as

520
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:43,390
possible to the hardware okay to catch

521
00:26:43,390 --> 00:26:45,730
the behavior you're at a really you know

522
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:48,580
more advantageous you know place and at

523
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:51,850
hardware it's really hard to catch stuff

524
00:26:51,850 --> 00:26:53,590
at the hardware level because there's so

525
00:26:53,590 --> 00:26:55,060
many things happening I mean if you have

526
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:56,320
another project that we look at that

527
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,540
that's you know on a separate project

528
00:26:58,540 --> 00:27:00,640
but it's really not that easy at the

529
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:05,320
hardware abstraction and also for

530
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:08,890
efficiency purposes as well yeah another

531
00:27:08,890 --> 00:27:10,800
question I have a quick question or

532
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:13,060
suggestion so you're assuming in here

533
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:16,000
also malicious counterfeits some

534
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,650
counterfeits are are just economic they

535
00:27:17,650 --> 00:27:19,780
want to be able to sell you a device

536
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:21,850
that full cost but provide something

537
00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:23,350
that's that's much cheaper and

538
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:25,060
potentially just a performance metric in

539
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:27,490
there may also be able to identify other

540
00:27:27,490 --> 00:27:29,710
types of counterfeits that are not you

541
00:27:29,710 --> 00:27:31,120
know maliciously storing a leaking data

542
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,530
but are just made with inferior

543
00:27:32,530 --> 00:27:34,000
components and not responding to the

544
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,890
appropriate hearing I think a lot of our

545
00:27:35,890 --> 00:27:37,660
asset owners we would be just as

546
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:38,950
concerned about those types of uh

547
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:40,650
components as they are about malicious

548
00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:44,230
counterfeit yeah yeah yeah

549
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:49,330
any other questions one back here good a

550
00:27:49,330 --> 00:27:54,010
lot of questions thank you I guess as

551
00:27:54,010 --> 00:27:55,840
well as if an attacker has gone to the

552
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,640
trouble of counterfeiting a device and

553
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:00,370
he's changing its behavior like he's got

554
00:28:00,370 --> 00:28:03,100
some motivation and it's just one extra

555
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:05,980
step for him to feed back false data so

556
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:08,380
that you're from the point of view of

557
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:09,850
your algorithms it looks like a

558
00:28:09,850 --> 00:28:13,150
legitimate device but yeah it's a very

559
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:16,060
good point actually are one of the next

560
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:18,370
steps that we are going to be also we're

561
00:28:18,370 --> 00:28:23,020
going to be incorporating we're gonna be

562
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:24,610
also incorporating this in a distributed

563
00:28:24,610 --> 00:28:27,060
fashion like where we have more

564
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:30,070
information also you know look at this

565
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:34,380
overall system you've yeah

566
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:36,030
nation on the network or something like

567
00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:39,720
this or I'm sorry I didn't get so you

568
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:41,460
pick up if there's extra data moving

569
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:42,840
around in that wreck and take that as an

570
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:45,090
indicator of a change in behavior yeah

571
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:47,840
yes yeah yep
