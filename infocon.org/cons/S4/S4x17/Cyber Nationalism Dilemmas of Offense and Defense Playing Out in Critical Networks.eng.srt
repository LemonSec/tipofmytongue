00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:11,670
please welcome Ben Buchanan to the s 417

3
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:19,859
main stage thank you very much a

4
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:22,529
pleasure to be here my right hand is all

5
00:00:22,529 --> 00:00:24,150
warmed up to sign those copies tomorrow

6
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:26,519
so I'm just talking today don't worry

7
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:29,369
about that and what I'm here to do when

8
00:00:29,369 --> 00:00:32,488
I do most of the time is I study how

9
00:00:32,488 --> 00:00:35,270
nations particularly their intelligence

10
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:38,040
community and their militaries operate

11
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:40,950
in cyberspace and it's pleasure to be

12
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:41,489
here

13
00:00:41,489 --> 00:00:43,890
Dale asked me to talk a little bit about

14
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:46,469
the subject of cyber nationalism how

15
00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:48,600
national interests play out in

16
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:51,059
cyberspace and often play out in ICS

17
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:54,149
networks before I get to the nuts and

18
00:00:54,149 --> 00:00:56,489
bolts of operations I want to take a big

19
00:00:56,489 --> 00:00:59,399
step back and ask a rhetorical question

20
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:02,550
but an important one if I asked you to

21
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:06,060
summarize the entire 20th century in one

22
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:08,760
sentence or one phrase what would you

23
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:11,610
say if you're a technologist and if

24
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:13,619
you're an optimist you probably say

25
00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:15,270
something like bringing people together

26
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:18,240
or connecting the world and you could

27
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,360
point from trains to cars to planes and

28
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,240
eventually to the Internet as a means

29
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,130
which this is done the Internet of

30
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:27,900
course is maybe the most significant of

31
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:28,439
those

32
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:30,869
it's short for Internet work which gives

33
00:01:30,869 --> 00:01:32,850
a sense of the discrete and disparate

34
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:34,530
communities that get brought together

35
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:37,110
with technology but I'm not just a

36
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:39,299
technology person I spend a lot of time

37
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:41,159
with historians and political scientists

38
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:42,689
at Harvard and if you asked them the

39
00:01:42,689 --> 00:01:44,369
question they prize to something a

40
00:01:44,369 --> 00:01:46,860
little bit blunter they might say don't

41
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:50,670
mess with nationalism and nationalism is

42
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:52,590
this notion that groups can come

43
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:54,899
together and form a nation often around

44
00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:57,090
some grievance or through some conflict

45
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:59,640
and that nation will compete in the

46
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,920
international system with other nations

47
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,030
and they'll struggle sometimes violently

48
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:08,250
sometimes not to do diplomacy to do war

49
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:10,378
to do all the things that we expect our

50
00:02:10,378 --> 00:02:12,930
nations to do and political scientists

51
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:13,580
have a

52
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:16,670
a key term that they used to describe

53
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:20,180
the system which is anarchy not chaos

54
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:22,820
but anarchy the lack of a ruler that

55
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:24,980
sets rules that's an external arbiter

56
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:27,650
for events in short at the end of day

57
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:29,690
nations have to provide for their own

58
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:31,850
security they have to advance their own

59
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:34,460
interests smaller nations will band

60
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:36,350
together in security umbrellas but at

61
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:37,780
the end of the day the tip of the spear

62
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:41,000
particularly for big strong nations they

63
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,830
have to provide for themselves and there

64
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:45,590
aren't rules on how they do that so with

65
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:47,030
that backdrop with that political

66
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:50,600
science 2-minute talk let's think about

67
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,700
how that applies to cyberspace and how

68
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,950
that applies to the digital domain that

69
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:57,410
we all operate in in other words if you

70
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:59,330
don't care about political science if

71
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:01,850
you don't care about geopolitics I would

72
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:03,020
submit that by the end of this talk

73
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:05,330
you'll believe that geopolitics cares

74
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:08,300
about you so I've divided this into

75
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:09,920
three presentations or three

76
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:13,070
propositions you can follow along and

77
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:15,440
tell me exactly where you disagree but

78
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,720
the goal of doing it in that way was to

79
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:20,180
make it clear so when you're when you're

80
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:21,709
agreeing and when you're disagreeing you

81
00:03:21,709 --> 00:03:23,390
know exactly what you're you're dealing

82
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:25,280
with we'll talk a little bit about

83
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,680
offense how nations break in on the

84
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,930
offensive side and why they do it talk a

85
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:32,870
little bit about defense how nations use

86
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:34,610
cyber operations to break in for

87
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:36,650
defensive reasons and how they do

88
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:38,510
defense at a very sophisticated level

89
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:40,700
and we'll talk about why all this is

90
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:43,400
threatening why this matters to people

91
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,230
who don't really care about technology

92
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:48,500
care about national security why they're

93
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:49,940
interested in technology and why they've

94
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:51,830
started to care a lot about it and use

95
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:55,670
it as a tool of statecraft so without

96
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:57,380
further ado let's get to proposition

97
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:59,720
number one my argument in this

98
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:02,390
proposition is that nations that want a

99
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:04,550
cyber security or cyber operations

100
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:06,980
capability during a time of conflict or

101
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:09,560
potential conflict need to break in need

102
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,720
to launch a network intrusion in advance

103
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:14,810
of that conflict now a couple reasons

104
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:16,519
for this for why I think this

105
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:18,798
proposition is true if you hang around

106
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:22,370
in Washington DC as much as I do you'll

107
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:24,860
hear people talk at Congress and

108
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:27,410
policymakers all the time about house

109
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:29,510
cyber war takes place at the speed of

110
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:31,550
light cyber war whatever that is

111
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:33,800
goes really really quickly and how this

112
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,050
changes a lot of things and I argue

113
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:37,340
that's just not true

114
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:40,730
parts of cyber war whatever that is take

115
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:44,030
place at the speed of light but many

116
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:46,190
parts don't often the part that goes

117
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:48,770
very fast is the last part and all the

118
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:50,240
stuff that goes up to that goes quite

119
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,420
slowly and requires a lot of effort and

120
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:55,160
these earlier steps breaking in gaining

121
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:57,050
access pivoting through the network

122
00:04:57,050 --> 00:04:58,760
stealing credentials whatever it is I

123
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,680
submit that these steps have less

124
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:03,050
momentum than the kinds of conventional

125
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:05,540
military operations that national

126
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:07,070
security policy makers are used to

127
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:09,560
thinking about and if you think about

128
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,750
launching a bombing run well when the

129
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:13,640
the Jets on the runway there's not too

130
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,990
much momentum you can call that bombing

131
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:17,120
run off at any time when you have the

132
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,860
airplane take off and cross into enemy

133
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,720
airspace now you've got to worry about

134
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,790
fuel and if you're in contested airspace

135
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:24,500
you've got to worry about the enemy's

136
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,510
shooting it down so there's a momentum

137
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:28,370
once you actually start invading and

138
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:30,620
crossing into enemy territory there's a

139
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:33,260
user a looser capability that is quite

140
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:35,270
stark and quite immediate and you take a

141
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:38,150
risk I argue the risk you take in cyber

142
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:40,790
operations is much less and the need for

143
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:43,070
preparation is much greater if you want

144
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:45,320
to have the cyber capability you need to

145
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,750
break in early because there's a tight

146
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:50,540
linkage between collection and attack if

147
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:52,310
you want to have to develop capability a

148
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:54,169
targeted capability one that has a

149
00:05:54,169 --> 00:05:55,820
tailored effect you need to do

150
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:58,070
reconnaissance first for those you who

151
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:59,900
know the basics of the kill chain model

152
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:02,330
or the ICS kill chain model that Mike

153
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:04,250
Asante and Rob Lee talked about this is

154
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:06,650
pretty basic stuff this is a sea change

155
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:08,270
if you come from a conventional military

156
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:10,580
background where a fire plane works just

157
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:12,650
the same in the Atlantic as it does in

158
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:14,660
the Pacific and where you can retarget a

159
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:16,310
missile or a nuclear weapon pretty

160
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:17,900
easily the idea that you need to do a

161
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:20,150
lot of reconnaissance and preparation of

162
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:21,770
the enemy's environment the enemy's

163
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:25,760
terrain first is a pretty recent idea in

164
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,650
military affairs and I think its

165
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:29,360
sharpest in cybersecurity

166
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,180
so in wrapping up this proposition let's

167
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:34,250
put a very fine point on it if you want

168
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:36,080
to have a capability six months from now

169
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,910
that's a cyber capability that's

170
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:40,070
particularly advanced and targeted you

171
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:41,370
need to break in now

172
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:44,340
actually leave your space break into red

173
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:46,560
space and gain access and start doing

174
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,139
reconnaissance on the enemy's Network so

175
00:06:49,139 --> 00:06:51,060
this is a fundamental characteristic I

176
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:53,460
argue of how high-end offence works

177
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:55,860
particularly targeting ICS devices

178
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:58,080
because of the complexity involved in

179
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:01,340
doing those kinds of tailored operations

180
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:04,139
the number of canonical examples here

181
00:07:04,139 --> 00:07:06,900
Stuxnet the crack attack in Ukraine this

182
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:09,449
crowd knows them as well as anyone but

183
00:07:09,449 --> 00:07:11,639
those represent a sea change in a lot of

184
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:13,560
ways in military thinking in a

185
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:18,449
conventional context so if we get to

186
00:07:18,449 --> 00:07:20,789
preposition number two we shift the

187
00:07:20,789 --> 00:07:24,810
focus to defense there's a lot of things

188
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:28,199
that we do to defend ICS networks you

189
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:30,449
might set up primary defenses you might

190
00:07:30,449 --> 00:07:33,780
set up air gaps you might manage your

191
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:35,340
net flow material network security

192
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:37,169
monitoring all the things that are

193
00:07:37,169 --> 00:07:38,460
usually talked about at a conference

194
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:40,850
like this are really important and

195
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:43,199
they're absolutely or they should be a

196
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:45,870
baseline if they're not already but

197
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:48,810
remember that I said nations don't have

198
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:50,729
rules in how they conduct their

199
00:07:50,729 --> 00:07:53,789
intelligence affairs so if they want to

200
00:07:53,789 --> 00:07:55,289
defend a critically important network

201
00:07:55,289 --> 00:07:57,960
they often go a little bit further in

202
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,849
ways it probably would be illegal for

203
00:07:59,849 --> 00:08:01,860
you to do if you run a power company or

204
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:04,740
a water system particularly I argue in

205
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:07,200
proposition number two here nations have

206
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:10,229
an incentive and indeed do intrude into

207
00:08:10,229 --> 00:08:12,840
other nations networks for the purposes

208
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,240
of improving their defenses not just to

209
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,280
set up offensive attacks as I described

210
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,320
in proposition number one but to improve

211
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:21,990
their defenses and got a couple quotes

212
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:23,729
here that allude to the general

213
00:08:23,729 --> 00:08:25,410
possibility and I'll get to some

214
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:28,710
specifics the u.s. cyber czar Michael

215
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:30,570
Daniel said that if you know a lot about

216
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:32,940
cyber very easy to defend against you

217
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:34,440
can generate signatures you can see the

218
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,089
enemy attack coming and you can block it

219
00:08:36,089 --> 00:08:38,070
so that's why on the offensive side the

220
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:40,890
u.s. keeps its capabilities so secret

221
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:43,529
and the NSA will acknowledge and even

222
00:08:43,529 --> 00:08:44,820
President Obama acknowledged when he

223
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:47,970
gave a speech at the NSA that a lot of

224
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:49,950
what the US does when it breaks in is

225
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:52,890
inform its defensive mission so there's

226
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:54,750
sort of a high-level picture that yes in

227
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:55,230
true

228
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:57,900
Asians are useful for defense but the

229
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:00,210
key point here is that it changes how

230
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:03,150
the dynamic works between intruder and

231
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:05,010
defender because suddenly the defender

232
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:06,660
is an intruder too the defender has

233
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:08,250
privileged information the defender

234
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:10,830
seizes the initiative and this reminds

235
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:14,130
me of a story about the great American

236
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:16,200
chess grandmaster job Bobby Fischer

237
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,120
probably the best American ever to play

238
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:21,960
chess and he said that he only got good

239
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:24,240
at chess he only really figured out

240
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,700
chess at a sophisticated level when he

241
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:27,990
realized that when he was playing as the

242
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:30,150
black pieces so the pieces that move

243
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:33,120
second he had just as much right to the

244
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,460
initiative to dictate the course of the

245
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:37,650
game as the white pieces the piece that

246
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:39,960
moved first and again this is illegal

247
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:42,060
for most people to do but when you're in

248
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:43,980
the international system I submit the

249
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:46,230
same thing is true in cybersecurity the

250
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:47,220
best defense

251
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:50,010
the truly sophisticated defense involves

252
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:52,020
penetrating other sides networks gaining

253
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:53,640
threat intelligence you can't get any

254
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:56,580
other way and seizing the initiative and

255
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:57,630
we'll talk about what the effects of

256
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:59,400
that mean and why it probably should be

257
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,860
illegal for companies to do it in a

258
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:03,930
couple minutes now you might say well

259
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:06,260
wait second bent we are pretty far from

260
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:08,940
ICS here you're just talking about two

261
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:11,150
nations doing counterintelligence and

262
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:13,710
NSA hacking the Chinese equivalent and

263
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:16,260
vice versa that doesn't really have to

264
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:18,240
relate too much to ICS it's just sort of

265
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,010
nationalism not very much critical

266
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:22,350
infrastructure which leads me to another

267
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:25,200
wrinkle you can extend proposition

268
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,070
number two and you can say it's not just

269
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:30,450
the doctors incentives to hack your

270
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:32,970
adversary which is often very hard to do

271
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:35,040
but there's incentives to hack your

272
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,950
adversaries target because in fact your

273
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:40,530
adversary is so hard to hack so if the

274
00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:42,570
NSA can't get into Chinese Network so

275
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:45,540
the Chinese can't get in to NSA networks

276
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:48,540
the next best thing is for the NSA to go

277
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:50,610
find some Chinese targets that are not

278
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:53,670
the NSA and for the Chinese to go find

279
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:56,310
some NSA targets that are not China and

280
00:10:56,310 --> 00:11:00,630
too broad in the network of intrusions

281
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:02,850
that you launch for defensive reasons to

282
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:05,010
gather information on how your adversary

283
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:07,170
operates so you can develop signatures

284
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:08,800
so you can understand there

285
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,019
tactics techniques and procedures and so

286
00:11:11,019 --> 00:11:12,369
you can understand their tradecraft in a

287
00:11:12,369 --> 00:11:14,379
way that enables you to block it and

288
00:11:14,379 --> 00:11:16,480
this is where ICS networks come

289
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,509
immediately back into the picture

290
00:11:18,509 --> 00:11:20,739
because if you believe proposition

291
00:11:20,739 --> 00:11:22,209
number one that the most sophisticated

292
00:11:22,209 --> 00:11:25,089
nations have good reason to intrude into

293
00:11:25,089 --> 00:11:27,129
ICS networks into entry into networks

294
00:11:27,129 --> 00:11:29,379
they might want to attack in advance of

295
00:11:29,379 --> 00:11:32,829
conflict then this part proposition 2

296
00:11:32,829 --> 00:11:33,670
makes a lot of sense

297
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:35,410
if you want to understand how those

298
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:37,149
nations operate and you can't get into

299
00:11:37,149 --> 00:11:39,100
their red space you want to pick out

300
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:41,379
where they're operating against third

301
00:11:41,379 --> 00:11:42,879
parties that are hopefully reasonably

302
00:11:42,879 --> 00:11:44,829
soft targets and you want to break in

303
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:49,720
there and see what you can learn and

304
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:50,949
there's a lot of evidence or at least

305
00:11:50,949 --> 00:11:52,379
some evidence that this is the case

306
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:54,549
Kaspersky Labs the cyber security firm

307
00:11:54,549 --> 00:11:56,819
that most you probably know published a

308
00:11:56,819 --> 00:11:59,519
report called the magnet of threats

309
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:02,049
which noted that one computer of

310
00:12:02,049 --> 00:12:03,429
particular interests didn't say what it

311
00:12:03,429 --> 00:12:05,799
was had been penetrated by five

312
00:12:05,799 --> 00:12:06,730
different major

313
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:09,160
cybersecurity actors essentially

314
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,420
everyone had interest in this computer

315
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:12,279
and I would submit that most of them

316
00:12:12,279 --> 00:12:14,139
probably had interest in that computer

317
00:12:14,139 --> 00:12:16,360
but if they're smart they also had an

318
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,339
interest in the other parties that had

319
00:12:18,339 --> 00:12:20,559
interest in that computer and if you

320
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:23,139
look at some of the information we have

321
00:12:23,139 --> 00:12:25,420
on sophisticated tool chains across the

322
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:28,029
five eyes we do see that this is borne

323
00:12:28,029 --> 00:12:31,209
out so this broader concept is what I

324
00:12:31,209 --> 00:12:33,339
call third party counter katrina

325
00:12:33,339 --> 00:12:35,379
exploitation is a pretty powerful thing

326
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:38,709
and it plays out on the soft targets of

327
00:12:38,709 --> 00:12:40,809
the world which relatively speaking are

328
00:12:40,809 --> 00:12:42,910
often ICS networks which are soft

329
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:44,079
targets at least compared to

330
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:46,660
intelligence community networks so

331
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:48,790
there's an incentive here to intrude

332
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:51,459
very broadly for defensive reasons not

333
00:12:51,459 --> 00:12:53,679
just into your adversaries network and

334
00:12:53,679 --> 00:12:55,089
in fact sometimes in true interruptions

335
00:12:55,089 --> 00:12:56,319
network can tip them off that you're

336
00:12:56,319 --> 00:12:57,759
after them so you don't want to do that

337
00:12:57,759 --> 00:12:59,439
you want to find the third parties and

338
00:12:59,439 --> 00:13:01,389
then poke around in there and see what

339
00:13:01,389 --> 00:13:04,869
turns up so that's proposition

340
00:13:04,869 --> 00:13:07,449
number two we can turn now to third and

341
00:13:07,449 --> 00:13:10,569
final proposition intrusions threaded

342
00:13:10,569 --> 00:13:13,869
all of this stuff here would be a purely

343
00:13:13,869 --> 00:13:16,749
academic or technical discussion if you

344
00:13:16,749 --> 00:13:18,519
don't believe this third proposition no

345
00:13:18,519 --> 00:13:19,569
one in Washington DC

346
00:13:19,569 --> 00:13:22,390
no policymaker no intelligence community

347
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:24,970
would care if intrusions weren't

348
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:27,370
threatening so it may seem obvious that

349
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:28,810
intrusions are threatening that when you

350
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:31,360
suffer an intrusion if you're running it

351
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,860
critically important Network

352
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:35,140
well that's ICS or where that's a vital

353
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:36,640
government network that you'll feel

354
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:39,070
threatened and you'll in some cases make

355
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:41,890
it an item of national policy to figure

356
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:44,950
out how to respond but it's worth being

357
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:46,870
a little bit rigorous about thinking

358
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:49,029
about how we think about this threat so

359
00:13:49,029 --> 00:13:50,980
I've divided the threats of intrusion

360
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:53,019
into four areas the first is that they

361
00:13:53,019 --> 00:13:55,600
can enable a specific cyber attack they

362
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,920
can able the tailoring and

363
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:59,490
reconnaissance that's required to have a

364
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:01,959
well-developed ICS attack this was

365
00:14:01,959 --> 00:14:03,940
proposition one just showing up here

366
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:06,940
from the other side of the ledger it's

367
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:08,800
great to be able to break in to develop

368
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,390
the capability not because it's because

369
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:11,920
you why attack just because you want to

370
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,899
have a deterrent or contingency plan the

371
00:14:13,899 --> 00:14:15,820
flip side of that is it's terrible to

372
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:17,589
have someone in your network who might

373
00:14:17,589 --> 00:14:19,029
be able to be doing those things to you

374
00:14:19,029 --> 00:14:23,950
so the the capacity to do preparation in

375
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:26,100
the environment is very threatening and

376
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:28,269
American documents such as presidential

377
00:14:28,269 --> 00:14:30,430
policy directive 20 and military

378
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:32,560
documents on preparation for the

379
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,660
environment bear this out again these

380
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:37,120
are sort of wonkish very policymaker

381
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,709
documents but they're out there and you

382
00:14:38,709 --> 00:14:40,480
can get a sense for how nations like the

383
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,850
US think about this both from doing it

384
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:44,220
but also from being threatened by

385
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:46,870
Admiral Rogers of the NSA and Cyber

386
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:50,440
Command notes that they detect foreign

387
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:52,360
adversaries sophisticated adversaries in

388
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:55,600
u.s. infrastructure and he said why are

389
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,880
they in there and the direct quote is

390
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,410
they're giving themselves the option if

391
00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:01,839
they want to act so this is a very

392
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:03,820
threatening thing and probably the most

393
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:06,610
threatening potential effect if you run

394
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:08,890
ICS network for all the reasons that

395
00:15:08,890 --> 00:15:10,690
conferences like this are really good at

396
00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:13,120
spelling out the second thing is that

397
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,240
they can serve as a beachhead for future

398
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:19,029
operations that even if you break into a

399
00:15:19,029 --> 00:15:21,670
network with no intention of developing

400
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:24,040
an ICS attack no intention of learning

401
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,240
about the environment you're simply

402
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:26,860
looking for other adversaries who are in

403
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:28,600
that network you're doing the third

404
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,220
party counter computer networks

405
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:32,709
potations I talked about the access you

406
00:15:32,709 --> 00:15:36,010
gain from breaking in can reasonably

407
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:38,530
be converted into something else not

408
00:15:38,530 --> 00:15:40,090
nearly something as sophisticated or as

409
00:15:40,090 --> 00:15:42,100
tailored as if you were doing proper

410
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:43,900
reconnaissance but you could probably do

411
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:46,420
a wiper attack and within the frame of

412
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:48,460
international politics wiper attacks

413
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:49,870
have become quite significant

414
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:52,540
certainly Sony in North Korea by any

415
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:54,460
standard we would talk about in a

416
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:56,230
conference like this not a terribly

417
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:58,450
technically sophisticated event but

418
00:15:58,450 --> 00:16:00,520
politically very important certainly

419
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,920
something like the attack Shamoon on

420
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:05,080
Saudi Aramco or the attack on Sands

421
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,970
Casino in December 2014

422
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:08,860
again not sophisticated technical

423
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:12,160
attacks but show the damage that could

424
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:15,190
be done with this level of access basic

425
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:17,620
level of access and showed how that

426
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:19,960
basic level of damage is significant

427
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,640
enough to reach the concern level of

428
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:24,520
national policymakers so that's the

429
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:27,400
second thing you can do is you can have

430
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,500
your defensive access and turn it in a

431
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,660
moment of crisis to some basic level of

432
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:33,670
offensive access go from collecting

433
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:35,890
information to attack and it's a tight

434
00:16:35,890 --> 00:16:37,600
linkage between collection and attack

435
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,090
that makes cyber operations in some ways

436
00:16:40,090 --> 00:16:41,770
very different than say airplane

437
00:16:41,770 --> 00:16:45,600
operations or satellite operations a

438
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,400
third way in which an intrusion can do

439
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:51,550
harm is it can change the tenor of

440
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:54,790
future conflict and competition less

441
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:57,280
relevant for ICS networks very important

442
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:00,010
for government networks if a nation

443
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:03,520
breaks in it can steal secrets that it

444
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:06,280
uses to inform its economic competition

445
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:08,020
to inform its political conflict and

446
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:09,880
sometimes to inform its military

447
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,859
conflict and the United States defense

448
00:17:11,859 --> 00:17:13,599
Science Board has published a lot about

449
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,760
the risks of doing this and the critical

450
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,910
dependencies in u.s. systems that need

451
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:21,490
to be protected some of which are ICS

452
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:23,589
systems and how if an adversary were to

453
00:17:23,589 --> 00:17:24,970
get in there and take those secrets out

454
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:27,609
it would very much change the tenor of a

455
00:17:27,609 --> 00:17:30,210
future military or political conflict

456
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:33,640
the fourth bit of damage that can come

457
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:36,430
from an intrusion again is more

458
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:39,220
localized to intelligence networks but

459
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:40,930
these are enormous counterintelligence

460
00:17:40,930 --> 00:17:43,840
risks if someone breaks in steals your

461
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,540
secrets they know what you know and how

462
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:48,940
you know it that fundamentally changes

463
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:49,779
how they

464
00:17:49,779 --> 00:17:51,669
to you how they anticipate your moves

465
00:17:51,669 --> 00:17:54,399
and how things play out at an

466
00:17:54,399 --> 00:17:55,749
intelligence level so now I brought a

467
00:17:55,749 --> 00:17:57,460
military conflict but just focused on

468
00:17:57,460 --> 00:18:00,159
intelligence and US documents are pretty

469
00:18:00,159 --> 00:18:02,440
clear that this is a mission for cyber

470
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:04,599
command for DoD to do

471
00:18:04,599 --> 00:18:05,590
counterintelligence

472
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:08,200
on foreign nations other nations which

473
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,549
are not democracies are obviously much

474
00:18:09,549 --> 00:18:11,229
more close lip about what it is they do

475
00:18:11,229 --> 00:18:13,119
but I think it's a safe bet to say the

476
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:14,739
Russia ISM in China's in the world it

477
00:18:14,739 --> 00:18:16,659
spend a lot of time trying to figure out

478
00:18:16,659 --> 00:18:19,960
how US intelligence works this is where

479
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,369
the third party intrusions can come into

480
00:18:21,369 --> 00:18:23,499
play and once again it links back to ICS

481
00:18:23,499 --> 00:18:25,779
networks if their capacity of spying on

482
00:18:25,779 --> 00:18:27,999
the NSA is to spy on the NSA's targets

483
00:18:27,999 --> 00:18:29,559
or their capacity of spying on the

484
00:18:29,559 --> 00:18:31,450
Chinese to spy on the Chinese targets

485
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:33,580
which might be American computers then

486
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:36,729
suddenly this intelligence battle of

487
00:18:36,729 --> 00:18:39,969
whit's intrudes again without actual

488
00:18:39,969 --> 00:18:44,710
network intrusion onto ICS networks so

489
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:47,289
that is proposition number three so

490
00:18:47,289 --> 00:18:49,419
let's take a step back here and then I

491
00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:51,309
will wrap up you can put these three

492
00:18:51,309 --> 00:18:54,339
propositions together and come to what I

493
00:18:54,339 --> 00:18:56,349
hope was a reasonably fluid argument you

494
00:18:56,349 --> 00:18:58,779
can say on one hand nations have very

495
00:18:58,779 --> 00:19:01,089
good reasons to break in early for

496
00:19:01,089 --> 00:19:03,969
offensive power they want to develop the

497
00:19:03,969 --> 00:19:05,469
capacity to attack because they're

498
00:19:05,469 --> 00:19:07,149
either planning on launching attack or

499
00:19:07,149 --> 00:19:08,859
because they wanted to turn it because

500
00:19:08,859 --> 00:19:11,169
they want a contingency plan so they've

501
00:19:11,169 --> 00:19:13,149
got good reason before those conflict

502
00:19:13,149 --> 00:19:15,070
before there's tension if it's at all

503
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:16,239
plausible and they have the resources

504
00:19:16,239 --> 00:19:18,190
and I acknowledge it's very expensive to

505
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:20,320
do this to break in early get that

506
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,450
access it's better to have the access

507
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:25,299
and not need it than to need it and not

508
00:19:25,299 --> 00:19:26,129
have it

509
00:19:26,129 --> 00:19:28,509
so that's proposition one proposition

510
00:19:28,509 --> 00:19:31,479
two same thing but for defense it's good

511
00:19:31,479 --> 00:19:33,249
to break in early to understand how the

512
00:19:33,249 --> 00:19:35,200
adversary operates to understand their

513
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,489
tradecraft where they might be going

514
00:19:36,489 --> 00:19:39,009
next purely for defensive reasons you

515
00:19:39,009 --> 00:19:40,269
don't want to do damage you don't want

516
00:19:40,269 --> 00:19:41,440
to strike you don't even want the

517
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,809
possibility of doing that but you do

518
00:19:43,809 --> 00:19:45,309
want to protect your own networks very

519
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:48,309
well the problem is that both of those

520
00:19:48,309 --> 00:19:50,080
things are very threatening and they're

521
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,989
very hard to tell apart so a nation

522
00:19:52,989 --> 00:19:55,119
might suffer an intrusion and not know

523
00:19:55,119 --> 00:19:58,749
why the other side is breaking it is it

524
00:19:58,749 --> 00:20:00,070
breaking because they're planning a no

525
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:02,019
kidding cyber attack and this is the one

526
00:20:02,019 --> 00:20:03,610
capacity and the one

527
00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:06,080
opportunity to stop it are they breaking

528
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,120
they want to establish a deterrent are

529
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,380
they breaking in because they just want

530
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:10,580
to poke around and see what they can

531
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:12,110
find and maybe then I'd be interested in

532
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:13,310
your country at all they're interested

533
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:15,110
in other country and other countries

534
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:17,210
operations which might plausibly be

535
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:20,000
against your country so the web of

536
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,500
interpretation here is very difficult

537
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:25,340
and this is what a political scientists

538
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:28,340
call the dilemma of interpretation where

539
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:31,760
another nation a nation sees an action

540
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,410
by another nation and needs to figure

541
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:35,330
out what the intentions are behind that

542
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:38,030
action and it's very difficult to learn

543
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:41,560
intention sometimes from just activity

544
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:45,890
if we tie this all together there is

545
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:47,630
this notion of the security dilemma

546
00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:50,090
Michael Asante this morning gave a great

547
00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:51,650
talk I thought about the sword of

548
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:52,820
Damocles

549
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:55,850
from ancient Greece I'll do one of the

550
00:20:55,850 --> 00:20:57,440
similar vain as well there was a Greek

551
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,390
historian Thucydides who was the first

552
00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:01,940
great historian really of all humanity

553
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:04,310
and through sadie's talked about the

554
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:06,470
peloponnesian war between Athens and

555
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:08,840
Sparta and this ad said that the

556
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,900
Penelope Stern war was inevitable

557
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:14,900
because as Athens rose Sparta which was

558
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:16,520
in the dominant power at the time got

559
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:18,920
worried Athens was going through it was

560
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,900
a sea state not really a nation but it

561
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:22,100
was going through its own kind of

562
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:24,650
advancing national interests Sparta

563
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:25,910
which had to protect its own national

564
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:27,920
interests got worried and the Athenians

565
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,990
could never convince the Spartans that

566
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:31,790
their intentions were not to overrun

567
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:34,820
Sparta and vice versa it's this rising

568
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:37,610
power that made it inevitable as Athens

569
00:21:37,610 --> 00:21:39,590
did things to defend itself it

570
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:41,150
unintentionally threatened Sparta and

571
00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:42,350
vice versa

572
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:45,410
and this to Sadie said and international

573
00:21:45,410 --> 00:21:46,550
relations theorists have worked it out

574
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:48,770
in much more formal detail since then is

575
00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:51,290
a security dilemma you provide for your

576
00:21:51,290 --> 00:21:53,330
own security but you threaten in other

577
00:21:53,330 --> 00:21:55,610
nations and that's because it's a

578
00:21:55,610 --> 00:21:57,710
self-help system it's an anarchic system

579
00:21:57,710 --> 00:21:59,450
there's no one for a big nation to turn

580
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:02,270
to they have to defend themselves so we

581
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:03,860
have two of these security dilemmas I

582
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:05,990
would argue in cyberspace to cyber

583
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:08,060
security dilemmas and I don't want to

584
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:10,280
belabor too much of the book here

585
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:11,540
because I'm not here to sell books

586
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:14,000
you're already all getting them and the

587
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,160
notion is that as you intrude for

588
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,260
offensive reasons

589
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:20,029
you might just want to turn but they the

590
00:22:20,029 --> 00:22:21,320
other nations suffer the intrusion will

591
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:23,539
feel threatened if you intrude for

592
00:22:23,539 --> 00:22:27,320
defensive reasons you might threaten

593
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:28,610
another nation that thinks it's for

594
00:22:28,610 --> 00:22:29,450
offensive reasons

595
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:31,520
if you intrude into a third party for

596
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,919
defensive reasons you might threaten

597
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:35,299
that nation even though you're not even

598
00:22:35,299 --> 00:22:36,679
interested in defending against that

599
00:22:36,679 --> 00:22:38,750
nation so the broad network of

600
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:42,590
intrusions suddenly leads to a risk of

601
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:44,779
escalation and maybe even to conflict as

602
00:22:44,779 --> 00:22:47,000
cyber capacities get more developed as

603
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,840
more nations come online we'll see how

604
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:52,220
the risks of escalation and the

605
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:55,640
potential harms play out there now let's

606
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,380
tie us all back to ICS and then I'll

607
00:22:57,380 --> 00:23:00,710
wrap up why does this matter if you are

608
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:04,130
an ICS professional because unlike every

609
00:23:04,130 --> 00:23:05,510
other past security dilemma

610
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:07,130
unlike the Greeks which are fighting it

611
00:23:07,130 --> 00:23:09,740
out on the oceans or unlike the Soviets

612
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:11,240
and the Americans during the Cold War

613
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:13,490
which fought out in submarines under the

614
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:16,789
seas or satellites in space or fighting

615
00:23:16,789 --> 00:23:20,809
dogfights over Korea or Vietnam the

616
00:23:20,809 --> 00:23:23,270
cyber security dilemma plays out in

617
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:24,950
intelligence community networks ok we

618
00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:26,720
don't worry about those and it plays out

619
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,789
in ICS networks and other networks of

620
00:23:28,789 --> 00:23:31,399
critical importance because ICS matters

621
00:23:31,399 --> 00:23:33,500
so much because these critical networks

622
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:35,510
matter so much they become offensive

623
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:37,159
targets and they become critical

624
00:23:37,159 --> 00:23:39,890
defensive targets this suddenly means

625
00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:41,240
that even if you're running a private

626
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:43,750
network with no interest in geopolitics

627
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:45,679
suddenly you've got to worry about

628
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:47,750
defending against sophisticated

629
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:49,490
adversaries that are bringing to bear

630
00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:50,840
than might have nation-states against

631
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:52,880
you and you need to figure out to what

632
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,649
degree your federal government is going

633
00:23:54,649 --> 00:23:56,419
to help you do that - whatever you want

634
00:23:56,419 --> 00:23:59,779
them to what liability you have and how

635
00:23:59,779 --> 00:24:01,299
it's going to play out a technical level

636
00:24:01,299 --> 00:24:04,610
so I would submit that in a lot of ways

637
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:07,610
the challenges that we face in ICS go

638
00:24:07,610 --> 00:24:09,559
back to broader geopolitical challenges

639
00:24:09,559 --> 00:24:13,760
that truly matter and that whether we

640
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,010
like it or not are not going away simply

641
00:24:16,010 --> 00:24:17,480
because of the nature of the

642
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:20,990
international system so I said how would

643
00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:23,899
you describe the 20th century in one

644
00:24:23,899 --> 00:24:26,240
phrase or one sentence and there's

645
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,620
different ways to look at a varying

646
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:29,929
degrees of optimism when you describe

647
00:24:29,929 --> 00:24:31,130
the 21st century

648
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:33,080
a hundred years from now and look back

649
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:37,490
I'm not sure that cybersecurity and ICS

650
00:24:37,490 --> 00:24:39,710
will be in the sentence description of

651
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:41,540
it but I'm willing to bet that if you

652
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:43,820
wrote a paragraph by the 21st century

653
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:46,640
these subjects would be right in there

654
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:49,250
probably the second or third sentence in

655
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:50,770
other words all of this stuff

656
00:24:50,770 --> 00:24:53,090
geopolitically is too important to

657
00:24:53,090 --> 00:24:55,340
ignore which means technically it's

658
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:57,020
vital to get it right thank you very

659
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:59,290
much

660
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:09,919
you
