2
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:11,219
situational awareness I don't know if

3
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:13,830
you've if anyone's going to claim

4
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:15,509
operational awareness but if not I'm

5
00:00:15,509 --> 00:00:17,640
going to coined term and I'm really just

6
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:19,710
applying the the fact that we need

7
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:22,020
better situational awareness in the

8
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:23,880
operation space which is where it came

9
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:28,050
up with the the boa terminology and I

10
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:29,519
personally think this is the biggest

11
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:31,560
challenge that we have facing ICS is a

12
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:33,239
lack of operational where that's what I

13
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:35,160
mean but by that is just a holistic

14
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,630
understanding of what's going on on our

15
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:38,969
networks we have a tendency now to be

16
00:00:38,969 --> 00:00:41,879
forced to use technology that we don't

17
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:43,140
really have a saying you know our cars

18
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:44,460
are more sophisticated than they've ever

19
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:47,070
been if you have a fault we don't really

20
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:48,719
know we can't troubleshoot it it's not

21
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:50,129
like the good old days used to be able

22
00:00:50,129 --> 00:00:52,590
to lift up the hood and take a look and

23
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:53,940
roll up your sleeves and get at it you

24
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:55,170
just can't do that anymore so we're

25
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:56,940
increasingly forced to use technology

26
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:58,680
more and as we do we have less

27
00:00:58,680 --> 00:00:59,910
understanding of what it is we're doing

28
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:04,019
so with that I also wanted to to

29
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:05,939
highlight here that there's been a

30
00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:09,900
number of discussions leading up to and

31
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:12,540
including s4 today regarding deep packet

32
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:15,030
inspection so much so that even Bernie

33
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:17,430
Sanders was forced to bring a giant

34
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:19,830
cardboard cutout of one-a-day LPS and

35
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:22,799
sweets specifically talking about dpi so

36
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:25,860
it's obviously a very hot topic and

37
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:27,900
we're going to continue that theme and

38
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:29,009
give you a little bit of a sense of what

39
00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:32,820
dpi is from from our perspective so a

40
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:34,560
little bit about me my name is matt cail

41
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,920
I'm with a company called ultra 3e TI

42
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:39,000
you could probably tell from my accent

43
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,590
I'm based out of the Chicago area from

44
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:45,000
the Midwest via the UK and I've been

45
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,990
doing automation in some capacity for at

46
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:51,180
least 15 years starting as an embedded

47
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:52,829
engineer working my way up through

48
00:01:52,829 --> 00:01:55,110
manufacturing also in sales and support

49
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:57,689
and systems integration so I've got a

50
00:01:57,689 --> 00:01:59,490
fairly good holistic view of things and

51
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:01,680
it's been interesting to see where we've

52
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,479
been with cyber security regarding the

53
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:07,049
space and I'm excited by the hope that

54
00:02:07,049 --> 00:02:11,099
we have here at s4 this year ultra 3ti

55
00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:13,349
quick quick introduction to us so 3ci

56
00:02:13,349 --> 00:02:13,980
you may never

57
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:16,410
of us it's a very cryptic name it's kind

58
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:17,760
of a memorable or forgettable name

59
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:18,959
depending how you want to look at it but

60
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:22,110
heavily we got a lot of history in the

61
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:24,480
DoD in government space so if you're in

62
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,250
the ot ICS space you never heard of

63
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:29,519
ultra 3ti that's probably why but I am

64
00:02:29,519 --> 00:02:32,099
here solely for this dis purpose so I

65
00:02:32,099 --> 00:02:34,500
have no DoD or federal experience

66
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,269
although that is the core of our

67
00:02:36,269 --> 00:02:38,130
business but really the key takeaway

68
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:40,590
there is that we've been entrusted to

69
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:42,599
work with very high-risk very high

70
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:46,290
criticality criticality networks and and

71
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:48,870
that applies to obviously the space in

72
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:50,069
which we're talking at and presented

73
00:02:50,069 --> 00:02:52,260
today so we're going to talk a little

74
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:54,810
bit about ot anomaly detection again

75
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:56,310
there's another buzzword a lot of hype

76
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:57,900
around that and we're going to then

77
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:00,420
factor in how dpi technology deep packet

78
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:02,940
inspection technology applies into the

79
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:05,519
IOT space looking at some some examples

80
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,319
of that some application instances and

81
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:08,910
then we're going to just do a little bit

82
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:10,470
of a commercial for the cyber fence

83
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:12,209
product which is ultimately what this is

84
00:03:12,209 --> 00:03:15,049
here under the sponsor stage pretense so

85
00:03:15,049 --> 00:03:18,389
if you is anyone doing the s4 CTF in

86
00:03:18,389 --> 00:03:21,030
here I imagine if you were you'd be up

87
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:23,040
there now card we've got one one little

88
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,880
hands so there might be some CTF clues

89
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,769
towards the end of the presentation so

90
00:03:28,769 --> 00:03:31,109
there's a little incentive to stay even

91
00:03:31,109 --> 00:03:32,750
if I'm kind of dragging on a little bit

92
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:36,030
all right so I personally believe that

93
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:38,130
today's biggest OT challenge as I said

94
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:40,200
before is ultimately a lack of

95
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,269
understanding and the threes here that I

96
00:03:42,269 --> 00:03:43,530
have the lack of monitoring and

97
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:45,510
understanding of normal conditions to be

98
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:47,700
able to discern abnormal we do not know

99
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:49,380
what normal looks like therefore we

100
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:50,940
cannot know what abnormal looks like are

101
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:52,440
we looking if we are looking are we

102
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:58,739
looking enough so I've broken this down

103
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:02,340
into ot and anomalies into three

104
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:04,470
classifications the first one is system

105
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:05,880
anomalies and what I mean by that is

106
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:08,430
really the things that an operator can

107
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:10,650
detect the overall system is running

108
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:13,079
right because certain amount of widgets

109
00:04:13,079 --> 00:04:14,280
are coming out at the rate you would

110
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,918
expect them to or the blend looks right

111
00:04:16,918 --> 00:04:18,630
or in the case of DuPont you know the

112
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:21,418
color of white looks white as we had

113
00:04:21,418 --> 00:04:23,760
earlier on you may get some deviations

114
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,530
maybe like something doesn't sound right

115
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:27,060
and operators like

116
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:28,980
normally this doesn't make that sound or

117
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:30,720
this smell and those are some things

118
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,220
that you can detect that potentially

119
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:34,740
there's a system-wide anomaly ultimately

120
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:37,260
though system anomalies I classify as

121
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:42,630
human detectable anomaly you know a good

122
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:44,250
example of that could be you know the

123
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:47,310
plumbing in your in your home something

124
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:50,250
goes bad you smell it if you had the

125
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:52,050
ability to see in the pipe you could

126
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:53,070
have maybe done some sort of

127
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:54,810
preventative maintenance but unless

128
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:56,130
you're looking you don't know and it's

129
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:57,870
usually catastrophic once something

130
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:59,910
happens the other classification here I

131
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:02,850
have our network anomaly so has our

132
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:04,710
network changed have we got a new

133
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:06,780
topology have we got a new device our

134
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:09,750
new devices talking to each other that

135
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,760
they weren't before and if they are what

136
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,410
type of communications exists between

137
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:16,229
those devices so data flow data type and

138
00:05:16,229 --> 00:05:17,850
also data frequency how often are they

139
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:19,500
talking are we seeing a denial of

140
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,810
service type approach here and then the

141
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:23,130
third classification have a device

142
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:25,740
anomalies so something at the very end

143
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:28,020
is not working right maybe it's a fault

144
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:30,570
maybe the configuration has been changed

145
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:32,550
maybe the firmware has been updated and

146
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:35,039
now we're getting unexpected behavior or

147
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:36,300
maybe there was a new application

148
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:37,800
installed in the case of a host based

149
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,960
system so those are the three types of

150
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,940
anomaly that I tend to define and we've

151
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:43,919
got Network anomalies and asset device

152
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:45,900
anomalies and to me these are the ones

153
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,610
that you can detect these are the ones

154
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:49,710
you can be active in understanding and

155
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:52,260
from those baselines you can then start

156
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:56,690
to detect abnormal from normal

157
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,240
and the other thing I was going to say

158
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,750
is that armed with regard to anomalies

159
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:09,510
in my experience when we look at control

160
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:11,070
systems networks especially in a

161
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:12,480
troubleshooting capacity one of the

162
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,710
first things you ask for as a network

163
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:15,180
map can I get a network map or network

164
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:17,400
block diagram or something how many of

165
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:20,790
you find that that's easy to get and for

166
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:22,620
the record I see no hands but I also

167
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:25,530
kind of blinded here so I would agree

168
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:27,180
with that the amount of times I've asked

169
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:29,400
what I consider relatively trivial data

170
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,590
to help me in my job to troubleshoot is

171
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:34,140
seldom available so if we don't even

172
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:35,580
have that level of understanding of our

173
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:38,010
networks we definitely have a long order

174
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:39,390
to be able to detect these these

175
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:44,030
sophisticated anomalies all right so I'm

176
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:46,080
having a deep understanding of your

177
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,060
control systems is key to detecting

178
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:49,590
anomalies and you can see where we're

179
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:52,860
starting to go now so moving on I think

180
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:54,630
we all know this I'm sure this is

181
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:56,010
preaching to the choir but it's worth

182
00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:57,630
going through some of these just to make

183
00:06:57,630 --> 00:06:59,190
sure that rule in agreement so these are

184
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:01,340
some of the key attributes that I find

185
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:03,870
significant or poignant regarding ot

186
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:06,570
systems so messages tend to be sent in

187
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:08,490
clear text and bonus points for anyone

188
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:10,350
who can tell me what that message little

189
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:11,730
snippet is there in the top right-hand

190
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:13,880
corner

191
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:20,070
it's a Modbus 1-6 so I think that's a

192
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:23,340
right multiple I'm not sure anyway click

193
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:25,350
messages are sent in clear text also

194
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:26,880
there's typically no authentication so

195
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,800
there's no validation that you are who

196
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,180
you say you are and therefore I can

197
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:33,690
trust you typically there's no integrity

198
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:35,790
checking so if I send the message I just

199
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:37,020
trust that once it's gone on the wire

200
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:39,000
it's good I'm assuming that it's got

201
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,200
there and I'm assuming that it's got

202
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,700
there in the same way in which I sent it

203
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:43,860
you also tend to get more complex

204
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:45,750
protocol design so any one dealt with

205
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:49,350
the mp3 here ok if you do then you'll

206
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:50,460
start to appreciate some of the

207
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:52,260
complexities of how complex protocols

208
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:54,210
can be don't gauge industrial controls

209
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:56,120
protocols by Modbus TCP

210
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:58,590
also we don't see lightweight and NICs

211
00:07:58,590 --> 00:08:00,630
so you have an embedded device and you

212
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:02,190
put some sort of NIC in it and it has

213
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:04,680
some relatively light resource

214
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,510
capabilities in terms of what it can do

215
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:08,490
we've also seen a trend for poorly

216
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:12,050
implemented protocol stacks and also

217
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:14,550
there's a it's not uncommon for us to

218
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:16,740
yet the standard protocols we expect as

219
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:18,360
well as some we don't expect some

220
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,610
proprietary protocols so my device talks

221
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:22,740
Modbus but it's also doing a couple of

222
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:24,930
other vendor things that allow me to do

223
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:26,870
uploads and downloads and so on

224
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:30,110
also you tend to get numerous insecure

225
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:32,400
interfaces and when I prefer to insecure

226
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,559
interfaces I'm speaking specifically

227
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:37,799
about HTTP SNMP telnet we've heard about

228
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:38,970
that today especially if you're in

229
00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:41,340
Chris's trunk session obviously

230
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:43,350
increased in tech interconnectivity and

231
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:45,780
as a result of that a lot of business

232
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:47,550
needs driving that interconnectivity

233
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:49,620
without really understanding the risks

234
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:52,020
and I think the best example of that is

235
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:53,910
the Murai botnet or any botnet that

236
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:55,860
we've heard about today where a series

237
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:57,480
of embedded devices have been thrown out

238
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,280
there they've got the technology in to

239
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:01,350
do it but they aren't secure and there's

240
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:03,120
a certain risk associated with that and

241
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,990
also poor poor bounce checks ics-cert

242
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:09,210
had a statistic on I believe 30 percent

243
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:10,410
of the vulnerabilities that they

244
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:12,690
reported were a result of poor bounce

245
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:15,300
checking in the encoding it's also

246
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:18,960
important to note that IT systems are

247
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:21,930
very unpredictable there's a lot of user

248
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:23,910
variation there which requires a lot

249
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:26,280
more sophisticated anomaly detection ot

250
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,410
is less so right ot is fairly stable

251
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:30,480
fairly fairly repeatable fairly

252
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,940
predictable and obviously we are

253
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:34,560
challenged with very long life cycles

254
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,850
these things that you can't just go and

255
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:37,410
flip a switch change something out and I

256
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:40,140
would go up and set it up again so would

257
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:41,100
we all tend to agree with those

258
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:43,380
attributes anything there that anyone

259
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:46,980
disagrees with ok so that's it's that

260
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:48,300
the playing field for where we're going

261
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:51,890
with this so as a result of those

262
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:54,930
behaviors we have this insecure by

263
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:57,330
design technology and as a result of

264
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:58,620
that their inherent vulnerabilities that

265
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:01,020
we have to contend with specifically

266
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:02,100
sniffing and eavesdropping

267
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:04,080
we've got messages and clear text that

268
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,970
means we are also vulnerable to manage

269
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:06,720
middle attacks

270
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,660
we also are vulnerable to unauthorized

271
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:12,330
changes or commands as well as spoofing

272
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:14,490
corruption denial of service these are

273
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:16,050
all things that we have to contend with

274
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:17,610
as attack vectors but ultimately it ends

275
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:20,490
up with the device being owned here's a

276
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:22,980
practical example very very

277
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:25,020
unsophisticated demonstration here with

278
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:26,640
some very crude animation but we've got

279
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,810
a PLC that

280
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:30,330
talking to a VFD which runs a motor as

281
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:31,830
part of a very critical process and

282
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:33,570
there's an HMI is the window into the

283
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:36,120
system so this motor has the capacity in

284
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:40,410
this scenario to go 0 to 100,000 rpm but

285
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:42,690
the process requires you to only ever go

286
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:46,110
as high as 63 thousand rpm so the HMI we

287
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:48,510
code the HMI we set limits to that so

288
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:49,920
the operator can only set a value

289
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,830
between 0 and 63,000 additionally if we

290
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:55,080
want to put another error another bounce

291
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,730
check we can put it in the PLC and that

292
00:10:56,730 --> 00:10:58,860
also says you can only go between 0 and

293
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:02,760
63,000 however the message from the do I

294
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,110
have a laser here the message from here

295
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:06,240
to here because there's no integrity

296
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,450
check in once if somebody else comes in

297
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:11,460
here and they're unauthenticated and

298
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:12,720
they send a different command they are

299
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,310
not held to those same bounce checks

300
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:16,560
that you have in the PLC or the HMI so

301
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,200
now we've just told our VFD to go what

302
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,200
did I say 83 85 thousand rpm which puts

303
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,970
us into the danger zone and boom we've

304
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:25,410
ended up with some physical

305
00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:27,570
manifestation of our process bonus

306
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:29,940
points for anyone who gets the

307
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:34,410
references to 85,000 rpm and 63,000 rpm

308
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:39,089
specifically really Stuxnet reference

309
00:11:39,089 --> 00:11:43,440
all right all right ok and because this

310
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,820
is a network level discussion it

311
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:45,660
wouldn't be complete without some

312
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:48,240
reference to the OSI 7 layer model so we

313
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,400
have our OSI 7 layer model I'm not going

314
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,960
to go into specific detail to that or

315
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:54,510
into the tcp/ip model but the reason I'm

316
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:56,520
going to highlight this is this

317
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,800
identifies the layers of the protocol

318
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,990
stack which the devices specifically are

319
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:02,520
looking at so in the case of standard

320
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:04,890
firewalls staple files tend to look at

321
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:06,780
the IP layer and they look at a TCP

322
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:08,760
layer agreed and then perhaps the Mac

323
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:11,070
layer as well where we're going with

324
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:13,500
this those deep packet inspection or

325
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:16,200
application aware firewalls need to look

326
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,700
at the whole thing they need to be able

327
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:20,190
to digest not just the headers right the

328
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:22,230
way down into the data payload and make

329
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:24,810
some decisions based upon that so where

330
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:25,860
I'm going with this is the application

331
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:28,709
layer content is the most important

332
00:12:28,709 --> 00:12:30,630
content in that message that is the

333
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:33,089
stuff that defines your process so this

334
00:12:33,089 --> 00:12:38,850
is the most risk this is the content

335
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:40,780
that could have most adverse in

336
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:45,460
to your control system so what do these

337
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:47,350
represent in the real world we here's

338
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:50,620
commands we here application Modbus TCP

339
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:52,690
payloads it for example but what this

340
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:55,060
actually relates to in the real world is

341
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:56,680
really what ties us all together this is

342
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:57,820
the part that should be the most

343
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:00,400
alarming this ultimately defines the set

344
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,410
points your set points for your process

345
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:04,150
could be temperature flow pressure I've

346
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:06,130
given some examples there it could also

347
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:08,200
be the process variable the vet the

348
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,030
actual value that I'm reading from my

349
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:12,970
process back it could also be alarm

350
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:15,010
limits the alarm limits that define our

351
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:17,110
safe zone and if we go outside of that

352
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:20,020
we end up in an unsafe situation they

353
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:21,850
also represent the digital inputs and

354
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:24,070
outputs coming from various sensors or

355
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:27,910
going to various actuators also analog

356
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:30,400
inputs and outputs and also the device

357
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,470
mode so these are all very important

358
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:34,360
parameters when you break them down into

359
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:37,650
what they mean in your in your process

360
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:40,600
so as I say there this represents way

361
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,940
too much risk for us not to take this

362
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:47,790
seriously and take an effort to secure

363
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:53,260
here are some examples of taking that

364
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:55,360
and applying it to actual data sheets so

365
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:59,200
in this case here this is a tamper proof

366
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:02,230
thing that you can access and remember

367
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:03,790
this is in clear text with no

368
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:05,740
authentication so if I want to turn off

369
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:08,500
my tamper I can do so same thing here

370
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:11,620
with with VFD speed references with

371
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:14,650
alarm masking so I can mask alarms again

372
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:18,600
unauthenticated an author an encrypted

373
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:22,530
values here on my VFD again they can

374
00:14:22,530 --> 00:14:24,820
control access control so in the case of

375
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:26,890
BACnet you may have your door access

376
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:28,900
control system side to that so i can

377
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:32,470
open my door through that i've got speed

378
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:34,210
reference again there so these are

379
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:35,830
actual and this one I put up I thought

380
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:36,580
this is interesting

381
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:38,590
go to emergency mode I don't know what

382
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:40,750
that means but if I can block go to

383
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:42,550
emergency mode when it's emergency I'm

384
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:43,870
guessing it's probably going to have

385
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:47,350
some pretty bad outcome all right so now

386
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:49,720
we've set the table as to where we're

387
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,220
going with this we talked about ot

388
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:54,080
anomalies we talked about the value of

389
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:57,140
of starting to pause that content what

390
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:58,250
that can mean in the real world and

391
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:00,260
here's where dpi technology starts to be

392
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:02,390
explained so what do we get with deep

393
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:05,300
packet inspection technology so first

394
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:07,490
thing is you get way more enhanced

395
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:09,380
visibility of the interactions between

396
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:11,600
your devices so you're now not just

397
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,640
looking at the header information you

398
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:15,440
are looking at the command that's being

399
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,480
sent the value that you are telling

400
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:19,550
something to be so I'm setting a set

401
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:21,110
point and I'm setting it to this value

402
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:22,850
you get much greater visibility of that

403
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:25,820
operational visibility you also now

404
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:27,440
because you have access to that and a

405
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,760
visibility of that you can start to

406
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:31,040
enforce those rules down to the command

407
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,050
and value level and you can start to

408
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:34,550
enforce a policy that's more consistent

409
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:36,740
with your process so you know what your

410
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:38,690
process shouldn't shouldn't do you know

411
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:40,910
the tolerances you can now start to lock

412
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:44,000
those down at the network layer you also

413
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,440
have the option to lock down now

414
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,410
specific functions that you don't use so

415
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:50,660
when I have a Modbus capable device I

416
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:52,100
keep going back to my bus but I wanted

417
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:53,149
to be able to read from it

418
00:15:53,149 --> 00:15:54,589
I want lock everything else down and a

419
00:15:54,589 --> 00:15:56,390
great example of that is up in the CTF

420
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:57,560
which I talked a little bit about later

421
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:59,630
on where we're using cyber fence to do

422
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:01,190
that we've set certain rules you can get

423
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:02,839
access and certain commands and lockdown

424
00:16:02,839 --> 00:16:04,880
you don't necessarily need all of your

425
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,290
commands open just because they are

426
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:07,880
there and the endpoint doesn't usually

427
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,610
give you that option to shut that down

428
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:12,940
we now also have the ability to detect

429
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:15,110
configuration changes or firmware

430
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:16,910
changes that may take place at that

431
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:19,250
endpoint that is stuff that's usually

432
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:20,810
exercised over the network I want to do

433
00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:22,130
a firmware update I'd do it over the

434
00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:23,480
network I want to make a configuration

435
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:24,980
change I'd do it over the network so now

436
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:27,589
I have the ability to lock that down as

437
00:16:27,589 --> 00:16:27,980
well

438
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:32,089
I also this is this is a shocker to a

439
00:16:32,089 --> 00:16:34,100
lot of IT guys but the validation of

440
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:37,610
messages you can send a malformed packet

441
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:39,440
to certain devices and I won't name

442
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,720
anyone specifically where it will cause

443
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,610
an out of bounds scenario and that

444
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:45,170
device will just lock up just because

445
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:46,970
you send it the wrong packet I think one

446
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:48,350
of the guys that presented earlier was

447
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:50,269
referencing I think of seán MacBride was

448
00:16:50,269 --> 00:16:52,550
referencing the the URL frosty of the

449
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:54,740
cyber expertise folks just taking a

450
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:57,260
specific HTTP command and sending it and

451
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:58,970
that just bricks the device or cause to

452
00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:02,209
some outcome so actually that validating

453
00:17:02,209 --> 00:17:04,369
that message per the protocol standards

454
00:17:04,369 --> 00:17:06,380
can be sounds very trivial but it's

455
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:07,440
actually very important

456
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:10,859
we now also set a limitation the

457
00:17:10,859 --> 00:17:12,540
messages and commands to prevent unsafe

458
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:14,790
scenarios so we are stopping the

459
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:17,010
potential insider or the inadvertent

460
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:18,510
operator making a mistake because they

461
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:19,859
are bound to that lis or they are unable

462
00:17:19,859 --> 00:17:22,319
to do that which obviously limits the

463
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:24,300
limits the impact of sensory human error

464
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:27,180
and other key things with DPI they've

465
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:28,470
got to be passive it's got to be a

466
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:30,300
passive implementation that has no

467
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:31,650
interruption to existing systems

468
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:33,540
obviously change management is a big

469
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:36,090
thing in OT we don't want to have to go

470
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:37,710
through this whole of Boreas exercise to

471
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:39,480
do something and break something so

472
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,620
we've got to have a passive

473
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:42,450
implementation and reduce the risk of

474
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:43,500
interrupting something that's already

475
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,600
running and ultimately what this gives

476
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,520
you is a holistic baseline of your

477
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,380
application so you now understand

478
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:51,360
everything what who's talking of what

479
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,040
what are they saying what's being said

480
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:58,280
how often is it being said ok so DPI

481
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:00,930
essentially validates and enforces the

482
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:04,520
control operation as it was designed

483
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:07,370
here's a common ot architecture

484
00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:09,960
referencing the Purdue Purdue model here

485
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,820
so I think we'd all agree that we've got

486
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:14,400
level zero here with our sensors and

487
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,590
actuators which are then wired into some

488
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:18,420
sort of appliance I've got a VFD here in

489
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:20,820
some PLC's and these are usually network

490
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:22,920
capable and they talk up to our host

491
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,480
stations where we run the software to

492
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,130
manage these and supervise these and

493
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:27,930
take it even further where we can start

494
00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:31,460
to manage that at much larger scale

495
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:34,260
what I'm going to focus on here is this

496
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:36,030
point this point to me is the most

497
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:38,310
important piece of the pie here this is

498
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:40,410
where our electronic communications

499
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:43,500
networks become physical so if we can

500
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,150
control this and have better

501
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:46,740
understanding and awareness at this

502
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:49,050
level we've got much bit greater chance

503
00:18:49,050 --> 00:18:51,000
of managing these here now you could

504
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,560
argue if you've got physical access to

505
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,720
this you could Jam a wrench in the gears

506
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,840
or you could cut the wires on the motor

507
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,940
or do something or short out the switch

508
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:01,500
if you've got physical access all bets

509
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,690
are off but this is the point from a

510
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:05,610
network standpoint that you want to have

511
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:07,230
the most enforcement of your control in

512
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:11,190
my in my philosophy so I'm talking here

513
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:12,720
about deep packet inspection I've talked

514
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,670
about Modbus a couple times I'm going to

515
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:16,500
now start to apply what that deep

516
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:19,140
awareness gives you in the context of

517
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:20,640
different protocols so in the case of

518
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,270
mod by

519
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:22,890
you've heard me say about function codes

520
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:24,420
and register numbers and data note

521
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:26,670
addresses these are all parameters in a

522
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:29,340
standard Modbus data exchange and then

523
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:31,440
ethernet/ip same kind of thing but

524
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,180
different language they now refer to

525
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:35,820
more of an object instant class model

526
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:39,540
with attribute IDs and then data dnp3

527
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:41,430
again the language changes a little bit

528
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:43,500
but you've got addresses objects you've

529
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:44,670
got different messaging different

530
00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:46,590
function codes then same again with

531
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:48,690
BACnet so the common theme here is that

532
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:50,340
you start to see that there are commands

533
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:52,110
and values which are essentially defined

534
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:53,820
in different ways but they are the core

535
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:55,800
the core of what our process is doing

536
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:58,560
here now the other thing I'm going to

537
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,510
throw out there is how many of you think

538
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:02,400
there's a skills gap in our in our

539
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,490
industry yeah I see a few hands I would

540
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:07,020
agree with that so we already have this

541
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:08,550
skills gap and now there's this English

542
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:10,440
guide via Chicago standing on a stage

543
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,030
saying we need to look deeper we need to

544
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:14,070
be able to understand and manage this so

545
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:16,320
the key part of this is that we do have

546
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,480
a skills gap we recognize that the

547
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,460
managing and enforcement of this has to

548
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:22,470
be done in somewhat of an easy manner I

549
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:26,220
think we don't agree with that and many

550
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:28,620
of us use dpi Wireshark I think is the

551
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:31,920
best free tool that I use on it well not

552
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,780
daily basis but a common basis and

553
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:35,670
essentially we're already doing that

554
00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:37,260
with our dissectors so if you break open

555
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:40,890
a message here we've got a Modbus read

556
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:43,020
function register you look at it from a

557
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:45,030
layer 2 perspective you look at it from

558
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:46,800
a layer 3 perspective these are all

559
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,030
things that we can do with standard

560
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:49,620
firewalls and then we start to break it

561
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:51,690
down layer 4 again for ports and now we

562
00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:53,070
start getting to the application

563
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:54,660
specific content and I love these

564
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:56,280
dissectors because it now tells me that

565
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:58,260
I've got to read register at this

566
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:00,660
address 8,000 with a word count of 1

567
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:02,820
otherwise I've got to start looking in

568
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:04,740
here and deciphering that like I showed

569
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:06,270
on the previous slide so we're already

570
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:08,430
using it we already value that to some

571
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:12,030
capacity dpi as I said before it's the

572
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:14,370
new the new buzzword even Bernese

573
00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:16,890
getting on the on the case and in

574
00:21:16,890 --> 00:21:18,090
addition to that we're getting a lot of

575
00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:20,790
other pretty exciting acronyms next

576
00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:22,980
generation firewalls next generation

577
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:25,490
antivirus next generation blank or

578
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:27,960
something as a service you know we're

579
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:30,120
talking now like even Sox as a service

580
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:32,400
or NOx as a service I don't know if

581
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,960
that's even an acronym yet but there are

582
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,010
a lot of as a server

583
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:37,380
type things you can subscribe to the key

584
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:38,610
thing I want to point out here is that

585
00:21:38,610 --> 00:21:40,260
just because somebody says they have

586
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:42,840
deep packet inspection it's on you to

587
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,940
understand what that means because not

588
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:46,980
all deep packet inspection is equal and

589
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:48,690
it's one of those terms it's going to be

590
00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:53,580
thrown out there a lot now okay so

591
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:55,860
here's what three tea eyes position is

592
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:58,290
regarding dpi for ot this is how we

593
00:21:58,290 --> 00:22:00,480
define it the solution obviously should

594
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,190
be designed for the ot environment and

595
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:03,900
as I showed you before in the Purdue

596
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:06,240
model where we think the most hardening

597
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,510
is required is done at that level one

598
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:10,530
that's where it should be designed for

599
00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:11,820
it should be designed to reside there

600
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:14,010
should have a din rail mount it should

601
00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:16,680
be powered accordingly 24 volt DC s

602
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,510
typical should add the noise and

603
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:21,780
environmental specs example it also

604
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:24,000
needs to have full ot protocol awareness

605
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,140
and what I mean by that is not just

606
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:26,970
looking for signatures don't just try to

607
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:28,740
do pattern matching on a signature it

608
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:30,300
needs to understand the protocol and as

609
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:31,590
these protocols become more and more

610
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:33,660
complex there's more requirement for us

611
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:35,010
to do that because the sequencing of

612
00:22:35,010 --> 00:22:37,650
those protocols becomes key also it

613
00:22:37,650 --> 00:22:39,060
should enforce some sort of packet

614
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:40,830
validation it should know the standard

615
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:42,630
it should know what's expected it should

616
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:44,790
know what an illegal message looks like

617
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:46,620
or a malformed packet looks like it

618
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:47,880
should give you the ability to recognize

619
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,950
that and just drop it you know in a case

620
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:51,450
of an Ethernet frame when you get a

621
00:22:51,450 --> 00:22:54,540
malformed packet why process it if it's

622
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:58,080
if it's just garbage at a minimum it

623
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,030
should support the parsing of industrial

624
00:23:00,030 --> 00:23:03,360
protocols commands so read write is

625
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,010
typically what it boils down to in some

626
00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:08,220
sort of capacity it also should have the

627
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:10,970
ability to give you visibility into

628
00:23:10,970 --> 00:23:13,620
non-standard ot messages and I'm going

629
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:15,180
to talk a little bit about that in a few

630
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:17,490
slides from here but we give you the

631
00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:19,260
ability we support a number of protocols

632
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:21,450
we tell you right off the bat Modbus TCP

633
00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:24,750
OPC Ethernet IP dnp3 BACnet well what

634
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:27,180
about something else well we give you a

635
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:29,220
way that you can process that what if

636
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:31,290
the device has some hidden interface so

637
00:23:31,290 --> 00:23:32,730
that you can do firmware updates and you

638
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:34,230
want to lock that down well if we are

639
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:36,360
able to pause the packet just because we

640
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:37,710
don't have a standard interface for it

641
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:39,780
doesn't mean we can't implement some

642
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:42,090
sort of rules on that it should have a

643
00:23:42,090 --> 00:23:43,830
passive implementation as I said before

644
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:45,750
it shouldn't have any impact to your

645
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:48,150
existing ot system

646
00:23:48,150 --> 00:23:51,610
no latency or minimal latency on that

647
00:23:51,610 --> 00:23:52,870
which is a challenge because you've got

648
00:23:52,870 --> 00:23:56,110
to process a lot of data on the fly you

649
00:23:56,110 --> 00:23:57,580
should also have the ability to

650
00:23:57,580 --> 00:23:59,800
timestamp and log events to some sort of

651
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:02,260
central clock and I know that Krista

652
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:04,450
Strunk is a big advocate of network

653
00:24:04,450 --> 00:24:06,310
security monitoring and being able to

654
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:08,560
tie Network specific events to

655
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:10,330
real-world events is a pretty big deal

656
00:24:10,330 --> 00:24:12,040
so having that to a centralized clock is

657
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:16,270
huge it also needs to allow for a way

658
00:24:16,270 --> 00:24:18,940
for the OT engineer to implement his

659
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:21,550
baseline easily as we said before as a

660
00:24:21,550 --> 00:24:23,290
skills gap there's a lot of complexity

661
00:24:23,290 --> 00:24:24,730
we're rolling into here there's got to

662
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:26,710
be a way that you can essentially learn

663
00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:29,020
the network present it in a summary that

664
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:30,970
you can now make informed decisions as

665
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:33,970
to what rules you need to enforce there

666
00:24:33,970 --> 00:24:35,740
also needs to be a way to test it with

667
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:37,420
confidence that it's not going to have

668
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:39,310
an immediate impact with false positives

669
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:40,660
on your system you need to be able to

670
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:44,590
test it in a non-invasive way we also

671
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:46,480
believe that the events that you get

672
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,340
from this deep packet inspection need to

673
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:50,620
be meaningful it can't just say instance

674
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:52,540
X objects something something it needs

675
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:54,910
to pertain to the real world what does

676
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:56,410
that mean to the person who's going to

677
00:24:56,410 --> 00:24:58,830
see that alarm show up on its screen and

678
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:02,620
you really need to deploy dpi as part of

679
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:04,120
a white listing strategy so that's not

680
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:06,070
anything I mentioned so far but the key

681
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:07,870
parts of deep packet inspection in my

682
00:25:07,870 --> 00:25:10,150
mind is that you whitelist the known

683
00:25:10,150 --> 00:25:12,100
good and you assume everything else is

684
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:16,210
bad network security monitors I

685
00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:17,710
mentioned for I know Sistrunk is a big

686
00:25:17,710 --> 00:25:20,110
advocate for NSM and there's even a

687
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:22,750
Twitter handle dedicated to ICS NSM if

688
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:24,610
you haven't seen that but it's hugely

689
00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:26,740
important that the whole network

690
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:29,020
security monitoring there so anyone

691
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:31,360
recognized the the eyeball of supply

692
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:35,260
went too far bro yeah good we got some

693
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:37,600
bros in the house so referencing bro

694
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,820
there obviously it's hugely important

695
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:41,170
NSF does give you the ability to start

696
00:25:41,170 --> 00:25:43,060
doing deep packet inspection as well it

697
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:45,160
tends to be a centralized point you need

698
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:47,080
to get that data to it and that's not

699
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:49,120
trivial the amount of networks that I've

700
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,410
had to troubleshoot which are all

701
00:25:50,410 --> 00:25:52,390
unmanaged switches that bodes for a

702
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:54,490
pretty complex situation now if I want

703
00:25:54,490 --> 00:25:56,410
to get NSF deployed I've got to now

704
00:25:56,410 --> 00:25:59,980
update autumn and your spam pot or I got

705
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:01,540
to implement the tap either way I've got

706
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:01,770
a

707
00:26:01,770 --> 00:26:03,300
make my network to do that and invasive

708
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:06,140
systems better implement that

709
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:09,990
NSM tends to be passive and really all

710
00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:12,210
it does is just tell you when bad

711
00:26:12,210 --> 00:26:14,850
anomalies or some sort of anomaly has

712
00:26:14,850 --> 00:26:16,680
occurred it doesn't give you the ability

713
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,780
to block it or stop it unless you start

714
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:21,570
going to more of an IPS approach so NSM

715
00:26:21,570 --> 00:26:24,000
really is an awareness which is great we

716
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,410
need it because we don't have it I think

717
00:26:25,410 --> 00:26:26,700
there's an absent definitely in that

718
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:29,130
need for that but understand that the

719
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:32,160
important aspect of NSM is how you

720
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,990
respond to that you've got to have an

721
00:26:33,990 --> 00:26:35,640
incident response plan that's Swift and

722
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:40,830
knows what to do and if you were in my

723
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:42,960
croissant a session earlier and he was

724
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,760
talking about passive operators you

725
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:47,130
understand it that that's a problem so

726
00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:48,420
I'm not going to spend too much time

727
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:50,700
talking about this but this is based

728
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:53,640
upon the ICS kill chain from Lockheed

729
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:55,680
mine but we we know we've learned this

730
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:58,290
from attacks we've seen high-profile

731
00:26:58,290 --> 00:26:59,940
attacks it starts with some sort of

732
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:02,280
reconnaissance with open-source

733
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:04,530
intelligence you then weaponize your

734
00:27:04,530 --> 00:27:07,140
delivery you get it into the system

735
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:09,420
usually with a sophisticated social

736
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:10,980
engineering attack of Spearfish of some

737
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:13,110
kind or in the case of Stuxnet we know

738
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:15,300
that USB in the case of target with

739
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:17,100
infected laptops or a number examples of

740
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:19,290
that then you exploit the host you

741
00:27:19,290 --> 00:27:20,730
install your malware you maintain

742
00:27:20,730 --> 00:27:22,380
outside control and then you do the bad

743
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:24,660
stuff this is what you do and when I say

744
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:26,670
bad stuff what you tend to do is you try

745
00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:29,430
to get a PC that's at level 2 an

746
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:31,410
engineering workstation is the is the

747
00:27:31,410 --> 00:27:33,770
keys to the city it's dual honed it

748
00:27:33,770 --> 00:27:36,240
traverses the control network to the

749
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,790
corporate network once you get to there

750
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:40,740
you can then escalate your privileges

751
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:42,690
and then do what you need to do that's

752
00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:44,760
that's the modus operandi that we've

753
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:49,200
typically seen so bad guy comes in he

754
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,030
gets the level 2 he compromises the

755
00:27:51,030 --> 00:27:52,890
engineering workstation now he can do

756
00:27:52,890 --> 00:27:55,560
some bad stuff or we bring in the

757
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:58,740
malware or whatever it is via sneaking

758
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:00,720
it come on a USB Drive and infected

759
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,480
laptop could even be an implant of some

760
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:05,820
kind I don't know how much reassurance

761
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:08,430
you have with your supply chain but how

762
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:10,410
do you know what you're getting is truly

763
00:28:10,410 --> 00:28:12,390
untampered and what it's exposed to be

764
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:15,450
there was a black hat presentation in

765
00:28:15,450 --> 00:28:17,639
fifteen of a guy that took a wireless

766
00:28:17,639 --> 00:28:20,340
module and overlaid it to a Siemens IO

767
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:22,559
and even though the Siemens controller

768
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:25,200
was turning the i/o in case of an output

769
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,929
turning output on or off he had wireless

770
00:28:27,929 --> 00:28:29,970
ability to override that there was no

771
00:28:29,970 --> 00:28:31,919
contention he was upstream of a resistor

772
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:33,360
allowed him to do that and you wouldn't

773
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,590
know you look at the box and you'd never

774
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:38,100
know there was anything inside of it and

775
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:39,779
then the third example yet we got here

776
00:28:39,779 --> 00:28:41,639
could be a wireless attack vector either

777
00:28:41,639 --> 00:28:43,679
way you want to get to level two that's

778
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:45,330
where you can do your bad stuff to work

779
00:28:45,330 --> 00:28:47,039
your way down to the physical layer so

780
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:51,990
that's the the typical approach and what

781
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:55,139
we're recommending is a solution called

782
00:28:55,139 --> 00:28:57,330
cyber fence there is a product outside

783
00:28:57,330 --> 00:28:59,370
we will also have the Cabana tomorrow

784
00:28:59,370 --> 00:29:01,380
and it is a deep packet inspection

785
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:03,480
capable appliance that is really

786
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:06,210
designed to sit here between level 1 and

787
00:29:06,210 --> 00:29:08,730
level 2 or again it could be at level 2

788
00:29:08,730 --> 00:29:10,980
level 3 but really I think this is where

789
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:12,600
the value proposition makes most sense

790
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,639
it's designed for this environment it

791
00:29:14,639 --> 00:29:18,149
can protect one or many devices and you

792
00:29:18,149 --> 00:29:19,620
would deploy this as part of a white

793
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:21,389
listing policy so you understand what

794
00:29:21,389 --> 00:29:22,889
normal communications looks like between

795
00:29:22,889 --> 00:29:25,889
here and now you've got your your your

796
00:29:25,889 --> 00:29:28,740
internal perimeter between that the

797
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:29,669
other thing that's pretty cool about

798
00:29:29,669 --> 00:29:31,740
cyber fence is it has a number of ports

799
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:33,870
on it one of which can be dedicated to

800
00:29:33,870 --> 00:29:37,500
management and/or monitoring so I can

801
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:40,590
now take that port out to my external

802
00:29:40,590 --> 00:29:43,260
software we saw clarity talking I know

803
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:44,549
the cyber X is here you're probably

804
00:29:44,549 --> 00:29:46,409
familiar with energy these are all guys

805
00:29:46,409 --> 00:29:49,919
that have ot capable monitoring tools so

806
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:52,409
we can now span that traffic out to

807
00:29:52,409 --> 00:29:54,269
there or we can use this port for

808
00:29:54,269 --> 00:29:58,200
dedicated management I know that the the

809
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:01,460
waterful guys like to talk about the

810
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:04,649
impact or how you can get a circumvent a

811
00:30:04,649 --> 00:30:06,330
firewall typically you need access to

812
00:30:06,330 --> 00:30:07,830
the management console so our approach

813
00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:09,539
is to just take that management console

814
00:30:09,539 --> 00:30:11,399
and separate it in isolated completely

815
00:30:11,399 --> 00:30:14,130
from the control network and this

816
00:30:14,130 --> 00:30:15,779
product as I said is designed to go in

817
00:30:15,779 --> 00:30:18,929
the control enclosure on the din rail so

818
00:30:18,929 --> 00:30:20,549
what do we protect against we protect

819
00:30:20,549 --> 00:30:22,230
you against the port scanning the

820
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:24,960
abnormal data flows the potential for

821
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,940
human error a lot of the things that we

822
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:28,150
brought up before

823
00:30:28,150 --> 00:30:30,070
and as we start to get down here this is

824
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:31,450
where it gets really interesting the

825
00:30:31,450 --> 00:30:33,880
firmware updates the changes of state to

826
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,919
the PLC or the controller or whatever

827
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:38,740
the logic might be and also attacking

828
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:41,950
unused features and functions so I won't

829
00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:43,179
spend too much time talking about the

830
00:30:43,179 --> 00:30:45,309
product if you do get chance to come by

831
00:30:45,309 --> 00:30:47,440
the booth tomorrow I'd be happy to talk

832
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,120
to you guys I will point out a couple

833
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:50,559
things here does the deep packet

834
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:52,720
inspection it does have encryption

835
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,850
capabilities the encryption is certified

836
00:30:54,850 --> 00:30:56,770
to government standards namely FIPS

837
00:30:56,770 --> 00:31:00,190
140-2 and Common Criteria it does have

838
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:02,140
the outbound management point it does

839
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:04,960
have the span port capabilities it is

840
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,789
also third part I think I mentioned

841
00:31:06,789 --> 00:31:08,320
third-party validation already as well

842
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:13,059
arm so that's a little overview on just

843
00:31:13,059 --> 00:31:14,980
to show you how easy we try to make it

844
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:16,419
to set up some of these rules so in the

845
00:31:16,419 --> 00:31:19,240
case of Modbus unit address register

846
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,890
address whether you want to check the

847
00:31:20,890 --> 00:31:22,630
value and we go right the way down to

848
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:25,990
the value level for specifically for for

849
00:31:25,990 --> 00:31:28,539
writing registers dnp3 we try to make it

850
00:31:28,539 --> 00:31:30,460
more check box or into the MPP being a

851
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:32,200
very complex protocol back net again

852
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:36,190
with check boxes this is the generic DPI

853
00:31:36,190 --> 00:31:38,350
piece that i mentioned earlier

854
00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:41,110
we don't have support for every

855
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:43,000
industrial protocol yet we're working on

856
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,549
it in this in the meantime if you have a

857
00:31:45,549 --> 00:31:47,380
protocol let's say it Schweitzer's

858
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:50,440
proprietary protocol of something we can

859
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:52,270
give you the ability to define your own

860
00:31:52,270 --> 00:31:54,279
rules in an XML file by looking at

861
00:31:54,279 --> 00:31:57,010
simple offsets and doing some sort of

862
00:31:57,010 --> 00:31:59,620
pattern matching so it's kind of an

863
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:01,539
interim step between us having full

864
00:32:01,539 --> 00:32:02,980
support and giving you the ability to

865
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:04,539
control your own destiny a little bit

866
00:32:04,539 --> 00:32:06,070
and this is where you can start to lock

867
00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:07,899
down some of the proprietary stuff that

868
00:32:07,899 --> 00:32:09,909
we have to reverse engineer namely like

869
00:32:09,909 --> 00:32:11,770
firmware updates or configuration

870
00:32:11,770 --> 00:32:15,580
updates how many of you guys saw this

871
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:17,740
recently the Modbus stager here was a

872
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:19,690
proof of concept that was put out there

873
00:32:19,690 --> 00:32:22,929
where somebody is using Modbus devices

874
00:32:22,929 --> 00:32:26,440
that are public facing and taking empty

875
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:28,289
holding registers and using that to

876
00:32:28,289 --> 00:32:31,899
store his malware so he would use them

877
00:32:31,899 --> 00:32:34,510
as essentially memory locations pretty

878
00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:37,120
interesting idea ultimately if you

879
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,590
somebody has access to your Modbus

880
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:40,179
registers this is the least of your

881
00:32:40,179 --> 00:32:41,290
worries because they can

882
00:32:41,290 --> 00:32:43,870
send an F C 90 command and screw it up

883
00:32:43,870 --> 00:32:45,070
but this is a pretty interesting

884
00:32:45,070 --> 00:32:48,850
proof-of-concept and there you know I

885
00:32:48,850 --> 00:32:51,070
took this from a datasheet here this is

886
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:53,770
a device we won't to say who but it has

887
00:32:53,770 --> 00:32:56,170
a lot of registers available to you that

888
00:32:56,170 --> 00:32:57,820
you can do with and this is what the

889
00:32:57,820 --> 00:32:59,830
premise of this Modbus stager is and the

890
00:32:59,830 --> 00:33:01,750
question I asked you is do you really

891
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:03,730
need to have that many registers open

892
00:33:03,730 --> 00:33:06,280
are you using that many if not lock them

893
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:10,210
up use the whitelisting approach and

894
00:33:10,210 --> 00:33:12,010
ultimately if you want to protect

895
00:33:12,010 --> 00:33:13,570
against critical anomalies you need to

896
00:33:13,570 --> 00:33:15,130
go right the way down to the physical

897
00:33:15,130 --> 00:33:17,020
layer so you need something in between

898
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:18,880
your intelligent network connected

899
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:21,160
device that can handle it so we've got I

900
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:24,480
think some flow control here some talks

901
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:28,750
current limiter speed limiter protective

902
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:30,610
relay limit controller these are all

903
00:33:30,610 --> 00:33:32,860
things that should be unintelligent

904
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:35,800
solutions to help protect your ultimate

905
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:38,560
physical process but it adds some

906
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:41,140
significant cost and complexity so

907
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:43,570
standard best practices implement

908
00:33:43,570 --> 00:33:45,940
traditional firewall rules consider the

909
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:47,320
value you get from deep packet

910
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:49,120
inspection specifically for your

911
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:51,780
application add some sort of logging

912
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:54,550
monitoring with remote with remote

913
00:33:54,550 --> 00:33:55,990
logging logging would be great remote

914
00:33:55,990 --> 00:33:57,460
monitoring would be great and then also

915
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:58,990
consider the need for end-to-end

916
00:33:58,990 --> 00:34:01,660
encryption to take those insecure by

917
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:03,010
design protocols and maybe add something

918
00:34:03,010 --> 00:34:04,090
to it for those of you that were the

919
00:34:04,090 --> 00:34:05,290
Schneider presentation earlier you'll

920
00:34:05,290 --> 00:34:06,940
see that secure Modbus is around the

921
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:08,679
corner we hope very interesting

922
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:10,690
presentation but in the interim you can

923
00:34:10,690 --> 00:34:13,000
take take that into your own hands and

924
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,100
implement your own form of encryption we

925
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:17,139
will just close out here so industrial

926
00:34:17,139 --> 00:34:18,850
control networks are porous they're

927
00:34:18,850 --> 00:34:20,918
insecure by design we know that there

928
00:34:20,918 --> 00:34:23,650
are a number of holes so you have to do

929
00:34:23,650 --> 00:34:25,510
something we have to do something if we

930
00:34:25,510 --> 00:34:30,580
want true operational awareness you need

931
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:32,620
to be able to discern what normal looks

932
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:34,449
like before you can understand what

933
00:34:34,449 --> 00:34:36,100
abnormal looks like so you need to look

934
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:37,780
at mechanisms that will allow you to do

935
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:38,860
that and I think deep packet inspection

936
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:41,290
is a great way to do that you also have

937
00:34:41,290 --> 00:34:43,150
to look at who you trust do you trust

938
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:45,010
your ICS vendors to take care of this do

939
00:34:45,010 --> 00:34:46,900
you trust that the vendor is taking care

940
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:48,668
of everything and you're good I would

941
00:34:48,668 --> 00:34:50,530
argue the track record doesn't look so

942
00:34:50,530 --> 00:34:52,690
good for that so you need to look at

943
00:34:52,690 --> 00:34:55,000
other options otherwise do you try

944
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,370
your risk mitigation strategy on that

945
00:34:57,370 --> 00:35:00,190
relationship the greater visibility you

946
00:35:00,190 --> 00:35:01,810
have the more these look at the more

947
00:35:01,810 --> 00:35:03,130
control you have over your control

948
00:35:03,130 --> 00:35:04,600
system and your ultimate physical

949
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:07,600
processes and dpi is a great tool to

950
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,580
being able to work out where the anomaly

951
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:12,900
is what which one is out of place

952
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:15,190
embedded devices the proliferation of

953
00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:17,230
embedded devices mean the challenge for

954
00:35:17,230 --> 00:35:19,060
us to protect those relies on something

955
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:21,490
upstream of it something external so

956
00:35:21,490 --> 00:35:23,770
consider we can't just install a

957
00:35:23,770 --> 00:35:26,680
software-based firewall or snort on our

958
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:28,420
embedded device because we will probably

959
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:32,170
break it and also know that there are a

960
00:35:32,170 --> 00:35:34,180
lot of options out there but some

961
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:35,860
sometimes the claims for deep packet

962
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:37,810
inspection are not always true some a

963
00:35:37,810 --> 00:35:39,700
signature based so understand that not

964
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:42,760
all dpi technology is the same and also

965
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:44,080
understand that while this can be

966
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:46,450
complex to decipher there are tools and

967
00:35:46,450 --> 00:35:47,950
there are ways and there are methods to

968
00:35:47,950 --> 00:35:49,720
help make that process easier

969
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:53,650
so last closing thought here is that you

970
00:35:53,650 --> 00:35:55,720
know this is a cybersecurity event but

971
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:56,860
really we're not here to talk about

972
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:58,480
cybersecurity we're here to talk about

973
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,850
uptime and safety that's the end goal

974
00:36:00,850 --> 00:36:03,670
cybersecurity is just a facet in having

975
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:06,220
a better handle on what it is that we're

976
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:09,370
doing so with that I think we're right

977
00:36:09,370 --> 00:36:11,050
on the time if anyone has any questions

978
00:36:11,050 --> 00:36:14,530
I'll be happy that's the first thing

979
00:36:14,530 --> 00:36:15,910
that we do so the first thing we do is

980
00:36:15,910 --> 00:36:17,650
just check is it is it does it look

981
00:36:17,650 --> 00:36:19,810
right is it the right shape smell look

982
00:36:19,810 --> 00:36:22,840
as the standard defines and then if it

983
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:25,030
is then we look to our white listing

984
00:36:25,030 --> 00:36:26,650
policy is it allowed is it not allowed

985
00:36:26,650 --> 00:36:29,200
and you could just use it for just

986
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,360
checking for for malformed packets if

987
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,470
you want and not having any white

988
00:36:32,470 --> 00:36:34,480
listing if you want you could even use

989
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:36,100
the device just for monitoring if

990
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:38,200
someone says it's too invasive I don't

991
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:39,820
want you been out of control or break

992
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:41,770
any of my communications just put it in

993
00:36:41,770 --> 00:36:43,720
as a bump in the wire that just gives

994
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:45,850
you monitoring feedback give you syslog

995
00:36:45,850 --> 00:36:48,400
information and alerts or just using it

996
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,440
as a tap so you can use it in a

997
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:53,080
non-invasive way yeah any other

998
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:56,530
questions yes I think I'll be retired by

999
00:36:56,530 --> 00:36:58,030
the time that that changes so I'll let

1000
00:36:58,030 --> 00:36:59,290
the next guy worry about it but no

1001
00:36:59,290 --> 00:37:01,240
really realistically you're absolutely

1002
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:03,730
right on but I would also argue that

1003
00:37:03,730 --> 00:37:05,380
even just because you've got encryption

1004
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:07,930
you are still released based unless you

1005
00:37:07,930 --> 00:37:08,859
got authenticate

1006
00:37:08,859 --> 00:37:10,119
well you have that trust based

1007
00:37:10,119 --> 00:37:11,799
relationship what if this host becomes

1008
00:37:11,799 --> 00:37:12,609
compromised

1009
00:37:12,609 --> 00:37:15,609
it has secured access to my PLC but if

1010
00:37:15,609 --> 00:37:17,499
that host is compromised I still want to

1011
00:37:17,499 --> 00:37:19,690
do some sort of enforcement now we can't

1012
00:37:19,690 --> 00:37:21,759
do that on the wire quite as easily so

1013
00:37:21,759 --> 00:37:23,049
then it becomes maybe a software

1014
00:37:23,049 --> 00:37:24,640
enforcement policy of something but

1015
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,799
absolutely yeah I'm all downstream video

1016
00:37:26,799 --> 00:37:28,450
absolutely I mean one of the things that

1017
00:37:28,450 --> 00:37:29,950
we do go to market with is we don't just

1018
00:37:29,950 --> 00:37:31,690
sell our technology as a box we sell it

1019
00:37:31,690 --> 00:37:34,420
as a chip so the the other strategy is

1020
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:36,430
we work with OEMs to take our technology

1021
00:37:36,430 --> 00:37:38,559
and embed it into their device so that

1022
00:37:38,559 --> 00:37:42,239
we do help them do the encryption piece
