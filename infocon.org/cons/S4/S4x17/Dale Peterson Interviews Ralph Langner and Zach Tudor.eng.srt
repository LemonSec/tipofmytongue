2
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:14,940
welcome to the closing panel I'm very

3
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:18,660
pleased to have two guests with me not

4
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:21,930
only because of their experience

5
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:23,609
reputation and knowledge but because

6
00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:27,090
they are the two most frequent attendees

7
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:30,269
of s4 so on the far end I have Ralph

8
00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:32,940
Langner of Langner communications in the

9
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:35,550
lagna group obviously he's most famous

10
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:38,489
for his work on Stuxnet but he was

11
00:00:38,489 --> 00:00:40,440
coming to ask for well before Stuxnet

12
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:43,710
and and since that time is written books

13
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:48,390
and right now is working on a project or

14
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:51,120
a product called ot base which is an OT

15
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,910
security program and I know a number of

16
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:55,350
you in the audience will be taking his

17
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:58,140
class on Friday about how to create an

18
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:00,809
OT security program and Ralph has been

19
00:01:00,809 --> 00:01:04,140
here for all 10s 4s this is actually the

20
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:07,400
10th s4 so we appreciate his support

21
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:10,860
yeah that was the only reason why I

22
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:12,689
could correct Stuxnet you know all that

23
00:01:12,689 --> 00:01:14,970
preparation that has for that helped me

24
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:17,340
develop the capability if you want to

25
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:20,119
have some fun you can watch like the S 4

26
00:01:20,119 --> 00:01:25,110
2008 Langner presentation on hacking OPC

27
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:26,970
or something like that you did an OPC

28
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:30,270
server one way but whatever 2007 year

29
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:33,479
one okay and then immediately to my left

30
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:36,619
is act tutor he is currently with INL

31
00:01:36,619 --> 00:01:39,210
has been there for a little less than a

32
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:41,520
year and is responsible for so many

33
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,619
things I can't even mention them all but

34
00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:45,479
definitely the ICS security efforts

35
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:47,280
there amongst other things I don't know

36
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,840
them all myself yet but I'm trying to

37
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,299
catch up and Ralph's hat I'm sorry

38
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:54,600
Zach had a perfect record until last

39
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,000
year he missed last year's s4 but he has

40
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,180
attended nine of the ten s4 so we again

41
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:03,630
we appreciate his support and I thought

42
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:06,100
in this final panel yeah

43
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:10,210
okay thank you you know so I thought in

44
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:13,930
the end I obviously have a lot to do

45
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:16,090
with the program and what we're going to

46
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:18,880
talk about at s4 and it's geared based

47
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,800
on things that I think are important and

48
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,860
what I wanted to do was talk to these

49
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:26,500
two gentlemen about maybe other things

50
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:30,400
that we haven't talked about s4 so why

51
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,310
don't I start out Ralph with you what do

52
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:36,190
you see as one or you can mention more

53
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:38,800
than one if you like important issues

54
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,800
that we're not addressing either at this

55
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:45,640
conference or as an ICS community you

56
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,920
know first before we go into the details

57
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,350
I think one important issue of that next

58
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:52,300
next year we should have a

59
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:55,180
pre-conference Welcome Party I've been

60
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:58,800
saying that to do for so many years now

61
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,420
but all right by the way you could you

62
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:03,130
can thank Ralph for this moving down to

63
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:04,750
South Beach it only took him four years

64
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:06,970
to convince me but the reason we're in

65
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:11,850
South Beach is constant recommendation

66
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:17,260
but if I think about any subject matters

67
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:19,810
that I believe are a bit

68
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:24,400
underrepresented two things come to my

69
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,829
mind and the first thing would be I see

70
00:03:26,829 --> 00:03:29,260
a complete lack of a discussion on the

71
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:32,410
iio tea at this conference and I think

72
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:34,660
this is very surprising at least to me

73
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:38,950
because we should consider or we should

74
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:40,630
realize that this discussion is

75
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:43,900
presently going on in full steam but

76
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:46,000
it's not Colette at this conference

77
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,720
within this audience and I think that's

78
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:52,420
that's a bad thing so as probably

79
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:55,060
everybody in this room knows there are a

80
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:58,840
bunch of conferences on the IOT there

81
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,820
are even a bunch of conferences on the

82
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:06,610
security of the IOT excuse me but we so

83
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:08,470
far agreed we didn't discuss this in

84
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:11,440
detail and what you would probably guess

85
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:14,290
is if you actually go to any of these

86
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:16,570
conference I just had the pleasure to

87
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:19,310
keynote one of that code of these con

88
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:23,420
is less for you would expect that you

89
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:28,000
won't find a lot of ICS talent there

90
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,830
including the speakers and I don't think

91
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:32,330
that's a good thing that there is a good

92
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:34,250
development so there are presently

93
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:38,330
witnessing the IOT or industry internet

94
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:41,750
discussion taking off as we speak and we

95
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:44,690
have little stakes in this discussion

96
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:47,780
and I think we see we should rather try

97
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:51,020
to change that quickly so if I remember

98
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:55,310
my talk last year in fall in Washington

99
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:58,850
DC most people in the audience and also

100
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:03,800
on the podium had very few ideas about

101
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:07,880
how let's just say an industrial thing

102
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:10,450
as they called it would be different

103
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:14,620
from a smart toilet or a smoke detector

104
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:19,430
a wristband smart wristband and I think

105
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:23,419
I had a bit of a hard time just bringing

106
00:05:23,419 --> 00:05:25,790
at that point home that if you are

107
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:28,460
considering let's just say a big pump in

108
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:31,370
an industrial setting nobody in our

109
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:33,800
space refers to that object as a thing

110
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:37,729
right because when you talk about it as

111
00:05:37,729 --> 00:05:38,510
a thing

112
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:40,610
you're completely stripping of its

113
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:43,910
function and how that physical function

114
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:47,720
is embedded or is messed up with all the

115
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,460
other actuators in that industrial

116
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:53,240
setting so I believe everybody in there

117
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:55,400
in this audience should take an effort

118
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,850
to participate in this ongoing

119
00:05:57,850 --> 00:06:00,289
discussion make your voice be heard

120
00:06:00,289 --> 00:06:04,970
because there is a reason to assume that

121
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:08,510
if we don't make ourselves heard with

122
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:11,510
our subject matter expertise

123
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:15,289
we'll just revive history so you'll see

124
00:06:15,289 --> 00:06:18,530
the same thing in my opinion as Dale

125
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:21,490
alluded to at the end of his talk

126
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:25,070
remember back in the 90s when when

127
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:27,979
everybody was going to Windows PCs and

128
00:06:27,979 --> 00:06:30,740
local area networks connecting to ICS

129
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:31,670
and all the

130
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:34,730
in gaseous vendors were moving to add

131
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:37,570
network interfaces to their products and

132
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:41,440
when that happens the idea was well

133
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,120
what's wrong with that I mean nothing

134
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,560
bad is going to happen because you're

135
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:48,290
just using that as an Aeron you're just

136
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:52,220
using that to to do our HMIS in a more

137
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:54,470
cost-efficient manner and you know a

138
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:56,560
couple of years later everybody knows

139
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:01,520
that it is a big deal and it this this

140
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,700
lack of thinking it through got us into

141
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:07,220
the mess that we presently are so just

142
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:10,760
in brief everybody knows when the

143
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:13,490
vendors try to plot their existing

144
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:16,580
products to that Ethernet based

145
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:20,240
connectivity they ported the the

146
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,120
protocols etc on a one-to-one basis so

147
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,980
they didn't realize that when you go

148
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:26,720
from zero point two point two networks

149
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,270
that that something like authentication

150
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:33,650
would be a great idea and now we have to

151
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:35,810
live with that and at the same time

152
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:38,480
those vendors told us well you know

153
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,940
nobody told you to connect all those

154
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:43,460
devices and networks to the internet

155
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:45,380
right so yes you're using OPC you're

156
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:47,630
using D comments error but we are not

157
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:49,640
telling that you should connect all

158
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,710
these things to the Internet

159
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:55,580
fast forwards now the same vendors tell

160
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:58,910
you the exact thing you got to connect

161
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:00,290
everything to the Internet otherwise

162
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:01,820
you're going to be out of business in a

163
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:04,880
couple of years we will see protocols

164
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:09,710
promoted as the core technology for the

165
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:14,510
IOT not modbus/tcp necessarily but for

166
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:17,570
example prophy net profit net is touted

167
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:21,770
as the best networking protocol in order

168
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:24,350
to make the IAO t happen and just in

169
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:26,420
case you didn't know what first many of

170
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:28,760
you will know pro Fiona does not include

171
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:31,430
authentication ethernet/ip does not

172
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:35,020
include also education and so this is my

173
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:38,690
my fear presently that you're forced to

174
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:43,000
repeat history and I think or or I

175
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,779
experience some kind of

176
00:08:44,779 --> 00:08:47,720
urgency here because as I said this

177
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:50,480
discussion is going on at full steam and

178
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,249
we are not participating in that so I

179
00:08:54,249 --> 00:08:57,499
think knowing you all these years I mean

180
00:08:57,499 --> 00:09:00,730
we got a lot of i IOT

181
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:04,040
presentation suggestions and submittals

182
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:07,189
they were primarily about look how easy

183
00:09:07,189 --> 00:09:10,610
it is for me to hack this you know a

184
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:12,949
small device and those probably aren't

185
00:09:12,949 --> 00:09:16,069
of great value to us because we know you

186
00:09:16,069 --> 00:09:17,269
know if they weren't designed with

187
00:09:17,269 --> 00:09:19,839
security just like we had 50 0 days in

188
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:22,129
2012 we could find we could fill the

189
00:09:22,129 --> 00:09:24,709
whole agenda with this what an end Zack

190
00:09:24,709 --> 00:09:26,029
I'll ask you and then maybe Ralph you

191
00:09:26,029 --> 00:09:28,370
can chime in what kind what should we be

192
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:30,829
talking about on IOT when we get

193
00:09:30,829 --> 00:09:32,540
together in things like this or what

194
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:35,180
should be the way we attack solving this

195
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:36,949
problem well one of the things I've

196
00:09:36,949 --> 00:09:38,540
noticed over the years and I kind of

197
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:40,100
changed my position after you know some

198
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:41,959
events of the last six months or so I

199
00:09:41,959 --> 00:09:44,089
used to always define things between the

200
00:09:44,089 --> 00:09:46,519
kind of Internet of Things and the

201
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:47,629
Internet of trivial things

202
00:09:47,629 --> 00:09:48,769
so I would always make fun of you know

203
00:09:48,769 --> 00:09:51,350
nest thermostats or smart toilets as you

204
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:52,189
mentioned you said that with a straight

205
00:09:52,189 --> 00:09:53,509
face and I tried to do that myself as

206
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:55,790
well and then when you see but we all

207
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:58,430
knew the capability of a botnet of IOT

208
00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:00,199
devices and sure enough those trivial

209
00:10:00,199 --> 00:10:03,319
things became important and mass so some

210
00:10:03,319 --> 00:10:05,300
of the other consequences of what we do

211
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:07,790
with the connected Internet of Things

212
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:09,470
one of the things we can talk about but

213
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:11,420
before I talk about smart and give it

214
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:13,100
back to Ralph I just want to talk about

215
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:15,110
the the theme of this conferences here

216
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:16,670
come together and kind of uh

217
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:18,709
congratulate Dale and and applaud all

218
00:10:18,709 --> 00:10:20,870
the audience because ten years ago when

219
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:23,420
Dale was starting the s4 I know his

220
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:25,819
premise was that we needed to to bring a

221
00:10:25,819 --> 00:10:29,230
bunch of people from different parts of

222
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:31,939
industry of academia the National Labs

223
00:10:31,939 --> 00:10:34,519
government together to talk about the

224
00:10:34,519 --> 00:10:35,959
problem because there wasn't really a

225
00:10:35,959 --> 00:10:38,509
structured way of talking about OT type

226
00:10:38,509 --> 00:10:41,120
of cybersecurity in a way that was

227
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,230
really meaningful for all of us and I

228
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:43,100
think that a lot of the other

229
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,899
conferences that have come up in the

230
00:10:44,899 --> 00:10:46,879
meantime have been different

231
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:50,120
formulations of s for some bigger some

232
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,069
smaller some less successful but but

233
00:10:52,069 --> 00:10:53,689
none of them that are any more important

234
00:10:53,689 --> 00:10:55,040
and you've done a really great job doing

235
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,540
that all together Christian I

236
00:10:56,540 --> 00:11:02,690
I want everyone to and and well with

237
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:04,660
that all those good words now let's uh

238
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:07,640
so did you have any I mean how should we

239
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:10,580
be addressing this i io t thing as a

240
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:13,850
group i I know in my talk one of the

241
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:16,460
things I mentioned was I feel like just

242
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:18,860
saying we're going to address IOT is

243
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:20,990
almost an impossible problem because it

244
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:24,200
is so big I mean so one of my answers

245
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,210
was taxonomy we need to start saying

246
00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:29,360
let's split this into cases we can deal

247
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,490
with but what what do you either I guess

248
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:32,720
Ralph we'll start with you Leon what do

249
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,120
you think is is a fruitful way to start

250
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,400
talking about securing this well first

251
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:40,310
of all again remember this discussion is

252
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:42,020
already happening unfortunately it's not

253
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:44,090
happening on this stage so there are a

254
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:46,700
couple of other conferences some of them

255
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:48,920
focusing on security as I said the the

256
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,990
conference that I have attended less for

257
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:54,740
it was the security of things forum so

258
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:56,690
obviously they have a bunch of talks on

259
00:11:56,690 --> 00:12:00,440
on security on cyber security certainly

260
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,360
I agree with you that it does make a lot

261
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:05,570
of sense demonstrating how to hack a

262
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:08,450
profile net installation is not very

263
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:10,040
different from what we have seen in

264
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:12,230
respect to Modbus and anything else that

265
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:14,450
doesn't include authentication and a

266
00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:17,660
reasonable level of security but I think

267
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:20,660
there or at least I have seen a couple

268
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:22,820
of interesting thoughts to our

269
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:24,740
collaborations on the subject you know

270
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:26,900
there are there are a bunch of smart

271
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:29,660
people in that space especially on the

272
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:32,720
IT side of things and they have some

273
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:37,490
concept for how and trying to establish

274
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:42,650
a secure a IOT if we agree that you're

275
00:12:42,650 --> 00:12:44,840
going that way and that this is a good

276
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:49,340
thing and certainly I would put the

277
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:52,250
emphasis on protective and mitigative

278
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:55,580
strategies I think we must have this

279
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:57,590
discussion because it is clear to me

280
00:12:57,590 --> 00:13:00,200
that the risk that you're introducing

281
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:04,850
with the IOT is a magnitude bigger than

282
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:07,130
what we did so far because now you're

283
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:09,889
just going to hyper-connectivity and I

284
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:12,199
productivity means you're also

285
00:13:12,199 --> 00:13:14,569
increasing your risk at the same time

286
00:13:14,569 --> 00:13:17,179
because first the the number of

287
00:13:17,179 --> 00:13:20,660
potential infiltration points is rising

288
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:23,209
and second the cost of consequence

289
00:13:23,209 --> 00:13:25,189
potential cost of consequence is also

290
00:13:25,189 --> 00:13:28,669
going up as well and so we gotta have

291
00:13:28,669 --> 00:13:30,949
this discussion on how to secure this

292
00:13:30,949 --> 00:13:33,529
new thing or maybe also include

293
00:13:33,529 --> 00:13:36,799
discussions on where it is definitely a

294
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:40,339
bad idea to apply all these concepts

295
00:13:40,339 --> 00:13:44,989
products its strategies etc and I mean

296
00:13:44,989 --> 00:13:47,179
they already gave a couple of good

297
00:13:47,179 --> 00:13:50,629
points in his talk because again this is

298
00:13:50,629 --> 00:13:52,129
happening right now as we speak

299
00:13:52,129 --> 00:13:55,040
preventive predictive maintenance using

300
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,939
remote access and then the vendors

301
00:13:57,939 --> 00:14:00,290
certainly if if only for convenience

302
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:04,519
they want to have all the functions

303
00:14:04,519 --> 00:14:06,319
available they want to be able to

304
00:14:06,319 --> 00:14:09,169
theoretically completely reconfigure the

305
00:14:09,169 --> 00:14:12,019
remote device and this is a discussion

306
00:14:12,019 --> 00:14:15,100
that I think is necessary to have and

307
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:17,839
also single out those areas which we

308
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:21,079
might want to exclude another area would

309
00:14:21,079 --> 00:14:25,220
be include the regulator's what what is

310
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:28,009
our position as the ICS security

311
00:14:28,009 --> 00:14:30,649
community what what should we tell

312
00:14:30,649 --> 00:14:33,559
governments on on where to place

313
00:14:33,559 --> 00:14:36,589
limitations on which specific risks to

314
00:14:36,589 --> 00:14:40,639
observe and to to limit because I'm

315
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,649
under the impression that that this

316
00:14:42,649 --> 00:14:46,939
input would actually or could make a big

317
00:14:46,939 --> 00:14:49,189
difference well you know one thing that

318
00:14:49,189 --> 00:14:51,529
I think and Ralph's hit on it initially

319
00:14:51,529 --> 00:14:54,289
was that s4 should focus on on I iotv

320
00:14:54,289 --> 00:14:56,389
the industrial internet of things as

321
00:14:56,389 --> 00:14:57,919
opposed to trying to solve that at large

322
00:14:57,919 --> 00:15:00,579
a problem of consumer electronics etc

323
00:15:00,579 --> 00:15:03,049
IOT is also going to give us a new

324
00:15:03,049 --> 00:15:04,879
explosion of data when we've already

325
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:06,649
been in the center of an initial

326
00:15:06,649 --> 00:15:08,779
explosion of data so all of the sensors

327
00:15:08,779 --> 00:15:10,129
that we have out there that are coming

328
00:15:10,129 --> 00:15:12,980
in people are trying to implement Sims

329
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:15,199
but still trying to determine whether we

330
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:17,299
use that same just at the OT floor how

331
00:15:17,299 --> 00:15:18,860
do we integrate it with with business

332
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:21,080
the IT OT

333
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,610
conflicts that we may have again and

334
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:24,590
then with IOT that exploding of

335
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,270
information the potential to have even

336
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:28,700
greater sensing capabilities out on

337
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:30,920
plant floors and operations but being

338
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,390
able to aggregate all that data and make

339
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:34,430
use of it so potentially some of those

340
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:35,990
areas that can talk about you know new

341
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:38,450
ways to use data efficiently and

342
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:41,360
effectively within control and I would

343
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,860
see might be something that that could

344
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:45,230
be appropriate for the s4 yeah let me

345
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:48,350
jump in on that because that is a is a

346
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:51,080
good junction to my my second issue that

347
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:53,600
I think is underrepresented in this

348
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,270
conference and that is the whole big

349
00:15:56,270 --> 00:16:01,430
field of security automation my opinion

350
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:04,070
is that if we don't get our act together

351
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:06,020
rather soon on how to automate our

352
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:08,930
procedures and strategy we will be in in

353
00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:10,610
a deep mess because just of the

354
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:14,840
complexity of the rising risk you will

355
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:17,750
and already are engines at some place is

356
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:21,230
no longer be able to try to address the

357
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:24,500
problem by by having a bunch of guys you

358
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,480
know dedicated to the task and they were

359
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:29,060
meeting let's just say every week and

360
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:30,500
they are sitting in a room and then

361
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:33,080
they're discussing the risk and they are

362
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:36,920
doing some kind of analysis by hand well

363
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:39,710
I mean focus is no longer going to work

364
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:43,670
this is 2017 you're drowning in data

365
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:46,640
we're drowning in complexity and also

366
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:51,170
remember that that this human driven

367
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:54,560
effort just doesn't scale we don't have

368
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:58,280
enough experts and the only way that we

369
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:00,170
can solve this problem is by using

370
00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:03,170
automation and I have to add that I'm

371
00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:05,959
very very optimistic about that because

372
00:17:05,959 --> 00:17:12,410
if you see the the level of success in

373
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:15,800
other fields I mean just remember the

374
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:18,109
presentation on machine learning earlier

375
00:17:18,109 --> 00:17:20,630
or today if you see what other fields

376
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:22,790
are doing presently using artificial

377
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:24,650
intelligence machine learning

378
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:28,610
you name it modeling to me is out of the

379
00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:32,270
question that technically it can be done

380
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:33,020
we

381
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:35,270
have the capability already but we just

382
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:38,830
failed so far to apply it to an area

383
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:42,620
where most people agree well just

384
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:46,670
remember Obama's executive order 1366

385
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:49,120
well this is one of the most critical

386
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,560
problems that we need to address right

387
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:55,010
and let's see what the next president is

388
00:17:55,010 --> 00:17:56,990
going to say about that around one of

389
00:17:56,990 --> 00:17:59,150
the things that that I think also comes

390
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:00,710
and takes that to the next step and when

391
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:02,600
you made your list on day one of the

392
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:03,830
different areas that you mentioned it

393
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:05,450
and we did talk about our machine

394
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:07,820
learning today and some good aspects but

395
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:09,680
beyond automation you know we're now

396
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,960
talking in broader industries and in the

397
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:15,230
defense which is somewhat interesting of

398
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:17,510
autonomy as opposed to just automation

399
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:19,250
instead of human-in-the-loop but human

400
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:22,310
on the loop and some of the issues that

401
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:23,930
we'll see with that you know a lot of

402
00:18:23,930 --> 00:18:25,310
the artificial intelligence machine

403
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:27,680
learning programs that we see today you

404
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:29,660
cannot actually go and walk back and

405
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:31,160
understand how they made that decision

406
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,270
it was a good decision

407
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:33,710
we programmed it correctly it learned

408
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:35,300
appropriately it made the right decision

409
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:36,950
but we don't have the visualization

410
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:39,260
tools that the math the language to

411
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:40,640
understand exactly how those decisions

412
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,860
came about and if we're going to move

413
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:46,790
into autonomous systems for for drones

414
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:49,520
for surveillance for operations then we

415
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,800
need to be fully convinced of how those

416
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,900
decisions have been made and I think

417
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:54,920
that's something that we're going to

418
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,470
deal with especially as we get into more

419
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:58,640
automation because that the next step

420
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,740
and we still always you know say oh well

421
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:02,690
they'll never use your wireless in this

422
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:04,220
environment and then two years later Oh

423
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:05,300
there'll be no such thing as a

424
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:08,090
cloud-based control system right so if

425
00:19:08,090 --> 00:19:09,380
someone say to me well will never do

426
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:11,540
autonomy I mean certain critical

427
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:13,010
controls I'll say just just wait five

428
00:19:13,010 --> 00:19:16,520
years ago back there the security

429
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:19,010
automation is kind of interesting in the

430
00:19:19,010 --> 00:19:22,100
sense that and and I'm trying to think

431
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:24,680
of a parallel and it doesn't an analogy

432
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:27,620
and it doesn't come to my mind right now

433
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:31,100
it's not being done at all so you really

434
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:32,690
I shouldn't say at all but it's not

435
00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:35,030
being done very much the types of things

436
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:36,740
that you're going to automate it's being

437
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:39,410
done in some places to some degree but

438
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:40,760
it's not one of these things where you

439
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:44,060
have this process that's widely deployed

440
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:46,350
and effective that you're automating

441
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:49,230
it's almost more that it's not widely

442
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:50,490
deployed and effective it may be

443
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:53,190
automation is the only way to get it

444
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:55,110
done I don't know if that's what you're

445
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:56,190
saying but there are there examples

446
00:19:56,190 --> 00:19:59,430
where you go from not doing it well or

447
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:02,640
not doing it to automation directly you

448
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,640
know make that big jump well first of

449
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:08,130
all I think we have already seen some

450
00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:12,530
very impressive examples of on how

451
00:20:12,530 --> 00:20:15,500
security automation can be applied so

452
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:19,530
just for example I just suggest for

453
00:20:19,530 --> 00:20:21,360
everybody if you haven't already done so

454
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:26,040
to look up the the DARPA cyber Grand

455
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,870
Challenge from from last year and what

456
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:30,470
they did so in a nutshell they had

457
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:33,060
hacking teams competing against each

458
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:36,120
other every team tried to hack into the

459
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:39,350
other systems but the challenge was that

460
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:42,120
they that they weren't actually allowed

461
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:44,910
to use human input so it was all

462
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:50,100
pre-programmed and the the software that

463
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:52,500
conducted the attacks also used some

464
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:55,380
machine learning so it has been able to

465
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:59,040
to identify or to search for new ways on

466
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:02,010
how to hack into those other systems and

467
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:04,770
at the same time the software also tried

468
00:21:04,770 --> 00:21:07,500
to do some self healing some self

469
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,480
patching just to give you an idea that

470
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,880
so this is happening already this this

471
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:17,190
happened last year and what I believe we

472
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:22,140
should do is sue to to explore how all

473
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:25,230
these existing approaches technologies I

474
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:27,030
mean ranging from from the computing

475
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:30,530
power that we presently have like AWS

476
00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:33,720
kerchief and to the algorithms that are

477
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:36,330
out there so the case studies that have

478
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:39,180
been done and explore rather quickly how

479
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:41,940
we can turn that into good use into our

480
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:45,450
specific field ranging from from try to

481
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:48,570
address complex tasks like how do i how

482
00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:50,910
can i use that at some high value

483
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:52,920
facilities to to protect high-value

484
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,990
targets like nuclear power plants just

485
00:21:54,990 --> 00:21:58,030
as a reminder we still don't have

486
00:21:58,030 --> 00:22:00,480
they're any good algorithms at this time

487
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:04,540
to determine what the critical digital

488
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:06,910
assets are at nuclear power plants you

489
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:09,490
will if you think that's easy I can tell

490
00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:11,830
you it's very very complex so when when

491
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:14,850
the US nuclear industry started out

492
00:22:14,850 --> 00:22:17,530
defining a method for doing that they

493
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:19,930
were under these assumption they would

494
00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:21,640
end up with axis 8 when your authority

495
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,350
critical digital assets and no they were

496
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:25,540
talking about a couple of hundreds if

497
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:27,430
not thousands pretty good digital assets

498
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:30,430
including those new plans who use analog

499
00:22:30,430 --> 00:22:34,270
safety systems so that for me is I try

500
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:37,120
to allude to to that problem in my talk

501
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,840
less you're at on this stage that

502
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:42,640
suggests me that that we need to try to

503
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:45,430
find some some algorithms some heuristic

504
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:46,900
algorithms in order to address that

505
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:50,080
tough problem and certainly another area

506
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,810
where where I see a huge potential for

507
00:22:52,810 --> 00:22:55,150
security automation is everywhere there

508
00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:57,850
you need to scale up your efforts so you

509
00:22:57,850 --> 00:23:01,180
know you're not looking at a low number

510
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:03,430
of high-value targets but you're looking

511
00:23:03,430 --> 00:23:05,260
at a high number of let's say medium

512
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:07,300
value targets well certainly automation

513
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:09,130
would be seen as a way to help leverage

514
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:10,630
some of the workforce shortages that we

515
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:13,420
see by using the experts you know better

516
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:15,220
one of the things that we might also

517
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:16,960
look at you mentioned the DARPA cyber

518
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,280
grand challenge but drive is also

519
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:20,140
running a program now called radix or

520
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:21,670
radix depending on where you're from

521
00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:24,580
that incorporates some some elements of

522
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:26,710
of automatic recovery automatically

523
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:29,590
Constitution you know ways of developing

524
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:31,510
alternative systems or testing systems

525
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:34,720
after an event I think a lot of people

526
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,550
here will be you know looking at those

527
00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:39,220
types of systems and how they might

528
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:41,980
impact what the impact might be of

529
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:44,440
having that type of help come in to help

530
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:46,300
you reconstitute your environment after

531
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:48,640
what might be a significant event and we

532
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:49,960
can imagine you know something you know

533
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:52,000
on the order of Ukraine happening in the

534
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,060
US and how would you know be able to use

535
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:57,280
external resources who may not have the

536
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:59,410
full knowledge of your of your plant and

537
00:23:59,410 --> 00:24:01,840
its actual configuration have autonomous

538
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,910
or automatic systems be able to come in

539
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:06,400
and identify configurations and rebuild

540
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,710
blueprints etc so some of those things

541
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:10,970
are also very interesting but

542
00:24:10,970 --> 00:24:12,110
we'll all have to play a little bit of

543
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:13,940
catch-up so you know look up there the

544
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:15,980
University of Illinois and some others

545
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:17,390
are doing some good work in the area

546
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:19,910
lots of companies and when DARPA comes

547
00:24:19,910 --> 00:24:21,920
in like they say they they will they

548
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:24,910
will make a big splash they'll hopefully

549
00:24:24,910 --> 00:24:27,140
bring enough brainpower on to the

550
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:28,820
project have enough good results we can

551
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:30,140
then all leverage off them for the next

552
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:32,240
five or ten years and weed the labs and

553
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,170
some of the universities that are

554
00:24:33,170 --> 00:24:34,250
involved are hoping that I'm working

555
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:35,480
with the asset owners that are also

556
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:38,630
involved with the project okay well I

557
00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:40,580
want to make sure we give you time so

558
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:42,710
what ralph said here's a couple things

559
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:45,350
we should be talking about here and and

560
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:47,810
and also in the community has broader

561
00:24:47,810 --> 00:24:50,870
what do you see as maybe things were not

562
00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:53,450
paying enough attention to at s4 or the

563
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:55,400
broader community as a whole well you

564
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,780
know I love listening to rough talk

565
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:58,910
that's why I said yes when you when you

566
00:24:58,910 --> 00:25:01,730
asked me to come over but well you know

567
00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:03,980
you know one of my my pet peeves forever

568
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:07,160
has always been up in Metrix I think

569
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:09,830
that we've gotten away from the concern

570
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:12,800
about really understanding you know what

571
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,870
to measure how to measure it and how

572
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:16,670
it's impactful and it just kind of you

573
00:25:16,670 --> 00:25:19,630
know moved on there have been several

574
00:25:19,630 --> 00:25:21,710
well-funded studies on metrics and I

575
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:23,120
think they all came back negative ly and

576
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,070
conclusive and I think that that is I

577
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:26,930
put a damper on we required because

578
00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:29,660
operations go on right so we have to

579
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:30,920
look at other ways of measuring the

580
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:33,140
performance and the impact of our of our

581
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:35,720
systems the other thing that I know

582
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:38,450
Renee Taran must spoke about and that we

583
00:25:38,450 --> 00:25:41,930
are very actively pursuing in INL is I'm

584
00:25:41,930 --> 00:25:43,160
looking we're at a consequence based

585
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:45,730
approach to or managing our systems and

586
00:25:45,730 --> 00:25:49,190
problems rather than try to deal with

587
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:50,060
threats that you may not fully

588
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:51,920
understand especially out in acetone or

589
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,360
land that they don't have the full

590
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,380
sediment makes on the threats

591
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:56,060
vulnerabilities that are increasing and

592
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:57,860
being discovered every day it's hard to

593
00:25:57,860 --> 00:25:59,510
develop a risk paradigm when you can't

594
00:25:59,510 --> 00:26:00,980
keep those two variables anywhere near

595
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:03,350
but but you know what the most severe

596
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:04,900
consequences are in your environment in

597
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:06,950
safety engineering and other engineering

598
00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:08,660
disciplines as she mentioned you know we

599
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:10,000
can use those consequence based

600
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,560
understanding to then engineer out some

601
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:13,940
of the worst things that could happen to

602
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:16,940
us there's a new bill out or another

603
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:18,350
proposed bill while Senator King and

604
00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:21,200
rich that it caused a lot of press last

605
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,330
year and I think we've worked with the

606
00:26:23,330 --> 00:26:24,680
legislature to come

607
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:26,390
collectively as a community to let them

608
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:28,850
you know that that what that automation

609
00:26:28,850 --> 00:26:31,550
isn't bad that computers and critical

610
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:32,930
structures not bad but there are

611
00:26:32,930 --> 00:26:34,190
appropriate uses for different

612
00:26:34,190 --> 00:26:36,890
technologies you know you know analog

613
00:26:36,890 --> 00:26:38,900
safety systems for critical systems as

614
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:40,790
opposed to you know having everyone you

615
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:43,010
know use it's the same wires the same

616
00:26:43,010 --> 00:26:45,170
devices to be able to really you know

617
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:46,850
mitigate some of these security concerns

618
00:26:46,850 --> 00:26:49,280
and so that consequence based approach I

619
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:50,510
think is something that we'll be working

620
00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:52,160
on more this year and you'll probably

621
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,810
see a lot of different things come out

622
00:26:53,810 --> 00:26:55,520
for next year or maybe the year after

623
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,320
that's for a conference on consequence

624
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:59,330
based types of approaches and pilots I

625
00:26:59,330 --> 00:27:01,220
know we're I'm just finishing up a pilot

626
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:02,540
with the utility and hopefully we'll

627
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:03,950
have something good to we can come to a

628
00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:05,720
few baths with that as well okay but

629
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:08,150
that it's and it works across systems so

630
00:27:08,150 --> 00:27:09,560
as I said before other engineering

631
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:11,390
paradigms whether it's you know

632
00:27:11,390 --> 00:27:13,610
mechanical engineering construction etc

633
00:27:13,610 --> 00:27:15,710
you know let's what what do we have to

634
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:17,000
do to make sure the building doesn't

635
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,320
fall down that the bridge does not sway

636
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,630
in a violent you know when they look at

637
00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:21,830
those consequences and those are the

638
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:24,350
baseline engineering things that we need

639
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:25,910
to do I think that we'll start seeing

640
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:28,250
that in in both retrofits for critical

641
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:29,990
assets and also in new engineering

642
00:27:29,990 --> 00:27:32,840
architectures the metrics is kind of

643
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:34,700
interesting and it ties a little bit

644
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:36,770
back to way back to what I talked about

645
00:27:36,770 --> 00:27:39,530
in the mini keynote as you start to talk

646
00:27:39,530 --> 00:27:41,540
to your board of directors and your in

647
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:43,340
your sea levels and you say we have

648
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:45,100
these problems we need to do something

649
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:49,060
they're looking for some quarterly

650
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:53,330
report that shows we were here we wanted

651
00:27:53,330 --> 00:27:55,370
to get here and you know where are we

652
00:27:55,370 --> 00:27:58,910
and perhaps raising that bar so the the

653
00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:01,520
driver for the metrics I think you

654
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,110
talked I don't know how many ice cores

655
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:05,510
ago like six or seven ago absolutely

656
00:28:05,510 --> 00:28:09,020
with mark fabro about metrics I think at

657
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,910
that point and and there's still a need

658
00:28:10,910 --> 00:28:13,880
for them but they were very technical

659
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:16,880
engineers security person kind of

660
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,470
metrics and and the other problem that

661
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:19,760
we have with the metrics was that we

662
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,860
couldn't link it back to security you

663
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:23,840
know we started you know learning how to

664
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,670
measure things but couldn't necessarily

665
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:28,070
measure the absolute impact on making it

666
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:29,750
yourself more secure someone mention

667
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:32,000
that one of the talks earlier here today

668
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,060
you know you know IT security guys ot

669
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:36,410
security guys your problems I mean you

670
00:28:36,410 --> 00:28:37,910
go to this conference that's four

671
00:28:37,910 --> 00:28:39,080
you come back and you want more money

672
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:41,330
for more security so can you tell me

673
00:28:41,330 --> 00:28:42,710
that you know if I give you this money

674
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:45,950
that will be secured in six months well

675
00:28:45,950 --> 00:28:46,850
no not really

676
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:48,470
well that will be more security if you

677
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:50,180
tell me how much more secure will be

678
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:51,530
what we still don't have that capability

679
00:28:51,530 --> 00:28:53,480
either right now benchmarking and

680
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:54,890
comparing ourselves to other members of

681
00:28:54,890 --> 00:28:58,370
the industry and not trying to outrun

682
00:28:58,370 --> 00:29:00,410
the bear you know too much but to stop

683
00:29:00,410 --> 00:29:02,420
running the competition used to be a

684
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:04,490
good you know benchmark but if there's

685
00:29:04,490 --> 00:29:06,800
an adversary that's looking to impact

686
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:09,350
you it doesn't matter what your peers

687
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:11,150
are doing because it's your security

688
00:29:11,150 --> 00:29:13,730
that matters not the at the aggregate so

689
00:29:13,730 --> 00:29:16,280
are you optimistic about metrics I mean

690
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:18,530
and NRF the same question you think in

691
00:29:18,530 --> 00:29:21,590
two years from now we'll have useful

692
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:25,250
metrics that are at least consensus

693
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:27,590
agreed-upon for how you determine how

694
00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:30,020
secure your ICS is not at all right now

695
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:31,430
I don't think that we're studying the

696
00:29:31,430 --> 00:29:33,080
metrics problem the way we had been in

697
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:35,540
the past that we've gone back to doing

698
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:36,920
more effective operations more

699
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:39,320
understanding risk and consequences and

700
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:41,180
that may be a good thing but I still

701
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:42,620
think that we need to come back to the

702
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:46,070
area of metrics later on the other big

703
00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:48,380
thing that has been brewing for it for

704
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:50,240
10 years along with the metrics is is

705
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:53,090
the science of cybersecurity and once

706
00:29:53,090 --> 00:29:54,950
again we can't really you know become

707
00:29:54,950 --> 00:29:57,260
more of a scientist Accor or truly

708
00:29:57,260 --> 00:29:58,970
engineering discipline as opposed to a

709
00:29:58,970 --> 00:30:01,310
black part until we have those those

710
00:30:01,310 --> 00:30:04,310
measures we can compare you know the the

711
00:30:04,310 --> 00:30:06,620
actual capabilities of one intrusion

712
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:08,540
detection system versus another and in

713
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:11,420
absolute terms and rather than just the

714
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:13,700
effectiveness of the user interface you

715
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:15,380
know whether it's appealing to the user

716
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:18,140
and then and we still use it but but

717
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:22,070
true effectiveness so so ralphus and you

718
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:24,200
may disagree but if you agree that

719
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:26,840
metrics are something that we are

720
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:29,840
important what's your feeling on them is

721
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:32,360
this something that is achievable in the

722
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:34,760
in the next you know one to two or three

723
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:37,580
years or is this something that we'll be

724
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:40,190
chasing five years from now I have a

725
00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:41,930
great feeling about metrics because

726
00:30:41,930 --> 00:30:44,470
you're using metrics in the right

727
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:46,820
service security program now over 30

728
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:51,809
base 40 days no no that's that OD basis

729
00:30:51,809 --> 00:30:54,359
product but all but the the the

730
00:30:54,359 --> 00:30:57,239
programmatic effort that that you're

731
00:30:57,239 --> 00:31:01,320
using comes with metrics no since two

732
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:02,759
years since the introduction of the

733
00:31:02,759 --> 00:31:05,039
program and we were seeing the results

734
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:07,799
and and the asset owners the clients are

735
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:10,549
happy with that because they just as

736
00:31:10,549 --> 00:31:12,809
anybody would guess so you can do

737
00:31:12,809 --> 00:31:14,369
comparisons you can benchmark yourself

738
00:31:14,369 --> 00:31:17,340
against your peers you can do

739
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:19,559
comparisons how did we perform in the

740
00:31:19,559 --> 00:31:22,049
last cycle what are our goals in that

741
00:31:22,049 --> 00:31:25,169
specific domain for the next cycle and

742
00:31:25,169 --> 00:31:28,710
that works just great and I think the

743
00:31:28,710 --> 00:31:34,950
the the the one aspect you should be you

744
00:31:34,950 --> 00:31:37,309
should think very hard about we never

745
00:31:37,309 --> 00:31:40,889
made an effort to to reach any consensus

746
00:31:40,889 --> 00:31:43,440
in the community okay so what I'm not

747
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,059
talking about what you're doing what our

748
00:31:45,059 --> 00:31:47,450
clients is completely proprietary

749
00:31:47,450 --> 00:31:51,839
however I would also assume that if if

750
00:31:51,839 --> 00:31:53,399
you would have a discussion on what

751
00:31:53,399 --> 00:31:56,190
you're actually doing most of you would

752
00:31:56,190 --> 00:31:58,080
agree that this makes absolute sense it

753
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:00,659
might not be perfect it certainly is not

754
00:32:00,659 --> 00:32:04,919
perfect but it's useful and so in my

755
00:32:04,919 --> 00:32:09,919
opinion the the the problem that we are

756
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:13,409
self imposing on many of our efforts is

757
00:32:13,409 --> 00:32:16,289
to reach a consensus first because

758
00:32:16,289 --> 00:32:19,320
before we start to do anything I think

759
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:21,960
that's a flawed approach especially

760
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:24,719
because you're running out of time we

761
00:32:24,719 --> 00:32:28,109
don't have the luxury to to to get our

762
00:32:28,109 --> 00:32:30,869
act together over a decade like with all

763
00:32:30,869 --> 00:32:34,169
the big standardization efforts that you

764
00:32:34,169 --> 00:32:38,580
see going on at IEC at ISA etc I don't

765
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:40,559
believe that we have the luxury I think

766
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:42,749
presently our biggest problem is that we

767
00:32:42,749 --> 00:32:46,320
are out run not just by the threats by

768
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:48,690
oh by all the attackers in this world

769
00:32:48,690 --> 00:32:53,299
but just by the complexity alone then so

770
00:32:53,299 --> 00:32:57,509
this is this has been my my approach for

771
00:32:57,509 --> 00:32:59,210
the last couple of years don't wait

772
00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:02,549
until you reach any consensus again I'm

773
00:33:02,549 --> 00:33:05,190
happy to to have a debate on the metrics

774
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:05,440
that

775
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,389
we're using it and the basics are

776
00:33:07,389 --> 00:33:10,149
actually published in in the white paper

777
00:33:10,149 --> 00:33:12,669
the ripe ot security framework that you

778
00:33:12,669 --> 00:33:15,549
can find on the internet but experience

779
00:33:15,549 --> 00:33:17,139
has shown it works it works pretty well

780
00:33:17,139 --> 00:33:19,419
it is not perfect but it that it helps

781
00:33:19,419 --> 00:33:22,809
guide the effort for all clients for for

782
00:33:22,809 --> 00:33:25,750
the asset owners even though we have a

783
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:27,730
regulator who is quite happy with that

784
00:33:27,730 --> 00:33:30,250
approach so I'm probably much more

785
00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:32,200
optimistic than you are and and and I

786
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:34,000
will agree that that we deftly can't

787
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,600
wait for a consensus or even a right

788
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,850
solution that we have to try things and

789
00:33:39,850 --> 00:33:42,129
and see when they work and then spread

790
00:33:42,129 --> 00:33:43,480
the word throughout the industry so I

791
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:44,830
totally agree with your approach and I

792
00:33:44,830 --> 00:33:46,750
think that right is another good

793
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:48,460
mechanism for that but once again

794
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:49,899
someone mentioned before that some

795
00:33:49,899 --> 00:33:51,940
machine learning algorithms or maybe the

796
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:54,879
motion sensor of a game that can that

797
00:33:54,879 --> 00:33:56,860
can predict your movements once they got

798
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:58,149
it working they went back and said we

799
00:33:58,149 --> 00:33:59,950
really don't know why it works but it's

800
00:33:59,950 --> 00:34:01,899
working well and I think too for it to

801
00:34:01,899 --> 00:34:03,190
be the science we really have to be able

802
00:34:03,190 --> 00:34:04,960
to understand because then we won't be

803
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,879
able to push off from it to the next

804
00:34:06,879 --> 00:34:09,960
step you know one thing that I heard

805
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:14,260
throughout a number of sessions in and I

806
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:15,760
just heard it again is this concept of

807
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:18,940
time you know that our cycle time in

808
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:22,839
this space is traditionally very slow

809
00:34:22,839 --> 00:34:25,480
very slow adopters I think Brian Owen

810
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,730
brought it up in the certification panel

811
00:34:27,730 --> 00:34:28,960
you know if you're talking about

812
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:31,750
certifying products and in your writing

813
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:33,969
new code every three weeks or 12 weeks

814
00:34:33,969 --> 00:34:36,819
and deploying it with what you mentioned

815
00:34:36,819 --> 00:34:39,069
about IOT I mean they're running

816
00:34:39,069 --> 00:34:41,319
full-speed they're not going to wait for

817
00:34:41,319 --> 00:34:46,389
this community to catch up do you have

818
00:34:46,389 --> 00:34:49,089
any idea how we accelerate this

819
00:34:49,089 --> 00:34:53,319
community ability to bring in change and

820
00:34:53,319 --> 00:34:55,719
bring in new ideas you've you've been

821
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:58,150
convicted so many conferences in your

822
00:34:58,150 --> 00:35:00,760
roles over the years you know this

823
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:03,160
community very well how how do we change

824
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:06,339
that culture so that we do the change

825
00:35:06,339 --> 00:35:08,140
quickly well you know I don't think it's

826
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:09,730
necessarily you know say you know this

827
00:35:09,730 --> 00:35:13,050
community the community of engineers

828
00:35:13,050 --> 00:35:15,220
cybersecurity professionals IT

829
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:17,670
professionals we're all ready to jump in

830
00:35:17,670 --> 00:35:19,410
I've mentioned to both you guys before

831
00:35:19,410 --> 00:35:21,779
that I'm so sick of hearing about the

832
00:35:21,779 --> 00:35:24,059
latest wake-up call that we've had in

833
00:35:24,059 --> 00:35:25,499
the industry it's amazing any of us get

834
00:35:25,499 --> 00:35:28,589
to sleep at all because I know every

835
00:35:28,589 --> 00:35:30,059
every week every month there's a new

836
00:35:30,059 --> 00:35:31,559
flavor attack of the day and it's like

837
00:35:31,559 --> 00:35:33,480
oh this will change everything right you

838
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:36,420
know CEOs are now on board and I call it

839
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:38,069
the half-life of awareness sometimes you

840
00:35:38,069 --> 00:35:39,599
know when something bad happens if

841
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:41,099
nothing else bad happens in a week it

842
00:35:41,099 --> 00:35:43,079
dies down as a month it dies down again

843
00:35:43,079 --> 00:35:45,329
and once again people that have other

844
00:35:45,329 --> 00:35:47,309
problems that they have to focus on um

845
00:35:47,309 --> 00:35:49,739
and so you know I'm not one of those you

846
00:35:49,739 --> 00:35:51,329
know who likes to tout the cyber Pearl

847
00:35:51,329 --> 00:35:54,140
Harbor but you know things do happen

848
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:57,029
attacks have happened you know you know

849
00:35:57,029 --> 00:35:59,700
botnets of IOT devices etc we see all

850
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:01,950
this happening but until it happens to a

851
00:36:01,950 --> 00:36:03,930
specific industry or a specific company

852
00:36:03,930 --> 00:36:06,960
they don't tend to be on board until

853
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,369
they've had their own awakening and we

854
00:36:08,369 --> 00:36:09,480
have to be able to leverage the

855
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:12,599
awakenings if nothing else I would also

856
00:36:12,599 --> 00:36:15,630
think that you're observing some kind of

857
00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:18,859
a mindset problem here and I think that

858
00:36:18,859 --> 00:36:22,230
overall the the mindset in the whole

859
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:24,420
factory automation community and even in

860
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:25,920
some parts of the service security

861
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,839
community or in the ot security

862
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:31,890
community is a pretty static like let's

863
00:36:31,890 --> 00:36:34,319
just wait for what is evolving in terms

864
00:36:34,319 --> 00:36:36,569
of standards for example so what what I

865
00:36:36,569 --> 00:36:38,430
would like to see and I think we were

866
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:40,529
seeing the beginnings of this is that

867
00:36:40,529 --> 00:36:43,319
that some smart people some smart

868
00:36:43,319 --> 00:36:46,470
companies some innovative companies just

869
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:51,390
start to to get bold again yet just turn

870
00:36:51,390 --> 00:36:53,489
back the clock a couple of decades I

871
00:36:53,489 --> 00:36:59,089
think when more econ decades ago and

872
00:36:59,089 --> 00:37:02,549
develop the develop the Modbus protocol

873
00:37:02,549 --> 00:37:07,470
it was kind of bold oh I mean that they

874
00:37:07,470 --> 00:37:10,589
just put in so I cannot imagine that

875
00:37:10,589 --> 00:37:13,680
they had a real task force working for

876
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:15,749
weeks or months on the protocol

877
00:37:15,749 --> 00:37:17,519
definition to me it appears like this

878
00:37:17,519 --> 00:37:20,940
was done over over a weekend like a

879
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:23,339
rainy weekend and then some some

880
00:37:23,339 --> 00:37:25,140
engineer said well you know I have

881
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:26,999
nothing better to do nothing good on TV

882
00:37:26,999 --> 00:37:29,580
so just define that protocol

883
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:33,030
and I have been missing that same spirit

884
00:37:33,030 --> 00:37:34,800
well let's just come up with a smart

885
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:37,950
solution and we will see chances are if

886
00:37:37,950 --> 00:37:40,740
it's really smart and and if it produces

887
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:42,360
some benefit then the market will

888
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:45,510
actually use that so in this respect I

889
00:37:45,510 --> 00:37:47,880
want to encourage everybody just come up

890
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:50,490
with your local smart solutions and I'm

891
00:37:50,490 --> 00:37:54,000
actually pretty optimistic that we are

892
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:58,770
in in a time where change is about to

893
00:37:58,770 --> 00:37:59,130
happen

894
00:37:59,130 --> 00:38:01,980
in this area and this field change is

895
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:05,220
about to happen so as most of you will

896
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:07,110
know there are a couple of stars up

897
00:38:07,110 --> 00:38:11,280
recently which have successfully raised

898
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:14,280
a lot of venture capital I think the

899
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:17,580
time is right to for entrepreneurs or

900
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:20,130
smart companies or even scientists if

901
00:38:20,130 --> 00:38:23,400
you're working at the academia to just

902
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:26,160
come up with a smart solution and I

903
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:28,170
think the chances have never been better

904
00:38:28,170 --> 00:38:30,360
that that this complete static

905
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:32,490
environment will pick up your solution

906
00:38:32,490 --> 00:38:37,230
and you will have defined the next de

907
00:38:37,230 --> 00:38:39,270
facto standard let's just hope it's

908
00:38:39,270 --> 00:38:41,160
going to be better than Modbus yeah well

909
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:42,120
you know I think you have a good point

910
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:44,310
there and and timing is a lot I know a

911
00:38:44,310 --> 00:38:46,020
lot of innovators and adventures you

912
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:47,160
know obviously work in the last nine

913
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:50,730
years with DHS S&T and the cycle times

914
00:38:50,730 --> 00:38:52,820
for you know government procurement

915
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:55,110
industry procurement and others that can

916
00:38:55,110 --> 00:38:56,430
be very long but if there's a solution

917
00:38:56,430 --> 00:38:58,230
that's that's needed to build by things

918
00:38:58,230 --> 00:39:00,270
and I think that time Modbus came out

919
00:39:00,270 --> 00:39:01,650
there was getting ready to be an

920
00:39:01,650 --> 00:39:03,780
explosion of automation you know at that

921
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:05,130
level and they were there at the right

922
00:39:05,130 --> 00:39:06,510
time with them you know one of the the

923
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:08,430
first things available I think that as

924
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:09,960
you mentioned now there is getting ready

925
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:12,390
to be another explosion and trying to

926
00:39:12,390 --> 00:39:14,190
you know foresee the types of things

927
00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:15,570
that people will need the way to you

928
00:39:15,570 --> 00:39:18,210
know bring autonomy or automation and

929
00:39:18,210 --> 00:39:19,710
I'm not sure that economy is something

930
00:39:19,710 --> 00:39:22,560
that we're ready for yet within this is

931
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:25,650
a area with all of the the data that

932
00:39:25,650 --> 00:39:26,700
we're going to have to be able to use

933
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:29,760
that data for the sensing of operations

934
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:32,250
of security of other areas may be the

935
00:39:32,250 --> 00:39:33,990
thing that will will get us to that next

936
00:39:33,990 --> 00:39:37,530
phase okay well why don't we close with

937
00:39:37,530 --> 00:39:39,750
I mentioned again at the beginning of

938
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:40,900
the conference

939
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:43,420
Peter teal question you know what is

940
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:45,579
something that you believe to be true

941
00:39:45,579 --> 00:39:49,599
that most of your colleagues and other

942
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:52,119
people in the industry disagree with and

943
00:39:52,119 --> 00:39:54,549
and Zac I'll let you go in disagree with

944
00:39:54,549 --> 00:39:55,900
anything I say right that's what

945
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:57,880
happened there um it's always easy for

946
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:59,980
me because I'm so disagreeable right but

947
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:02,559
I'm sure I blow it up for you so of life

948
00:40:02,559 --> 00:40:03,940
I think I've already mentioned I think

949
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:06,789
that that's a true true metrics are are

950
00:40:06,789 --> 00:40:08,710
really important and we're going to you

951
00:40:08,710 --> 00:40:10,059
know miss the fact that we don't have

952
00:40:10,059 --> 00:40:12,249
them very soon and I would beat the drum

953
00:40:12,249 --> 00:40:13,930
for you know studying metrics and

954
00:40:13,930 --> 00:40:15,730
getting a baseline so that we know where

955
00:40:15,730 --> 00:40:16,990
we're at in the future that's

956
00:40:16,990 --> 00:40:19,720
interesting so you think that that the

957
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:23,019
importance of metrics is not recognized

958
00:40:23,019 --> 00:40:25,059
by the community again I don't think

959
00:40:25,059 --> 00:40:27,220
we're doing anything about it okay

960
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:30,609
well as for me so a thing but what most

961
00:40:30,609 --> 00:40:32,740
people disagree on what with me is that

962
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:35,980
I am convinced absolutely convinced that

963
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:38,529
we can solve this problem we can make

964
00:40:38,529 --> 00:40:42,630
critical infrastructure Osiris secure

965
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:49,150
just do it yes I actually don't disagree

966
00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:51,910
with you on that I think I there's

967
00:40:51,910 --> 00:40:55,210
actually a session I did at s4 Europe

968
00:40:55,210 --> 00:40:57,369
called defense will win and people were

969
00:40:57,369 --> 00:41:00,039
just shocked but I I really I really

970
00:41:00,039 --> 00:41:02,559
think we have advantages in our sector

971
00:41:02,559 --> 00:41:05,019
that are completely different Dale has

972
00:41:05,019 --> 00:41:09,730
changed I mean you know I don't know

973
00:41:09,730 --> 00:41:11,950
maybe I don't know my daughter or

974
00:41:11,950 --> 00:41:14,529
something oil even finalized something

975
00:41:14,529 --> 00:41:17,319
but in any event I really appreciate you

976
00:41:17,319 --> 00:41:19,690
guys coming up here and sharing your

977
00:41:19,690 --> 00:41:22,029
thoughts and raising some new things

978
00:41:22,029 --> 00:41:25,119
that maybe people can discuss over beer

979
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:28,150
I hear them pouring beer behind us so

980
00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:29,799
I'm I'm hoping they're ready for the

981
00:41:29,799 --> 00:41:32,079
craft beer bash if if they're listening

982
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:34,150
back there you need to remember to bring

983
00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:36,099
up the ramp or they'll storm the stage

984
00:41:36,099 --> 00:41:39,130
and and they won't be able to get up

985
00:41:39,130 --> 00:41:41,920
