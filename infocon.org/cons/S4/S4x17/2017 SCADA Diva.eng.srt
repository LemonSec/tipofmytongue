1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:04,859

2
00:00:04,859 --> 00:00:07,560
tradition I have a prepared speech to

3
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:10,380
read from from someone that's well-known

4
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:13,590
in the community so every year at s4 we

5
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:15,240
look to the future of control system

6
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:17,100
security while learning from our pasts

7
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,529
hot issues come and go discussions and

8
00:00:19,529 --> 00:00:20,840
arguments are made for ones position

9
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:23,130
research is shared but it's the people

10
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:24,840
that are most important to the continued

11
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:27,000
success of the community this year we'd

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,590
like to recognize one person in the

13
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:30,119

14
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:32,399

15
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:41,670

17
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:45,600
to the recipient to stay grounded in

18
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,940
their craft not to be swayed by popular

19
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:50,160
opinion to not degrade into marketing

20
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,739
speak to resist the urge to upload new

21
00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:54,870
malware used to hack electrical grids to

22
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:55,649
virustotal

23
00:00:55,649 --> 00:00:59,039
to further advances in ICS pew-pew cyber

24
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:01,739
maps to not publish attack white papers

25
00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:03,510
publicly without White House approval

26
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:05,670
and to be open to others thoughts and

27
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:08,700
opinions in recognition of this person's

28
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:10,950
passion for ICS security and to their

29
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:11,729
future success

30
00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:14,670
