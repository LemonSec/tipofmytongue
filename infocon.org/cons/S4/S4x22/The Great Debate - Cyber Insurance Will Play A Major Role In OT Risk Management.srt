1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,240
foreign

2
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:07,980
good morning we've got the great debate

3
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:09,300
here to start out the day a little

4
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:12,840
arguing uh between two friends so that

5
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:14,639
should be fun I just had a couple things

6
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:16,079
I want to say first of all welcome to

7
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:19,020
day three uh we need to bring the energy

8
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:21,359
today I thought I could get like the

9
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:23,220
Tony Robbins dancers up here and you

10
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:24,960
could all dance but I know my crowd I

11
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,039
don't think that would have gone over

12
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:28,380
too well but you know we got to bring up

13
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:29,939
the energy day three we've got a great

14
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:32,220
schedule for you as you see we're not

15
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:34,920
over at the Fillmore one of the things

16
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:37,020
that happened when we moved the day was

17
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:39,480
it was really hard to find venues so we

18
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:42,360
were adaptable we were resilient and so

19
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:44,280
today we'll just be over here

20
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,379
uh lunch is a little bit different

21
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:49,260
lunches at the food trucks across the

22
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:51,360
street and what the tent is still up you

23
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:52,860
can use the tent if you want you know

24
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:55,199
just to talk to someone today

25
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:57,660
and then we will have some box lunches

26
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:59,219
here so if you need to get lunch fast

27
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:02,520
you can grab a box lunch the only tricky

28
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,860
part is is this is actually a social

29
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:07,680
function building for a synagogue and

30
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,720
we're in the middle of Passover

31
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:13,020
so please don't bring food outside food

32
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:14,640
or drink in here because there's certain

33
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,740
foods that are not supposed to be in

34
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:19,020
this for religious regions

35
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:20,220
uh

36
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:22,380
let's see I had two other things for you

37
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:24,420
the second the second to last one is

38
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:26,640
this afternoon at two we have

39
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,680
unsolicited response which is really fun

40
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,299
we we give

41
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:33,299
any attendee five minutes on this stage

42
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:35,880
to make their case they can make it

43
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,280
funny they can make it serious they can

44
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,500
give a crazy new idea I've had people

45
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,659
come up and tell me everything that I

46
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:46,680
said was wrong so you can you can

47
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,540
you know hit on a speech that you didn't

48
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:50,939
like or something you had a Twist on but

49
00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:53,340
if you do have an unsolicited response

50
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:56,100
you need to get on the list here so you

51
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:58,259
come and see either myself or Kate Kate

52
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:00,240
are you back there somewhere she's over

53
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,700
there there's Kate so see one of us will

54
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,860
put you on the list it we I already have

55
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:06,780
three it tends to fill up fast we have

56
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:09,419
spots for 10 or 12. Patrick Miller will

57
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:11,879
put him on the list but uh that's always

58
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:12,840
fun

59
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,480
and then after the closing panel we also

60
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,700
have the craft beer bash here so you

61
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:19,020
want to stick around like that we don't

62
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:21,360
like people just to wander out after the

63
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,980
last talk we like to have a little bit

64
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:25,319
of fun so stick around for the full day

65
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:28,020
the last thing that Liz told me to say

66
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:30,900
is we have some swag left over

67
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:33,000
so if you're a woman and you want a

68
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,980
woman in ICS t-shirt there's a few of

69
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:36,540
those left downstairs there's some

70
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:39,420
stickers there's some old S420 shirts

71
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:41,400
some cherry water bands a variety of

72
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,319
other stuff so that's right down by the

73
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:44,580
entrance

74
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:47,519
uh with that I think we'll get into the

75
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:48,540
debate

76
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:50,879
so we have a topic and we do this

77
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,580
standard debate style we'll do

78
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:56,160
Pro con rebuttal rebuttal and they'll

79
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,140
get to ask each other a question our our

80
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:00,739
debate topic this year or questioning is

81
00:03:00,739 --> 00:03:03,599
cyber insurance will play a major role

82
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:06,420
in OT cyber risk management in three to

83
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:07,980
five years

84
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:10,680
arguing the pro side that yes it will is

85
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:14,340
Monica tigliano and arguing the consite

86
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:17,819
no it will not is Dave White

87
00:03:17,819 --> 00:03:20,519
I just want to give you one caveat and

88
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:22,980
I'll say it at the end this does not

89
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:25,319
necessarily reflect their opinions they

90
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:27,060
may agree with some or all of what they

91
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:28,800
say or none of what they say their job

92
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,200
is to be the strongest advocate for

93
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,700
whether cyber insurance will play a

94
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:35,700
major role in risk management or not

95
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:38,519
and with that I think oh I want to take

96
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:40,980
a poll first so let's let's pull the

97
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:42,540
Audience by a show of hands how many

98
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:44,640
people think cyber insurance will play a

99
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,680
major role in OT cyber risk management

100
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,480
in three to five years raise your hand

101
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,700
if you think it will

102
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:54,599
okay put the hands down how many people

103
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:57,480
think it will not

104
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,860
I know you're just voting for her

105
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:00,500
because she's beautiful

106
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:03,360
so so I I got a little did you both get

107
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,159
a little more a little more yes and no

108
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:06,659
okay so that's where we're starting out

109
00:04:06,659 --> 00:04:09,180
we'll take a poll at the end okay so

110
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:11,580
Monica has five minutes on the clock go

111
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:12,780
ahead Monica

112
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:14,640
well thank you all for attending an

113
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,160
insurance talk bright and early

114
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,839
um I do think some of you might be some

115
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:20,820
form of wizards to be able to volunteer

116
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:24,240
to be insuranced out by 9 30.

117
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,940
um I did think the talk should have been

118
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:29,340
insure or don't insure

119
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:32,400
you must not try

120
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,160
um it's it's really because all

121
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:38,340
organizations have a form of risk we're

122
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:39,720
talking about operational technology

123
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:42,240
risk in this case and the way to manage

124
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,100
it comes in different risk treatments

125
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:46,560
but risk transfer is one of the critical

126
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,780
things you need to do

127
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:52,500
now not all insurance is equal and

128
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,540
today's topic is centered around cyber

129
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:57,360
insurance it's only about 20 years old

130
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,180
cyber insurance but it was designed to

131
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:02,460
cover risks that arose out of data and

132
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:05,699
Technology a strange Concept in the

133
00:05:05,699 --> 00:05:10,080
early 2000s or late 1990s

134
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,360
um it's also important to note that

135
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,040
irrespective of whether you agree or

136
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,380
disagree that insurance will play a

137
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:18,540
major role the only way to hedge your

138
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:20,759
risk and the current environment through

139
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:22,680
a financial product is through cyber

140
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,780
insurance

141
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:26,699
now typically there's three main

142
00:05:26,699 --> 00:05:29,580
arguments to get you on board with what

143
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:32,660
I'm saying but I felt a bit adventurous

144
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:35,160
and also as a result of your curiosity

145
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,020
of attending the talk today I'm going to

146
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:39,180
provide you with four reasons why

147
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:40,800
insurance is going to play a major role

148
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,259
in OT risk management

149
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:46,320
so in no particular order we have the

150
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,120
role that insurance plays in terms of

151
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,160
supporting long-term investment

152
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,680
the second would be managing

153
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,300
catastrophic events

154
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,660
the third is efficient use of capital

155
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:59,820
and the fourth and this is probably the

156
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:02,160
most controversial it is evidence of a

157
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,120
mature

158
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,280
risk management program

159
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,139
so if we think about the long-term

160
00:06:07,139 --> 00:06:09,539
investment argument

161
00:06:09,539 --> 00:06:12,479
typically decisions have to be made from

162
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:13,979
an operational technology perspective

163
00:06:13,979 --> 00:06:17,460
for 10 20 30 40 years in advance

164
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:20,039
and the way we can manage that risk

165
00:06:20,039 --> 00:06:22,139
differs in the beginning versus maybe

166
00:06:22,139 --> 00:06:24,120
towards the end of the life cycle of

167
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,500
that investment

168
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,720
and we can argue that Capital

169
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,699
expenditures can continue throughout the

170
00:06:29,699 --> 00:06:31,440
course of that project

171
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,960
but really the way to smooth out what we

172
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,479
call the risk curve is to be able to

173
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,880
transfer that risk at any one point to

174
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,880
manage those unknown unknowns

175
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:45,300
if we look at digital transformation in

176
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:48,000
energy manufacturing it's pretty

177
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,280
important to realize that no matter how

178
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:53,580
you try to project manage organize

179
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,259
yourselves there are things that are

180
00:06:55,259 --> 00:06:57,360
completely outside of your control as

181
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,740
you move

182
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:01,080
towards the future

183
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,300
and mergers and Acquisitions also

184
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:06,180
present quite a high risk for

185
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:06,900
um

186
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:09,240
investing in long-term decisions

187
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:12,180
so when you look at contracts to manage

188
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:14,280
your liability if you do your due

189
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,740
diligence on a third party we still are

190
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:19,919
operating in a commercial environment

191
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:23,460
so there is risk now catastrophic events

192
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:26,099
are probably the most important for this

193
00:07:26,099 --> 00:07:28,380
space because we look at cyber terrorism

194
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:32,400
cyber sabotage supply chain risks all

195
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,139
that can produce catastrophic events

196
00:07:34,139 --> 00:07:37,080
that are not really in the risk

197
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:39,120
tolerance of an organization so you

198
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,699
could put some money aside for a rainy

199
00:07:41,699 --> 00:07:44,940
day but it's never going to be enough to

200
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:47,340
actually help with the irreparable harm

201
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:49,380
that an organization can suffer from a

202
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:51,180
catastrophic event

203
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:53,880
and that brings me to managing your

204
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,319
Capital efficiently

205
00:07:55,319 --> 00:07:58,199
can't just store hundreds of millions of

206
00:07:58,199 --> 00:08:00,720
dollars aside for when something bad

207
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,099
happens

208
00:08:02,099 --> 00:08:03,960
it's much smarter to be able to

209
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:07,020
contribute to a pool of risk

210
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:08,880
pay in spread your risk with other

211
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:11,639
organizations and be able to manage a

212
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:15,479
sort of catastrophic event in the future

213
00:08:15,479 --> 00:08:19,020
now lastly the controversial argument is

214
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:22,020
that risk transfer insurance is an

215
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:23,879
Evidence of a mature risk management

216
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:25,199
program

217
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,060
to be able to transfer risk you have to

218
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:28,979
identify it and you have to assess it

219
00:08:28,979 --> 00:08:31,379
you go through a lengthy due diligence

220
00:08:31,379 --> 00:08:33,899
process to be able to assert what your

221
00:08:33,899 --> 00:08:35,820
risk is and have that third party accept

222
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:37,080
it

223
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,839
board of directors like this they like

224
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:41,700
the process because it actually gives

225
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:44,279
them Clarity that something did happen

226
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:46,560
we did identify it we did assess it and

227
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,760
we then made a decision about

228
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:51,060
transferring it it protects them from

229
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:52,920
their own personal liability issues and

230
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:55,260
they have to maintain a high standard of

231
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:57,000
care around making decisions for

232
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,100
shareholders

233
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:01,019
other stakeholders

234
00:09:01,019 --> 00:09:03,240
can be governments or customers and

235
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:06,240
suppliers and if we look at

236
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,680
OT risk management or risk transfer

237
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,019
through their lens we see how major of a

238
00:09:10,019 --> 00:09:11,459
role it can play

239
00:09:11,459 --> 00:09:13,740
governments believe that insurance

240
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:17,040
provides economic resilience

241
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,260
and it also puts the onus on the private

242
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:21,180
sector to figure out a way to risk

243
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:23,760
manage and customers and suppliers they

244
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,019
want to know that there is somebody

245
00:09:25,019 --> 00:09:28,260
backing that third party or counterparty

246
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:30,000
risk in the event that something happens

247
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,160
they want to have viable Partners in the

248
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,720
future

249
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,100
so

250
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:37,920
I guess my message is

251
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,939
ensure we must

252
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,860
okay let's put five minutes back on the

253
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:49,620
clock Dave it's your turn all right

254
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:51,540
thank you thank you Dale thank you

255
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:52,920
Monica

256
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:56,100
um look I'm arguing that

257
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:58,260
cyber insurance will not play a major

258
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:01,080
role in OT risk management in the next

259
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:04,320
three to five years and you know

260
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,779
I and I'm disappointed in my argument

261
00:10:06,779 --> 00:10:09,180
because I really want it to and I

262
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:11,640
believe that it will one day but I

263
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,320
definitely don't think that it will in

264
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,700
the near term

265
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:17,399
look the promise of insurance is that we

266
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:18,839
pull risk

267
00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:21,720
and learn from claims so that we can all

268
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,880
become better risk as a result of

269
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:27,120
learning what the conditions of a risk

270
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,820
were before an event happened and then

271
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:31,560
what happened as a result of that risk

272
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,399
event

273
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:35,339
and so and if we look at you know early

274
00:10:35,339 --> 00:10:37,440
in the industrial revolution the

275
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,360
insurance industry is credited with

276
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,820
solving steam boiler risk and it did

277
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:44,459
that because industrial companies wanted

278
00:10:44,459 --> 00:10:47,160
Insurance insurers provided that

279
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,260
insurance and insurers learned from

280
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:51,540
those claims and then shared that

281
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:52,920
learning through the underwriting

282
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,720
process and through property risk

283
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,060
engineering and underwriting is just the

284
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:59,100
process that you know Monica does and a

285
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:00,720
lot of talented people in the industry

286
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:04,079
do to evaluate a company and then price

287
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:06,720
a risk for that company property risk

288
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,920
engineering is something that the

289
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,740
property insurance world does that I'm a

290
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:12,959
big fan of they actually send inspectors

291
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:16,320
out to facilities and those inspectors

292
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,560
find things that the insurer then asks

293
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,899
the insured to improve things like you

294
00:11:21,899 --> 00:11:24,240
need to replace the roof or you need to

295
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,279
upgrade the sprinkler system things like

296
00:11:26,279 --> 00:11:28,320
that and think about the other things

297
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,760
that we learned from the insurance

298
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,160
industry we learn which Medical

299
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,959
Treatments are more effective because of

300
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:35,399
all the data that we get from health

301
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:38,339
insurance we learn which geographies and

302
00:11:38,339 --> 00:11:40,500
which automobiles are more prone to car

303
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:43,399
accidents and theft from car insurance

304
00:11:43,399 --> 00:11:46,800
and we should all credit and thank the

305
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,779
Cyber insurance industry because they

306
00:11:48,779 --> 00:11:52,920
solved the point of sale theft of credit

307
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:56,279
card data several years ago remember you

308
00:11:56,279 --> 00:11:58,440
know five seven years ago when all of

309
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,940
the big cyber headlines were about

310
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:02,640
payment card breach events I think TJ

311
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:07,140
Maxx think target right and those events

312
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:10,380
led the insurance industry to demand

313
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:13,320
that insurance invest in end-to-end

314
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:16,019
encryption in point of sale systems

315
00:12:16,019 --> 00:12:18,060
and so it became after the target event

316
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:20,399
it became near impossible to get

317
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:22,320
insurance if you weren't making that

318
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,420
investment in end-to-end encryption of

319
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:27,120
payment card data and now we no longer

320
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,339
hear about big payment card breach

321
00:12:29,339 --> 00:12:31,920
events in point of sale Networks

322
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,660
because the retailers made those

323
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:35,519
Investments and those Investments were

324
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:37,200
driven by the insurance industry so we

325
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,279
have evidence that the insurance

326
00:12:38,279 --> 00:12:40,980
industry can do this

327
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:44,060
the problem is

328
00:12:44,279 --> 00:12:47,459
that that promise of insurance depends

329
00:12:47,459 --> 00:12:49,260
on data

330
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:51,420
and we're simply not going to have the

331
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:54,120
data for OT cyber risk in the next three

332
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,740
to five years and there are three

333
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:57,300
reasons that we're not going to have

334
00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:00,120
that data first insurers are not

335
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:02,579
offering policies that adequately

336
00:13:02,579 --> 00:13:05,880
address OT cyber risk you all know we

337
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:08,579
all know that OT cyber risk is the

338
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:11,040
gateway to physical damage as a result

339
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,839
of a cyber event

340
00:13:12,839 --> 00:13:14,339
these traditional cyber insurance

341
00:13:14,339 --> 00:13:16,680
policies that as Monica said were

342
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,779
created to deal with data events really

343
00:13:18,779 --> 00:13:21,600
data breach events ransomware events

344
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,260
those policies exclude physical damage

345
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:28,200
they don't cover physical damage so they

346
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:31,260
don't really fit OT cyber risk

347
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:33,420
there are Innovative insurers like

348
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:35,639
Monica Monica's company Munich re for

349
00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:38,639
one that are now offering policies for

350
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:40,980
physical damage cover but those insurers

351
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:44,100
are few and so there simply isn't enough

352
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,540
Insurance being offered in the

353
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:47,639
marketplace for OT cyber risk and number

354
00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:48,839
two

355
00:13:48,839 --> 00:13:51,899
companies that have OT cyber risk aren't

356
00:13:51,899 --> 00:13:54,000
demanding those policies look

357
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,220
historically companies with OT cyber

358
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:58,139
risk were confident that their property

359
00:13:58,139 --> 00:14:01,200
policies would cover any physical damage

360
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,540
many property policies are called all

361
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:05,459
Hazard policies they should cover that

362
00:14:05,459 --> 00:14:08,040
damage but that market has changed there

363
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,200
were some rule changes in London and

364
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:13,079
starting in 2020 property policies in

365
00:14:13,079 --> 00:14:15,180
the London Market have to either

366
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:17,940
explicitly include cyber as a cause of

367
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:21,000
loss or explicitly excluded and that has

368
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,760
led to a worldwide

369
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,860
increase in the number of property

370
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:27,600
policies that have very strong

371
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,060
exclusions for physical damage from

372
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:33,240
cyber events and so and companies aren't

373
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,040
demanding that coverage many companies

374
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,620
with OT cyber risk still believe that

375
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:38,940
their property policies are going to

376
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:40,800
cover it so they're really blind to that

377
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:44,519
Gap in their exposure and finally

378
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:46,920
we don't have enough claims so to get

379
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:49,440
data we need people we need insurers

380
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,139
selling insurers companies buying the OT

381
00:14:52,139 --> 00:14:54,839
cyber insurance and we need claims and

382
00:14:54,839 --> 00:14:56,579
fortunately we haven't seen a lot of

383
00:14:56,579 --> 00:14:59,040
claims that's really good news but

384
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,660
without those claims we don't have the

385
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:03,180
data for insurance for cyber Insurance

386
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:06,180
to be a major player in OT cyber risk

387
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:08,100
management in the near term in the next

388
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:10,699
three to five years okay thank you

389
00:15:10,699 --> 00:15:14,040
Monica rebuttal

390
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:16,860
it's true that insurance is a slow

391
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:18,420
moving industry

392
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:20,699
we have been able though to adapt in the

393
00:15:20,699 --> 00:15:22,440
last 20 years to be able to provide

394
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:25,139
specialized products so the barrier is

395
00:15:25,139 --> 00:15:27,120
to actually transferring risks are

396
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,519
pretty low it's the information exchange

397
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:32,820
between parties that is currently not

398
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:35,399
really robust enough

399
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:37,860
organizations that are not measuring

400
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:39,779
their own risk and not able to

401
00:15:39,779 --> 00:15:42,000
articulate it would not be able to give

402
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,220
Underwriters confidence to transfer that

403
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:47,279
risk so as organizations build more

404
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,079
maturity in their own data information

405
00:15:49,079 --> 00:15:51,240
and how they actually identify and

406
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,760
assess risk then the insurance industry

407
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:57,180
can take a different view on having more

408
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:59,399
capacity or more amount of insurance

409
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:01,560
available or

410
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:04,139
putting back the coverage where it was

411
00:16:04,139 --> 00:16:06,480
taken from

412
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,699
Dave's Point around the property

413
00:16:08,699 --> 00:16:10,740
insurance Market being all Hazard and

414
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:12,839
then perhaps having these technology

415
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:14,760
exclusions or cyber exclusions there

416
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:17,040
it's a good one it really comes from a

417
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,500
fear of not understanding how things

418
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,180
operate

419
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:24,120
and in an industry where it's just

420
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,459
mainly the pooling of risk from a

421
00:16:26,459 --> 00:16:28,199
property perspective and then looking at

422
00:16:28,199 --> 00:16:29,940
what happens from a climate perspective

423
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:32,760
an environmental change that's what is

424
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,399
conceptualized it's easier to understand

425
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:37,740
man-made risk has never been an easy

426
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:40,440
risk to transfer but as organizations

427
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,720
try to articulate that and what is

428
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:43,800
happening in their particular

429
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:47,220
environments we can then develop bespoke

430
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:49,199
risk transfer Solutions

431
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:51,060
which means that

432
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:53,339
we the insurance industry will not be

433
00:16:53,339 --> 00:16:54,899
able to do anything without the

434
00:16:54,899 --> 00:16:58,380
participation of risk professionals from

435
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:00,120
an OT perspective

436
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:02,279
so explaining the convergence of

437
00:17:02,279 --> 00:17:04,619
engineering to then OT and how you

438
00:17:04,619 --> 00:17:07,380
secure those operations that has to be

439
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:09,000
at the Forefront

440
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,179
of getting cyber Insurance to be as

441
00:17:12,179 --> 00:17:13,559
important as we think it is because

442
00:17:13,559 --> 00:17:15,839
those long-term investments will not be

443
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:18,059
protected by just spending more and more

444
00:17:18,059 --> 00:17:21,240
money there is no perfect security and

445
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,919
there will not be a way to predict the

446
00:17:22,919 --> 00:17:25,380
future so insurance is needed

447
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:27,359
the collaboration that we all have to

448
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:29,280
partake in though it's going to be hard

449
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:32,760
but three to five years that seems to be

450
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,880
quite a hefty time in my opinion in

451
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,620
terms of figuring out what we can do

452
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:40,080
with risk if we don't figure out what we

453
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,640
want to do with risk in three to five

454
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:45,539
years I'm not sure leaders CEOs CFOs are

455
00:17:45,539 --> 00:17:47,400
going to be very comfortable with that

456
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,760
Outlook

457
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:54,000
now the data issue that exists in

458
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,080
insurance

459
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:57,900
it's also related to Talent OR

460
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,580
traditionally there weren't a lot of

461
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:01,380
Industry professionals that went into

462
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:02,460
insurance

463
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:05,400
but we actually see quite an inflow of

464
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:08,100
Industry professionals or experts trying

465
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:11,700
to build that data flow and provide that

466
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:13,140
sort of information so that we can make

467
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:15,660
decisions and price risk

468
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:19,260
so the hiring of Engineers whether it be

469
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:22,200
mechanical electrical or computer

470
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,299
Engineers has really helped us to map

471
00:18:24,299 --> 00:18:25,559
out risk

472
00:18:25,559 --> 00:18:28,919
or working with third-party Specialists

473
00:18:28,919 --> 00:18:31,320
that build Frameworks and standards and

474
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,820
have the ability to collect the

475
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,559
information based on those standards and

476
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:37,440
Frameworks to then look back and see

477
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,120
where the losses are coming from

478
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:42,240
but without having organizations buying

479
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,539
insurance so making that a risk transfer

480
00:18:45,539 --> 00:18:47,520
priority we're never going to see the

481
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,679
data from the losses and the claims

482
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:52,500
so insurance companies are a venue for

483
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,240
exchanging information they always have

484
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,640
and loss prevention is at the core of

485
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:59,460
what we want to do for the OT space

486
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:02,280
but there has to be a dialogue

487
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:05,460
great thank you can we put five minutes

488
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:07,500
back on the clock

489
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:10,980
right so I I know Monica and I knew that

490
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:12,480
she would make some great arguments but

491
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,580
I still I still believe that it's not

492
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:16,980
going to happen in three to five years

493
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:17,760
um

494
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:21,179
look that and and you know a lot can

495
00:19:21,179 --> 00:19:23,160
happen in three to five years I mean

496
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,660
look at the last three to five years

497
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:27,480
look at the how fast our workplace

498
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,880
changed as a result of a biological

499
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:32,880
pandemic look at how fast ransomware

500
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,640
became the number one cyber event that

501
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:38,160
every organization was worried about and

502
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,080
look how fast international relations

503
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,299
and the nature of War changed as a

504
00:19:42,299 --> 00:19:44,160
result of the Russian attack on the

505
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:47,100
Ukraine that all happened in an instant

506
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:49,260
those things happened in an instant but

507
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:51,600
I don't believe that the insurance

508
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,480
industry is going to play a major risk

509
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,580
in OT cyber risk management in three to

510
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:59,940
five years for four reasons first the OT

511
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:02,460
cyber Risk insurance Market is nascent

512
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:05,039
there aren't enough insurers offering it

513
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:07,320
and there aren't enough companies asking

514
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,820
for it

515
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:10,620
second

516
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:12,480
the Cyber Insurance Market is

517
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,100
retrenching right now and it's

518
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:17,160
retrenching because of ransomware losses

519
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:19,679
look ransomware it's it's simple

520
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:22,799
business math if you're an insurer and

521
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:24,840
suddenly you find yourself paying out

522
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:27,660
more in claims on an annual basis then

523
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:29,580
you're taking in in premiums on an

524
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:32,160
annual basis then you start to wonder if

525
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,500
that product is viable

526
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,480
and that's what's happening in the

527
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,400
insurance industry there are a lot of

528
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,740
insurers losing money on Cyber insurance

529
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:43,140
right now and as a result you see rates

530
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:45,240
going up you see some insurers leaving

531
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:48,120
the market you see incredible increases

532
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:50,580
in underwriting scrutiny we have one

533
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:52,400
client who is the utility

534
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:55,980
that in addition to electricity and

535
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:57,660
natural gas they serve Water and

536
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:59,820
Wastewater one of their cyber insurers

537
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:01,620
said look we're we're finished with

538
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:03,299
water and wastewater we're no longer

539
00:21:03,299 --> 00:21:04,919
writing insurance for water and

540
00:21:04,919 --> 00:21:06,660
wastewater so they had to go and find a

541
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:09,480
new insurer this year right and their

542
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,820
application went from four pages last

543
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:15,419
year to 42 Pages this year and the board

544
00:21:15,419 --> 00:21:17,460
started asking the ciso questions of

545
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:20,039
like what are you doing wrong look at

546
00:21:20,039 --> 00:21:21,480
what's happening to our cyber insurance

547
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,580
rates what are you doing wrong without

548
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:25,980
understanding that it's not that company

549
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:27,960
they're not really doing anything wrong

550
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:30,000
it's the market but the market is

551
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,580
retrenching and insurers are scared of

552
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:34,260
the risk right now because they've been

553
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:36,480
stuck offering a lot of losses

554
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,340
oftentimes when that happens in the

555
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:40,440
insurance industry it's cyclical and

556
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:42,780
it's driven by you know a bad storm

557
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:46,080
season or a bad fire season

558
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,419
but the data that we see for cyber

559
00:21:48,419 --> 00:21:51,840
claims looks different they're going up

560
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,820
and to the right and they don't appear

561
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:56,880
to be cyclical at all and that's causing

562
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,580
some insurers to leave the market so the

563
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:02,940
the industry is retrenching

564
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:05,820
third you know it took eight years for

565
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:07,559
this traditional cyber Insurance the

566
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:09,419
insurance that excludes physical damage

567
00:22:09,419 --> 00:22:13,080
to go from a 35 percent market share in

568
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:16,980
the U.S to a 75 market share and so it

569
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:19,820
took eight years for that data Centric

570
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:24,299
I.T risk management product to go to a

571
00:22:24,299 --> 00:22:26,039
substantial market share in the U.S and

572
00:22:26,039 --> 00:22:27,120
I just don't think that we're going to

573
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,159
make that for

574
00:22:29,159 --> 00:22:32,460
OT cyber risk and finally insurers are

575
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:34,620
really afraid of systemic risk and

576
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:36,960
systemic risk is think about

577
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,419
um things like not Petra and solar winds

578
00:22:39,419 --> 00:22:42,120
when one event or one vulnerability

579
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:46,020
causes losses and claims across a large

580
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:48,659
number of insureds in a single insurer's

581
00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:51,840
book that's a systemic event and it's an

582
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,780
event that really calls into question

583
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:56,520
the amount of capacity that's available

584
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:59,100
in the marketplace and we've seen

585
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:01,260
systemic events really wreak havoc on

586
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:03,260
the industry in the past here in the U.S

587
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:06,179
after the terrorist attacks of 9 11

588
00:23:06,179 --> 00:23:08,760
which was a huge systemic event on

589
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,320
proper in the property insurance world

590
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:13,440
the U.S government stepped in through a

591
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,659
program called Tria and created a

592
00:23:15,659 --> 00:23:19,020
Federal backstop for terrorism risk in

593
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:20,400
property coverage

594
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,679
and so if the government were to do

595
00:23:22,679 --> 00:23:25,559
something like that for cyber risk

596
00:23:25,559 --> 00:23:27,419
cyber risk that's data only the

597
00:23:27,419 --> 00:23:29,100
conventional cyber insurance or cyber

598
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:31,380
risk that's OT cyber property damage

599
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:33,960
Insurance then that would have a huge

600
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,820
effect on insurers being comfortable

601
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:38,940
with systemic risk but that's very

602
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:41,159
unlikely in the current Congressional

603
00:23:41,159 --> 00:23:42,960
climate in the U.S

604
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,600
and so for those four reasons I don't

605
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,340
think that cyber insurance is going to

606
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:49,919
play a major role in OT cyber risk

607
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:51,059
management in the next three to five

608
00:23:51,059 --> 00:23:54,120
years okay great so for our last thing

609
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:58,219
can we put three minutes on the clock

610
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:00,720
perfect

611
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,940
so you have the opportunity to ask Dave

612
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:05,360
a question

613
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:09,419
um Dave what is the opportunity cost of

614
00:24:09,419 --> 00:24:11,659
accepting risk

615
00:24:11,659 --> 00:24:14,100
the opportunity cost I think you you

616
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:16,080
outlined it very well in your opening

617
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,720
remarks the opportunity cost is that

618
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,600
with an accepting risk organizations

619
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,960
need to be prepared to bear that risk on

620
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,880
the balance sheet right and so they've

621
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,480
got to put aside capital reserve to

622
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,640
um to back that risk and that takes

623
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:36,000
Capital away from fueling the businesses

624
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,240
growth and so the opportunity cost I

625
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:41,520
would say is growth right because that

626
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,679
money which would otherwise be invested

627
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:45,960
in the growth of the business

628
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:49,140
ends up being put on a Shelf

629
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:51,539
to back a risk that's unable to be back

630
00:24:51,539 --> 00:24:52,919
to the marketplace and that's that's

631
00:24:52,919 --> 00:24:55,679
really the opportunity cost okay

632
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:57,480
you have a chance to ask Monica a

633
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:58,440
question

634
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,179
so Monica

635
00:25:00,179 --> 00:25:02,100
um I know that Munich re is one of the

636
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:04,320
companies that's offering cyber physical

637
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:08,220
damage cover and I applaud you for that

638
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:10,380
um it's a coverage that I think the

639
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:13,559
world needs and I'm curious if you could

640
00:25:13,559 --> 00:25:15,840
just share

641
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,880
how much of that coverage is available

642
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:20,460
today if if I'm a company that has a lot

643
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:22,500
of OT cyber risk how much of that

644
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:25,080
coverage can I buy where can I get it

645
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,940
and how do you see that changing over

646
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:28,440
the next few years

647
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,539
what's the Market's attitude toward it

648
00:25:30,539 --> 00:25:31,860
yeah

649
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:34,200
so at the moment there's about 300

650
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,360
million worth of cyber physical damage

651
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:38,520
coverage in the market and that's on the

652
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:40,380
backdrop of about

653
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:43,200
9 billion in terms of Premium compared

654
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:46,679
to trillions in the property Market

655
00:25:46,679 --> 00:25:49,380
it's really in the last five years that

656
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:51,900
we've seen the build up of that 300

657
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:54,059
million of capacity

658
00:25:54,059 --> 00:25:57,299
it's really from major insurers out

659
00:25:57,299 --> 00:25:59,039
there that have Global operations that

660
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:00,659
can also understand the different

661
00:26:00,659 --> 00:26:03,360
product lines so

662
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,580
you would have to ensure property risk

663
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:07,679
for a while to be able to understand how

664
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:09,720
cyber then connects into property risk

665
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:12,720
so we have about 12 major markets at the

666
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:15,600
moment that offer between 10 million to

667
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:19,200
25 million of capacity or of insurance

668
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,620
but then there are specialized

669
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:24,659
facilities that have developed to offer

670
00:26:24,659 --> 00:26:28,159
most of that capacity

671
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:31,679
the growth is not there because there is

672
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:33,539
no real demand

673
00:26:33,539 --> 00:26:37,140
but the questions that organizations are

674
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:40,260
posing is how can we get there and the

675
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:42,720
way we've gotten here is major

676
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:45,240
corporations wanting to invest little by

677
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:48,480
little premiums every year to build that

678
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:51,539
pot of of money to be able to pay those

679
00:26:51,539 --> 00:26:53,520
severe losses

680
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,620
I think in the next three to five years

681
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:58,140
we're going to see more property

682
00:26:58,140 --> 00:26:59,700
insurers

683
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:02,279
come back and offer cyber property

684
00:27:02,279 --> 00:27:03,360
damage

685
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,100
because there's going to be an exchange

686
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:07,620
of information across classes

687
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:12,059
so leveraging the expertise that

688
00:27:12,059 --> 00:27:14,460
cyber Underwriters have with property

689
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:16,260
Underwriters to be able to then go back

690
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:17,880
to the billions of dollars of insurance

691
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:21,000
that are offered in the property Market

692
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,700
but it's a chicken and egg problem yeah

693
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:26,100
okay well thank you very much both of

694
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:29,400
you so I just want to remind everyone

695
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:32,039
they were debating for their side so

696
00:27:32,039 --> 00:27:35,760
don't don't like tweet out that Dave

697
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:38,940
thinks all insurance companies are evil

698
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:42,240
or anything like that or Monica says

699
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,880
everyone needs to buy it right now you

700
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,440
know they were just their proponents and

701
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:48,000
they did a great job I thought let's get

702
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,220
let's just ask the question again let me

703
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:52,740
make sure I get the exact wording cyber

704
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:54,600
insurance will play a major role in OT

705
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:57,059
cyber risk management in three to five

706
00:27:57,059 --> 00:27:59,400
years let's see a show of hands who say

707
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,320
yes to that

708
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:03,000
now see this is tricky because we have

709
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,260
more people in the room now

710
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:06,480
[Laughter]

711
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:09,299
and how many people say no it will not

712
00:28:09,299 --> 00:28:11,940
play a major role

713
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:15,179
pretty same same percentages but I I

714
00:28:15,179 --> 00:28:16,860
thought they both did a great job can we

715
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:19,340
give them a hand
