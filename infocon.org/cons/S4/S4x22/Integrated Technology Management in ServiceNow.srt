00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,120
hello everyone i am karan srivasta i am

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:08,720
director of product management at

3
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,040
servicenow

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,480
and first of all i want to start the

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,480
presentation by saying

6
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,160
why the heck servicenow is here at an

7
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:17,760
ics security event i've gotten this

8
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:18,640
question

9
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,880
quite a bit today

10
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,039
but as you guys know we have we have

11
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:25,359
heard this over and over again how

12
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:27,279
important it is to do asset inventory

13
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:29,279
how important it is to

14
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,119
do vulnerability management security

15
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:33,120
incident response

16
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,800
and if you are familiar with some of

17
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,520
servicenow's products like it operations

18
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,280
management

19
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,200
security operations and our most famous

20
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,680
product i.t service management you would

21
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,760
starting to get an idea of why i'm here

22
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,840
today so today i'm specifically going to

23
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,440
talk about

24
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,239
how

25
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:52,079
the landscape of it and ot are coming

26
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:53,840
together and how servicenow's

27
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,760
operational operational technology

28
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,199
management

29
00:00:57,199 --> 00:00:58,480
is helping

30
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,199
customers today to manage unplanned

31
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:04,879
downtime uh to uh cut costs and also

32
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,159
improve uh the the security

33
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:10,880
aspects of ot environment that they have

34
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:14,240
um having a unified

35
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:18,080
plan of governance is helping csos and

36
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,240
cios across the manufacturing

37
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:23,600
environment by using servicenow

38
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,360
so let me start by giving some

39
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,600
introduction of what servicenow did

40
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,280
before we jumped into operational

41
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,960
technology management

42
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,600
uh we spoke to numerous manufacturers

43
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,200
across the

44
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,479
manufacturing

45
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:39,119
vertical horizontal um

46
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:41,920
and collected information about what is

47
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,079
the some of the most important things uh

48
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:45,840
to them today

49
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,799
and we found out that ot as everybody

50
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:50,479
here knows is the heartbeat for

51
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:51,840
manufacturing

52
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,040
and with industry 4.2 with rapid

53
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,119
modernization with industrial iot

54
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:58,880
devices adoption

55
00:01:58,880 --> 00:01:59,759
what

56
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:02,640
cios and csos and other manufacturer and

57
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,600
other

58
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,920
important figures in manufacturing arena

59
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,038
are realizing that

60
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:10,959
their cyber security risk has gone up

61
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:13,920
significantly which has led to

62
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,520
any unplanned down

63
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,680
a lot of unplanned downtime that they

64
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,920
were not managing previously and

65
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,879
that has led to higher cost our research

66
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:24,160
shows that

67
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,879
in automotive industry an hour of

68
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:29,040
unplanned downtime can lead to anywhere

69
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,959
from 250 000

70
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:33,440
to 750 000 in losses i mean this is a

71
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,519
significant amount of money that

72
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:38,239
manufacturers are losing today

73
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:40,560
it's not a it's not a secret

74
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,920
ot

75
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,160
environment is the second most attacked

76
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,319
environment today

77
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:48,319
and you have seen numerous examples of

78
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:50,879
it um you know colonial pipeline is one

79
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,400
of the most recent one that pops in my

80
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,000
mind

81
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,120
and

82
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,599
so we started looking at what servicenow

83
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:59,680
has historically offered in the world of

84
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,920
i.t and what can we bring in the world

85
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,440
of operational technology that will be

86
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:07,040
extremely useful to manufacturers

87
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:09,840
so some of the main challenges that i

88
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,000
would like to list the very first one is

89
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,480
lack of visibility manufacturers today

90
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:17,519
don't have good visibility into their

91
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:20,879
operational technology asset environment

92
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:22,640
they are still using some of the

93
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,879
old-school tools to manage

94
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:26,560
ot assets

95
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,959
using spreadsheets using visio i mean

96
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:30,959
these are archaic tools which are labor

97
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:33,760
intensive not accurate and can

98
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,680
cannot be used from a strategic

99
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,680
standpoint to manage operational

100
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,599
technology assets

101
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:40,959
and

102
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:43,200
which leads me to the next point which

103
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,080
is manual processes handling

104
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,040
ot

105
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,799
without using any kind of digital

106
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:51,360
workforce tool whether it's emails

107
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,640
whether it's

108
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,959
i've seen manufacturers use sticky notes

109
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:57,439
that would they would go and paste on on

110
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:00,239
ot assets to tell a technician what is

111
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:01,680
wrong with it or what steps that are

112
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,280
needed to be taken i mean that

113
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,879
introduced a lot of human error um

114
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:08,080
and

115
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,560
at the end of the day what i can't see i

116
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,319
can't protect right so visibility

117
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:14,799
becomes very important and the context

118
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:16,880
around visibility with respect to

119
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,358
production becomes very important

120
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:21,519
same thing for security there are so

121
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,520
many solutions out there and you will

122
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,080
see so many more this week

123
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,000
that has created multiple different data

124
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,400
silos and those data silos may not talk

125
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,800
to each other may not provide a unified

126
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,680
view

127
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,000
that is just a playground for for from a

128
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,960
secure

129
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,360
force cyber threat um

130
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,800
for cyber

131
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,680
uh security related issues right and

132
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,280
that creates

133
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,840
an issue around mismanagement of for

134
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,080
example vulnerabilities or any security

135
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,080
incident that exists in the zot

136
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,199
environment

137
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:55,360
and last but not least probably one of

138
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,960
the most important ones

139
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,000
that most of you might be realizing is

140
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,600
the drain of a knowledgeable workforce

141
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,080
in the manufacturing space like a lot of

142
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:09,280
individuals were either managing ots

143
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,000
historically right not a lot has changed

144
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,880
in terms of

145
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,440
how ot assets were managed a lot of lot

146
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,000
of these

147
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,919
experienced technicians were holding

148
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:24,479
information in their head not even on

149
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:26,560
in their computers and that makes it

150
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,880
very challenging when they leave to

151
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,199
replace them to bring somebody else and

152
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:32,720
so knowledge and knowledge management

153
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,520
has become an important piece of it

154
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:39,840
so using emails using sticky notes using

155
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,080
word-of-mouth communication is not the

156
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,400
most effective way to manage

157
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,520
your ot

158
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,720
assets

159
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,120
it's not scalable whatsoever and it

160
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,919
becomes challenging when you can't scale

161
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:54,320
that approach across all your production

162
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,840
sites right

163
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,120
and

164
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,199
with more and more digitalization with

165
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:02,639
more and more adoption of ot technology

166
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,639
uh the the bigger the complex this

167
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:07,840
problem is going to become

168
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,680
so what we have done we have taken

169
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,600
it operations management security

170
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,319
operations and id service management and

171
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,960
have married them with manufacturing

172
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,560
requirements to create operational

173
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,479
technology management environment are

174
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:23,840
offering

175
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,520
and it stands currently it stands on

176
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,919
four major pillars um around foundation

177
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:29,759
visibility vulnerability response and

178
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:31,919
service management and i'll talk about

179
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:34,560
each of those but before i go there

180
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,639
i need to to talk about what is the the

181
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:40,639
foundation of all of it

182
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:43,039
right folks who are familiar with our

183
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:44,560
cmdb

184
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,280
might know that that database

185
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,280
can accept different variety of data so

186
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,360
one of the one of the first things that

187
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,960
we did was we created dedicated ot

188
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,160
specific

189
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,280
classes in our cmdb that can accept data

190
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,240
like scadas historians plc's robotic

191
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,360
sensors

192
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,960
uh it is

193
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,560
in line with the purdue model that's why

194
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,720
i'm showing the purdue model and it is

195
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,720
important because that air gap the dmz

196
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,880
is shrinking quite a bit

197
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,720
and it is important to understand which

198
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,039
ot which asset comes from ote

199
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:18,400
environment and which asset comes from

200
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,080
the it environment

201
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,759
and being

202
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:24,160
all of that data being in cmdb can give

203
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,440
you that it ot view in one platform in

204
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:30,400
one dashboard that a or cio might

205
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,720
need to make decisions with respect to

206
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,880
securing their ot assets so laid the

207
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,680
foundation by creating new classes in

208
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,240
cmdb

209
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,599
so so now the classes are created

210
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:45,280
and we know that there are multiple

211
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,199
different data silos there are multiple

212
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,280
different tools that are available to

213
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,199
manufacturers today

214
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:53,120
that they that collects ot asset

215
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,039
information whether it's in microsoft

216
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:56,720
excel whether they're using an ot

217
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,120
security partner or whether it's in one

218
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,560
of the old school systems that they

219
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,240
might have that they are

220
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,759
that is not supposed to be for asset

221
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:05,759
management but they are using one

222
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:07,919
because there isn't an end-to-end asset

223
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:10,319
management solution out there

224
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:12,319
so what we do from a foundation

225
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:14,639
standpoint is we have created a

226
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:16,720
connector for example to microsoft excel

227
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,000
we also work with numerous ot security

228
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,160
partners to create integrations that

229
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,639
will allow us to bring the data the

230
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:28,160
asset data into cmdb

231
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,599
and

232
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:31,440
again i'm not trying i'm not trying to

233
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,039
say that we will become the single

234
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:34,958
source of truth what i'm trying to say

235
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:36,719
here is we will become the unified

236
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:39,120
source of truth and i'll i'll talk a

237
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,360
little bit about it towards the end and

238
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,880
it is important to know the difference

239
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,320
because we are not trying to replace any

240
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,399
of your existing tools we are trying to

241
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:48,800
bring in the right information

242
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,600
which is pertinent to make or to make

243
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,200
effective decisions with respect to your

244
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,240
security environment

245
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,519
so

246
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:00,000
now that we have brought in um

247
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,160
all of the the asset information in cmdb

248
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,320
so what right now it's a glorified excel

249
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,240
spreadsheet but that's that's that's not

250
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,600
where we stop

251
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,240
it is important to contextualize that

252
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,399
asset information with respect to your

253
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:14,080
production processes

254
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,040
for example if there is a critical

255
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,519
bottleneck production process

256
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:21,360
that has a particular sensor on it and

257
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,080
if if that goes down that production

258
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,839
line shuts down it might affect your

259
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:28,080
entire manufacturing

260
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,760
operations

261
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,920
and so it is important to not only

262
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,680
understand the criticality of the assets

263
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,839
but it's also important to understand

264
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:38,160
criticality of the assets with respect

265
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,800
to in context of the production

266
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,720
processes that might exist so what we

267
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,360
have done is provided an opportunity to

268
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,080
our manufacturers to bring production

269
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,160
processes that equipment model and model

270
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,519
it in servicenow that expands our cstm

271
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:56,320
and shows the criticality of the assets

272
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,560
with respect to the equipment model

273
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,839
and you can you can see it

274
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:04,079
on the screen that it it can be

275
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:06,880
visualized in in form of a service map

276
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,560
also it can be seen

277
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,600
as its own workspace

278
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,640
so now we have provided uh a place to

279
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,040
put all of our ot asset information we

280
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,120
have provided ability to visualize it

281
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,600
and contextualize it with respect to

282
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,240
the production processes so now that

283
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,079
there is a good amount of visibility

284
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:28,399
that is available we can start thinking

285
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:31,519
about security aspects

286
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:35,040
so our logical next step was to provide

287
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,680
integrations and ability to accept

288
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,839
vulnerabilities with respect to those

289
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:42,480
assets that were previously discovered

290
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,880
so now what you can see in in servicenow

291
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,399
is you can see

292
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:49,120
ot assets that sit on particular

293
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,959
production line that is in a particular

294
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:53,360
site whether it's here in miami or in

295
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,200
london doesn't matter you can see all of

296
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,920
that on one platform and then you can

297
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:01,519
also see vulnerabilities with respect to

298
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:04,640
the ot assets that are already in cmdb

299
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,800
for people who are familiar with

300
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,839
servicenow's i.t solution my starting to

301
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:11,680
realize that this sounds very familiar

302
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,000
because this is exactly how our world of

303
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,519
i.t works

304
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:17,920
where we have the capability of bringing

305
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,160
it assets within cmdb and then

306
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:23,040
associated with vulnerable items

307
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,279
so for somebody who is sitting at the

308
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:27,519
corporate level looking at all of their

309
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:29,519
connected assets regardless whether it's

310
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:32,800
it or ot it provides a unified complete

311
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:33,760
view

312
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:34,880
to them

313
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,800
from a security land landscape

314
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,399
standpoint

315
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:41,360
the way our vulnerability workflow works

316
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,680
is we bring in the vulnerabilities

317
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,160
associated with the ot asset

318
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,240
we use the rules that are set up by

319
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,240
organizations and that takes into

320
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,079
consideration the business criticality

321
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:54,160
the criticality of the assets

322
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:57,440
to to create a risk score and that risk

323
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,800
score will help organizations prioritize

324
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,800
those vulnerable items

325
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,160
which ones need to be mitigated

326
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,519
initially

327
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:08,160
fast which one can be deferred and our

328
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,519
um

329
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:11,440
platform that has a built-in ai tool

330
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,399
will help you automate that process

331
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:16,320
and we can use our service management

332
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,800
tool to do the future steps of of change

333
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,399
management as well as exception

334
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:22,160
management once those vulnerabilities

335
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,399
and the associated risk factor

336
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:25,760
with those vulnerabilities are

337
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,399
identified

338
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,200
and so now we brought in the assets we

339
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,040
brought in the context we're bringing in

340
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,279
the vulnerabilities by bringing in our

341
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:39,279
service management offering what we do

342
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:40,959
is we provide

343
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:43,839
an ability to to do um

344
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:46,399
to bring in digital workflows associated

345
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:48,320
with those assets right you can create

346
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,240
remediation groups

347
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,839
um where once a digital uh workflow is

348
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:55,760
triggered uh

349
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,920
the right stakeholders the parties that

350
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,079
are responsible to to do a software

351
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:01,760
upgrade or a patch

352
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,880
can take those actions uh and it doesn't

353
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,480
get lost in communication there is a

354
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,560
record there is a paper trail now that

355
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,639
is established

356
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:12,399
by bringing in the right stakeholders by

357
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:16,480
using our service management application

358
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,240
so i spoke about unified source of truth

359
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,320
as i mentioned we don't want to become

360
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,000
single source of truth we take

361
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
information from

362
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,079
different databases we take information

363
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:30,160
from excel we take information from our

364
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,920
ot security partner we bring that

365
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,360
information so

366
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,480
so that it creates an environment

367
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,560
of

368
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,639
accurate information that is required to

369
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:41,600
manage

370
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,000
your ot environment from a security

371
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,519
standpoint as well as from visibility

372
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:47,360
standpoint

373
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,399
so

374
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:50,399
servicenow is in a unique position to

375
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:52,079
build more and more integrations because

376
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:53,760
we have that capability available and

377
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,440
that process is standardized so that

378
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,800
it's not

379
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,360
uh it's not challenging for you to or

380
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,199
for a customer to to

381
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:03,600
use different integrations to bring the

382
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,360
asset information in

383
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:09,120
and that's what makes cmdb so powerful

384
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,279
so at the end of the day

385
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:13,760
what we do is we provide that workflow

386
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,000
that sits on top of all of your

387
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,839
different data silos accepting

388
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:20,480
information like asset information

389
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,399
vulnerable items

390
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:25,600
so that you can quickly recover from any

391
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,079
security incident associated

392
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:29,839
with your ot assets

393
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:31,279
that makes

394
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:32,959
those systems more

395
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:35,360
readily available to improve the

396
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,320
operational um continue to ensure the

397
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,000
operational continuity

398
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,040
and overall increases the confidence in

399
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,279
your security environment around ot as

400
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:47,920
well as it

401
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:53,279
so servicenow in in the ot environment

402
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:56,480
lets you utilize our multi instance

403
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,399
cloud infrastructure to access the

404
00:14:58,399 --> 00:14:59,600
information

405
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,920
readily to deep dive into

406
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,240
uh the asset information where you can

407
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,000
as i mentioned you can separate the

408
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,600
information based on different sites

409
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,440
with different plants

410
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,440
and different rules within those

411
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,519
organizations will be able to view

412
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:16,079
either have a unified view or just

413
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:17,839
a focused view of the assets that are

414
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:19,360
assigned to them

415
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:23,120
and that that's the power of of um ot or

416
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,079
servicenow platform

417
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:29,040
it doesn't stop there right so ot is one

418
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,120
piece for from a manufacturing

419
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,959
standpoint our platform because we use

420
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:35,839
one platform for both it and ot it will

421
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:38,800
help you resolve any customer related

422
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,639
issues once you deliver the product it

423
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:43,680
can help you with po management it

424
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,720
really empowers the factory workers uh

425
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,720
even before any incident happens really

426
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,120
do that knowledge management piece well

427
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,440
where we can capture the information

428
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,920
using our inbuilt tools and then publish

429
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,839
reports which can be readily made

430
00:15:57,839 --> 00:15:59,920
available and can be used for training

431
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,800
new and incoming uh batch of uh

432
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,560
uh technicians and workers who work in

433
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,399
the factory environment

434
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,199
and

435
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:11,279
it also helps support other adjacent um

436
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:13,040
functionalities within manufacturing

437
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,320
whether it's finance whether it's

438
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,800
marketing associated with manufacturing

439
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,959
so it just doesn't stop there it's one

440
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:20,480
platform that can manage different

441
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,839
aspects of your manufacturing

442
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:28,560
perfect so that's all i had we have uh

443
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,079
great people from servicenow who are

444
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:32,560
experts in security and i wanted to put

445
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,639
out some time to take any questions that

446
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:36,240
you guys might have and we'll do our

447
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,360
best to answer those questions

448
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:46,279
sure

449
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:02,480
so um do you want to take that or i can

450
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,559
try answering it

451
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:07,439
um so for

452
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,839
government operations for defense and

453
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:12,160
security standpoint we have the fedramp

454
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,880
instance that is available

455
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:15,679
but

456
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:17,599
from a security standpoint i think if

457
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:19,760
you're already using it on the id side

458
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,359
the security is very well established

459
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:23,199
for the for the overall service now

460
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:26,640
cloud you want to add

461
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:29,840
thanks man so normally for utilities

462
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,200
they don't want to do anything they

463
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,400
don't have anything to do with the cloud

464
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,760
for the most part now the enterprise had

465
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,440
a different story but on the ot side for

466
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,240
sure

467
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,280
so

468
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,280
you know the fedramp might be a possible

469
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,320
answer that some of them might be

470
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,160
willing to accept but

471
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:45,679
you know to the extent you can insure or

472
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:47,520
help to make them more comfortable with

473
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,520
using a sort of cloud service for that

474
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,280
would be great and that's why i started

475
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,720
trying to tease out is what are you guys

476
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,160
doing specifically other than fedramp

477
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,640
which is a great answer

478
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,600
that's that's what we're doing so i

479
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,720
think if you want to talk more

480
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,080
specifically we could we've seen some

481
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,320
customers that have been able to achieve

482
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:11,120
their um requirements with like gcc or

483
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:14,120
nc

484
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:19,679
any more questions

485
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:22,160
so regarding the

486
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,919
the integration

487
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:26,240
md

488
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:29,840
cmdb i'm sorry cmw ot integration with

489
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:33,679
the vulnerability management piece um

490
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:36,559
i'm i'm i'm guessing it looks like it's

491
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:39,039
because you're you have that capability

492
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:42,400
it implies that you're able to

493
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,000
capture

494
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,160
software

495
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,200
uh

496
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,160
software within the cmdb4 you know uh

497
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,960
for those uh ics systems i'm trying to

498
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,960
understand the

499
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,480
what what type of framework are you sort

500
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,480
of using to like is that integrated with

501
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:01,039
other external uh services or is that

502
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:02,320
something that you guys are using is

503
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,400
there a certain s-bomb framework that

504
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,919
you guys are using or

505
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:07,200
how is that integration what does that

506
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,679
look like to so i sort of identify those

507
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:11,760
those software uh

508
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,919
part of the

509
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:16,000
inventory yeah good question by the time

510
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,840
the mic comes to bradley i'll i'll try

511
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,760
and answer it so you're absolutely

512
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,840
correct we use different integrations

513
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,360
from a security

514
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:26,000
perspective where we bring vulnerable

515
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,919
items associated with the discover asset

516
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:30,000
for example if we have an integration

517
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,320
with an ot security provider

518
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,799
who are discovering these assets they

519
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:37,039
can also bring in they can also show us

520
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:39,520
vulnerabilities associated with it once

521
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:42,160
those vulnerabilities are detect are

522
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:45,200
discovered they are sent into servicenow

523
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,720
and then we can

524
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,400
use the business context the criticality

525
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,200
of oti assets to create a set of rules

526
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,880
that will help us

527
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:55,039
create those risk score associated with

528
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:57,120
uh vulnerable items and then prioritize

529
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,880
it accordingly from a framework

530
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,720
standpoint i think bradley can under add

531
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,919
a few more yeah so for um software we

532
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:05,360
could certainly model that in a number

533
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:06,480
of different ways depending on the

534
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,080
source where you're getting that data

535
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,039
from

536
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:11,120
either in terms of like installed

537
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,200
software packages or even running

538
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,760
processes that can be detected

539
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,360
all those can be associated with

540
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,840
whatever asset you're looking at so

541
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,760
happy to connect with i don't know who

542
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,440
is right over there happy to connect

543
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:27,600
afterwards uh go go into more detail

544
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:31,440
any other questions

545
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:34,159
hi thanks chris white with exxon mobil i

546
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:36,320
i had a question about the maturity of

547
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,480
the ot product itself how long has it

548
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,799
been kind of in in the suite

549
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:42,159
and then if you could you could tell a

550
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:44,240
little more about where it's going so i

551
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,000
understand kind of the integration of

552
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,080
purdue model tagging into the cmdb

553
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,840
what's next

554
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,280
great question so

555
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,600
um we started working on the product

556
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,159
about two years ago now and we launched

557
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:59,039
the suite of ot management product line

558
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:02,000
back in september of last year

559
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,159
from a maturity standpoint

560
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:06,960
what what you have seen so far uh the

561
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,280
visibility piece the isa 95 equipment

562
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,039
model the purdue model

563
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:12,240
the ot

564
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,240
standardized classes the vulnerability

565
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,840
management all of those products are

566
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:18,320
established and are currently either in

567
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,080
deployment or have been deployed with

568
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,520
certain customers

569
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:25,200
um as far as where it is going from a

570
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,080
road map perspective as as

571
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,080
i tried to mention early on that the

572
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,760
problems that we have seen in the world

573
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,919
of id are now becoming problems in the

574
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:36,240
world of ot and if you're familiar with

575
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,799
uh servicenow's i.t offering an itx

576

portfolio we have

577
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,200

578
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,039
response hardware asset management

579
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:47,360
software asset management all of those

580
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,840
offerings available grc risk in in the

581
