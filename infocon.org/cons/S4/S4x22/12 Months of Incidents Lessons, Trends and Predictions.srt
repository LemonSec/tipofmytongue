1
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:06,319
hello everyone thank you for joining us

2
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:08,320
i'm andrew ginter the vp of industrial

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:10,960
security at waterfall security solutions

4
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,519
i'm greg hale i'm the editor and founder

5
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:16,079
of industrial safety and security source

6
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:17,520
or and

7
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,279
ics drive

8
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:20,640
and it's ics drive we're going to be

9
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,320
talking about today we're going to be

10
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,680
talking about the the new ot incident

11
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,480
repository that greg has developed and

12
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,160
we're going to be talking about a new

13
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,320
report that greg and i have cooperated

14
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,360
on in terms of uh looking at what's in

15
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,360
the repository what happened in 2021

16
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,559
what what lessons can we learn

17
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:42,960
um

18
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,320
go ahead we launched ics drive about a

19
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,520
year ago in march and

20
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,320
when i started iss source i was always

21
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,160
looking for ways to find out more and

22
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,320
more information

23
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,640
incidents and see if i can relate

24
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,120
one incident that happened to another

25
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:04,159
incident and back then this is about 12

26
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:05,680
years ago there was about there was the

27
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,320
rizzi database and ics cert did some

28
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,479
stuff but there wasn't

29
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:12,400
they all kind of went by the wayside so

30
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,159
i about

31
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:15,840
oh geez i want to say about a year and a

32
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,560
half ago or so we um i sat down with

33
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,400
some of my cyber security friends and we

34
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,200
were going over some thoughts and ideas

35
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,400
and who came up with this ics drive and

36
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,240
it's essentially it's a report it's a

37
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,000
repository of incidents that have

38
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,560
happened and these incidents we you can

39
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,560
search them be it for

40
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,840
you know the name of the company

41
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:40,320
let's see what else the date the

42
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,799
incident happened the type of malware

43
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:44,560
the threat actor

44
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,920
and um consequences consequences thank

45
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,399
you and it's essentially then they're

46
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:52,159
all kind of cross-collated so if you

47
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:54,479
want to look up one thing you can find

48
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:57,280
out things that happened in one industry

49
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,560
or

50
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,439
types of attacks that one threat actor

51
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:03,600
did across the board

52
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,759
that's right and

53
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:08,000
you know the what when i found out about

54
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,758
the repository what what struck me what

55
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:12,319
excited me about it is sustainability

56
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:13,760
because we've had rizzy come and go

57
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,440
we've had three or four other

58
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,400
repositories less well-known come and go

59
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,959
and in my estimation they always go

60
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:23,040
because they're extra work

61
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,440
because they're managed by security

62
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,400
people

63
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,440
who are doing security and you know they

64
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,440
need to understand

65
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,200
what's happening in the in the attack

66
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,239
world because you need to understand

67
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:36,080
attacks in order to design defenses so

68
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,000
they need the knowledge but they don't

69
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,560
necessarily need each and every attack

70
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,720
in order to get sort of a gestalt of

71
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,480
what's happening in in in the world and

72
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,280
so be you know becoming comprehensive is

73
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,599
always sort of extra work it was it was

74
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:52,160
hard to find you know a justification a

75
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,959
cost justification to to do that work

76
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:57,680
but greg is a journalist among you know

77
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,959
other things he's got a long background

78
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:00,480
in the engineering world but he's a

79
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,879
journalist and so it's his job to do the

80
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:06,319
research on every incident and write

81
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,640
articles about every incident and as

82
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,480
long as he's doing the work he figured

83
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,280
let's

84
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,640
put it in the database and make it

85
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,800
available to everyone and so that is in

86
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,720
a sense a perfect fit with greg's

87
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,120
business model so you know i'm excited

88
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,519
because this is a a repository that i

89
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:23,440
think is going to stand the test of time

90
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,360
and that is the goal we we definitely

91
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,280
want it to last

92
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,840
more than a year two years three years

93
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,599
it's gonna we want it to keep going on

94
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:35,359
uh for the for a long time

95
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,200
so we're also going to be talking about

96
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,599
a a report this is a report that's not

97
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:41,920
quite done uh we wanted to have it ready

98
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:42,640
for

99
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,760
today and uh we didn't realistically

100
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,760
it's likely to hit the streets in about

101
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,360
two weeks so it's in the very final

102
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,080
stages of of uh you know being finished

103
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,439
you folks are getting a preview of it

104
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:55,920
here um the report is not about every

105
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,080
incident in the database um we've

106
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,799
selected incidents uh a couple of

107
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:02,239
criteria you know one of my most

108
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:04,480
important criteria was select incidents

109
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,760
that i

110
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,920
have experience with in terms of the the

111
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,159
industry the priorities the the

112
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:12,560
circumstances um you know i don't know

113
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,400
squat about hospitals

114
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,040
yet i hope someday to learn but so we

115
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,079
didn't write about incidents in

116
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,759
hospitals what we focused on was

117
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,639
incidents with physical consequences not

118
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:23,919
uh you know

119
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:26,560
not got into the the network and stole

120
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,759
some data and disappeared but you know

121
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:31,600
the manufacturing process continued the

122
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,199
lights stayed on these are incidents

123
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:35,040
with physical consequences

124
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,040
in discrete manufacturing so everything

125
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,680
from toasters to automobiles to aircraft

126
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,479
and

127
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:42,320
process industries everything from power

128
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,960
to oil and gas to rails to

129
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,240
transportation

130
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,040
so

131
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,919
that was that was the focus and uh

132
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:51,600
you know the

133
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,160
the uh to me the goal

134
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,600
you know what what do you use the report

135
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,680
for well partly it's a game everybody in

136
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,360
the security industry needs to become

137
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,120
familiar with what's happening in the

138
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,360
world because sooner or later that's

139
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,120
going to come after us

140
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,039
uh so that's sort of the the usual

141
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:09,520
reason but another reason is you know

142
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,120
these are real incidents with real

143
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,680
consequences and to me that's a powerful

144
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,440
tool to take to our business decision

145
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,240
makers who have to authorize funding for

146
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,080
initiatives like this and you know

147
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,919
historically getting

148
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:24,160
warnings from the government

149
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,680
do we believe the government a lot of

150
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,960
people don't

151
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,440
getting you know alerts about about

152
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,440
vulnerabilities is anyone exploiting

153
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,800
them i don't know but here are

154
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,800
other businesses in similar industries

155
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,960
or the same industry that suffered real

156
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,880
consequences this is a powerful tool in

157
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,400
my mind for springing funding loose

158
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:48,000
we in the report were writing about 22

159
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,479
actual incidents that had some kind of

160
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:52,560
physical consequences but

161
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,800
throughout the year from last year we

162
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,360
reported on 64 uh incidents that

163
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,360
happened throughout the industry

164
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,160
and but we're really focusing on on the

165
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,600
22 is as andrew's saying and but we also

166
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,759
know that this is a

167
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:10,240
snapshot of the types of incidents that

168
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,319
are happening we know that there this is

169
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:13,919
just the tip of the iceberg and a lot

170
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:15,600
more out there but

171
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,759
this is a good indicator of what's going

172
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:20,560
on another thing that i want to add

173
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,199
is a lot of times i've seen in past

174
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:24,880
databases you know they put the incident

175
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,280
and that's it what we're constantly kind

176
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,280
of doing is learning more and more about

177
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,319
that incident and refreshing it so it's

178
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:34,720
what we know that's happening on in

179
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,759
april you know we'll add to it in may or

180
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:40,080
june or september or october that kind

181
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,160
of thing so we're constantly updating

182
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,080
them

183
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,600
so here's a preview

184
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,080
of the incidents that occurred in 2021

185
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,080
that had physical consequences most of

186
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,319
the consequences were shutdowns of

187
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:53,919
physical operations of manufacturing or

188
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:56,639
other physical operations

189
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:59,440
and for the record we selected for here

190
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,560
only incidents that had public reports

191
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,560
where you know the knowledge was public

192
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,400
no no private disclosures you know

193
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,680
something happened but we're not telling

194
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,960
you anything

195
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,720
these are

196
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,560
you know you can go to bloomberg you can

197
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,440
go to iss source and read about the

198
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,280
details and you know names and numbers

199
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,199
of of these incidents you know some of

200
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:20,560
them are not surprising everyone's heard

201
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,720
of colonial um you may or may not have

202
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,800
heard of jbs meat packing four or five

203
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,639
of the world's biggest meat packing

204
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:27,919
plants were shut down for i think

205
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:30,319
between 40 or 24 and 48 hours we're

206
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:31,280
talking

207
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,840
you know a million cattle a day

208
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:34,960
going

209
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,199
i take it back it's a year it's a year

210
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:39,199
going through these so you know a few

211
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:42,000
tens of thousands of of uh animals you

212
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,440
know not processed the way they were

213
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,479
supposed to be

214
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:46,400
um

215
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,599
all of them

216
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:50,560
21 of the 22 all of them except one

217
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,120
was ransomware the exception is iranian

218
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,039
rails on the bottom there that was a

219
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:57,120
hacktivist or a hacktivist group who got

220
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,840
in and disrupted signage and caused in

221
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,919
the words of the uh you know official

222
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:04,479
newspaper unprecedented chaos

223
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:06,160
at passenger rail stations throughout

224
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,199
iran um a report which was subsequently

225
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:10,800
redacted saying there was no consequence

226
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,840
at all so you believe what you wish

227
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,360
one of the things i find interesting

228
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,400
about it is the the incident on

229
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,720
new cooperative and

230
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,639
the reason why i found that interesting

231
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:24,639
is it happened in september after the

232
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:27,520
harvest after all the grain has come in

233
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,960
for in iowa

234
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,759
and it really hit me that this was

235
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:33,120
you know you hear about ransomware

236
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,039
attacks and sometimes they're

237
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,640
they're drive-bys you know they just

238
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,159
throw something up against the wall and

239
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:41,120
see what sticks but this was a focused

240
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,080
attack that went after

241
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,480
a this grain facility

242
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,760
and i it just hit me that this is kind

243
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,399
of like the new wave of attacks that are

244
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:54,560
seem to be happening i might be right i

245
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,279
might be wrong but it's that that attack

246
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:59,360
i've i found to be the most interesting

247
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,120
now what was great about it is new

248
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,959
cooperative didn't cave in and they went

249
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,800
out on their own at least

250
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,399
rumor has it they went out on their own

251
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:08,720
and they um and they did they didn't pay

252
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,800
any ransom on it but i just found that

253
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,720
to be one of the more interesting

254
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,519
of the raw on the 22 incidents that we

255
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:16,640
wrote about

256
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,800
i was raised on a farm

257
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,640
the organization was targeted in the

258
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,560
middle of harvest season for several

259
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,519
grains

260
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:26,480
and grain receipts you know

261
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,880
handling received grain was impaired for

262
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,839
a large part of a day and if you look at

263
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:33,839
it from the ransomware attack

264
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:35,680
perspective it's a brilliant attack i

265
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:38,080
mean they they're it's a perishable good

266
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:38,800
so

267
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,839
go after them hit them they should pay

268
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:44,160
and you would think they would pay now

269
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,160
kudos to new cooperative and they didn't

270
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,040
but

271
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,200
i i just found that uh like i said

272
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,839
that's very interesting

273
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:55,680
um industries um

274
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,200
not a lot of surprises here there were

275
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,519
very few incidents in there were none in

276
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:01,839
electric there were there was one in oil

277
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:03,519
and gas both oil and gas and electric

278
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:04,880
have reputations certainly in north

279
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,640
america and to an extent worldwide as

280
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,640
being heavily defended and so that in a

281
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,480
sense was not a surprise

282
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,640
to me that what seemed might might seem

283
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:15,680
a bit of a surprise is rails because the

284
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,560
rail

285
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,040
engineering culture is extremely safety

286
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,680
focused there's there's you know safety

287
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,360
is king in rails

288
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,680
and you know

289
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,200
in a sense it's surprising that you

290
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,240
would have

291
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,079
outages due to cyber security but if you

292
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:32,240
look more closely at the incidents

293
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,160
you'll see that most of them affected

294
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,399
i.t networks most of them affected the

295
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:38,880
ticketing systems and without the

296
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,640
ability to issue tickets the passenger

297
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,680
rail systems had to stop so um

298
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,839
these are that that was sort of the the

299
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:47,120
uh

300
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,720
we're not talking about ransomware

301
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,160
getting into the signaling system we

302
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,600
were talking about about the i.t

303
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,079
networks

304
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:56,079
um

305
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:58,480
the surprise i found out of this and uh

306
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,600
we're saying there were no real

307
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,399
surprises the surprise i found out that

308
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:03,920
i felt was

309
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,720
the colonial pipeline attack and

310
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,440
maybe it's me being naive i don't know

311
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,240
but

312
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:13,120
the relative ease in which the attackers

313
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,000
got in i i and

314
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,279
and then what ensued after that i found

315
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:21,120
i found that i was surprised by that

316
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,000
because

317
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,519
this as it was pointed out to me

318
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,680
yesterday and i had forgotten about this

319
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,440
uh this wasn't the first time that

320
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,720
colonial

321
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,920
shut down their pipeline and uh but the

322
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,720
the panic that happened after the

323
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,480
colonial shutdown

324
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,160
i i found that

325
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,320
compelling versus the other time which

326
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,240
is right after hurricane harvey the

327
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,279
colonial pipe down was shut down for

328
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:47,360
uh how many three four five days

329
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:50,399
whatever period of time was but the the

330
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,720
the reaction from that

331
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,560
wasn't obviously as great as the

332
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,560
reaction that happened

333
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,600
when it shut down what this past may and

334
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,000
i i just found that uh that was a

335
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,720
surprise to me

336
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,079
so um

337
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:10,800
the report is focused on those incidents

338
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,560
and the lessons we draw from them but we

339
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,760
do mention

340
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,519
the other stuff that we've observed in

341
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:17,760
the repository um there were eight near

342
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,399
misses so everyone's heard about oldsmar

343
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:22,320
oldmar did not suffer physical

344
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,959
consequences yes the lie setting was set

345
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,480
up to ten thousand times what it was

346
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,880
supposed to be but there's a large body

347
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,720
of finished water that that lie goes

348
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,279
into and so there was in fact no

349
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:35,519
uh no damage done to the finished water

350
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:37,360
the ph roundup slightly different than

351
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,360
it should be because the the incident

352
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,720
was caught so quickly so there's a bunch

353
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,120
of those the one that caught my mind my

354
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,279
eye was fujifilm

355
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:47,680
they produced covet tests

356
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,279
their i.t

357
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:51,120
order processing was shut down by a

358
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,480
ransomware attack

359
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,440
but there were no delays in shipments of

360
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,440
coveted uh tests reported so to me

361
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,959
that's a near miss if

362
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:01,040
uh their ability to take orders had been

363
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,200
impaired longer it may be that you know

364
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,639
they would have produced the kova tests

365
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,560
and had no way to get them to to

366
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,880
customers so there were some near misses

367
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,639
um there were some near some some

368
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:12,639
incidents in other industries the

369
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:14,959
casinos shut down because they were

370
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:17,360
worried about leaking customer data into

371
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,000
the world it was an i.t breach but it

372
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,920
was a physical shutdown because of an

373
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,360
i.t breach

374
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,920
seven school systems many schools uh had

375
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,680
to shut down for periods of between a

376
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:30,000
day or four or five days

377
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,920
sometimes because of you know air

378
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,160
conditioning sometimes because of you

379
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,760
know again crippled i.t systems but

380
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,519
physical consequences

381
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:39,920
10 health care organizations

382
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,880
over 17 hospitals had impaired

383
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,360
operations most of them had to divert

384
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,920
ambulances to other hospitals because

385
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,160
their again information systems had had

386
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,160
been compromised

387
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:55,760
and uh you know in retail we saw gas

388
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,399
stations throughout iran uh shut down

389
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:01,680
because of a uh an attack we saw about

390
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:05,040
500 swedish grocery stores shut down um

391
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,360
you know to me

392
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,720
i don't know if that's really process

393
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,560
industries we i we know we left him out

394
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,160
of this report but it to me it's it's

395
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,680
arguable

396
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,480
i found um going back to the oldsmar

397
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,440
incident the doing and searching

398
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,839
and looking at the water industry

399
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:22,959
attacks

400
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:25,360
there were four that occurred last year

401
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,199
it was oldsmar and there were two in

402
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:29,440
maine and there was one in california

403
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:32,399
and and it just makes me look and think

404
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:35,040
about you know the water industry

405
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,519
just and we wrote about it extensively

406
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:41,360
during oldsmar and how vulnerable it is

407
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,839
and i i'm just and i know the federal

408
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:45,600
government's gotten involved and they've

409
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,040
they're they're trying to help out to

410
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,440
make sure these water

411
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,000
areas water plants are

412
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,519
they get there

413
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:56,320
they get the right security levels but i

414
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,279
just found with the importance of what

415
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:00,720
water is

416
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:01,519
to

417
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:03,040
the the public

418
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:06,480
um and how and their security is kind of

419
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,160
i don't know what you want to call the

420
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,199
weakest

421
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:11,760
out there i just found it compelling and

422
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,839
the if you want to talk about a reaction

423
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:17,360
i i we did a story years ago about in uh

424
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,440
charleston west virginia about a

425
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:22,959
chemical spill in in the river up there

426
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:25,440
that um forced the

427
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,160
tower forced charleston to go without

428
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,000
water out of the

429
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,079
uh they had to get bottled water shipped

430
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:33,120
in

431
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,040
for like a week or something like that

432
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,639
and it was um

433
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:38,320
that's the importance of the water

434
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,440
industry so

435
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:43,040
when yeah uh the if the y went into that

436
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,079
system

437
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:45,920
would it have done anything maybe maybe

438
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,920
not but i

439
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:51,120
i just i'm amazed at the the whole water

440
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,920
industry uh situation

441
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,240
trends

442
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,720
[Music]

443
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:01,120
most of the victims were in

444
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,759
food and beverage

445
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:05,120
you know

446
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,959
not industries

447
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:08,240
and discreet manufacturing neither

448
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,680
neither industry is known for strong

449
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,040
security there's exceptions in every

450
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,279
industry i mean airbus for example is an

451
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:15,519
exception in in discrete manufacturing

452
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:17,040
but a lot of the small manufacturers not

453
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,440
so much

454
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,759
we saw this slide already what's going

455
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,600
on

456
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,000
there we go here's the trend slide okay

457
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,199
sorry

458
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:28,639
um

459
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:30,639
more than doubling the number of

460
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:32,959
ransomware attacks last year more than

461
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:35,199
doubling total attacks with physical

462
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:36,480
consequences we're talking more than

463
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,000
doubling ransomware tax with physical

464
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,519
consequences

465
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:41,440
um we're predicting

466
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,880
that we're going to more than double

467
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,079
again next year we're predicting

468
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:45,920
exponential growth in this space just

469
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,680
like we've seen in lots of other spaces

470
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,560
in the cyber world

471
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:53,759
cloud seeded ransomware we're predicting

472
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:56,000
that more attacks like cassaya are going

473
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,920
to hit the industrial space you know

474
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,040
caseya

475
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,000
was

476
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,160
ransomware that used an exploit in a

477
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,880
software update distribution service to

478
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,640
send the ransomware simultaneously into

479
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,160
over a thousand victims in the space of

480
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,079
about 45 minutes not quite

481
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:11,679
simultaneously

482
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:13,039
um

483
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:14,880
how many industrial vendors out there

484
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,640
are there out there there's hundreds

485
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,880
okay it's a very fragmented space how

486
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,559
many of them are huge

487
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:22,959
few most of them are smallish how many

488
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:25,280
of them are offering

489
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,119
you know software as a service or

490
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:28,640
predictive maintenance as a service or

491
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,120
all of these services that rely on

492
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,360
information feeds from the industrial

493
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,160
equipment into the uh the you know the

494
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,000
the vendor's cloud

495
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,679
most of them this is a new business

496
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:41,280
opportunity it's a new kind of business

497
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,960
it's very profitable

498
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,080
um

499
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,000
all it takes is for the bad guys to get

500
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,440
into one or six of those poorly defended

501
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,039
vendors there's going to be

502
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:52,720
small poorly defended vendors out there

503
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:56,160
with connections into hundreds of sites

504
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,840
and use those connections to seed

505
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,440
ransomware into hundreds of industrial

506
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,720
sites simultaneously this is the

507
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,320
cloud-seeded ransomware i'm predicting

508
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,080
it's going to happen we've seen it

509
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,000
happen in the i.t space you know we're

510
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,120
predicting it's going to happen in the

511
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,760
ot space before the end of 2023

512
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,200
and the other thing we've observed is

513
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,799
look at the nations or look at the the

514
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:14,799
ransomware attack techniques you know

515
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:16,480
they're using targeted attacks when did

516
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,559
they start doing that roughly

517
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:20,799
five six years after targeted attacks

518
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,160
sort of came into

519
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,880
common knowledge with uh the dhs warning

520
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,720
us about advanced persistent threats in

521
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,360
0607 you all remember that

522
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,280
um

523
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,520
now we're seeing uh ransomware groups

524
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:36,320
with caseya using uh cloud-seeded

525
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,320
ransomware the first time we saw that

526
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,320
sort of big time in the nation-state

527
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,640
space was not petya

528
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:45,679
you know a 1.3 billion dollar lawsuit

529
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:47,280
just finished with an insurance company

530
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,679
about not petcha that was in in 2017

531
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:51,760
what we see is that the the the tools

532
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,120
and techniques that ransomware groups

533
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:56,080
are using are lac are trailing nation

534
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,760
state tools and techniques

535
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,160
by you know between three and five years

536
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,080
which is bad news because

537
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,840
we all think oh nation state no no

538
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,919
nation state's going to come after us

539
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:07,440
but ransomware will

540
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,200
the good news is we have three to five

541
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,679
years to take steps to get ready for

542
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:13,679
ransomware to do to us whatever we see

543
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:15,840
the nation states doing to each other

544
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,919
today

545
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:19,760
um i'll

546
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,280
i'm also going to talk about the

547
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,600
increase we're already seeing

548
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,320
to date that our the level of attacks

549
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,799
have increased over the same period of

550
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:30,960
last year so we're

551
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,720
there is going to be an increase in that

552
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,360
tax now is it an increase in

553
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,360
tax or is an increase in reporting on

554
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,880
attacks and that's

555
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,080
that can be

556
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,600
that's again that's a question that

557
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,440
could be up for debate but

558
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,120
no matter what we're going to be uh

559
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,600
looking at them and reporting on on them

560
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,120
as they keep growing and growing and

561
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,679
growing and one thing that andrew and i

562
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:54,640
have had our deepest discussion about on

563
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,240
the trends was

564
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:59,200
cloud-seeded ransomware and i i i guess

565
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,039
i was kind of calling it something

566
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:03,760
different than than you were i'm i was

567
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,480
also saying supply chain attacks and

568
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,400
now whether it's

569
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,000
we're the same or that's something

570
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,360
that's completely different that's a

571
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,960
trend that's going to happen over the

572
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,640
next year and that's going to be an

573
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,400
increase in supply chain attacks you

574
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:19,280
know the cassaya the solar winds that

575
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,880
kind of thing

576
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,720
yeah so we argue about the terminology

577
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,640
but you know the trends seem clear we're

578
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,480
going to it's it's just too big a

579
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,240
financial opportunity for the ransomware

580
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,280
folks

581
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,120
they're going to start sending their

582
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,520
ransomware at us you know through these

583
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,600
supply chain or cloud

584
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,639
pivoting routes

585
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,640
uh what do we do about it we do have a

586
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:44,000
few recommendations um you know i always

587
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,559
recommend if an industrial site wants to

588
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:48,480
become you know wants to wants to jump

589
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,159
to the head of the queue

590
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:51,840
this is what i documented in my most

591
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,039
recent book

592
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:55,280
secure operations technology it is the

593
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,280
methodology used by the world's most

594
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,039
secure industrial sites they ask

595
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:00,559
different questions so they get

596
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:02,159
different answers they look at security

597
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:03,360
a different way

598
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,240
and

599
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:07,200
they use all of conventional i.t and ot

600
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,039
security don't get me wrong but they do

601
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:10,720
a bunch that's extra and that's what

602
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:11,919
i've documented in the book if you're

603
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:13,760
interested there are free copies at the

604
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,760
the waterfall cabana in

605
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:18,480
15 minutes

606
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,400
another

607
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,640
strong recommendation is

608
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:25,200
not just put you know

609
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,960
unidirectional gateways or some other

610
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,919
strong separations strong protection

611
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:32,000
between your itnot networks

612
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,760
don't just do that

613
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,280
also you have to look real hard at

614
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,520
what's on your it networks and figure

615
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,600
out if

616
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:41,280
minute-by-minute you know ot industrial

617
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:45,200
operations depend upon services on the

618
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,200
it network if your ticketing system is

619
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,840
essential to keeping the rails running

620
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,120
you shouldn't really think about it as

621
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,640
an i.t resource you've got to think

622
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,799
about it as at least a hybrid resource

623
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:56,000
if not an ot resource you've got to

624
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,240
start defending it to the same degree

625
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,559
that you defend the minute by minute you

626
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:02,720
know i need these systems up to run

627
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,360
resources these dependencies are are

628
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,799
stuff that's that's killing us in a lot

629
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:08,320
of spaces

630
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,320
and you know finally

631
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,640
the the dependency that you want to

632
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:15,039
control in a sense the most tightly is

633
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:17,200
any dependency on a cloud service or an

634
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,039
internet-based service because again

635
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:20,640
that's an opportunity to pivot and

636
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,200
attack through poorly defended internet

637
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,520
service providers into

638
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:29,039
our most important assets

639
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:31,600
uh the recommendation that i

640
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,520
again that we went back and forth on but

641
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:34,799
it's uh

642
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:37,039
to be a more

643
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:39,039
you know you come to these um these

644
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:41,280
events and you uh listen to everybody

645
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,559
saying we got to do things differently

646
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:44,799
you got to do things differently well

647
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:46,480
the answer is yeah we have to do things

648
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,400
differently now i i don't have the pure

649
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,080
answer of course nobody does i don't

650
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,440
think but

651
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,760
having a more holistic environment

652
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,760
security environment where

653
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:58,559
you know we're able to have the business

654
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:00,720
enterprise the manufacturing enterprise

655
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:04,159
the it enterprise the

656
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:05,679
business

657
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:07,280
or the

658
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,600
building automation enterprise the

659
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,840
physical security enterprise having it

660
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,840
all kind of under one umbrella and then

661
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,679
having everything kind of blend to one

662
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:18,559
another i think is more something that

663
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:22,400
we would see happening in the future

664
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,280
so a word about waterfall um we are the

665
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,280
ot security company we invented the

666
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,799
interdirectional security gateway we've

667
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:31,360
been around for going on what 14 15

668
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,600
years this year uh we're you know

669
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:34,720
deployed

670
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:37,760
across the globe we have offices across

671
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:38,960
the globe

672
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,840
um we're trusted by

673
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,440
all kinds of critical infrastructures

674
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,520
and we continue to you know expand our

675
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:48,640
scope into new areas rails is

676
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:49,919
comparatively new for us but it's

677
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:51,760
growing very rapidly

678
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:54,000
building automation is uh you know new

679
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,919
territory but you know

680
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:58,159
an industry that urgently needs stronger

681
00:23:58,159 --> 00:23:59,200
security

682
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,400
um

683
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:03,120

news website that's focused on safety

687
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,760
and security and we're talking about

688
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:14,080
security it's cyber and physical

689
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,200
security

690
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:18,080
um we also have a weekly newsletter

691
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,840

ics drive and so between all those

697
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,720
entities we're trying to help

698
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:37,279
everybody do their job better or at

699
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:40,000
least be more informed about what's

700
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,159
happening throughout the industry

701
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:46,559
and see if we can see if we can help

702
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:48,799
so to wrap up um

703
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:51,200
there's a new incident repository

704
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,159
um

705
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:54,880
based on ot incidents that have been

706
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,360
reported in public public reports not

707
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,279
private disclosures not errors and

708
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:02,640
emissions uh you know real cyber attacks

709
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,400
uh an incident repository that you know

710
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,400
i have reason to believe is going to

711
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,679
survive into the future because it's

712
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:10,320
finally got the right business model

713
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,919
um

714
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:13,679
there's a new report out uh it's not

715
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:15,919
quite out it's going to be out

716
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:18,080
within about two weeks so

717
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,080
stay on you know have a look at uh

718
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,919
subscribe to to

719
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:23,360
to this man's newsletter to greg's

720
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,440
newsletter um and you'll you'll get

721
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,120
notice of it um

722
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,799
but it's coming uh you know real soon we

723
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:31,200
wanted to have it done for monday um and

724
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,640
sort of the main lesson here is that

725
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,240
ransomware is a pervasive threat and

726
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,799
ransomware threats are tracking

727
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:38,640
nation-state attack techniques by about

728
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,880
three to five years so you know whatever

729
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,320
we see the nation states doing to each

730
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:45,120
other today uh we've got to prepare for

731
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,440
and i would encourage you uh you know by

732
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:50,480
all means come by the uh the the cabana

733
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,880
and grab a copy of the book and

734
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:55,120
experts like yourself let me know when

735
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,720
you've read it what you think of it i'm

736
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:59,039
working on the new one and i need

737
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:01,200
feedback from folks like you about this

738
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,039
one as to whether it was useful to do a

739
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:04,799
better job the next time

740
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:07,919
one last thing if you if you know of an

741
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:09,600
incident

you can send me a note you can

743
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:14,720
go on the icsdrive.com website and

744
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:17,039
there's a button up in the upper right

745
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:18,400
hand page

746
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,440
where you can

it's it's real and all that kind of

750

00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,559
you know this is for everybody this is

753
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:34,799
for the industry to learn from and to

754
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:37,279
and to pick up from but it's also you

755
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:39,760

are there any questions do we have time

761
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:54,240
to quit for a question if there is one

762
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:57,600
there's a question at the back yes sir

763
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:06,240
if someone puts in the oh that would

764
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,960
help sorry um if someone puts in the

765
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,039
indicators of compromise for cobalt

766
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:13,760
strike that it uh eliminates about 90

767
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,919
percent of the ransomware attacks have

768
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:17,200
you run into that with any of your

769
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,520
research

770
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:21,919
um i i have not

771
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:24,720
i have not but i have not i mean i don't

772
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,880
investigate incidents we're relying on

773
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:29,679
public reports i have seen that

774
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:32,320
observation made in you know analysis

775
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,399
articles saying it looks like the bad

776
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:37,440
guys have you know either bought or or

777
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,480
stolen

778
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:39,600
licenses

779
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,200
um

780
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,640
but in terms of what to do about it i

781
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:45,120
haven't i haven't seen any any any

782
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,840
thoughts on

783
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:50,320
that yes sir

784
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:55,840
for incidents that take several years to

785
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,520
get enough meaningful information to

786
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,520
have a good picture about it how do you

787
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:02,320
intend to address that within your uh

788
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:05,360
well i want to keep updating so

789
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,679
if and i'm keep i keep looking at them

790
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:09,039
and it's

791
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:11,200
being an old newspaper guy it's always

792
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,799
you write about the news story then you

793
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:14,159
follow up and you follow up and you

794
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:16,000
follow up and that's what i'm going to

795
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,679
do now again there's always reminders or

796
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:21,279
you can send me an email saying well

797
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:22,720
what about that one incident that

798
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,880
happened you know i there may be more

799
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,799
information out there then i'm out there

800
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:28,559
and i'm going to get it and then the

801
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:30,320
same with your yearly reports you'll

802
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:32,960
yeah uh address the previous years in

803
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,559
that way yeah right so

804
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:36,080
let me let me interrupt there that's

805
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:38,000
that's actually a tricky one

806
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,480
um the it's one thing for greg to say

807
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,919
i'm going to put it in the repository

808
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:46,640
but if you get a report in you know 2021

809
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,480
about an incident that happened three

810
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,000
years earlier and it was finally

811
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,320
disclosed because someone discovered it

812
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,559
in you know a security and exchange

813
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:56,159
disclosure you know some place that it

814
00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:57,760
just wasn't noticed before there was a

815
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,360
public disclosure

816
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,279
um it's great to say it's going into the

817
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:03,520
database yes indeed

818
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:06,480
the report is about 2021's incidents

819
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:10,320
this thing happened in 2017 or 2019.

820
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,200
um

821
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,120
yeah there's a lot of that so we'll will

822
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:15,440
we uh short answer is

823
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,799
we haven't crossed that bridge yet but

824
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:18,880
we're going to have to and yeah i i

825
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,559
think the answer is if it was a

826
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:23,360
significant enough incident

827
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:26,159
and there was a big enough change or

828
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:28,720
more knowledge learned

829
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,399
then i think we would have to touch on

830
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:32,399
it wouldn't be the whole report wouldn't

831
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:33,919
be written on it but maybe there would

832
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:37,360
be something about that like you know

833
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:40,320
having a history in there but you know

834
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,320
it would but there would have to be it

835
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,720
would have to be a pretty big incident

836
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,960
now if it was something um

837
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,320
you know that was a little bit smaller

838
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:51,200
yeah on the repository we would update

839
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,679
it was no doubt about it but would we

840
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:55,440
mention in the report i don't know i

841
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,279
mean that's but the other we have to go

842
00:29:57,279 --> 00:29:59,200
back and forth that's right and but you

843
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,159
know one of the things one of the

844
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:01,679
takeaways in the report that we're

845
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:02,720
working on

846
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,399
going forward is

847
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:05,919
uh a graphic

848
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:08,720
saying here's the findings and so

849
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,720
and it's a graphic that you know is you

850
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:13,120
can you reporters can take and paste

851
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,320
into their stories and say here's the

852
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,399
history of of uh you know ransomware

853
00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:19,120
attacks with physical consequences

854
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:21,520
and uh that graphic is something we're

855
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,919
going to update as the reports go by if

856
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:25,919
we see older reports i think it's

857
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:28,240
absolutely fair to go back and update

858
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:30,240
the graphic retroactively put a mention

859
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,000
of it in the you know the next report

860
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,240
coming out so that the graphic you know

861
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,399
can be used a by reporters and b by all

862
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:38,159
of us when we need to spring funding

863
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:40,960
loose it is the latest you know we we do

864
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,080
need to keep that up to date you're

865
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:44,799
right and unrelated uh we have on the

866
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:47,760
site we have over 450 incidents there on

867
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,039
the site

868
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:52,000
some are old old incidents

869
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,840
and they may not have much info on it

870
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:54,799
but we

871
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:57,679
and but we have that many at least 150 i

872
00:30:57,679 --> 00:30:59,840
think it's a little bit more than that

873
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:02,240
so a quick one so uh for the record i'm

874
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,760
from the department of defense and i

875
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:06,640
believe the government

876
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,000
i just want i don't know

877
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,480
i'm good with that uh so now uh so how

878
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,080
do we get the rest of the iceberg did

879
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,760
you talk about that you're only really

880
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:16,320
seeing some of these incidents what what

881
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,399
do you postulate might be some

882
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:21,120
positive incentives to get more to re

883
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:24,399
publicly report to help you know

884
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:27,600
provide more data for your uh useful

885
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:28,320
well

886
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,159
greg and i disagree a little bit on this

887
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:32,159
um

888
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:33,760
um

889
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:37,360
in my books it's difficult to hide a

890
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,760
production shutdown if you've had to lay

891
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,440
your people off i mean how did we find

892
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,279
out about the jbs shutdown it wasn't

893
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:45,519
because jbs told us it was because the

894
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:46,399
union

895
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:47,919
called the press and said hey we've just

896
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:50,159
been laid off you know something's going

897
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:51,440
on

898
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:54,080
and it came to light that way so it's

899
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:56,880
difficult to hide major shutdowns i mean

900
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,880
you know something minor if you know

901
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,799
three people get laid off and or they

902
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:02,320
still get paid for three days they're

903
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,679
just no production

904
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:05,519
you know the little stuff you can miss

905
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:07,760
the big stuff i don't think you can miss

906
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:10,760
it's

907
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:16,799
that's a good point so

908
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:18,000
for anyone who didn't hear uh he's

909
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,440
saying uh there may have been a report

910
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:21,519
of a shutdown but there may not be a

911
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:23,519
reliable cyber attribution to the

912
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:26,000
shutdown from an authority that knows so

913
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,600
yeah it is so

914
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,519
my answer is there has to be more

915
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:34,159
transparency and there can't be uh for

916
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:35,279
people

917
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:37,600
uh reporting an incident

918
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:40,080
they can't there can't be consequences

919
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,760
from and i'm gonna i'm gonna say the

920
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,760
government and i'm i don't mean to rip

921
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,679
them apart but there can't be any

922
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:47,840
consequences other than what they're

923
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:50,399
feeling from the attack now if it's them

924
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:52,960
being you know being malicious on their

925
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,640
on their rip

926
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:57,120
on their part then yeah they're they're

927
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,159
they're they should pay some

928
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:00,000
consequences but

929
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,840
there ha it has to be more transparent

930
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:04,240
and people have to be free to be able to

931
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:07,200
talk about it and and if you're if

932
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,880
that's not going to happen

933
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,399
you know you're going to be it's going

934
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:13,120
to be a secret

935
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,480
they're going to nobody's going to want

936
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:16,320
to talk about it and you know you know

937
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,480
i'll go through 10 cues when people are

938
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,159
you know reporting public companies

939
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:21,679
reporting

940
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:23,039
just to see if

941
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:24,559
and i don't go through a boatload of

942
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:25,840
them because i you know only so many

943
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:28,799
hours in a day but i'll look and see and

944
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:30,320
see if there were any kind of incidents

945
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:31,679
and um

946
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:33,440
you know it's

947
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,120
you can find them

948
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,640
and they don't talk about it but they're

949
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,799
in there someplace sometimes

950
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:40,799
but that's that's that's painstaking

951
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:43,279
well there's been some talk of that your

952
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:44,960
share price should increase when you

953
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:47,440
show you've used all

954
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,279
the resources to have

955
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:51,360
better than average security and then

956
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,880
even if you're still

957
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,880
at an incident you reported it in a

958
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,320
certain amount of time

959
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:58,320
then that could be an evaluating factor

960
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:01,200
that bolsters your share price rather

961
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,080
than

962
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:04,799
you hide it

963
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:07,760
yeah i mean the classic example is uh

964
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:09,679
you know you have uh

965
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:10,480
two

966
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,239
uh reports and

967
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:14,800
you know sec or let's just say to the

968
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,719
board you've got one csos talking to the

969
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:18,800
board the cso says you know board says

970
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,480
you know do we have any cyber uh

971
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,000
incidents last year and the answer was

972
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,520
no no we're clean nothing absolutely

973
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:24,719
nothing

974
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:26,560
the second ciso says there were eight

975
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,960
near misses there was one incident it

976
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,719
was subtle we found it we caught them

977
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:32,320
before they did any damage

978
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,760
um

979
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,520
but you know in the end there was there

980
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,800
was no shutdowns

981
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:39,760
which which cso is more credible

982
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,679
so yeah um

983
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:45,040
i think that if that

984
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:46,960
there should be you know a reward for

985
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:50,159
credibility in your reports and you know

986
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:52,159
to your point about the the government i

987
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:53,760
would hope that this report and this

988
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:57,040
kind of evidence um only provides in a

989
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:59,359
sense reinforcement for the predictions

990
00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:03,640
the government's been making all along

991
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,520
can we one more no

992
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:11,359
all right we'll we'll catch uh we'll

993
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:13,520
catch you afterwards thank you all right

994
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:16,680
thank you

995
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,599
you
