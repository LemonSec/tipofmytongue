1
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:06,799
what i'm addressing today is the concept

2
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:08,320
of cyber risk this is a bunch of stuff

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:10,880
that is sort of a preview into the my

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,320
third book the book i'm writing now

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,720
and it's all about risk and a lot of

6
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:19,359
people imagine that cyber risk and cyber

7
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:21,039
security are kind of

8
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:23,119
the same thing cyber risk management

9
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:25,199
involves a lot of cyber security

10
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:27,279
it turns out there's more to it than

11
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:29,119
that and that's what i wanted to to

12
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:31,599
focus on today some of the options that

13
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:33,040
we have in the ot space in the

14
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,840
industrial space for managing risk that

15
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,000
don't exist in the i.t space that are

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,320
sort of unique opportunities that you

17
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,320
know we should take advantage of so

18
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:43,600
start at the beginning

19
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,079
risk starts with consequences

20
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:47,680
um

21
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,600
the uh

22
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,120
a report i'm

23
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,960
coming out with probably in two weeks

24
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,440
time it will be pushed out on the ics

25
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,360
strive website as well as a waterfall

26
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,920
website um is looking at incidents in

27
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,280
2021 um there were

28
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,199
more than twice as many incidents in

29
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:07,360
2021 with physical downtime with

30
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,760
physical consequences as there were in

31
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,600
2020 we're seeing

32
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,479
you know

33
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:14,320
kind of what we expect the exponential

34
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,240
growth five years ago you know we might

35
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,640
go a whole year without a cyber incident

36
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,119
with physical consequences today we're

37
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:23,040
seeing more than one a month we're

38
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,000
seeing over a hundred sites shut down by

39
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,439
these incidents almost all of which are

40
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:29,840
ransomware

41
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,439
it's going to get worse i mean if you

42
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:32,880
believe the gartner group gartner

43
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:33,920
predicts

44
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:34,720
that

45
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,200
by the end of 2023 we'll see something

46
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,680
like a little less than one-third of

47
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,840
critical infrastructure organizations

48
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,079
worldwide suffer

49
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:46,640
suffer downtime because of ransomware

50
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,640
that's huge i mean that's way more than

51
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,479
the 100 sites that that are affected

52
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:51,439
here

53
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:53,119
gartner is also predicting that by i

54
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:55,280
think it was 2025 you can see the the

55
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,640
footnotes there um

56
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:01,200
cyber attacks are going to be targeting

57
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,040
health and safety they're going to be

58
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,200
you know basically attempted murder is

59
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,719
what's happening in in these in these

60
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,479
cyber attacks within a very small number

61
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:11,520
of years again it seems extreme today

62
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,319
but

63
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:13,680
you know predictions like this have

64
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,840
unfortunately been been borne out so

65
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,000
it's all about consequences and

66
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,239
um you know

67
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:21,760
i see sarah in the back there you know

68
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,040
one of the co-authors of

69
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,480
consequence-driven cyber-informed

70
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,560
engineering uh you know the book from

71
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,840
from inl in my mind the definitive text

72
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,720
on industrial risk assessment for the

73
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,480
next decade

74
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,879
and one of the steps in the methodology

75
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:39,440
is select your consequence a lot of us

76
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,400
focus

77
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,200
way too much on high frequency low

78
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,959
impact events because we have statistics

79
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:47,760
you know

80
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,519
viruses get loose on the network and we

81
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:51,920
have to clean them out

82
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,319
what cce advocates is

83
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:56,160
focus on the other end of the spectrum

84
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,400
focus on the big fish focus on the truly

85
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,480
unacceptable consequences because that's

86
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,319
in in a sense that's the intrinsic

87
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:06,800
difference between i.t and industrial

88
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,560
you know there's a lot of superficial

89
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,760
differences

90
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,480
patching is hard

91
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,760
it's you know it's difficult to put

92
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,760
antivirus everywhere

93
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,879
but these are all driven i argue by

94
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:21,840
consequence if we had a magic wand

95
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,920
and we could magically

96
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,200
update

97
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,360
every piece of software every piece of

98
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,840
hardware in our industrial suite

99
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,319
within a millisecond of vulnerability is

100
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:34,080
becoming known in that stuff if we had

101
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,920
that magic wand

102
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,680
there would still be a difference

103
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,599
between ic security and ot security and

104
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:41,440
the difference is consequence when we

105
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,040
when we compromise an it network what

106
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,519
happens it's a business consequence we

107
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:47,840
detect the affected machines we identify

108
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,799
them we isolate them we take a forensic

109
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:53,200
snapshot for later analysis we erase

110
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,560
them we restore from backups we repeat

111
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,720
here's the intrinsic difference between

112
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,120
iot and ot risk-wise we cannot restore

113
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,760
human lives or damaged equipment from

114
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,879
backups

115
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:07,280
there will always be a difference

116
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,319
between it and ot

117
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:13,680
oh

118
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,159
there we go

119
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:20,079
oh

120
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,479
what am i doing here

121
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:24,800
okay

122
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,720
um

123
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,960
so digging deeper with risk

124
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,960
a lot of people and even standards i'm

125
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,919
thinking this 830

126
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:36,639
uh the one focused on risk management

127
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:39,040
defines risk as consequence times

128
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,639
likelihood of the event

129
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:44,880
in a a given time frame usually annually

130
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:46,960
to me that's the wrong model that's the

131
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,800
right model for hurricanes it's the

132
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,800
right model for earthquakes because they

133
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,199
happen at random we have statistics

134
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:54,960
sometimes we have to look in the

135
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,560
geological record for earthquakes for

136
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,960
statistics but we have statistics going

137
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,960
back and we can use those statistics to

138
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,520
predict what's likely to happen in the

139
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,000
future how likely certain consequences

140
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,039
will be

141
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:09,039
but when we're talking deliberate attack

142
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:11,759
and even if you read nist 830

143
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:14,080
very closely um you'll see that when

144
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,520
they you know i'd read it and i said

145
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,320
likelihood what do you mean likelihood

146
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,360
because

147
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,680
if a cyber attack

148
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,919
works if it break if you break into a

149
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:25,600
target

150
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,000
it's almost certain that exactly the

151
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,360
same attack

152
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,840
launched against exactly the same target

153
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,919
will work a second time

154
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:34,960
it's not

155
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,400
a probabilistic thing it's a

156
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,680
deterministic thing in safety terms

157
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,639
all

158
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:41,840
uh

159
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:45,520
all cyber vulnerabilities are design

160
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:49,440
flaws okay they're not they're not uh

161
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,800
you know they're not random equipment

162
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,479
failure that would lead to injury or

163
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:53,360
death

164
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,080
they are program flaws in the safety

165
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,199
program

166
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:01,039
so um i looked at 830 or 33 whatever it

167
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:02,479
was and i said

168
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:03,840
what is this likelihood where do they

169
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,280
get a lot how do they figure out what is

170
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,720
the likelihood and they say well the

171
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,160
likelihood is a qualitative measure

172
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,840
determined in terms of vulnerability um

173
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,960
capability blah blah blah so

174
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,400
really what they're doing and what i

175
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,080
think is the right way to model risk is

176
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,000
to model risk not as a product of

177
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,680
consequence and likelihood and then make

178
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,080
up some kind of likelihood it is as a

179
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,160
function not a product not a multiply

180
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,759
it's a function of

181
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:29,600
uh consequence

182
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,880
intent

183
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,600
opportunity and capability

184
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,680
this is the way that we model terrorist

185
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,600
attacks which are also deliberate

186
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,360
attacks on a given target

187
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,960
um

188
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:41,919
if

189
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:44,319
there is intent if we have an adversary

190
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:47,120
who wants to come after us

191
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,759
and that adversary's capability

192
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:51,039
exceeds

193
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:53,360
the opportunity needed to attack us if

194
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,880
their capability is greater than in a

195
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,400
sense our defensive posture if they can

196
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,199
exploit the residual risk opportunities

197
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:00,960
that remain in our defensive posture

198
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,560
we're going down

199
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,800
there's there's no likelihood about it

200
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,759
and so

201
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,360
you know what are what are the tools we

202
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,080
have we have um

203
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,960
you know cyber security can reduce

204
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,120
opportunity

205
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,479
we can't do much about the enemy's

206
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:17,919
capability you know the ransomware

207
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:20,560
groups today are lagging nation-state

208
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,160
capabilities by about three to five

209
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,440
years what we see the nation-states

210
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,199
doing to each other today we should

211
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:26,880
expect ransomware to be doing to all of

212
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,720
us within three to five years

213
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,560
so um

214
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,199
what we need to do is deal with the

215
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:35,039
opportunity and not just reduce it a

216
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:36,800
little we need to do something else i'm

217
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,240
going to talk about that in a second i

218
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,319
did want to point out that

219
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,000
there is a degree of likelihood in

220
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,639
ransomware today and that degree has to

221
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:48,240
do with uh intent

222
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:52,800
22 sites went down in 2021 because of

223
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,440
ransomware sorry 22 enterprises like i

224
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:59,840
said over 100 sites um

225
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,039
the tools and techniques used by those

226
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:04,800
ransomware agents were very

227
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,520
sophisticated if they came against

228
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,520
most of the sites in the world they

229
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,919
would also go down the only random bit

230
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:15,280
of ransomware today is target selection

231
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,800
because the ransomware groups have a

232
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,199
limited capacity to attack only so many

233
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,479
sites at once

234
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:23,199
and you know think about it

235
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:24,879
if we go down

236
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,800
because of a ransomware attack and we're

237
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,479
called before the board to explain

238
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:29,919
what's going on we've been paying for

239
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:32,320
security why did we go down

240
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,000
well and you know we explain well you

241
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,360
know we knew those ransomware groups had

242
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,799
really powerful attack techniques and we

243
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:38,240
knew that if they came against us we'd

244
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,320
go down because you know we can't defend

245
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,839
against the nation-state attack from

246
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:43,519
even a couple of years ago and that's

247
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,680
the tools they're using um but we didn't

248
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,160
think they'd target us

249
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,600
we'd all be fired

250
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,480
that's the wrong answer okay we need to

251
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,320
understand the pervasive attack

252
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,920
capabilities in the environment and we

253
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,920
need to defend against them

254
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,440
reliably

255
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,839
rather than count on not being targeted

256
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,560
so how do we do that um

257
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,800
i'm going to go through three

258
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,200
three approaches here um

259
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,360
i want to mention security pha review

260
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,959
that's uh

261
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:17,839
the middle text in the diagram it's a

262
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:19,680
book from canexis it's brilliant in my

263
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,880
mind

264
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,399
i did not know

265
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:24,000
how to do this

266
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,279
when i read the book i didn't know this

267
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:26,880
was even possible and after i read the

268
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,200
book i went well this is you know this

269
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,560
is obvious

270
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,399
everyone should be doing this it's the

271
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:34,560
best kind of book where you say the

272
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,959
result is obvious but i didn't know it

273
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:39,040
before i read the book so you know i

274
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,800
think the author is brilliant

275
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,120
pha is process hazard analysis in the

276
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,720
safety world it's a

277
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,240
standard assessment that you go through

278
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,440
to

279
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,720
figure out how much trouble you're in

280
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,920
and what kind of mitigations you have in

281
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,200
place and whether the mitigations

282
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,720
address the risk adequately spr

283
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,000
adds a step to the methodology and says

284
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,680
when you've done all that safety stuff

285
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,360
because that tends to be your worst case

286
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,880
consequences um add a column to the

287
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,800
spreadsheet that says are the

288
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,200
mitigations hackable

289
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,240
if you have a very undesirable outcome

290
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,240
and all of your mitigations are software

291
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,839
based they're hackable

292
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:17,279
then we're in trouble then we need to

293
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:19,600
put you know all of the most powerful

294
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,120
tools in you know 62443 into play to

295
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,800
defend these systems

296
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,480
if instead we can look at that and say

297
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,279
you know what i should do is add

298
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:32,240
a buckle valve to the boiler so that if

299
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,120
the boiler over pressurizes

300
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,240
the brace on the valve breaks it snaps

301
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,000
the pressure is released the boiler does

302
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,680
not explode and does not kill everybody

303
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,279
nearby

304
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:45,519
that's an unhackable

305
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:46,880
mitigation

306
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,440
that's engineering okay that's not cyber

307
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,800
security we're not putting a longer

308
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,200
password on the safety system for the

309
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,160
boiler

310
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,079
we are making it physically impossible

311
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:58,240
for the boiler to explode

312
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,760
this is what engineers do the

313
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,160
engineering profession exists because

314
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,880
they manage physical risk this is what

315
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,880
engineers do and

316
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,240
we as you know cyber security

317
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,000
professionals need to recognize this and

318
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,560
say it's better to make small design

319
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,519
changes and completely eliminate the

320
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:17,120
consequence just take it off the table

321
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,279
it's we haven't reduced the opportunity

322
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:20,880
we've wiped out the consequence it's

323
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,160
gone

324
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,560
it's better to do that than

325
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,320
spend an enormous amount of effort

326
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,880
reducing somewhat the opportunity by

327
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,279
increasing the passwords and blah blah

328
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:33,200
i'm not saying do one or the other don't

329
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,560
get me confused i'm emphasizing the

330
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,920
engineering here because that's in a

331
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,560
sense the under emphasized piece

332
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,640
we need to do it all okay the sites i

333
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,320
work with are the most secure sites on

334
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,519
the planet and they do itsec they do ot

335
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:47,440
sec they do engineering they do it all

336
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,680
but this is in a sense the neglected bit

337
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,360
that we need to understand that needs to

338
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,639
be documented

339
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:55,440
cce um you know sarah was handing out

340
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,040
books yesterday getting it signed i've

341
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,880
got mine signed thank you

342
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,240
thank you sarah

343
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,600
um

344
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,480
it's a book on risk assessment primarily

345
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,920
it's got some good ideas in there about

346
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,320
the role of consequence in the you know

347
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,240
selection of the the uh the elements

348
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,839
that you want to to control what you

349
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:14,000
want to focus your your security program

350
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,639
on it's also got a couple of chapters on

351
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:18,800
physical mitigation now

352
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,279
look at the title consequence driven

353
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:22,839
cyber informed

354
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:25,839
engineering not cyber informed cyber

355
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:27,920
security they're talking about

356
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,000
engineering so yes there's a whole bunch

357
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,279
in there on risk assessment that's

358
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:32,800
primarily what the work is it's a

359
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,639
definitive work on risk assessment but

360
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:36,800
they're saying once you assess the risks

361
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,720
here's ways to manage the risk here's a

362
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,040
way to eliminate the risks using

363
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,360
engineering cce points out it's not just

364
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,959
safety consequences that can be truly

365
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:46,560
unacceptable there can be other

366
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,120
consequences like you know the lights go

367
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,760
out for the society for three days this

368
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,839
is unacceptable there's you know it

369
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:55,040
could be that there are business

370
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,480
consequences that would drive the

371
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,920
enterprise completely out of business

372
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,480
that's also an unacceptable outcome so

373
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,399
focus on the big fish

374
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:04,399
expand your your scope so that you're

375
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:06,560
you're dealing with uh all of the nasty

376
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,399
consequences not just the safety because

377
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:10,720
but safety is important and where you

378
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,160
can use

379
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,360
uh

380
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,959
you know engineered

381
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:17,440
unhackable protection and security is

382
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,639
the third one this is the book we were

383
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:20,560
giving out at the the waterfall cabana

384
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,000
it's my latest work i'm working on the

385
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,200
new one

386
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,240
this one

387
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,920
it's not a book about waterfall it's a

388
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,680
book about our customers it's a book

389
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,839
about what the world's most secure sites

390
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:31,760
do differently they ask different

391
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:35,040
questions they get different answers and

392
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,800
you know

393
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,320
one sort of

394
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,920
one or two levels deep into the book one

395
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,800
level deep is well one question they ask

396
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,480
you know in the i.t world we ask the

397
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,920
question how can i protect the

398
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,240
information the confidentiality the

399
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,560
integrity blah blah

400
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,639
the sites i work with don't ask that

401
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:53,600
question

402
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,519
they observe that if i have a control

403
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:57,680
system the only way that control system

404
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,279
can change from

405
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:02,800
normal or uncompromised to compromised

406
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,040
is if attack information enters the

407
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,079
system

408
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:08,639
all cyber sabotage attacks our

409
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,240
information this is the definition of a

410
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,240
cyber sabotage attack the information

411
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,480
might come in on a usb it might come in

412
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,839
on a cell phone it might come in through

413
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:18,560
a firewall it might come in in my head

414
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,560
as i walk past security

415
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,040
you know a password and malicious intent

416
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,560
that comes out through my fingers into

417
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,320
the first cyber asset in the in the

418
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:30,320
target zone that i come across

419
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,279
so

420
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:33,120
the world's more secure sites they ask

421
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,760
the question how can i protect physical

422
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:36,959
operations

423
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,000
from

424
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,600
information more particularly from

425
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,160
attacks that may be embedded in

426
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,079
information that's coming in and you

427
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:45,199
know they answer the question they say

428
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:46,560
well there's only two ways information

429
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,600
can move

430
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,000
it can move offline on a usb stick on a

431
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,519
cell phone in my head where i'm

432
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:54,320
physically carrying the medium

433
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,639
that has the information across security

434
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:59,839
and the second way is

435
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:00,880
online

436
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,720
through the wires through the wireless

437
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,240
through the fiber where nothing's

438
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,519
physically moving other than maybe

439
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:08,880
electrons or photons

440
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,360
in terms of protection against offline

441
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:15,040
attacks again these sites where they can

442
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,360
um you know will use

443
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,519
physical means they'll say this device

444
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:21,839
doesn't need a cd drive remove it

445
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:24,399
put it somewhere else it's gone

446
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:26,639
um you know we don't need these usb

447
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:28,880
ports literally glue them shut

448
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,959
you know people laugh but

449
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:32,560
why leave them there why leave this

450
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,160
threat vector open

451
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,519
if you don't need to

452
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:37,040
um

453
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,120
and but in a sense if you look at you

454
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,880
know chapter four of the book the the

455
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,880
offline protections

456
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,920
in a sense there's no surprises there um

457
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,399
they're kind of what we already know

458
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:49,920
from the i.t world

459
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,040
just done

460
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,959
quite a bit more intensely more

461
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:54,959
thoroughly more systematically than we

462
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:57,199
tend to see in the i.t world

463
00:15:57,199 --> 00:15:58,800
where the surprise comes is in the

464
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,240
online and this is where we observe

465
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,160
you know not everywhere but at

466
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,639
boundaries at criticality boundaries at

467
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:08,720
consequence boundaries where you have

468
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,320
you know the consequence of compromising

469
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,560
this network is truly unacceptable it's

470
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,800
a physical consequence the consequence

471
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,399
over here of compromising the business

472
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:18,000
network is a business consequence we

473
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,360
lose some money we lose a bit of

474
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,120
reputation we have to buy some insurance

475
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,720
for the customers whose credit card

476
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,240
influence we leaked

477
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,160
when you've got that boundary between

478
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,920
two networks had two different levels of

479
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,000
criticality that's where you put a

480
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,920
unidirectional gateway this is my

481
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,600
business i talk about universal gateways

482
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,160
but in a sense it's a mitigation that

483
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,600
lives at the boundary between

484
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,720
engineering

485
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,480
and security people think of it as a

486
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,720
security device because it kind of fits

487
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,399
at that layer where you otherwise think

488
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:45,759
of a firewall

489
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:48,320
but really what you're doing is changing

490
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,959
the design of the network so that the

491
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:53,199
bad stuff simply can't get in anymore

492
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:55,839
it's not physically possible to send the

493
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:57,600
bad stuff through the gateway in the

494
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,040
wrong direction that's that's how the

495
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,959
gateways work

496
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:02,959
a word about how the gateways work if if

497
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:05,119
you're not familiar with it the uh the

498
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:06,640
hardware at the center is the strange

499
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,640
one-way hardware it can only send

500
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,319
information one in one way it's not that

501
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:12,160
it's only allowed to send information in

502
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,559
one way it's only possible to send

503
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:16,640
information there's you know a laser in

504
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,199
the circuit board on the left there is a

505
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:21,919
photo photocell a fiber optic receiver

506
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:22,959
in the circuit board on the right

507
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:24,400
there's a short piece of fiber that's

508
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,559
almost exactly this long almost all of

509
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:27,520
the time

510
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,280
and you so you can send from one circuit

511
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,280
board to the other

512
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,799
but there is no laser in the receiving

513
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:34,320
circuit board there's no transmitter

514
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,960
it's not a transceiver it's a receiver

515
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,480
and so it's not physically possible to

516
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,799
send any photons back down the wire so

517
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:42,480
we can get information from operations

518
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,000
out to the business where we can profit

519
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,720
from the information and nothing

520
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,840
gets back it's not physically possible

521
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,919
the magic in a sense what confuses

522
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:53,039
people and this is in the nist

523
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:55,760
definition at 800-82 they define a

524
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,120
unidirectional gateway as they add the

525
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,480
one-way hardware

526
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,960
that makes copies of servers or emulates

527
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,400
devices how does that work let's say

528
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,240
there's an opc server in the industrial

529
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,240
network it's the focus of itot

530
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,440
integration all of the information

531
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,039
that's allowed to be shared with the

532
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:11,280
business is in the opc server it's a

533
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,600
very common design

534
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,919
the the waterfall software the universal

535
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:17,679
gateway software logs into the opc

536
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:19,120
server

537
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,720
username and password nothing tricky

538
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,400
nothing reverse engineered

539
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,559
asks for all the registers all the tags

540
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:25,919
and all the values

541
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:28,160
gets that snapshot of data and pushes it

542
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,400
out through the strange one-way hardware

543
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,919
and on the other side

544
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:34,559
the software is a standard opc server it

545
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:36,320
has all the tags and all the values

546
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,919
sitting there in memory less than a

547
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:39,200
second old

548
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,760
and anybody on the it network the

549
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,679
enterprise historian or sometimes the

550
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:46,160
sap server sometimes even the sock wants

551
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,440
this data

552
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:50,080
logs into the data into the opc server

553
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,080
pulls the data

554
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,240
all of the data that needs to be shared

555
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,400
with the enterprise is already there

556
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,720
in the replica servers be the opc or pi

557
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:02,080
or ihistorian or whatever you need

558
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,000
not only

559
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,280
does nothing get back through the

560
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,520
hardware nothing needs to get back

561
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,679
through the hardware all the queries

562
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:11,919
are sent to the replica which answers

563
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:12,720
them

564
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:13,520
so

565
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,679
um doesn't matter if the bad guys have

566
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:18,240
stolen phished every password for every

567
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,840
account on on every device on the

568
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,840
control network if you cannot get those

569
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,240
passwords into the network they're

570
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,480
useless it doesn't matter if they have

571
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:29,120
uh discovered a zero day in every piece

572
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,520
of security software that we're using in

573
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,799
the industrial network if those zero

574
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:35,039
days exploits which are information

575
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:37,039
can't get in

576
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:38,960
you're good it doesn't matter if they've

577
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,640
found a zero day in

578
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,880
the unidirectional gateway software

579
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,720
because even if you compromise the cpu

580
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,360
that's exposed to the i.t network

581
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:50,159
nothing gets back

582
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,039
this is what the hardware looks like

583
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:55,120
it's not that was a logical diagram on

584
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,039
the previous slide it's usually a 1u

585
00:19:57,039 --> 00:19:59,200
appliance there's a din rail form factor

586
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,120
there's a ridiculous number of

587
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,480
connectors

588
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,880
if you need to send tibco from one to

589
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,880
the other you know that's possible if

590
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,960
you need to do active mq that's possible

591
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,960
if you need to do and you know

592
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,960
with these connectors the main meal is

593
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,280
generally the industrial replication

594
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,880
but there's a bunch of stuff here that's

595
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,679
that's uh like smells i.t syslog and

596
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:22,159
snmp what's going on there

597
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:24,159
you buy the technology you deploy the

598
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:26,559
technology to get the industrial data

599
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:28,159
out to the business so that the business

600
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:30,799
can profit from access to the data

601
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:32,720
and these other connectors they sort of

602
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,559
come along for the ride to keep the

603
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:36,640
infrastructure people happy so that the

604
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,799
sock can still see what's happening in

605
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:41,600
the network so that the uh

606
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,360
the knock can still see if any of the

607
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,760
the network equipment fails and so on so

608
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,760
there's a wide variety of stuff that

609
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,640
basically turns this hardware into a a

610
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,880
plug-and-play replacement and you know

611
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,120
for for the the

612
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,200
the itot firewall

613
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,799
again i would encourage you to have a

614
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:00,159
look at the book if you didn't pick one

615
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:03,120
up yesterday i think we're out but um

616
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,799
i've got a url coming up

617
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:06,720
waterfall-security.com

618
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,799
sec dash ot where you can request a copy

619
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:10,559
waterfall distribution for free as a as

620
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:13,360
a public service

621
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,840
chapter six i've talked about

622
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,679
replicating servers

623
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:20,400
that's the first of 20 unidirectional

624
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,559
network designs in chapter six

625
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:23,760
there's a lot of stuff about

626
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,039
unidirectional it's kind of a little

627
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:27,520
alien to anybody familiar with firewalls

628
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,240
and uh go look through chapter six it's

629
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,280
20 different designs for how do you do

630
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,280
remote support through a unidirectional

631
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,919
gateway how do you do you know web

632
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:40,000
services that are intensely you know

633
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,760
bi-directional between the client the

634
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,440
web client and the web server through

635
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,120
unidirectional gateway there's answers

636
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,400
for all these questions that are often a

637
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,159
little bit counter-intuitive so i

638
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:51,360
recommend chapter six to you

639
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,600
this is the punch line um in the risk

640
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,840
management space you know it's called

641
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,400
due diligence or do care

642
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,039
we have an obligation to the business to

643
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:02,159
society

644
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:05,760
often a legal obligation to our insurer

645
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,240
to exhibit due care and i've said here

646
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,080
engineering versus cyber security really

647
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,679
it should be engineering and cyber

648
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:14,000
security but the emphasis in this

649
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,679
presentation is on engineering because

650
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:17,600
to me that's what's underrepresented in

651
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,400
people's thinking about cyber risk

652
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,919
you know what's the decision process

653
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:24,159
that we need to go through um look at

654
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:25,600
worst case consequences if we're a

655
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:28,000
toaster factory okay and we've got

656
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,440
mechanical interlocks on all our

657
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,039
machines so that when technicians reach

658
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:32,559
in to fix something their arms don't get

659
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:33,679
cut off

660
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:36,480
if safety is off the table as a cyber

661
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,799
consequence if the only consequence is

662
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:40,960
well you know ten days downtime for the

663
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,799
toaster factory and you know a one

664
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:44,320
million dollar hit or a twelve million

665
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,640
dollar hit on our earnings

666
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:50,000
that may be an acceptable business risk

667
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:50,799
you know

668
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:53,440
itsec might be a clear candidate for

669
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,280
using on the ot network because it's

670
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,200
there's no consequence boundary there's

671
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,760
no criticality boundary it's the same

672
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:02,159
it's the same uh you know risk on either

673
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:04,559
side the same consequence on either side

674
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:06,400
does that mean we should use it second

675
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,760
in the ot space well there's a second

676
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,760
question we have to ask and that is you

677
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,200
know if it's going to be a 12 million

678
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,880
dollar hit even if for our size of

679
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:15,440
business that's that's acceptable

680
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,840
what does it cost to reduce that to 2

681
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,120
million dollars

682
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,640
and if there's engineering mitigations

683
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,000
that cost almost nothing and these

684
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,679
engineering mitigations tend to be on

685
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:26,159
the low you know the low cost side

686
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:28,000
well then again we have an obligation to

687
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,039
the business

688
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:31,039
even if the the consequence is

689
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:33,679
acceptable to reduce that risk by taking

690
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:35,200
a lot of it off the table with some

691
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,039
engineering mitigations with some sec ot

692
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:39,760
with some gateways with whatever

693
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,960
if the consequence is unacceptable

694
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,960
then we need to do something sit down

695
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,960
with the engineers can we take some of

696
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,559
this consequence completely off the

697
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:51,840
table by you know making minor changes

698
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,600
routine changes that engineers make all

699
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,400
the time to their systems can we do that

700
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,480
for these systems can we make minor

701
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,400
changes to the network design

702
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,880
to take risk entirely off the table with

703
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:05,679
you know sekoti or other mechanisms

704
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:08,559
this is this is the nature of of cyber

705
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:10,240
risk management these are the tools that

706
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,080
are available to us on the ot world that

707
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:15,279
we don't have in the it world

708
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,520
that's what i had

709
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:20,320
are there questions

710
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,159
argument

711
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:24,240
i'm grateful nobody distributed tomatoes

712
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,799
to you guys

713
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:33,840
no oh um sorry i did have one more slide

714
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:36,799
oh okay the obligatory about waterfall

715
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:38,640
waterfall has been around for like going

716
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,559
on 15 years

717
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:42,240
installed worldwide trusted by critical

718
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,919
infrastructures all over the world we

719
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:46,000
invented the industrial application of

720
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,279
the unidirectional technology the

721
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:48,960
interdirectional gateway i wanted to

722
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,799
leave this up for you

723
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:54,159
the url to grab a copy of the book or

724
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:57,600
request one we try to send worldwide we

725
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,440
can send pretty reliably to the us but

726
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,039
in you know in the in the pandemic it's

727
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:02,720
been really hard getting to some parts

728
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,720
of the world but we will try

729
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,480
um i would encourage you if you're not

730
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,320
already listening to tune into the

731
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,080
industrial security podcast it is a

732
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,679
podcast about security it's not a

733
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:13,600
podcast about waterfall we have a

734
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:16,080
different expert guest every episode and

735
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,360
it's all about the guest and their

736
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,679
perspective on security it's go to your

737
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:21,039
favorite podcast app search for

738
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:23,279
industrial security you'll find it

739
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:25,039
and if you're interested on the

740
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:28,159
waterfall channel we also have a channel

741
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:29,679
of videos

742
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:31,600
we pitch them we we produce them as

743
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,760
educational they're less focused on

744
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,200
cyber security generally that's the

745
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,600
podcast they're more focused on

746
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,760
the security methodology that we observe

747
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,600
the world's most secure sites using and

748
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,760
you know how they use that methodology

749
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,919
how do they apply that to the the

750
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:47,360
security problem

751
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,039
that's what i had for you if there's no

752
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:50,880
questions

753
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,000
very good

754
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
in chapter six there are best practices

755
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,559
on on remote orchestration services

756
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:58,320
through the unidirectional gateway can

757
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,679
you answer

758
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:01,840
some of those best practices because how

759
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:04,080
how would that not become an attack path

760
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,320
sure so uh let me give you the the the

761
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,000
the question is uh you know can i give

762
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,760
you one of the examples of the surprises

763
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:12,480
in chapter six

764
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:15,120
let's look at remote screen view

765
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,320
we have

766
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,559
a problem on one of our machines we we

767
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:21,360
see an error message that we don't get

768
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,200
we have a contract a support contract

769
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,840
with microsoft so we call up microsoft

770
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,600
and we say we've got this weird error

771
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:30,240
message out of windows what's going on

772
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,159
and they say connect to our website

773
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:33,440
we'll take control of your box we'll

774
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,039
figure it out we'll fix it for you and

775
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:36,159
we go

776
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:38,640
on my four gigawatt power plant

777
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,559
over my dead body literally you that's

778
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:41,919
not gonna happen

779
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:43,200
but what we can do is go to our

780
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,720
engineering workstation remote into the

781
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,400
machine is having the problem so now we

782
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,080
see the error message on our engineering

783
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:50,159
workstation turn on remote desk view

784
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:53,120
remote screen view start taking some

785
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,640
amounts to a video

786
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,960
push it out through the one-way hardware

787
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,240
and now

788
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,159
microsoft can log into our web server

789
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:01,279
they can see what's going on they can

790
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:03,039
see the mouse moving they can say okay

791
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:04,720
bring up system diagnostics and they see

792
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,400
it moving because they're on the phone

793
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,559
no no that's that's communications

794
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:11,200
diagnostic further down it's a method

795
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,039
that's used for

796
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:14,000
uh

797
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,600
expert remote support by untrusted third

798
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,200
parties this voice that i get in the

799
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,720
phone has not been through my security

800
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,000
screening my

801
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,240
so for outsiders we have a different

802
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,559
solution for insiders we have different

803
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:29,440
solutions for um continuous remote

804
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,120
access those are some of the examples in

805
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,880
chapters thank you so much

806
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,840
thank you
