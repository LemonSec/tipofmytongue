1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,240
foreign

2
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:09,179
perspective today on organizational

3
00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:10,559
maturity

4
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:13,080
specific to OT cyber security

5
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,820
now you're probably wondering what

6
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:16,680
exactly does that mean

7
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:18,060
well it means a lot of different things

8
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:20,160
to a lot of people but most importantly

9
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,260
to the leaders they can answer a couple

10
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:26,039
different things one what happens when

11
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:29,699
there's a cyber breach not if but when

12
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:31,980
what are the true impacts and risks to

13
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:33,600
the organization

14
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,880
who's fixing what

15
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:38,340
and most importantly where's the return

16
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:40,500
on the invested products and security

17
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:44,040
services that were just deployed

18
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:46,020
several things that the pandemic taught

19
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:46,800
us

20
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,100
was that expect the unexpected and that

21
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:53,520
change Could Happen very rapidly

22
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,980
it thrusted digital transformation into

23
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:58,160
our OT environments like never before

24
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,539
regardless of your belief system around

25
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:02,899
the word digital transformation

26
00:01:02,899 --> 00:01:05,640
workforces were thrusted into a remote

27
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:08,400
situation all the while businesses still

28
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,020
having to deliver their product and

29
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:13,080
services and just like that change

30
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:15,200
happened rapidly

31
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,760
evolving threats as you're here today

32
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:21,119
listening to them unfold happen and are

33
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:23,700
actually becoming more real than they

34
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:25,560
ever have is it because of the political

35
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:28,560
instability probably so and we're faced

36
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,619
with having to evolve and change and

37
00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:33,780
respond in a rapid manner

38
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:35,640
all of this is creating instability

39
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,000
across the world and thus instability is

40
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,060
creating fear uncertainty and doubt and

41
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:44,600
because our world is changing so rapidly

42
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:48,060
our mindset must change as well

43
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:49,619
now I know you're probably looking at

44
00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:51,479
this picture here and for some it might

45
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:53,280
be familiar for some it might be funny

46
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,159
and some might be wow I recognize this

47
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:56,939
guy

48
00:01:56,939 --> 00:01:59,159
he's our friendly I.T guy that's now on

49
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:01,560
the shop floor maybe it's the new CIO

50
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:04,020
with no OT experience

51
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:05,579
maybe it's the governance Assurance

52
00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:08,459
teams asking questions of our OT

53
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:11,459
operators and Engineers on what do they

54
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:14,520
have here what are the risks and what's

55
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,920
important in this environment

56
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:19,560
for some these individuals give you

57
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:22,200
pause as a OT practitioner

58
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:25,379
why because they're not OT they don't

59
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:28,440
understand non-productive time loss of

60
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:32,700
life health and safety hazards

61
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:35,280
perhaps we can train them and change our

62
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,680
mindset to rely on them because in the

63
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,200
end it really does take a village to

64
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:43,800
combine business I.T and OT together to

65
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,599
answer those answer those fundamental

66
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:48,239
questions on Where is our risk and what

67
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:51,180
is our impact but most importantly a

68
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:53,640
mindset change so that we can create a

69
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:56,519
sustainable maturity in our organization

70
00:02:56,519 --> 00:02:58,920
so I'll give you a quick brief history

71
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:01,680
lesson here on resiliency and how change

72
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,300
made an impact

73
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:05,879
it's World War II London's under attack

74
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:08,940
by German Air Raids government thought

75
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:11,280
for sure London was over and to expect

76
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,540
the worst

77
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:13,800
you want to know what their incident

78
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,620
response plan was to expect more daily

79
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:18,780
Air Raids to expect hundreds of

80
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:20,940
thousands of deaths to expect the

81
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:22,440
hospitals to be overworked and just

82
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:25,260
crumble and sure enough chaos would then

83
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:26,700
ensue

84
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:29,040
but what really happened

85
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,739
well leadership stepped up and Winston

86
00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:34,440
Churchill instituted a memo each day

87
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:37,800
called activate memo daily and he asked

88
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,840
and called upon all leaders to do one

89
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,120
impactful thing each day

90
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,879
he also asked and demanded that we all

91
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:47,220
work together as they were underground

92
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:50,099
having no choice and left to learn and

93
00:03:50,099 --> 00:03:51,840
lean on each other

94
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,360
he reminded everybody to smile and that

95
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,819
to realize this was a process

96
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:59,340
but most importantly to have a moral

97
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:03,120
purpose a moral purpose to survive

98
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,519
London's World War II and the aftermath

99
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:08,220
is Art critical infrastructure today

100
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:10,080
while they stayed up night wondering if

101
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,459
bombs were hitting their homes their

102
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:13,799
businesses and and perhaps result in

103
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:16,019
death that's us at night as OT

104
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:17,579
practitioners wondering when the next

105
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:19,260
cyber threat is going to impact our

106
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:22,199
environment and how will we respond

107
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:25,080
but I rest easy because as London

108
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,000
demonstrated the will to preserve and

109
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,220
survive so too will our industry of OT

110
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:30,840
practitioners

111
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:33,000
have and will have and demonstrate a

112
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,160
resolve to mature that is why we're all

113
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:38,759
here today isn't it to learn to mature

114
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:40,860
so what's holding us back

115
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:42,419
well regardless if you're an

116
00:04:42,419 --> 00:04:44,780
organization that may have a Federated

117
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:47,340
decentralized management model meaning

118
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:49,680
you at the business level at the

119
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,419
operations level own your budget own

120
00:04:51,419 --> 00:04:53,340
your smes are responsible for your

121
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:55,500
output perhaps you have limited

122
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:58,020
resources not enough smes with OT

123
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:59,580
experience to understand and translate

124
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:02,280
cyber we've seen an influx of

125
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:05,160
non-technical non-ot cyber professionals

126
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,900
enter this realm

127
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:09,120
maybe it's all the processes or the lack

128
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,300
of all the regulator requirements you're

129
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:13,440
cus you're dealing with customer

130
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,080
requirements board of directors asking a

131
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,240
lot of questions and maybe you have too

132
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,560
much technology that you don't know how

133
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,900
to translate and make sense of it

134
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:24,240
or maybe you're the opposite and your

135
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,600
organization is leading the evolution in

136
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,699
a shared service model where they

137
00:05:29,699 --> 00:05:31,440
recognize that no longer at the

138
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,300
operations level is it just their

139
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,160
responsibility to secure their own

140
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,680
environments perhaps it's a shared model

141
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,360
where organizations at the top

142
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,060
leadership at the top create resources

143
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:44,460
it just may not be in the shape or the

144
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:46,139
form that we expect and want them to

145
00:05:46,139 --> 00:05:48,120
it's going to be a collective unit of

146
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,160
individuals that are all after the same

147
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,139
goal and that is to secure critical

148
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:54,120
infrastructure and perhaps they're

149
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,740
coming with their latest pen and paper

150
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:57,780
with the latest framework asking 100

151
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:58,979
questions

152
00:05:58,979 --> 00:06:00,960
but those questions will help identify

153
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,180
where the risks are what's in place and

154
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:05,340
what's not and then hopefully that

155
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:06,840
technology that's in place can be

156
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:09,240
translated and communicated up to the

157
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,979
board level on what the technical risk

158
00:06:10,979 --> 00:06:12,000
is

159
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,919
so

160
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:15,900
how did we get here and where did the

161
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:18,180
market influence us along the way

162
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:19,860
well I have to go back to the early

163
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:23,100
2000s when we saw an influx of Ip based

164
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:25,800
asset equipment make its way an entrance

165
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,860
into our PCN scada critical

166
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:31,020
infrastructure environments I'm talking

167
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:33,419
about the IP drilling chairs on your

168
00:06:33,419 --> 00:06:35,100
high-spec drilling rigs I'm talking

169
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:37,020
about the dynamic positioning and

170
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:38,940
Wastewater Management systems that are

171
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:41,580
all translating data back onshore I'm

172
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:44,100
talking about those IP digitized cranes

173
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:45,120
that are installed at the latest

174
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,699
terminal in ports all of that Digital

175
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:50,699
Data made way for the guardian solutions

176
00:06:50,699 --> 00:06:53,160
that entered into the market and for

177
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,680
once in a long time we had visibility on

178
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,479
what actually existed

179
00:06:57,479 --> 00:07:00,060
and then it created a visibility around

180
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:02,039
the vulnerabilities at the node and IP

181
00:07:02,039 --> 00:07:03,240
level

182
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,340
and for our OT practitioners that were

183
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:06,600
installing it and thought this was the

184
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,819
best day ever they soon realized that

185
00:07:08,819 --> 00:07:10,740
they didn't really understand the full

186
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:12,479
breadth of the cyber security posture

187
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:14,220
for which this information was now

188
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:16,139
telling us how were those OT

189
00:07:16,139 --> 00:07:18,900
professionals to translate the actual

190
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:21,419
technical risk on up to dollars that the

191
00:07:21,419 --> 00:07:22,979
company just invested

192
00:07:22,979 --> 00:07:25,199
that made way for the service industry

193
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:27,360
boom so that industrial critical

194
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,060
infrastructure focused organizations

195
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:31,919
could come in and make sense and

196
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:33,840
translate this information

197
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,780
so what's next for the industry how do

198
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:38,580
they get that information at the

199
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:40,560
technical level up to the boardroom so

200
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,380
that it creates a holistic view of

201
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,960
technical risk and business risk

202
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,419
well it starts with assessments now I

203
00:07:48,419 --> 00:07:49,979
know what you're thinking assessments is

204
00:07:49,979 --> 00:07:52,440
a bad dirty word but the truth about it

205
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,599
is that everybody is doing them and

206
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:57,240
specific the asset owners the asset

207
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,280
owners are doing assessments each and

208
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,139
every day whether it's through the I.T

209
00:08:01,139 --> 00:08:03,060
Department the business departments or

210
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:05,580
on the OT floor and they're doing it for

211
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:07,860
a couple of reasons they have to

212
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:10,380
communicate up on the current state of

213
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:12,479
their Union and demonstrate a path

214
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:14,340
forward to maturity

215
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:16,800
and most importantly it gives them a

216
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,259
road map of their buying habits of what

217
00:08:19,259 --> 00:08:20,699
to buy next

218
00:08:20,699 --> 00:08:22,379
and if they don't have resources

219
00:08:22,379 --> 00:08:24,300
internally they're going to lean on our

220
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:26,400
consultant friends our organizations our

221
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,560
vendors that have the expertise on hand

222
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,440
that can come in and showcase a

223
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,719
demonstrated methodology and progression

224
00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:36,059
to a successful maturing Organization

225
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:38,820
for cyber security

226
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:40,620
but what you don't realize that they're

227
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,179
starting with assessments and ending

228
00:08:42,179 --> 00:08:44,580
with assessments and so too are the OT

229
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:46,860
focused products even though they claim

230
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,660
that they're not doing assessments they

231
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:50,519
start with an assessment why because the

232
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:52,200
leader wants to know where the return on

233
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,000
investment is if your current state

234
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,820
without their solution is X today where

235
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:58,380
is the current state for with their

236
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:01,019
solution tomorrow it starts and ends

237
00:09:01,019 --> 00:09:02,820
with an assessment

238
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:05,220
so if we're going to do assessments we

239
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:06,959
should do them right and at the end of

240
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:09,240
the day we are all just spokes on a

241
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:12,060
wheel supporting our asset owners to a

242
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:14,220
level of maturity and desired state for

243
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,480
cyber security

244
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,339
because whoever owns the ass the

245
00:09:17,339 --> 00:09:19,380
assessment is the gatekeeper the

246
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:21,779
gatekeeper for purchasing power the

247
00:09:21,779 --> 00:09:23,640
gatekeeper for maturity of cyber

248
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,839
security

249
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:26,399
now I know what you're thinking there's

250
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,779
still probably some naysayers around

251
00:09:27,779 --> 00:09:29,880
assessments because those are viewed and

252
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,560
an internal belief system is that they

253
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,720
are a snapshot in time that they're not

254
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:36,360
Dynamic enough but Innovation can prove

255
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,700
otherwise on that topic but let's just

256
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:40,440
say okay we're not going to invest in

257
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,120
assessments and we're going to lean on

258
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,800
the guardian Solutions and the technical

259
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,380
equipment that we've installed how's

260
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:47,940
that working for you in terms of

261
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:49,620
Bridging the Gap of your technical

262
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:52,860
insights into the impacts and the risks

263
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:54,779
for the business

264
00:09:54,779 --> 00:09:57,360
perhaps you've through acquisition have

265
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,160
ended up with multiple solutions that

266
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,320
are outputting technical risk not only

267
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:05,220
in CVS scores but CVSs vprs they all

268
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:07,320
have their own threat

269
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,060
um

270
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:10,860
algorithms that decipher what the truth

271
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,240
threat is based on the vulnerabilities

272
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,920
at the node points how are you bringing

273
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,720
that together and communicating the true

274
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:18,240
risk it's probably pretty challenging I

275
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,820
know from the field it is so perhaps you

276
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:22,440
bring in your Consulting groups that can

277
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,760
bridge that Gap

278
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,920
but really is it ever is it their

279
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,360
responsibility

280
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,700
to bridge that Gap or is it the

281
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,560
challenge of the asset owners to improve

282
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,600
internally and bring in additional

283
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,100
information

284
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:36,600
so if you're going to do assessments you

285
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,980
should do them right

286
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:39,600
now I know you're probably thinking wow

287
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,540
where do I start I have every regulation

288
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:44,820
recommending a certain standard a

289
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:47,040
guidance and I also have my clients

290
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,779
pushing down our throats their own

291
00:10:48,779 --> 00:10:50,700
internal requirements where do I start

292
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:53,040
it can be extremely overwhelming

293
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,440
especially if you have limited staff and

294
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,899
your day job is to keep product moving

295
00:10:57,899 --> 00:11:00,480
and prevent loss of life and prevent

296
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,980
health and safety risks you don't have

297
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:04,380
time for this and so perhaps there are

298
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:06,120
some resources that are tasked to do

299
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,279
this again remember it takes a village

300
00:11:08,279 --> 00:11:11,040
it's not just the OT practitioner's

301
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,260
responsibility to do this

302
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:16,140
so with all these Frameworks with all

303
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:19,200
these recommendations where do you start

304
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,000
what do you pick

305
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,820
whatever you pick wherever you start you

306
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:25,500
should be aiming to answer a couple

307
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,959
simple things what's my recovery time

308
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:31,980
what is the true impact what standard is

309
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:34,200
going to allow me to move from point A

310
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,660
to B on my maturity what threats is this

311
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:38,700
really going to disclose these are a lot

312
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,500
of great questions that these Frameworks

313
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,360
should do but most importantly the

314
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,459
framework is supposed to create a common

315
00:11:44,459 --> 00:11:46,500
syntax language that the organization

316
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,480
can get around so they can track

317
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,640
progression

318
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:53,100
so in order to do that effectively it

319
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:55,560
takes a village itot and the business

320
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,959
working together in a certain layer of

321
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:00,360
capacity and to do that there are

322
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,579
different assessment models that lend to

323
00:12:02,579 --> 00:12:04,320
that visibility to that holistic

324
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,839
approach to risk and identifying impacts

325
00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:09,360
starting with business impact analysis

326
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,700
at the highest most level it's going to

327
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:14,640
disclose what are the financial impacts

328
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:17,760
the risks as well as help you prioritize

329
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,579
what assets to even begin your journey

330
00:12:20,579 --> 00:12:23,399
on maturing your cyber security for and

331
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:24,959
then you have your Gap assessments also

332
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,940
known as framework base those are going

333
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:29,220
to allow you to create a baseline after

334
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:30,839
you've scoped out which assets are

335
00:12:30,839 --> 00:12:33,000
important to the business and align

336
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,160
against a certain set of Frameworks

337
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,380
requirements and controls and help you

338
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:39,240
communicate effectively across business

339
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:42,000
lines and we usually see this around I.T

340
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,519
governance teams really getting engaged

341
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:46,320
and involved at the OT level with this

342
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,540
type of approach business impact we

343
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:50,880
typically see more on the business side

344
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,620
it can come out of the finance

345
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:54,300
department it can come out of the

346
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:55,680
marketing department whichever

347
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,600
department is really responsible and

348
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,639
having resources for that and then

349
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:01,260
lastly it's the component assessment

350
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:03,660
also known as equipment we typically see

351
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:05,700
this in the field and at the OT level

352
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:08,279
why because these types of assessments

353
00:13:08,279 --> 00:13:10,680
are down to the equipment level the sub

354
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,959
function and having a really depth

355
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:15,720
breadth understanding of the real threat

356
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,760
scenarios as it relates to the hazards

357
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,740
the safety risks as well as the

358
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:22,019
mitigating controls it takes a layer of

359
00:13:22,019 --> 00:13:24,540
expertise to dive into that

360
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:26,820
so where do we start again diving into

361
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:30,180
the Bia business impact analysis you're

362
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:32,220
that sizzo you're that leader that has

363
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:33,839
come in and have been asked by the

364
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:37,620
president what assets if impacted would

365
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:39,839
produce non-productive time loss of

366
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:41,459
Revenue loss of life and you probably

367
00:13:41,459 --> 00:13:42,839
don't know where to start the business

368
00:13:42,839 --> 00:13:44,579
impact is really going to give you good

369
00:13:44,579 --> 00:13:46,680
visibility into what assets those

370
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,660
actually pertain to

371
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:50,880
think of the latest breach that happened

372
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,100
last year all of a sudden boards were

373
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:55,500
asking are we subjected to ransomware

374
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:58,200
and if so what dependencies exist in our

375
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,779
environments business impacts analysis

376
00:14:00,779 --> 00:14:02,639
started becoming extremely popular in

377
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:04,320
the past couple years to answer those

378
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,600
questions besides it produces some

379
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,820
pretty good visuals red green yellow and

380
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:10,560
what executive doesn't love and

381
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,660
understand red green yellow

382
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:14,579
so some of the pros around that is it

383
00:14:14,579 --> 00:14:16,380
really Bridges the gap between the

384
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:18,360
business side and operations and it

385
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,519
starts that layer of communication to

386
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:22,260
understanding what's important because

387
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:25,019
not all assets are created the same

388
00:14:25,019 --> 00:14:27,120
some of the challenges with the Bia

389
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,940
really resolve around the scenarios that

390
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:32,639
are used in the likelihood of an actual

391
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:35,040
incident and it is pretty subjective

392
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,779
based on who's doing them and it does

393
00:14:36,779 --> 00:14:39,060
take some time to understand of all

394
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:41,339
assets where to really begin and execute

395
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:42,600
on a Bia

396
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,760
and so we typically see this on the

397
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,680
lower scale of maturity of organizations

398
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:49,019
and when I mention a maturity it's not

399
00:14:49,019 --> 00:14:51,360
based on their revenue it's really

400
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,519
around the resources and the activities

401
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:56,040
that they're doing to move the needle of

402
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:58,019
cyber security holistically throughout

403
00:14:58,019 --> 00:15:01,139
the organization

404
00:15:01,139 --> 00:15:03,120
by the time we get to framework

405
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,560
assessments this is really the

406
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,959
industry's sweet spot right now this is

407
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:08,760
really where an organization is aligning

408
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,980
to a given standard or framework around

409
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:15,360
a standard taxonomy language of controls

410
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,779
these controls are typically mapped to

411
00:15:17,779 --> 00:15:21,180
requirements oftentimes nist base ISO

412
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:24,120
IEC and some of the challenges around

413
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:26,160
implementing framework assessments is

414
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,839
that depending if you're a global

415
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:29,760
organization you probably have mandates

416
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:32,699
that transcend U.S requirements you have

417
00:15:32,699 --> 00:15:34,860
requirements that transcend your clients

418
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:36,720
assets and requirements and how do you

419
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,699
bring it all together what starts with

420
00:15:38,699 --> 00:15:40,260
centralizing and picking a single

421
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:42,180
framework to bridge that Tech sound and

422
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:45,600
we Gap and so once that's done you can

423
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,339
start to align your teams between

424
00:15:47,339 --> 00:15:50,519
business and it and OT together around a

425
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:52,560
Common Language and this allows you to

426
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,199
communicate upward and downward to your

427
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:58,079
operations teams effectively

428
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:01,199
the time allocation is somewhat High

429
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:03,240
because as you know and are familiar

430
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,500
with some of these Frameworks they can

431
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,600
be several hundred requirements just in

432
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,639
one and it takes a lot of hurting of the

433
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:10,620
cats to get everybody in a room and

434
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:12,420
answer these questions and then what do

435
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:13,800
you do with these with these

436
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:16,139
requirements you all you can identify

437
00:16:16,139 --> 00:16:18,360
the missing gaps you can map threats you

438
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:21,000
can map risks and this starts to paint a

439
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,860
holistic picture around your risk

440
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:25,380
posture when it comes to people process

441
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:27,660
and technology and we haven't forgotten

442
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:28,980
about those technologies that are

443
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:32,160
plugged in and giving us insights

444
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,620
when it comes to a more mature art

445
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:37,440
organization we start to see component

446
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,959
assessments equipment layer assessments

447
00:16:39,959 --> 00:16:42,660
again I would say this is a fewer than

448
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:44,699
one percent of organizations out there

449
00:16:44,699 --> 00:16:47,940
doing this today and so the reason why

450
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:49,740
there's so few organizations doing

451
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:52,019
component level equipment is the

452
00:16:52,019 --> 00:16:54,720
expertise that it takes to do this it

453
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,579
usually takes an OT cyber security

454
00:16:56,579 --> 00:16:58,920
expert to really understand the network

455
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:01,500
topology of a given control environment

456
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:04,140
it takes an expert to understand what

457
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:05,939
controls should be in place what

458
00:17:05,939 --> 00:17:08,099
mitigating controls already map and oh

459
00:17:08,099 --> 00:17:10,919
by the way have a data repository of all

460
00:17:10,919 --> 00:17:13,559
equipment and understand what specific

461
00:17:13,559 --> 00:17:16,559
threat scenarios maybe five four cases

462
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:18,780
that are really relevant to that

463
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:21,179
environment and then start going through

464
00:17:21,179 --> 00:17:23,400
a series of scenarios to really truly

465
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,679
identify the risks to that equipment or

466
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:27,059
sub-function level in a control

467
00:17:27,059 --> 00:17:28,799
environment

468
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:32,460
this again is on the maturity Arc of

469
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:34,440
organizations and it's not very common

470
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,240
but those are the Innovative

471
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:39,480
organizations leading the way today

472
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,460
so when I go back to organizational

473
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,380
maturity we really see the industry

474
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:46,440
evolving into four distinct phases you

475
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:49,260
are either in a prepare a baseline an

476
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:51,240
accelerate or incorporate a phase and

477
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,679
I'm going to dive into each of those

478
00:17:52,679 --> 00:17:55,740
here shortly but at its core if you're

479
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:57,780
in the prepare phase it has nothing to

480
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:59,580
do with the revenue of your organization

481
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:02,160
it really comes down to where you are

482
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,740
from a cyber security program within the

483
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:07,559
organizations and the resources that are

484
00:18:07,559 --> 00:18:09,419
allocated to it you're typically

485
00:18:09,419 --> 00:18:11,640
planning your journey by the time you've

486
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:13,799
gotten to the Baseline you've solidified

487
00:18:13,799 --> 00:18:15,419
a framework that you want to try to

488
00:18:15,419 --> 00:18:17,460
create a Common Language taxonomy around

489
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:21,000
you're aligning stakeholders and you're

490
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,220
establishing a plan of action when

491
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:24,840
you've transitioned to accelerate and

492
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:26,700
incorporate you've been doing your

493
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:28,200
program for a couple years and you've

494
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,640
worked out the bugs you know what

495
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,260
resources are needed

496
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:33,900
and you're ready for repeatable task and

497
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:36,059
Automation and by the time you get to

498
00:18:36,059 --> 00:18:37,860
incorporate you've installed so many

499
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:40,620
technological solutions you've

500
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,660
Incorporated the bias and you're doing

501
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:44,460
framework assessments and you want and

502
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:46,380
you're ready for a holistic breadth of

503
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:48,960
information to sum up and answer those

504
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,900
four questions in the beginning

505
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:54,299
so perhaps this profile might fit you

506
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:56,100
those that are in the room that are new

507
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:58,799
to OT that are a sizzo that are a CIO

508
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:01,559
with no OT background there is no cyber

509
00:19:01,559 --> 00:19:03,179
security program in place because it

510
00:19:03,179 --> 00:19:05,340
didn't exist before then but you've been

511
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:07,980
brought in to figure it out your first

512
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,600
year will be spent trying to understand

513
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,480
the business the Enterprise risk

514
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,820
strategy trying to figure out what kind

515
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:17,039
of budget would even be necessary to

516
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:19,919
even start your program and most most

517
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:22,260
importantly getting buy-in from your

518
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:24,419
business units your operating Executives

519
00:19:24,419 --> 00:19:27,000
your engineers really trying to Rally

520
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,760
them around creating this program and

521
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,140
most likely you're going to start with a

522
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:33,000
Bia because you don't even know what you

523
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,520
have so the Bia is going to tell you

524
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,860
what assets are most important to the

525
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:39,840
organization and then those would be

526
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,880
effectively your scope of assets that

527
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:45,140
transitions you into the Baseline

528
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:47,640
section by the time you've gotten to

529
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,620
Baseline again you've probably picked

530
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:51,000
out a framework maybe it's multiple

531
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,440
Frameworks because you're Global

532
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,120
organizations with assets all over the

533
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,580
world and you need to follow some rules

534
00:19:56,580 --> 00:20:00,419
that are subjected to the UK or APAC

535
00:20:00,419 --> 00:20:02,400
region and then you're figuring out how

536
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,380
to control and co-mingle all that

537
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:06,419
information but the most important part

538
00:20:06,419 --> 00:20:08,280
of the being in the Baseline is that

539
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,780
you're doing assessments and you're

540
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:11,580
figuring out what exists you're

541
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:14,160
identifying controls that are specific

542
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,780
to your environment that are either

543
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:18,419
there or non-existent you're perhaps

544
00:20:18,419 --> 00:20:20,220
sharing some of those insights across

545
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:21,660
the business unit because you need

546
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:24,539
support support to implement tools

547
00:20:24,539 --> 00:20:27,120
support to train individuals because

548
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,820
perhaps that's a challenge in a gap but

549
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:32,039
most importantly you're building your

550
00:20:32,039 --> 00:20:35,280
ecosystem of knowledge and awareness

551
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,320
by the time you're at accelerate this

552
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,820
program's probably been in place as I

553
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:41,220
mentioned five to eight years

554
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:43,799
anything below that you're still in

555
00:20:43,799 --> 00:20:46,320
Baseline and that is really truly what

556
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,419
we're seeing from the field those that

557
00:20:48,419 --> 00:20:50,400
are in cell an accelerate phase are

558
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,140
ready for automation they've been doing

559
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:54,299
the assessments they know what's missing

560
00:20:54,299 --> 00:20:56,520
but the reality is you're not going to

561
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,200
get hundreds of millions of dollars for

562
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,240
your budget each year you're gonna have

563
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,039
to slice it up so that's why

564
00:21:02,039 --> 00:21:03,960
organizations stay multiple years in

565
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,700
that baselining phase because you just

566
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:07,980
can't assess everything in one year you

567
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:09,960
just don't have the resources so it

568
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:12,539
takes several years to get to accelerate

569
00:21:12,539 --> 00:21:13,919
where you finally have assessed

570
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:16,320
everything and now you know what is

571
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,120
missing and what kind of budget you need

572
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:20,880
to deploy to affect change

573
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,039
in accelerate you're also perhaps

574
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:25,320
working with your supply chain to really

575
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:27,960
understand and mandate requirements to

576
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,640
them because now you understand what you

577
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,260
have in your environment now you know

578
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:32,820
what's necessary and if you're going to

579
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:34,860
continue to do business you might as

580
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:36,360
well partner and make sure that they're

581
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:39,240
deploying secure assets as well so right

582
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,679
now you're collaborating with business

583
00:21:40,679 --> 00:21:42,480
units and you're probably communicating

584
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,340
to the board so now this is getting

585
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:46,799
tracked at a quarterly basis so once you

586
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:49,080
start you can't stop kind of like

587
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:50,340
getting on that hamster wheel when

588
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:51,480
you're fundraising for your company

589
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:53,400
can't really stop

590
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,679
when you get to incorporate again I

591
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:57,600
mentioned you have a lot of Solutions in

592
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,980
place

593
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:02,159
you have integrated insights that you

594
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:03,780
want to co-mingle with framework

595
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:06,240
assessment outputs and perhaps you're

596
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:09,480
also pushing down your assessment

597
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:12,120
programs Downstream in a decentralized

598
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,679
manner because of automation

599
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:15,840
capabilities you're standing up

600
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,419
validation protocols and you're

601
00:22:18,419 --> 00:22:20,780
incorporating additional specific

602
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:24,120
business contacts into the assessment

603
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:26,539
layer

604
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:28,740
so putting all three of these things

605
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:31,740
together what this really enables you as

606
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:33,679
Leaders is to answer those questions

607
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:37,200
what happens when we get breached what

608
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:40,500
is impacted that's your Bia where is our

609
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,780
real risk and what are we doing to fix

610
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:45,000
it those are your framework and GAP

611
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,880
assessments and what is the true threats

612
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:50,100
that are facing our organization today

613
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:52,679
that comes down to the equipment sub

614
00:22:52,679 --> 00:22:55,320
component level understanding and when

615
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:57,419
you have all of that your organization

616
00:22:57,419 --> 00:22:59,940
is maturing at a rate that is

617
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:02,100
sustainable and then of course things

618
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:04,559
are going to change

619
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:07,260
but just like things can change rapidly

620
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:09,720
for one country so can for this industry

621
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:13,020
in London's darkest days they thought it

622
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:16,440
was over but they persevered they did

623
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:19,260
impactful things each day as Leaders you

624
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:20,760
don't need the government to tell you

625
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:23,100
what to do or to wait for a framework to

626
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:25,080
come out or a client to send you a list

627
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:27,720
of requirements you action every day

628
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,640
it's the culture that you manifest

629
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,620
within your organization to do something

630
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:35,039
about it you have intense teamwork and

631
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:37,320
rally together like they did

632
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:39,539
and have some fun along the way I mean

633
00:23:39,539 --> 00:23:41,460
we're all here in Miami enjoying this

634
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:44,220
weather aren't we and so lastly they had

635
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:47,159
a moral purpose to survive and just like

636
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:49,860
that they are a shining example of what

637
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:52,559
can be when working together comes

638
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:53,880
together

639
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:56,410
thank you

640
00:23:56,410 --> 00:23:59,929
[Applause]
