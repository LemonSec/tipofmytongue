2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,679
boy is it good to be back

3
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:10,960
can't believe

4
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,440
can't believe it's only been two years

5
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:14,400
um

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,239
the one thing i really love about s4

7
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:18,880
honestly is the storytelling and when

8
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,880
you think about myths they're as old as

9
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,000
storytelling as in in humanity um when i

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,199
was a kid

11
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:26,720
a lot of the myths that were told to me

12
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,800
growing up in new jersey was this idea

13
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,320
of a mythical creature called the jersey

14
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:31,920
devil you probably all heard of this the

15
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,760
hockey team is named after it and the

16
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:36,079
jersey devil was this creature had had

17
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:39,680
goat hooves and horns and claws and it

18
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,840
was told to me as a kid probably just to

19
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,200
scare me to keep me out of the woods at

20
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,840
night and it was also used to explain

21
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,480
some things that couldn't be explained

22
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,960
you know why were i don't know cattle

23
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,039
going missing or you know these these

24
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:54,960
things that went bump in the night

25
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,360
and these creatures were created

26
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,520
along with their myths to to not only

27
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,680
tell a story but to maybe control or

28
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,239
instill fear or to do all these things

29
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:05,040
to

30
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,560
to kind of

31
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,960
get across something to the the listener

32
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:13,040
or the or or the the viewer and we have

33
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:13,840
these

34
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,600
in our own industry it's kind of funny

35
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,560
uh you know i i asked the on the hoover

36
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:19,280
app

37
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,240
i asked what myths have we told

38
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:25,360
in in our industrial journey and our

39
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,439
security advisors or product companies

40
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:30,799
or product security and oms oems and

41
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:33,040
we tell these stories as a way to convey

42
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,880
a message to get something of importance

43
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,439
across to the listener but sometimes

44
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:40,400
they become nefarious sometimes we

45
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,960
create these fantastical creatures to

46
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,479
to get a point across because maybe the

47
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,399
listener doesn't believe or understand

48
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:47,680
what it is that we're saying and some of

49
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,200
these

50
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,119
you probably already heard like oh asset

51
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:52,320
owners

52
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,600
they don't know what's in their

53
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,799
inventory they don't even know what's in

54
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:56,320
their power plant

55
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,560
do you think that's actually true

56
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,439
that's i don't always and don't get me

57
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:02,880
wrong these were things that i did

58
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,439
initially as a young consultant or early

59
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:07,520
in the industry another one was uh the

60
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,399
air gap

61
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:09,679
oh my gosh

62
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:10,560
uh

63
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,640
this one's great because there are some

64
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,800
air gaps out there anyone ever work in a

65
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,000
nuclear plant

66
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,560
that's there's a honest to goodness air

67
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,879
gap there but we all talk about it we

68
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:23,280
joke about it we have beer as a beer i

69
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,120
sack we go oh the air gap there's no

70
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,720
such thing see someone's cracking a beer

71
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:27,520
there

72
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,640
and um

73
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,920
we say

74
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,200
the mythical air gap doesn't exist

75
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,800
nothing's air-gapped if it's connected

76
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,000
to the enterprises connect to the

77
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,680
internet we make up these stories

78
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,760
because it's how we convey our own

79
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,760
messaging our own beliefs

80
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,519
and we tell these stories

81
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:45,360
and sometimes there's a villain in them

82
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,080
there's a mythical creature there's some

83
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,599
fire breathing creature or something

84
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:51,519
that goes bump in the night that you can

85
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:53,599
use to scare the person into believing

86
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:55,519
you maybe give it a little more humph

87
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:56,480
and

88
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,159
what we're going to talk about today is

89
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:00,640
this idea of

90
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,879
recognizing the kind of biases or the

91
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:05,680
kind of storytelling we

92
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,360
convey to each other when we get into

93
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,480
these groups

94
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,280
um

95
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,440
you first have to be aware that it is a

96
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,760
problem because i think at this point in

97
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,760
the maturity of the industry it's

98
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,360
definitely a problem

99
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,840
but also recognize why we had to do this

100
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,239
uh we're not malicious people we're all

101
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:23,920
well intended we're trying to do best

102
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,560
for our industry make things more secure

103
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,159
so we need to be aware why we created

104
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:29,440
these fantastical creatures in the

105
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,560
beginning

106
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,720
but then more importantly recognize both

107
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,720
why we did it why we're currently doing

108
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,879
and and what to do for the future

109
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:38,720
because we really need to not do this

110
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,959
anymore and i'll have a few examples

111
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:43,599
we'll get through why but if we're going

112
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:45,760
to really move forward move the needle

113
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,760
as an industry not have another lost

114
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,519
decade

115
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:51,599
we got to really focus on how we can

116
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:53,360
move forward both as a community as

117
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,920
individuals and with our industrial

118
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,760
partners to actually empower them for

119
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,799
future change

120
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:02,159
now one thing

121
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:03,360
um

122
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,920
we all have mascots right we all have

123
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,400
logos we give our malware logos and

124
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,920
mascots this isn't about symbols though

125
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,439
so the mythical creatures i've chosen

126
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:15,120
have really nothing to do with anyone in

127
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,238
the audience

128
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:18,160
the idea here though is that these are

129
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,720
symbolic of some of the core issues we

130
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,479
have in the industry

131
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:24,000
but just recognized we're all fighting

132
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,880
for the same cause so

133
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,360
with that hopefully

134
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,840
our first mythical creature and this was

135
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,360
near and dear to my heart because i

136
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,400
started in industrial maybe

137
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:39,520
20 000 2009 2010. i think my first s4

138
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,120
was 2012.

139
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,520
um was this idea that we were a special

140
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,919
community we were new

141
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:48,479
we were young and hungry

142
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:51,440
we weren't respected honestly

143
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,280
how many times

144
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,400
i heard as an advisor or consultant

145
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,680
nobody cares about critical

146
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,360
infrastructure who would want to hack

147
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,479
this

148
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:02,560
was as a pen tester like the worst thing

149
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,600
you could hear

150
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,280
that would go in

151
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,360
they would be convinced somehow that

152
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,759
they needed a pen test you'd go you get

153
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,600
root you do all these things and how do

154
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,199
you actually go the next step and show

155
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:14,720
that i could impact the process and

156
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,479
operations they go well

157
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:18,800
ron we walked you into the substation

158
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,880
and who would even want to do this and

159
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,000
that made us

160
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,600
at least that made me

161
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,639
like angry but motivated like this is

162
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,880
new this is groundbreaking how can we

163
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,960
get this across so this natural urge to

164
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,240
be special

165
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,600
was born out of the idea that no one

166
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,320
took us serious ten years ago

167
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,919
we spent most of our time convincing

168
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:40,800
people that security was indeed an issue

169
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,039
that the industrial community needed to

170
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,400
to

171
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,919
provide solutions for

172
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:47,759
uh so that came with that was the need

173
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:49,039
for recognition

174
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:51,759
and honestly s4 has been great for that

175
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:53,759
this is our this is our super bowl i

176
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:55,520
mean if it wasn't weiss con it was here

177
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,560
and honestly we preferred here so um

178
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,240
s4 was the place where like-minded

179
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,759
people could come together and share

180
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:04,240
these ideas and and find other unicorns

181
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,240
and be like no no no we're not actually

182
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,080
all that different i have peers that

183
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,919
care about the same thing i do

184
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:13,039
and so as we moved along we started to

185
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,280
have awards and we started to

186
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,080
get quoted in cnn and then media showed

187
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,880
up and it made us feel even more special

188
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,080
and more

189
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,800
unique versus the rest of infosec or

190
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,960
cyber security

191
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,600
the last one um i think this is

192
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,280
unchanged and this is actually the

193
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,880
reason why i'm still in industrial

194
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,840
security the the mission is amazing i

195
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,000
have not seen a mission this critical

196
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
this important and something that i get

197
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,360
up in the morning to be this excited

198
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,880
about since i was in the military and it

199
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,680
has that military feel warts and all

200
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:49,280
right um so when you wake up and you

201
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,280
feel like you really are

202
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,599
you know saving humanity

203
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:56,000
you start to convince yourself wait no i

204
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
am special i am better than everyone

205
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:58,880
else

206
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,720
and so understand again we're going to

207
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,880
go through this with two other mythical

208
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,479
creatures

209
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:06,400
this this wasn't wrong

210
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,120
we were not recognized we were young and

211
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,520
hungry we are on a critical mission but

212
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,599
this is how it manifests

213
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:14,800
and

214
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,319
if i hear about the skills gap one

215
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:18,400
though one more time

216
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,199
um

217
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:21,120
never before in the history of

218
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,880
industrial security have we had more

219
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,720
training more conferences more

220
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,160
documentation

221
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,039
uh more awareness

222
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:31,759
we i think infosec went through this uh

223
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:33,039
years back

224
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:34,479
and now they have

225
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:37,120
degrees and masters programs and all

226
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,400
these things

227
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,280
the skills gap is there and this will be

228
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,520
tough to hear because we're keeping it

229
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,759
there this is the problem of the unicorn

230
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:48,560
we want to ensure that we are still

231
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,080
special

232
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,919
so when you think about all these things

233
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:53,520
like reaching out and helping another

234
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,919
person whether they're a competitor or a

235
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:57,360
friend or whatever

236
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,599
you always want to hold back like no i

237
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:01,599
have the secret tool bag i have the

238
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:04,319
secret knowledge this is a huge problem

239
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:06,800
right now with industrial and we keep

240
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,039
perpetrating it in our messaging and our

241
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:12,879
media no no only we know best and you

242
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:15,599
are just learning so as long as you have

243
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:18,000
me to guide you you'll be okay

244
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,440
that leads into the next one which is

245
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,680
gatekeeping this is another big problem

246
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,879
you know in the early days we used to

247
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:23,759
joke

248
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:24,879
you don't have enough operational

249
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,879
experience to really say or know what

250
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,240
you're talking about and if reid's out

251
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,639
there i'm sorry

252
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:33,039
that was an old joke that was internal

253
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:35,360
to the early days of industrial security

254
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,440
where it really was hey

255
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,120
this idea of if you haven't stepped into

256
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,519
a power plant who are you to tell me

257
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:43,839
how to secure that power plant

258
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:46,160
and at first that kind of made sense

259
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,920
maybe

260
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,760
but then as you moved along you said

261
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:50,959
wait a second

262
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:53,760
i have skills to bring i have experience

263
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,360
just because i didn't turn a wrench or

264
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,120
program a plc or

265
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,360
technically never you know interacted

266
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,279
with ladder logic that doesn't mean i

267
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:02,720
don't have something to offer

268
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,240
and this is something we continue maybe

269
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,240
not as much to say

270
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,600
well we're only looking for the rock

271
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,240
stars the unicorns someone who's

272
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,640
actually done ir on an oil rig do you

273
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,399
know how many people there are in the

274
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:16,880
world that have done ir on an oil rig we

275
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,279
can't be that exclusive

276
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:21,279
because the community if we want to

277
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:23,519
broaden and mature needs to have

278
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:24,880
everyone

279
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,480
with their unique backgrounds and skill

280
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,800
sets coming to the table

281
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,279
this last one um that's a highlander

282
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,519
highlander reference but it it's the

283
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:35,519
idea that everyone has to be top of the

284
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:36,399
heap

285
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:38,880
i'm the best in the world at x there can

286
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,399
only be one

287
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:43,760
uh lead researcher lead ir

288
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,519
this isn't a race

289
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:47,519
there's plenty of room for everyone the

290
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,200
gates are open there's tons of

291
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,399
opportunity

292
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,640
and if we're going to really grow as not

293
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,640
just a niche of a niche but like an

294
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,720
actual community these three things with

295
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,560
the unicorn really just need to be need

296
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,399
to be killed

297
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:02,240
so to recap

298
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,279
the exclusion part is huge not just uh

299
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:07,360
based on race gender et cetera but on

300
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,440
skill set on background there's so many

301
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,040
things so many barriers we put in front

302
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,959
of people before we're allowed or

303
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:14,720
allowing them to come to the table and

304
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,560
that just needs to stop

305
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,720
in order for our community to to really

306
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,480
mature

307
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,480
so i'm action oriented so and

308
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,320
everything's in threes as you can tell

309
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,959
so three things you can do today

310
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:29,200
go out there you have a unique skill set

311
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,200
you have a unique perspective you're

312
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,800
going to raise your hand at bisac or

313
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,640
you're going to post on twitter i can

314
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,720
help with something

315
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,440
maybe you've built these systems before

316
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,279
and you're just getting into security

317
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,200
there's someone who's been doing infosec

318
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,680
security incident response for years

319
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,000
they've never touched a plc you need to

320
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,519
raise your hand and say i can help you

321
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:50,800
with that and

322
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,320
this is tougher but something the

323
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,440
community

324
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,959
is getting better at you also need to

325
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:57,120
raise your hand and say i need help with

326
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,240
why

327
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,920
you need to admit to the community

328
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,000
i am doing something and i don't know

329
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,399
how ladder logic works can is there

330
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,399
anyone that can help me with this this

331
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:10,000
is how we short circuit

332
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,120
like actual progress in our community

333
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,360
so you'd do that today or this week

334
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,040
right and this is the perfect venue for

335
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,800
that by the way and go to beer isac

336
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,800
you're gonna get introduced to someone i

337
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,480
had someone last night that said hey i'm

338
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,320
a nuclear engineer what's the best way

339
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,320
to to hack a nuclear power plant that's

340
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,839
awesome let's get a whiteboard like

341
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:30,800
we're going to draw that out

342
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,800
i've only ever had that happen here

343
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:33,920
you're not going to have that happen in

344
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,839
rsa or black hat or anywhere else so

345
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:37,680
take advantage of that please

346
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,880
but as you go back out into the world uh

347
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,880
bring that into your organization

348
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,320
likewise in your organization there's

349
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,920
all these different silos and business

350
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,360
units and everyone else

351
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,360
and they're usually hesitant to be like

352
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,200
hey i need i need help with something

353
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,639
and you're probably hesitant to say i

354
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:55,600
can help with with this topic so next

355
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,839
week maybe next month or during this

356
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:00,000
month go out and try to affect change

357
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,600
within your organization and then as the

358
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,200
year goes on if you're an electric

359
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,519
utility oil and gas if you're a product

360
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:07,600
security at an oem

361
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,760
find that broader community reach out

362
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:12,079
beyond your your own tribe or your no

363
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:14,240
your own family within an organization

364
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,240
and start to bring that context to the

365
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,959
rest of the world

366
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,720
so second

367
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,240
the basilisk

368
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,480
which is this scary demon

369
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,560
if if it glances at you you literally

370
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,639
just turn into stone it kills you

371
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:29,760
um

372
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,680
this is born out of this idea this this

373
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,240
we talk about fear uncertainty and doubt

374
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,160
back to the unicorn we were never taken

375
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:39,360
advantage so or taken

376
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,959
taken seriously

377
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:43,360
so what's the best way then to to hype

378
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,600
up and and be taken seriously you make

379
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,440
things more urgent more scary more

380
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,800
chaotic

381
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:49,680
and

382
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,720
this scary demon was created in order to

383
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,399
affect change i don't think it was done

384
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:58,160
maliciously but here we have with it um

385
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,519
it was born out of some real things

386
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:00,320
though

387
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,320
even 10 years ago the the attack surface

388
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,880
for ics was was ever increasing this

389
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,680
other myth of the ito ot convergence

390
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,920
like that was converged 15 years ago

391
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,600
that ship has sailed

392
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,399
we had enterprise connected to ot for

393
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:15,920
business reasons

394
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,600
um and depending on the organization it

395
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,200
may have been haphazard it may have been

396
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,839
but it was there for a purpose so as the

397
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:24,639
ics attack surface increased

398
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:27,360
the reality of our made-up creature

399
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,800
started to become

400
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,240
more and more real by the day it was

401
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,399
like wait you know how would

402
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:34,639
ron enter a substation well i'll just go

403
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:36,079
pop the lock connect to it now i'm

404
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:37,839
connected to every single substation on

405
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:38,720
the ring

406
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,720
that was because of this convergence and

407
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,320
so as that increased the bee started

408
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,720
become real and from our perspective we

409
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,040
wanted to be taken even more seriously

410
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,600
because it was no longer theoretical

411
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,839
we had some outside pressures you could

412
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:54,160
call it nerc you could call it

413
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,800
executive orders um every time there was

414
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,959
a breach there was this

415
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:00,959
this huge spike in oh we should do

416
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:02,720
something about it and then three months

417
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,320
later everyone forgot

418
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,920
uh we're going through that cycle now

419
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,760
honestly you have 100 day initiatives

420
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,360
and then i don't know maybe we'll forget

421
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,120
about that this year

422
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,399
you have new malware come out it's

423
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:14,399
almost like if

424
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:15,920
you know you had a neighbor

425
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,600
that had a break in and you're like

426
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,040
super vigilant for a week and then you

427
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,880
forget to lock your door after that we

428
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,800
went through that which is why we create

429
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,800
these things to kind of

430
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,720
carry on this this idea that there were

431
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,320
real threats in the world

432
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,079
and the last one is really about the

433
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:31,680
impact i mean these aren't enterprise

434
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,079
systems if the email server goes down it

435
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:36,240
goes down we'll recover from backup

436
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,320
we'll do what we need to do

437
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,000
but we because of the critical mission

438
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,120
said no no this is our water our power

439
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,760
and so we really hype this up to get

440
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,440
people excited

441
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,760
and this is how it's manifest now it's

442
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,000
this sense of hopelessness

443
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,160
there really is a creature that can

444
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,399
take down the power grid anytime they

445
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:58,639
want um one thing we were talking about

446
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:00,160
last night

447
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,600
are the chinese really in the grid and

448
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,880
they can flip the switch like these are

449
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,959
things we've heard in media uh

450
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:06,959
perpetrated and it's this idea that the

451
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:08,959
powerful the the attackers are so

452
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:11,120
overwhelmingly powerful they're so

453
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,880
sophisticated

454
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,279
and you start to feel well then what can

455
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:16,560
i do about it

456
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,160
you know they have these these

457
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,399
techniques these methods these malware

458
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:22,240
estates sponsored you hear all these

459
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,000
terms and you start to feel hopeless you

460
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,320
go what can i do about it then i'm a

461
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,720
muni co-op i'm a small business i'm this

462
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,959
this and that i don't have the budget

463
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:33,360
everyone just gives up you go well

464
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,720
and then this is where the industry

465
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,320
started to really extend and this is

466
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,759
where we got ourselves in trouble we

467
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:41,360
said well you need a hero don't worry i

468
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,600
know what to do i will come in and save

469
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,639
you

470
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:45,920
and

471
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:49,440
we kind of white knighted the industry

472
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,320
and at first i think it was welcomed but

473
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,399
now we're saying hey wait a second um i

474
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:56,320
can't have you come in every time and

475
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,560
save me when are you going to teach me

476
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,320
how to fight off these demons or these

477
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,560
creatures

478
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,639
so this idea that

479
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:06,800
now that we're maturing as a company or

480
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,120
as a as a community and we're having

481
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,360
these real-life threats we're having

482
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,079
these real-life use cases these hacks

483
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:15,040
the

484
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,399
attack surfaces increase all these

485
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:18,880
things are starting to converge

486
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,560
these scary creatures are no longer

487
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,759
necessary

488
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:24,079
they really aren't and in fact the smart

489
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:26,560
cisos and the smart folks and this might

490
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,240
be demeaning but the smart folks that

491
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,680
are paying attention

492
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:32,560
they know we're full of it

493
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,480
right but they sit there and go okay

494
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,240
okay what are you gonna name the next

495
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,079
threat actor all right all right yep

496
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:41,600
they're after me they're after me um

497
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,120
it's something that's not necessary

498
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,680
anymore i don't think

499
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,680
and and maybe this is uh surprising to

500
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,120
some folks i don't think there's an

501
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,199
asset owner out there that doesn't

502
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:53,279
believe security is a problem

503
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:54,639
so we don't need to create these fire

504
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:56,399
breathing things to scare them to make

505
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:58,720
them think that security is an actual

506
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,480
problem

507
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,240
so again what can you do today

508
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:06,480
the best way to demystify attacks

509
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,240
uh and actually the many guys are going

510
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,160
to be up uh on in controller here right

511
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,679
after

512
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:14,400
is to go learn what the actual attack is

513
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,359
go study it see what these scary fire

514
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:19,119
breathing adversaries are creating the

515
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:21,199
the best of the best most sophisticated

516
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:23,919
go look at their code their code sucks

517
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:25,839
like i mean that was the big revelation

518
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:27,839
from the first and destroyer was

519
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:29,840
some of these modules don't even work

520
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,200
like what's going on this is the best

521
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,960
the russians can do

522
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,799
this is the best way to demystify is to

523
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:37,280
actually go think about a real attack

524
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,799
whether documented or something you come

525
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:40,480
up with your head in your head

526
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:43,919
um study it think about the reality of

527
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:46,559
of that attack vector and something that

528
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:48,480
actually has impact

529
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,919
and once you do that you'll start to

530
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:51,600
expand you'll start to think

531
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,520
well wait now that i i go back to my

532
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,880
organization i go back to my

533
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,799
architecture environment and i say

534
00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:58,960
would that attack actually work

535
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,400
in my architecture

536
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,080
what are all the barriers that i have

537
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,840
set up or my organization has set up to

538
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,559
make this attack not realistic anymore

539
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:08,320
it's no longer scary

540
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:12,160
and then the big thing we have a lot of

541
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,720
mythical storytelling around attacks and

542
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,640
even i did it earlier in the talk i

543
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,880
snuck into the substation and i plugged

544
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:22,640
in and i shut down the entire grid

545
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,960
we need those same stories for how you

546
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,840
stop the attackers we need the same

547
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,160
funny stories about oh my god did you

548
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,799
see that that malware it was awful

549
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:34,400
awful awful

550
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:38,160
as we demystify these these over-hyped

551
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,720
or these kind of overblown threats

552
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,240
it's going to make you more confident to

553
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,760
make the industry more confident that

554
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:44,960
we're actually doing something

555
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:49,039
worthwhile to to kind of push the needle

556
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,840
this last one and um i'm now in the

557
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,600
product hat so this one's squarely at me

558
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,640
as well it's the idea of the werewolf

559
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,160
this and it's not so much about the

560
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,240
mythical creature itself more as the way

561
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,919
to dispatch the mythical creature which

562
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:03,120
is the silver bullet and i'm sure

563
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,400
everyone's heard

564
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,160
and if only i had the blinky box that

565
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,240
would stop all the apts

566
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,080
then my industrial environment would be

567
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:10,960
safe

568
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,320
and

569
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:15,919
this was needed early on because

570
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:18,400
operations or industrial or the i.t

571
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,919
groups that were supporting industrial

572
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:22,160
never never felt empowered they never

573
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,320
felt like they had weapons or shields or

574
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,480
defenses to go after these these

575
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:29,200
industrial attacks these stuxnets and

576
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,120
reset the clock but um

577
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,280
these things that they were hearing all

578
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,799
the time

579
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:36,000
they didn't have any sense of

580
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,840
operational empowerment again it was

581
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,919
this idea of helplessness

582
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:41,840
so as we went along

583
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,440
in my advisor hat then you started

584
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,880
getting consultants to come in and there

585
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,880
was increased engagement there was all

586
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,200
these things with risk-based approaches

587
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,760
and compliance versus security and we

588
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,320
started to bring up all these solutions

589
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,840
to the scary problems and the things

590
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,440
that went bumping the night

591
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,840
but then it took more of a sinister turn

592
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,919
um now all of a sudden it was the blinky

593
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:04,320
box don't look in the box to see what

594
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,919
it's doing but don't worry it'll protect

595
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:08,559
you just keep paying us every year

596
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:09,600
i

597
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,240
it was the advisor hey i did this too

598
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,320
i'll come in for a pen test i'll tell

599
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:15,760
you you need to patch your firewall

600
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,400
rules stink and i was able to pivot

601
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,760
throughout the network and disrupt

602
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,280
processes

603
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,280
make sure you bring me back next year

604
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,919
right so we over specialized based on

605
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:27,520
this idea that

606
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,720
it was us

607
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:29,600
or

608
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,600
and i say us it's the capital u but it

609
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,600
was us doing this as a community to try

610
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,480
to help

611
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,640
but we really really over specialized

612
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,039
the tooling we made it so complex so

613
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:41,600
over specialized that our actual users

614
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,520
our operators industrial and security

615
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,400
couldn't

616
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,840
couldn't wield them they couldn't use

617
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,720
them when we were gone couple that with

618
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,720
the with the overhyped threats

619
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,320
every threat seemed like there was

620
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,640
something uniquely special about it so

621
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:57,919
you needed the new blinky box that

622
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:01,120
uh defended against the new chinese apt

623
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,559
and then it just kept iterating and

624
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:04,799
iterating until you had these cure-all

625
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:07,120
well if you only had

626
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,840
x technique x monitoring this threat

627
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,559
intel these services folks and it was

628
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:15,120
never about the actual operator

629
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,919
defending their own network monitoring

630
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:20,640
uh operating responding to their own

631
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,640
network it was always idea that we had

632
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,240
some sort of silver bullet for them to

633
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,400
buy

634
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,840
so

635
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,360
with this one it's a little more

636
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,440
ambiguous but stick with me

637
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,919
the operator security and industrial not

638
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:35,600
us unless there's operators in here i

639
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,520
think there's a few

640
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,760
they know better

641
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:40,880
not us

642
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,520
so let that sink in for a second

643
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,280
they operate the plant

644
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,280
they operate the pipeline they work with

645
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,640
it day-to-day

646
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,080
they have their own

647
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:54,480
problems struggles successes

648
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:58,159
our job in the industry oem product

649
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:01,280
advisor whoever researcher

650
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:04,080
our job should solely be to empower them

651
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,400
to make them a force multiplier

652
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,480
in the operations they're already doing

653
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,600
and that's the big one they don't need

654
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,120
any more silver bullets maybe they need

655
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,880
some regular bullets

656
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,799
that they can fire themselves

657
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:16,559
they don't need any more silver bullets

658
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:17,840
they're just fatigued with it and

659
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,760
honestly after another decade after the

660
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:22,240
lost decade i don't think we need more

661
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:25,360
silver bullets at this point

662
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,520
so this one's easy and uh uh chris

663
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,760
systrom says this all the time go find

664
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,200
an operator if you're a security

665
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,960
operator go find an industrial operator

666
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,600
vice versa bring them donuts ask them

667
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:38,960
what keeps them up at night ask them

668
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,880
what help they need how their process

669
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,960
works how their process doesn't work

670
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,799
again engagement

671
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:47,200
with the purpose of empowerment is

672
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,799
what's going to move us forward in these

673
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:51,039
relationships and in the security

674
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:52,400
journey

675
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,120
after that go through and learn at the

676
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,120
organization level what things are

677
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,880
blocking the security operator is it

678
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,600
budget is it resources is it technology

679
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,760
uh is it a ciso who doesn't give a crap

680
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,720
like just find out be engaged and see

681
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,240
how you can affect change within your

682
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,760
organization because then you'll be able

683
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:12,080
to pivot to next year's s4 and give a

684
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,480
talk about how you you've revolutionized

685
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,320
some sort of communication or attack

686
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,559
path analysis or whatever then you can

687
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:20,240
share it with the community the lessons

688
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,240
that you've learned by engaging and

689
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:25,120
empowering others

690
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,480
so

691
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:31,120
the idea here is that if we help each

692
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,640
other out

693
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,440
and at times you may need to be the one

694
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,679
that reaches out to help or you need to

695
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:40,000
be on the receiving end of that help

696
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,880
that cycle that steel on steel

697
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,080
that's what's going to move this

698
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,840
community forward it's no longer going

699
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:48,000
to be a single rock star looking to

700
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,159
elevate themselves above all others

701
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:51,600
together

702
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,200
we can actually

703
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:57,440
empower ourselves to slay these demons

704
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,720
so again we all have a role to play

705
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,080
and i don't even think i've listed all

706
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,919
of the roles on here but when you think

707
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:05,600
of product security

708
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,760
in oems

709
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,919
when you think of

710
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:11,760
what they have to do to respond to

711
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:14,000
researchers vulnerability reports

712
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,360
or to the new attack or to media

713
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,360
put yourselves in their shoes

714
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,039
like the amount of work they have to do

715
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:23,919
to to deflect and defend and to research

716
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:26,000
and to get business line and business

717
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,400
units to to create new code on on

718
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,080
systems that haven't been touched in in

719
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,520
years

720
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,360
they have a role to play they need our

721
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,240
help

722
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,080
the the operator the security operator

723
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,840
the industrial operator the folks that

724
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:40,080
are actually using the systems

725
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,760
they know day to day

726
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,440
what their struggles are what their

727
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,039
limitations are what they're good at

728
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:46,880
what they're not good at

729
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,200
they have a context that none of us will

730
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:52,400
have unless we've sat in their seat

731
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:55,039
for for advisors or consultants

732
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:56,640
you have a wealth of knowledge because

733
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,559
you're just not sitting in a single seat

734
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:01,279
you're going from customer to client to

735
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:02,640
different environments you have this

736
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,960
wealth and breadth of knowledge that

737
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,960
someone working at a single facility

738
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,559
will never have

739
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:10,480
and it's your job to tell that story to

740
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,720
bring that context to everyone you

741
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:13,760
encounter

742
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,360
and then for vendors and product and

743
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,440
technology and anything any tools that

744
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:20,799
we're creating to help our operators

745
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:23,039
you're able to codify all that you're

746
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:25,279
able to make it accessible you're able

747
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:26,080
to

748
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:28,400
to to make things efficient a force

749
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:31,200
multiplier for our operators

750
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:34,320
each of us has a role like a tank and a

751
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:38,000
damage dealer and a healer and a support

752
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,320
it only works if we work together it

753
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,720
really does and when when a tank leroy

754
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,559
jenkins off into a room

755
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:46,480
you know what's going to happen so as

756
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,960
long as we empower each other

757
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,880
then we're all going to succeed

758
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:51,919
and so

759
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:53,840
to close

760
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,200
it's kind of a

761
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,960
mr rogers quote you have to look for the

762
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,080
helpers

763
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,840
okay there are many helpers in this

764
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:02,080
community and in fact s4 is the only

765
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:04,480
place i've seen everyone come together

766
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:07,360
and almost be overly helpful

767
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:08,960
like just like hey you need to meet this

768
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:11,600
person they need help that is fantastic

769
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,039
we need to continue that we need to

770
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:14,640
emulate that for the new folks that are

771
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,559
here and then more importantly once we

772
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:18,320
leave miami we need to bring that out to

773
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:21,200
the world because empowering others is

774
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,720
what's going to move our community

775
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:26,000
forward it's it's easy to be the hero

776
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,320
it's easy to be luke skywalker right

777
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,760
it's a kid with a lightsaber you're

778
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,440
gonna go save the world

779
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,840
um we really need to be obi-wan we need

780
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:36,240
to be the advisors the guides we need to

781
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:39,600
be hero makers not heroes ourselves

782
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,520
because it's easy to be the hero

783
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,520
it's self-centered it's all about you

784
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:44,640
you have your own struggles you're gonna

785
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,799
save the day but to make other people

786
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:49,039
heroes that's really how we're gonna

787
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:50,480
move this community forward that's how

788
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,400
we're gonna actually secure

789
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,400
our industrial environments

790
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,360
that's how we're going to create the

791
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,720
future

792
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:57,520
so

793
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,760
thanks again it's great to be back at s4

794
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:03,640
and have a great rest of the conference
