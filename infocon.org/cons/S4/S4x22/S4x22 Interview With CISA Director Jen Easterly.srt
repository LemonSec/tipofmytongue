00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:07,680
please welcome director easterly and

2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,580
dale to the s4 main stage

3
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:13,360
[Applause]

4
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:14,550
[Music]

5
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:17,749
[Applause]

6
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,119
so welcome to s4 jen thank you we are so

7
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:23,279
happy to have you here i know you have a

8
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:25,920
very wide swath of things you have to do

9
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,800
and ics is just one of them but

10
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,160
we've got a lot of ground to cover so

11
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,000
i'm just going to jump in let's go let's

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,040
do it let's start broad

13
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,040
and then maybe we can

14
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,680
you know go down to the current events

15
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,840
if you look at 2022

16
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,120
2023 what are

17
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,760
two of the top two or three goals you

18
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,840
might have or objectives and and very

19
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,199
interesting on those i'd like to know

20
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:52,640
what kind of metrics how do you know if

21
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,480
you're succeeding yeah

22
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,920
well first of all i'm thrilled to be

23
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:56,960
here

24
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,559
thank you for having me

25
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:01,039
um just to step back a sec i think most

26
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:02,800
of this audience understands sysa

27
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,479
because i know my predecessor has spent

28
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:05,600
time here

29
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,360
but we were really set up three plus

30
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,000
years ago to be america's cyber defense

31
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,520
agency right to help reduce risk to the

32
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,040
cyber and physical infrastructure that

33
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,360
americans rely on every hour

34
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,000
of every day and unlike other

35
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,680
places where i've worked in my career

36
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,680
whether that's the army or the national

37
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,320
security agency or in counterterrorism

38
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,240
where the government arguably has

39
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,759
monopoly power

40
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:32,240
in cyber security we're just a partner

41
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,079
with private industry and our state and

42
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:36,000
local colleagues and so

43
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,920
you know particularly because the vast

44
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,759
majority of infrastructure is owned by

45
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:41,520
the private sector and so those

46
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,920
partnerships are so incredibly important

47
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,119
and among

48
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:48,079
you know one of my top priorities is the

49
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:50,240
security of industrial control systems

50
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,399
and operational technology and that's

51
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:54,720
why i was really excited uh to come down

52
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,719
here to be with this community

53
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:59,280
because this really has to be about

54
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,360
collective cyber defense and so when we

55
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,680
talk about the the goals dale

56
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,000
um i'll let me lay out three of them

57
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,840
okay um i'll try and use a little

58
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,318
alliteration with uh people process and

59
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:11,599
partnerships

60
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:13,440
uh people to me is always the most

61
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,879
important thing but in this case i'm

62
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:16,640
gonna start with process

63
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,920
uh process is not sexy uh but it is

64
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,319
super important and one of the things we

65
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:24,080
were asked to do by the white house in

66
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,560
july of last year based on what's called

67
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,640
a national security memorandum we were

68
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,800
directed to come up with

69
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,319
baseline goals

70
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,080
we call them cyber security performance

71
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,400
goals cpgs because you need an acronym

72
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,160
for everything in the us government as

73
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:38,959
you know

74
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:41,200
um and so we were asked to work with

75
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,800
nist

76
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,800
and to lay out the cyber security

77
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,280
performance goals and we did it across

78
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,680
about 11 categories from risk management

79
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,440
to vulnerability management to incident

80
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,400
response to data access to configuration

81
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,400
management all of that

82
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,959
laying out what the top line goal is

83
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:01,120
what the rationale for that goal is a

84
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,040
series of objectives and then to your

85
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,800
point about metrics

86
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,560
essentially sample

87
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,360
samples of evidence how can you show

88
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,760
that you've actually met those goals now

89
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,599
we were asked to publish the first

90
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:14,879
series of

91
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:17,760
ot goals by september of last year we

92
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,599
went out to the community the ics

93
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:20,720
working group and asked for their

94
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,760
feedback

95
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,440
they came back with some great feedback

96
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,440
we published an update that included

97
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,640
both ot and it in january since then

98
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,480
we've we've received about a thousand

99
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,599
comments

100
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:34,080
and so we're adjudicating one of the

101
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,000
uh the most popular comments was about

102
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,319
how do i think about this with respect

103
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:41,200
to the nist cyber security framework

104
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,640
that the private sector now has

105
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,959
thankfully gotten gotten very used to

106
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:46,400
well those of

107
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,560
us who are familiar with the csf it's

108
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,840
very very broad very um extensive

109
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,319
what the uh cybersecurity performance

110
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:55,360
goals are supposed to be they're going

111
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,680
to map to the framework but they're

112
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,239
going to lay out measurable actionable

113
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:03,680
and attestable and prioritized goals

114
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,560
baseline goals that that any

115
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,640
infrastructure owner or operator can

116
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,599
look to

117
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:11,360
and i can't stress enough how important

118
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,200
it is if you all have not seen these

119
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,000
goals please come to our website

120
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,798
check them out we are all about feedback

121
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:20,399
and improving and making sure that we

122
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:22,079
are working closely with community

123
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,759
particularly you know i know this is a

124
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:25,840
very sophisticated crowd of experts so

125
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,919
we can absolutely

126
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:30,160
use input and guidance and feedback so

127
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,840
please look at that we're adjudicating

128
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,520
guidance right now

129
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,000
we hope to get the baseline goals out

130
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,680
by fall of this year and then we're

131
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,080
going to do sector specific goals so

132
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,759
these range these are designed to range

133
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:43,759
across sectors and then we'll we'll work

134
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:45,440
with each of the critical infrastructure

135
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,520
sectors but again designed to be

136
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,000
measurable and actionable uh by

137
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,080
providing sample evidence so that's sort

138
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,919
of the process pieces before we move to

139
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:55,199
people let's let's talk a little bit

140
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:56,639
about that

141
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:58,639
so one of the questions i actually had

142
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:00,960
later down in my list here was

143
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,759
uh sis has put out a lot of yeah a lot

144
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:06,080
of information you know which is great

145
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,000
um and actually some of the things that

146
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,680
you've done i think have been excellent

147
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,440
from a marketing perspective the bad

148
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,240
practices guy or the bad practices list

149
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,400
the graphic novel i think really

150
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,639
engaging the community with different

151
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:20,880
types of messaging is good but one of

152
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,120
the things i've been confused on is

153
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,199
there's been a lot of guidance documents

154
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,360
like every time there's a new

155
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,000
in control or pipe dream or whatever any

156
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,759
any time

157
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:33,600
you put out these recommendations

158
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,720
they're

159
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,199
similar there's overlap but they're

160
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:40,560
different so if someone was to say what

161
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,039
is the one document i should look at

162
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,960
is it this document you just talked

163
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,639
about is that kind of the north star

164
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:48,320
that say they should say this is what we

165
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,759
should do and everything else is just

166
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:51,919
supporting material yeah that's the goal

167
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:53,600
that we're trying to get to right we're

168
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,919
trying to drive this common baseline and

169
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:58,319
then the sector specific goals

170
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:00,319
across the community look i just spent

171
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:01,680
four and a half years in the financial

172
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,000
services sector i know

173
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,319
how crazy it is to have the government

174
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:08,240
coming at you with all these different

175
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,120
signals saying we need this we need that

176
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,759
and none of it's harmonized they ask for

177
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,199
slightly different things and and

178
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:17,039
frankly dale it's one of my concerns

179
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:18,080
because

180
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,479
what i don't want is to drive our

181
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:22,639
private sector partners in a direction

182
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:23,520
where

183
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,440
it's all about compliance box checking

184
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,880
that was something that i worried about

185
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:27,759
doing

186
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:29,840
cyber security at morgan stanley but

187
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,560
rather actual risk reduction and and

188
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,240
that's a really important goal with this

189
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,240
latest legislation the cyber incident

190
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,280
reporting

191
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,440
act as we work with all of our partners

192
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,639
some regulators uh some not but to try

193
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:45,360
and harmonize all of this so again

194
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,520
uh we are not burdening the private

195
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,840
sector in what we are asking them to do

196
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,319
or asking them to give us and we're not

197
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:54,560
burdening us with a bunch of noise what

198
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,199
we want to do is get signal and so i

199
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:59,599
would say that these cpgs are the common

200
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:01,759
baseline and then we'll build off the

201
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:03,520
sector specific that we hope to do over

202
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,680
the next two years and then just one

203
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,280
other quick question on that in terms of

204
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,039
metrics so the documents do have a

205
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:10,080
metric

206
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,400
are you going to gather information from

207
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,000
the sectors so are you going to come up

208
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,280
with like an oil and gas

209
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,599
rating and an electric rating and is

210
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:21,039
that going to be voluntary or how are

211
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:22,560
you going to get that information from

212
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,960
these entities well i mean certainly we

213
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,479
would love to do that right you and i

214
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:28,479
know this is not a trivial endeavor

215
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:30,080
right the elusive measures of

216
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,440
effectiveness and measures of

217
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,720
performance you know one of the things

218
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,080
that i did when

219
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,000
i came to cisa i actually changed the

220
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,800
mission statement slightly we used to be

221
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,319
uh to understand and manage risk

222
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:44,639
so i changed it to understand manage and

223
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,879
reduce risk right making my job and my

224
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:48,879
team's job a little harder but if we're

225
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:50,960
just managing risk i don't think we're

226
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,039
doing what we need to do as america's

227
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:55,120
cyber defense agency so we need to be

228
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,039
able to work with a community to reduce

229
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:59,680
risk so i am in your headspace in terms

230
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,680
of getting actual things that we can

231
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,319
measure to say that we are reducing risk

232
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:05,199
these

233
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:07,120
sample evidence is sort of the start of

234
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,960
that but i'm really interested in

235
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,560
working with the community because i

236
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,479
know in my time in the private sector

237
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:14,639
there's a lot of work being done on this

238
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:16,400
and i think it's being done in a good

239
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,319
way because boards are now starting to

240
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:20,000
ask these questions in a really

241
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,759
important way right five six years ago

242
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,680
or when you started s4

243
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,560
boards probably had no idea cyber was

244
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,280
like this i.t thing yeah right and now

245
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,039
boards are asking these questions and

246
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:32,958
they're the ones who want to understand

247
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:36,240
all my investment how am i reducing risk

248
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,640
and so the baseline again is working off

249
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,760
these evidence which i then hope can uh

250
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,080
actually feed into measures of effect

251
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,880
effectiveness to reduce risk okay so how

252
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,200
about people yeah it's going to say

253
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,959
different people

254
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:53,360
it is my favorite um so one of the

255
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,720
things that's why i'm so psyched to come

256
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,240
down here because this is the community

257
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,200
that we need we need help from is we are

258
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,560
going to expand considerably our

259
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,920
ics technical team we just put out 20

260
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,519
job vacancies

261
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:09,440
i've got a great team here of folks

262
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,839
people like jay gasly and lindsey

263
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:14,800
tvornick and mj emanuel a whole team of

264
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,959
folks out there

265
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:18,800
and so if people are interested in

266
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,519
coming and working in the government

267
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,440
whether it's for a couple years or for a

268
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,120
long period of time

269
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,680
understanding what we do uh defending

270
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,080
the nation so we've got those new roles

271
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,240
coming in the other thing is we just got

272
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,920
these new authorities

273
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,760
it's called the cyber talent management

274
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,880
system ctms the congress set it up about

275
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,560
seven years ago and it took seven years

276
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,800
to implement so welcome to bureaucracy

277
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,880
uh but i get to benefit from it and so

278
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,959
what it is it allows us to hire people

279
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:49,519
much more flexibly so not the 20 plus

280
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:52,000
steps that you have to go through to

281
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,839
come into government which drives me up

282
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:54,959
the wall

283
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:57,760
and we can also pay closer to market

284
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,680
um you know not a huge amount but in

285
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,079
some cases you know upwards of three

286
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:03,680
hundred thousand dollars which is a lot

287
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,920
for the government now as we know nobody

288
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,079
comes into government to make money

289
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:09,680
right they come into government to serve

290
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,680
your country to get the experience of

291
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,079
defending the american people but we do

292
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:15,360
realize that we need to be more

293
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,320
competitive and so we are hiring for a

294
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,079
senior ics

295
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:21,760
technical expert who's going to be part

296
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,760
of our office of technology to really

297
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,880
help drive our vision and our strategy

298
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,959
as you probably know when

299
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:30,240
chris set up

300
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,600
cisa we went through something called

301
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,560
cisa 2020 and all those acronyms that

302
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,480
people had become slightly familiar with

303
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,279
from the n-kick uh of course we're still

304
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:42,079
u.s cert we're still ics cert but all of

305
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:44,399
that became our cyber division

306
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:46,800
and so we have that expertise but we

307
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,040
want to bring in somebody really senior

308
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,839
who again can help drive the vision the

309
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:53,040
strategy

310
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,720
and a lot of the outreach that we're

311
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,720
doing with community so look for that

312
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,079
posting as well

313
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:01,040
we're excited about that uh and uh look

314
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,120
for the other 20 job postings that we

315
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,279
have going on and then can i talk

316
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:06,399
partnership or do you have something you

317
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,000
want to ask no i was just thinking i

318
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,600
should have tried to sell you a sponsor

319
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,440
booth here you know like a cabana or

320
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,800
something you could you could have done

321
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,120
recruiting there why didn't you

322
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,360
you know i just i wasn't looking for an

323
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,200
angle do you want to apply it i think i

324
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,120
think it's going to be very competitive

325
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,680
to try to get these people i think a lot

326
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,360
of these vendors are trying to hire

327
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,600
people you know we offer remote work you

328
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,800
could do it from melbourne oh there you

329
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,320
go i keep trying to get dale to host

330
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,320
this thing in maui next year and it

331
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,360
starts with an m ends with an eye

332
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,040
exactly

333
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,360
okay let's go to partnerships okay you

334
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,519
know as i said at the outset

335
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:42,959
this is not something the government can

336
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:45,920
do right we are just a partner with uh

337
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,640
with industry and so we set up this

338
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,360
thing called the jcdc uh joint cyber

339
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,360
defense collaborative about eight months

340
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,360
ago i launched it when i when i spoke at

341
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,399
black hat

342
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,800
uh and the theory the case is we want to

343
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,680
be able to work closely uh with our

344
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,279
industry partners to be able to

345
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:05,600
understand the threat you know just as

346
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,120
we saw in solar winds it's not the

347
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,399
government that's going to detect

348
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:09,920
malicious activity on critical

349
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,920
infrastructure it's very likely going to

350
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,639
be a company like fireeye like mandiant

351
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:15,440
like

352
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,200
a big technology company because

353
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,440
technology underpins the backbone of all

354
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,519
of our critical infrastructure and so

355
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:23,519
working together with

356
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:26,000
our private industry partners we've

357
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,760
actually had some pretty good early

358
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,760
success it's early days but working on

359
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,639
log4j the vulnerability from december

360
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:35,040
working on uh ukraine all of the

361
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,639
tensions and the potential threats

362
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:38,160
around i know we're going to talk a

363
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,399
little bit about shields up

364
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:42,639
but as we're growing this i'm super

365
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:45,360
excited to announce uh we're actually

366
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,760
tapping into the expertise of the ics

367
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,360
community and so we just put out an

368
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,959
announcement

369
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:53,839
we are working initially with uh about

370
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:55,920
10 or so companies from bechtel and

371
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,880
clarity and dragos and ge and honeywell

372
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,720
and nozomi networks and schneider

373
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,120
electric and schweitzer engineering labs

374
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,639
and siemens and

375
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:08,560
xylem uh all together uh as part of jcdc

376
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:12,639
ics or jcdc ice i like to call it but

377
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:15,440
um so the idea is we're gonna tap into

378
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,920
yeah we're gonna tap into

379
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,480
the ingenuity the innovation the

380
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:23,279
expertise of this particular community

381
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:25,600
the icsot community

382
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,600
to enable us to work with critical

383
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,880
infrastructure we're going to start with

384
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,040
an exercise with our pipeline friends

385
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,560
and then we're also working with water

386
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:35,200
and chemical and really tap into that

387
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,680
industry expertise so i am super excited

388
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,800
about that and you know we've been

389
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,360
working i think rob was up here before

390
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,600
and maybe megan mentioned this we put

391
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,120
out this product

392
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,160
about

393
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:49,440
some tools around ics scada pipe dream

394
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,880
and controller whatever you want to call

395
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,120
it um but we work with our federal

396
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:56,639
partners on that both fbi nsa doe but

397
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:59,040
also got fabulous input from mandiant

398
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:02,000
from dragos from schneider electric

399
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,800
and so really and from palo i think as

400
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,279
well and so working with industry

401
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:09,360
and having them enrich and make these

402
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,680
products better i'm really excited about

403
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,880
jcdc ics for that and so you know those

404
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,880
are the initial companies we welcome

405
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,720
anyone who wants to work with us and

406
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,079
we're excited about building that

407
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:21,760
partnership i think it's incredibly

408
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,839
important um to get this collective

409
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:25,199
defense right

410
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:27,920
i think that's a good move i know there

411
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,839
was rumbling in in the community when

412
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:31,519
the first list

413
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:33,360
came out and we're like where are we

414
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,959
yeah you know so there was some rumbling

415
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:36,639
so i think that's a really good addition

416
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:37,360
to

417
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,040
is it like a sub group or something are

418
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,160
you going to create these subjects yeah

419
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,600
let me just let me let me address that

420
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,600
because i want folks to understand so

421
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,160
the first group were the technology

422
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,000
companies the backbone infrastructure

423
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,720
isp csps cyber security vendors

424
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,079
and the theory of the case on that was

425
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:54,480
everything's underpinned by technology

426
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,279
and so we wanted to be able to

427
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,680
really see the dots together connect the

428
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,760
dots and drive down risk to the nation

429
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,839
at scale

430
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:06,560
when the ukraine

431
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:09,920
war happened we actually brought in

432
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,639
some finance companies so jcdc finance

433
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:17,760
jcdc energy and then jcdc ics is really

434
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,199
this group that is going to help us

435
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:21,920
specifically focus on industrial control

436
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,480
systems and operational technology that

437
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,160
of course has been a priority for the

438
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,079
administration you know really since

439
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:30,399
colonial pipeline as you recall

440
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:32,560
um which gave us a lot of lessons

441
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:33,600
learned

442
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,360
about how we can work better as a

443
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,600
community and so what we're trying to do

444
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,399
is really expand this platform because i

445
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:42,000
think i think the other point to make

446
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,600
that's unique and important for this

447
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,440
community and rob lee might have

448
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,959
mentioned this look

449
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:48,800
you know we were built to be america's

450
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,199
cyber defense agency but there's a whole

451
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:53,120
federal cyber ecosystem of everybody

452
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,360
that has a really important role in this

453
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:59,680
uh fbi nsa us cybercom people like

454
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,519
energy the department of energy the tr

455
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:05,839
the tsa and so what jcdc does is

456
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:08,000
it's a platform but cis is just one

457
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,680
federal partner it brings together all

458
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,079
of those partners so that you can

459
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:14,720
actually go to one place and be able to

460
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,560
work with all of the federal partners

461
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,480
and with the private sector and you

462
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,639
don't have to have a phd in government

463
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:22,800
to figure out who to interact with

464
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,959
that's what congress recognized and you

465
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:26,000
know frankly it was one of the

466
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,160
motivating factors why i came back from

467
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,759
morgan stanley

468
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:31,839
to the government because i just felt

469
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:34,000
the government was kind of incoherent

470
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,440
you know you were getting signals from

471
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,440
all these different places and it's why

472
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,839
we have worked really hard to make sure

473
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:42,800
that we are joint sealing everything so

474
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:46,079
you saw doe you saw nsa you saw fbi

475
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:47,839
we're working very closely with industry

476
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:49,040
partners

477
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,720
later today we're going to release a new

478
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,240
product

479
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:55,839
with our fbi our nsa our five five eyes

480
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:56,959
partners

481
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:58,480
that was enriched with a lot of

482
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,720
information from our industry uh

483
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,880
industry folks uh that is really a

484
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,839
detailed overview of uh russian

485
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:08,400
state-sponsored cyber actors and

486
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,119
russia-aligned cyber criminal groups

487
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:13,760
so we have learned a lot over the past

488
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,359
several months and we're putting this

489
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:18,400
out along with the mitigation guidance

490
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,400
and so everybody should see that around

491
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,599
1300

492
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:22,480
today

493
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,400
which we're excited about but the joint

494
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,319
seals are really important because one

495
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:29,200
coherent cohesive

496
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,520
u.s government as opposed to coming at

497
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,600
you in various different ways i think

498
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,200
it's incredibly important to make sure

499
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,039
that we're doing this as a community

500
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:39,120
okay well let's pivot to talk a little

501
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,960
bit about shields up which i think

502
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,880
probably most of the audience has heard

503
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,000
about and you

504
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,919
you and rob are on 60 minutes talking a

505
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:48,480
little bit about it

506
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,640
the shields go up we're in a heightened

507
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:54,080
security posture yeah

508
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,679
what

509
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:57,760
or when will the shields come down and

510
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,200
what will it take for the shields to

511
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,280
come down yeah

512
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:04,160
yeah i know right um

513
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,120
so

514
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,120
a couple of things first of all

515
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,120
we wanted to make sure

516
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,200
that we were

517
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,520
[Music]

518
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,000
instilling a real sense of urgency you

519
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
know everybody in this room has a sense

520
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,600
of urgency every day

521
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:18,960
i don't need to tell this community

522
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,760
shields up and i don't need to tell

523
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,760
most cisos or most network defenders

524
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,160
shields up or shields up all the time

525
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:29,280
that signaling had a lot to do with

526
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,039
uh business leaders

527
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:31,919
small

528
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:34,160
large critical infrastructure owners and

529
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,720
operators to make sure that they

530
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,720
understood that there was a real sense

531
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,039
of urgency to this threat

532
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:43,360
and so it's been a campaign that i think

533
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,760
has gotten a lot of good traction we've

534
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:48,480
been able to use the shields up web page

535
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,559
as a one-stop shop again i like the

536
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:52,160
simplicity of being able to go to one

537
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,720
place to find all the information about

538
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,160
the threat advisory is to find the

539
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,400
mitigation guidance whether it's large

540
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,360
small businesses ransomware individuals

541
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,840
and then guidance to ceos and the most

542
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,160
important thing we're telling ceos is

543
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,559
empower your cisos

544
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:10,799
right and we want to continue to do that

545
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:13,200
but what is so the question is you know

546
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,720
what is shields i'm not going to say

547
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,480
shields down none of us should ever be

548
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,640
shields down in this threat environment

549
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,480
we'll go to what i'll call shields

550
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,520
normal

551
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:22,400
and

552
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,480
you know we have to realize that many of

553
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,400
the things on that website that you know

554
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,679
are really things that we should be

555
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:29,840
doing all the time that frankly

556
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,360
we're not if we were doing it all the

557
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:34,160
time we wouldn't have this these attacks

558
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,320
uh very often and we've seen the scourge

559
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,919
of ransomware

560
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:39,600
but one of the things a couple of things

561
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,120
that we in particular in this

562
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,799
environment we've asked people to lower

563
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:44,880
the thresholds for reporting right

564
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,720
because we want to make sure that if

565
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,120
there is leading-edge information about

566
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,960
attacks that we're actually

567
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,320
bringing that in and we've had to put

568
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:55,600
extra people on from our team on that

569
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,160
we have talked about being you know on

570
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,640
the ready for crisis response

571
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,200
um we have talked about

572
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,120
preparing for the worst and being being

573
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,600
ready to disconnect systems if we need

574
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,760
to i think those are things that

575
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,840
specifically are in this environment

576
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,200
that are not necessarily in an

577
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:16,480
environment where where shield's normal

578
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,159
but i think at the end of the day if

579
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:19,600
people are doing the things on that

580
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,039
website

581
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:23,280
it will stand us better as a nation

582
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,600
frankly and so i hope

583
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,200
that even when we go back to shields

584
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,039
normal that the basic things that we

585
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:30,799
need to be doing around

586
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:32,000
hygiene

587
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,360
which if we were doing them we'd be in a

588
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,960
lot better shape right

589
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,280
um we have instilled this sort of sense

590
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,880
of urgency you know for me i'm a little

591
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,960
bit on this campaign about

592
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,600
you know what do we do personally um to

593
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,679
keep ourselves safe online and this

594
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:48,240
again this this group are all experts

595
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,720
and very sophisticated but all of us

596
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:53,840
can be evangelists for not just the ics

597
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:56,480
and the ot community but what we need to

598
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:59,840
be doing um just day to day or on the

599
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,240
i.t side since really that's likely

600
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,320
where most things are going to start and

601
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,159
so things like multi-factor

602
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:08,480
authentication uh things like updated

603
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,799
software passwords all that type things

604
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:12,480
i would ask for you know this

605
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,400
community's help in getting that word

606
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,240
out across the country yeah i think a

607
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,559
lot of people are security support for

608
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:21,760
their families and their parents

609
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,000
but i i guess

610
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,240
i think a number of us in the security

611
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,760
community i think the messaging has been

612
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,600
very effective for the executives and

613
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,760
the business leaders and and i think

614
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:34,080
sometimes i i know sometimes i

615
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,600
underestimate the importance of that

616
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,280
just because when you live it day to day

617
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,400
you kind of

618
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,400
forget how many people don't

619
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,480
think about these things but on that

620
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,640
list they were things that everyone

621
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,600
should do

622
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,000
and then lowered thresholds or increased

623
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,600
monitoring

624
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:50,960
um

625
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,480
but you know probably from your morgan

626
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,559
stanley days and and even before that

627
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:57,039
you can't be at this higher threshold

628
00:21:57,039 --> 00:21:59,120
all the time 100

629
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,000
and

630
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,679
i would even say there's

631
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:03,760
things that we could do more than what

632
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:06,240
was on that list and i think you and i

633
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,159
corresponded a little bit about that is

634
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:10,000
there going to be like a shields really

635
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,400
up or super up and

636
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,280
and

637
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,520
and i worry that if we don't go

638
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:18,080
if we don't go to shields normal in a

639
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,440
week or so

640
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,919
you can't keep people at at a heightened

641
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:24,480
state for very long look man i agree

642
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,559
with you where the we're the network

643
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:29,360
defenders so so i've got folks out here

644
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,200
and folks back at cissa

645
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,039
that are you know and i worry a lot

646
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:35,600
about this i am a huge advocate for

647
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:38,000
mental health we've made 2022 the year

648
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,480
of mental health and and well-being

649
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,480
um you know i have personal experience

650
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,400
with this and i lost my brother to

651
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:47,120
suicide and so i want to make sure that

652
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:50,400
we are taking care of all of our folks

653
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,200
and frankly i worry a lot about burnout

654
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,559
and i worry a lot about vigilance

655
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:57,280
fatigue and so i will be the first one

656
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,679
who's excited to say shield's normal

657
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:00,880
because

658
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,720
my folks and many of the folks in this

659
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,200
room probably need a freaking break

660
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:08,159
right and so um we're not there yet

661
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:09,600
though i mean we're putting out a

662
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,679
product today you saw the product we put

663
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:14,240
out um but i am very very mindful of

664
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,840
vigilance fatigue and i want to make

665
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,679
sure that we are giving the right signal

666
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:19,520
to the community and so

667
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:22,720
um we're very focused on when we can go

668
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,320
back to a posture

669
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,640
that people can get a little bit more

670
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,720
breathing room yeah okay

671
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,320
let's shift again and you kind of

672
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:33,039
mentioned it early on but

673
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:34,159
i want to talk a little bit about

674
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:36,400
regulation in this space

675
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,320
so chris inglis

676
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,320
uh said i think in front of congress

677
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,919
enlightened self-interest that's

678
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:44,320
apparently not working market forces

679
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,799
that's apparently not working and then

680
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:48,400
i think you about the same day at the

681
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,400
same hearing or as such you said it

682
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,320
seems to me that voluntary standards are

683
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,480
probably not getting the job done and

684
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,240
that there's probably some sort of role

685
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,919
for making some of these standards

686
00:23:57,919 --> 00:23:59,760
mandatory now

687
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,520
that's a congressional

688
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,600
issue but they they look to cisa and the

689
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,159
administration as to what they should be

690
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:07,039
doing

691
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:09,520
what's your view on regulation for some

692
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,120
of the various sectors here that don't

693
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,600
have it yeah i think there is a place

694
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,480
for regulation but i should say cisa is

695
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,880
not a regulator right right and

696
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:21,120
and i don't want to be a regulator i've

697
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,440
been very clear with the congress on

698
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:26,320
that because i think the magic of cisa

699
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,559
and why we were built is all about

700
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:30,799
voluntary partnerships

701
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:31,679
and

702
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:34,559
to be a successful partner you have to

703
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:37,360
be able to build trust right trust is

704
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,039
the key to any relationship whether it's

705
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:41,279
a business deal or a marriage you have

706
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:43,679
to trust that partner and i am keenly

707
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:45,360
aware that it's hard to build trust and

708
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,039
it's easy to lose it

709
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:49,520
and if you think that

710
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,279
somebody is going to hammer you or

711
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:53,840
there's some sort of penalty

712
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,679
that's not the type of relationship that

713
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:57,520
i want or nor do i think is going to be

714
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,520
productive with respect to our mission

715
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,440
which is as america's cyber defense

716
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,480
agency you know that said i have seen

717
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,880
regulation be effective where financial

718
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,039
sector is highly regulated as you know

719
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:10,799
but i've also seen it as i mentioned

720
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:13,039
earlier dale where you have so many

721
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:15,919
different uh regulators coming at you

722
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:18,080
trying to figure out um how to

723
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,960
differentiate what you what you owe them

724
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,840
that timeline um on which you owe it and

725
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,919
then the resources that you're going to

726
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:28,880
allocate to do that i worry gets you

727
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:31,039
away from operational risk management

728
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:33,039
and gets you stuck in this compliance

729
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:35,840
box checking bucket so i think it's the

730
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:38,080
there is a role for for cyber security

731
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,840
regulations but i think it's really

732
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:42,640
important that the government figures

733
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:45,200
out how to harmonize what we're asking

734
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,720
for and so we're dealing with this now

735
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:47,919
with this new

736
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:49,520
cyber incident reporting legislation

737
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,520
which i actually think can also if we do

738
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,120
it right get your point about

739
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:56,080
understanding metrics right right now we

740
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,440
probably get 30

741
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,760
of the incidents that occur once this

742
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:02,559
regulation goes in place we can actually

743
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:04,960
have i think a much better baseline to

744
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:07,039
show whether in fact we're reducing

745
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:09,039
incidents or not but

746
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:12,159
we have this with other agencies the fcc

747
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:13,440
the sec

748
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,840
that are looking at uh asking for

749
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,760
reporting requirements and again i i

750
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,919
don't want to create this burden on the

751
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:21,360
private sector i don't think it's fair

752
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,520
and i don't think it's productive

753
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,360
so while there's a place for regulation

754
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:28,080
our focus is on working collaboratively

755
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,919
with the private sector and then

756
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:32,080
ensuring that as much as possible we can

757
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,840
help to harmonize requirements and i

758
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:36,159
would draw you back to

759
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:38,400
the cyber security performance goals

760
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,640
because if you have these worked with a

761
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,480
community consultatively if you have

762
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,880
this common baseline again mapped to the

763
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,960
nist cyber security framework if you

764
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,960
have these sector specific goals that we

765
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,880
worked collaboratively with the sector

766
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,919
and we all agree on that those can be

767
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:56,480
the driving force for what we're saying

768
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:59,200
or those minimum standards that

769
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,640
we expect because critical

770
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:01,919
infrastructure is all about national

771
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:03,279
security economic prosperity but

772
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:05,279
importantly what for public companies

773
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:08,400
anyway for what shareholders should

774
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,720
expect for what board members should

775
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13,600
expect and so i think you create an

776
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:16,480
ecosystem that is more about uh

777
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:19,039
collective cyber defense as opposed to

778
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:20,799
just compliance

779
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:22,799
but then do you see for example water

780
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:24,720
the water isac

781
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,039
and it's funny the water isac suggested

782
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:28,640
that they might follow the nerc sip

783
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,760
model

784
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:30,559
and

785
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:32,080
whenever i tell that to someone an

786
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,159
electric they roll their eyes and say oh

787
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:35,600
they they shouldn't do that that would

788
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,799
be a big big mistake

789
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:42,559
it's it's funny to see their faces

790
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:44,080
but are you going to leave it then up to

791
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:47,039
like epa to decide what

792
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:48,880
you know to work with congress for what

793
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:51,679
should be water regulations and and

794
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:54,000
tsa for pipelines and and that you're

795
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,760
just advising them

796
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,360
in that sense so so

797
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,520
the congress set up set us up with a

798
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,919
couple important roles and one of them

799
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:04,559
was to be the national coordinator for

800
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:06,480
critical infrastructure cyber security

801
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:07,679
and resilience

802
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:09,440
because you have these sectors they have

803
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,440
different regulators right 16 sectors

804
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,279
you have these things called sector risk

805
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:16,320
management agencies so finance has

806
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,480
treasury electricity has energy

807
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,880
pipelines has tsa as you said water is

808
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,080
epa

809
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:25,760
but we work closely with each of them to

810
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,039
make sure

811
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:28,720
that and this is what goes back to the

812
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,559
common common baseline for the cyber

813
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:33,120
security performance goals to make sure

814
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:36,240
that uh we are asking

815
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,799
uh from a again a common perspective the

816
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:41,919
same things across all sectors and then

817
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:43,039
what those

818
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:44,960
uh what those sector risk management

819
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,440
agencies do or focus on sort of the

820
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:50,399
technical aspects of why water ics may

821
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:51,600
be different

822
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:54,799
from electricity ics or pipeline ics and

823
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:56,799
so but we're the national coordinator

824
00:28:56,799 --> 00:28:59,520
because we you can't look at sectors in

825
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,600
a in a silo we know that right and

826
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:02,799
finance

827
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:04,480
it didn't matter if we spent billions of

828
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:07,120
dollars as we did on our cyber security

829
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,520
if the power went down if the telcos

830
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:11,520
went down right so everything is

831
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:12,720
connected

832
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:15,279
everything is ostensibly vulnerable made

833
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:17,200
even more exacerbated by the fact that

834
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,039
you have these supply chains

835
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:20,720
underpinning everything

836
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:23,679
and so we have to work with epa we have

837
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:26,159
to work with tsa they're the regulator

838
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:29,360
and so they they regulate um and they

839
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,200
develop those regulations but we're

840
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,760
there to provide technical assistance

841
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:36,720
and support um and to help make sure

842
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,840
that uh there are

843
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:41,760
harmonized uh standards across each at

844
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,679
the common level across each of those

845
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:44,799
sectors

846
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:45,679
okay

847
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:48,000
well we're almost out of time here i

848
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
have one thing i i wanted to tell you

849
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,640
and then i'll give you a chance to

850
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,399
tell the audience anything we didn't ask

851
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:55,600
about because i'm sure they're so

852
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,760
thrilled you're here but you know on the

853
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:00,320
in controller pipe dream thing

854
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:03,279
um there was a key sentence in in the

855
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:05,200
sizzle alert or bulletin the tools

856
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,360
enable them to scan for compromise and

857
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,520
control affected devices once they have

858
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:12,399
established initial access to the ot

859
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:14,559
network which is

860
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:16,000
essentially 10 years ago we did

861
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,760
something called project basecamp which

862
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,919
just showed all these plcs and things

863
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:22,480
were insecure by design that once you

864
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,640
got through the perimeter

865
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,799
you could turn things on and off you

866
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:29,760
could reprogram the logic

867
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:32,960
sizza and even before that dhs has never

868
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:36,320
said that those things should be secured

869
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,960
so i think that's that's a really big

870
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:41,440
hole right now is that it's just kind of

871
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,360
like yeah this is really bad stuff and

872
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:44,640
we're going to live with it for another

873
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,799
10 years so i hope i hope that you and

874
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:47,840
your team

875
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:50,399
sometime in the next year or two can get

876
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:52,320
on that big megaphone and say see these

877
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,240
things that are completely insecure and

878
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,000
really important

879
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,679
we need to put a little effort on that

880
00:30:57,679 --> 00:30:59,440
so that's that's my pitch to you but now

881
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,600
let me let me let you make your pitch to

882
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,039
the audience what else would you like

883
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:06,000
them to know hey first of all i i love

884
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,600
feedback i treat feedback as a gift and

885
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:10,720
i have

886
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,640
a tremendous respect

887
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,559
for the network defenders who are doing

888
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:16,720
this in the world of ics and ot and

889
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,640
across the board and so

890
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:21,679
we love that feedback i look at this as

891
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:25,200
collective cyber defense we depend on

892
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,519
this community and so i think it's a

893
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:29,919
great point and i'd love to work with

894
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:31,440
you and the rest of this community to

895
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,679
make sure that we get our messaging

896
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:35,360
right because you know we're the

897
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,559
youngest agency in the federal

898
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:38,559
government right we're growing we're

899
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:40,240
building we do want to have that

900
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,440
megaphone

901
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,840
but we can't do it without the community

902
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:46,640
and so i'm just excited to be here um

903

904

continue to strengthen and deepen our

905
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:53,440
