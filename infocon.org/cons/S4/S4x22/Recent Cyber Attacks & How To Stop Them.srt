1
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:06,480
so we're going to spend the next 30

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,559
minutes having a nice discussion in here

3
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:11,519
i'm really happy with the turnout um

4
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:13,920
this is most people realize this kind of

5
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:16,480
what they would call the vendor stage as

6
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,880
you obviously realize i'm not a vendor

7
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,039
i'm a product i'm a solution specialist

8
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:22,320
in cyber security and industrial

9
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,840
automation and control and i'll be

10
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,599
sharing the stage of course with miss

11
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:28,240
mariam from phoenix contact who allowed

12
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,400
me the opportunity to share some insight

13
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,040
of what's been going on for probably

14
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,960
whoops

15
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,800
that was a good save probably what's

16
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,399
been going on since the world really

17
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:41,840
woke up to this in about 2010. so with

18
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,920
that we kind of are gonna use an

19
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,559
underlying theme about both recent

20
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:48,559
attacks as well as kind of a look back

21
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:50,559
on the past decade of attacks and

22
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:52,320
figuring out

23
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,039
why people are still succeeding

24
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:56,800
why are these attacks

25
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,960
still able to progress and now the big

26
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,320
buzz is

27
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,960
uh pipe dream and we'll obviously talk a

28
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,479
little bit about pipe dream because

29
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:06,720
there's a lot of hype being put against

30
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,119
something that there should be no real

31
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:12,560
reason to be afraid and to be

32
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,000
overly concerned assuming you've done

33
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
basic steps and we'll talk a little bit

34
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,159
about that so i'm glad that dale was

35
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:22,080
able to kind of shift things because

36
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,680
there was a lot of last minute changes

37
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,920
that were taking place so again slides

38
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,439
are available which is kind of a nice

39
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:30,400
new addition with s4 that dale was able

40
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,479
to do using that new whatever it's

41
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:34,799
called wowzawya

42
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:37,040
what is it

43
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,400
well hoover so that's a pretty slick app

44
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,799
so the presentations are there but

45
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:44,640
presentations for me for those and i'm

46
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,159
really happy to see a lot of my old

47
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:47,680
friends and colleagues and supporters

48
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,680
here as well as a lot of new people it

49
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,119
was good to be able to get a feel for

50
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:52,159
you all

51
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:54,320
by looking at the attendees coming in so

52
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,560
i want to set the stage and this

53
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,320
architecture for people that have known

54
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,560
me and work with me has been a staple

55
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,040
architecture for introducing teaching

56
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,640
and reinforcing cyber security for

57
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,200
industrial networks and the reason is is

58
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,878
that there's a lot that can be done with

59
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:11,120
this architecture and those that also

60
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,959
know me know i'm very outspoken on

61
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:15,520
people that oversimplify ics

62
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,120
architectures you know they'll show a

63
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,440
network with one hmi and one plc well

64
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,920
that's crap and we all know it and these

65
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,239
architectures really consist of dozens

66
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:26,640
or hundreds of controllers and dozens of

67
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,520
hmis redundancy across the bottom across

68
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,760
the top across the networks everywhere

69
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,239
so it's important to teach concepts

70
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:36,959
using some reference model that provides

71
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:39,599
some reality to how architectures are

72
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:41,120
built out and another thing about this

73
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,760
architecture it's actually be is is

74
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,080
presented based on fact when i've done

75
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,680
this in more of a closed environment

76
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,360
where we learn some of the hooks it

77
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,280
handles about it people say did you take

78
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,440
this from our architecture because what

79
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,519
i use this for is to teach a lot of

80
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:57,200
concepts around

81
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,360
not only the concept of cyber security

82
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,800
but resilience

83
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,959
so the buzzword of the day for me if you

84
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:04,480
looked at what was going on on the app

85
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,879
is resilience if you designed resilient

86
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:09,920
architectures last year all of this hype

87
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,640
is completely worthless you will ride

88
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,599
through it

89
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:15,599
easily another thing that's been going

90
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,760
on a lot in the app is all this issue

91
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,840
around vulnerability disclosure zero day

92
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,920
dropping vendor obligation to get their

93
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,159
patches done in 90 days if you saw my

94
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:26,480
responses i was a vendor for 20 years

95
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,200
that's never gonna happen i did a

96
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,319
massive project with emerson i've

97
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:34,400
discovered a vulnerability with their

98
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,640
dcs controller that impacted every

99
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,280
controller they ever sold every system

100
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,000
they ever sold over about a 10-year span

101
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,239
across the world hundreds of thousands

102
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:46,400
of controllers were impacted by it it's

103
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,799
not something that we could fix in three

104
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:49,680
months

105
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,400
because we had to test prove

106
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,720
reassure get the word out to the

107
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,319
community the internal community the

108
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:57,760
vendor or the

109
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,159
asset owners and fix it so what we're

110
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:01,439
going to go through today is kind of

111
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:04,879
this problem and why we're still seeing

112
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:06,640
a lot of panic around industrial

113
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,799
automation and control and that tends to

114
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:11,439
be people hanging on to the low hanging

115
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:14,560
fruit they tend to focus on the top side

116
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,120
and to this day it brings tears to my

117
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,639
eyes and it's the one thing that keeps

118
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:21,680
me up at night is people today still

119
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,960
believe the attack will always be

120
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,040
externally originated

121
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,360
so no matter what we say no matter how

122
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,600
much supply chain attacks have shown

123
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,600
their ugly face we are still seeing this

124
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,240
predominance to develop secure

125
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,520
architectures

126
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,759
under the sole premise that the threat

127
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:44,880
is always outside that door

128
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,840
and this architecture was built based on

129
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,320
all of the facts given to me from the

130
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,720
research team at mcafee as part of their

131
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,320
work on the night dragon campaign in

132
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:57,759
2010 it was an apt

133
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:00,320
attributed completely to china it made

134
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,720
its way into skate architectures it

135
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,759
never got press because stuxnet took

136
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:07,520
over the media waves

137
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,400
but what it showed was one very

138
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,160
important thing that happened if you

139
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,240
look down on the bottom right

140
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,880
the initial step was externally

141
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,120
originated there's no doubt about it it

142
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,120
was the chinese government we knew that

143
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,320
the attribution was hard firm but the

144
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:28,160
problem is is after the first step

145
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,639
the lateral pivot that occurred in step

146
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:31,440
one

147
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,479
made this person appear as a legitimate

148
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:37,440
trusted authenticated insider

149
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,600
so now all of a sudden what are you

150
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,919
doing to secure your architecture from

151
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:43,280
the insider

152
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,320
not the malicious employee but the

153
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,120
outsider that's able to masquerade and

154
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,520
appear as the insider

155
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,280
so that's what happens in this

156
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,840
architecture and as we start to pivot

157
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,400
through it and learn about it in both

158
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,400
offensive and defensive courses that

159
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,479
i've have is that you find it at the

160
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:04,639
very bottom of the architecture where

161
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:06,560
the real gold lies

162
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,720
the assets that are connected to the

163
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,280
physical world that cost far more than

164
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,840
the cyber infrastructure have far more

165
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,160
physical impact typically can result in

166
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,800
loss of life all of that is connected at

167
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,800
the bottom of this architecture which

168
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,440
tends to have little ability to be

169
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:27,039
defended using normal methods and means

170
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:28,880
and in this architecture for learning

171
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,800
purposes there are no vulnerabilities

172
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,840
down there

173
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,080
so all of a sudden you've used all of

174
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,080
the pivots and all of the chained

175
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,600
exploits at the top

176
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,840
to create a bag of loot that allows you

177
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,759
to compromise a system

178
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:44,720
in the presence of no vulnerabilities

179
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,360
so the way that we do that is through a

180
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,080
concept of understanding resilience and

181
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:53,680
learning how to secure architectures

182
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,160
from obvious things that should never

183
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,599
happen and move away from first

184
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:03,280
move away from designing for convenience

185
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,160
to designing for security so we'll take

186
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,720
this one slide we can go on and on i get

187
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,160
two slides i've got about 10 minutes to

188
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,759
keep this in

189
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:14,560
everybody knows about zones and conduits

190
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,199
okay so i'm going to give a huge

191
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:20,960
i i love what the isa 99 standards and

192
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,039
practices team i'm a voting member of it

193
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:24,560
the work there

194
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,120
initially led by eric cosman has been

195
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,639
revolutionary

196
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:31,280
but to be completely honest let's just

197
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,280
get a quick show of hands how many

198
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,639
people make the 62443 series the

199
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:38,880
foundation of their industrial cyber

200
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,680
security program

201
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,319
that's pretty good so i'm gonna say five

202
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:46,240
maybe ten percent

203
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,160
for me in an industrial world i don't

204
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,199
understand why it's not a hundred

205
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:50,400
percent

206
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,080
so a lot of people have a lot of reasons

207
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,240
and they're all well justified

208
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,199
isa 6243 doesn't have the global

209
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:59,039
acceptance that other standards like the

210
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:01,919
27 000 family does but the one thing

211
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:05,440
that's unique about 62443 is the

212
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,440
creation and establishment of zones and

213
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,720
conduits

214
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,720
and the reason that i always say this

215
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,840
nothing's changed nothing has changed

216
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:14,720
and

217
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,960
what's really interesting is that the

218
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,759
triton attack that occurred against

219
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:21,039
saudi

220
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:24,000
petrochemical algebale i actually was

221
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,039
the original architect on that system

222
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:29,039
in its first phase

223
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:30,879
so the system that got attacked was the

224
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:33,360
second phase attack second architectural

225
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,360
phase attack so i knew a lot about what

226
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,958
happened there and everything that

227
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:38,719
happened on that attack

228
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:40,719
would have been stopped dead in its

229
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:43,519
tracks if people had implemented the

230
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:46,399
model against the zones and conduits

231
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:47,519
concept

232
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:49,760
because the zones and conduits

233
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,760
concept allows you

234
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:55,680
to group items assets devices

235
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,880
that can't traditionally be secured

236
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,279
and to then secure the conduit that's

237
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:03,600
used for all communications that enter

238
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,839
and leave that particular zone

239
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:07,839
so what we see is going to go like this

240
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,760
there is no like that if you look in the

241
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,160
the diagram on that picture the problem

242
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,240
is is most people that haven't lived

243
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,920
this document

244
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,320
don't understand that we don't create

245
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,040
one big zone for our industrial control

246
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:24,160
system there is a big

247
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:27,920
macro zone but we really must start

248
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,839
creating micro zones

249
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:32,160
so i did a lot of

250
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,560
we'll just say anti-marketing against

251
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,000
the reference architecture that was

252
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,320
published by homeland security because

253
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,760
they still have not embraced the concept

254
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,320
that the security around active

255
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,440
directory

256
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,519
is very important

257
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,920
and very different than the security

258
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,399
around the engineering workstation and

259
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:54,320
the engineering environment

260
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,880
which is very different and equally

261
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,519
important to the security around the

262
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:02,160
operational environment right because

263
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,480
each one of those provides a different

264
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,519
service to the overall architecture

265
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:10,880
and the compromise of any one of those

266
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,120
could lead to the subsequent

267
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:16,640
consequences associated with any and all

268
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:17,680
others

269
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:20,000
so it becomes a real big challenge to

270
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,360
understand

271
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,640
why are we not creating subzones and

272
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:27,440
those sub zones should be based on

273
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:31,600
unique risk isa 62443 iec i should say

274
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,560
to be properly correct does a very good

275
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,760
job at making risk the cornerstone of

276
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,079
the establishment of zones that risk can

277
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:43,040
be through a lot of things like

278
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:46,240
implementing control on secure or

279
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,160
insecure by design controllers i hate

280
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,760
that word you guys know that hate that

281
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,920
word insecure by design because insecure

282
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,920
is relative to time

283
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,680
we thought windows nt was the greatest

284
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,200
thing in the world when we made the move

285
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,600
to windows in the 90s it was the most

286
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,600
secure operating system ever developed

287
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,920
today we laugh it's a joke so no matter

288
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,920
what we do and we got some people here

289
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,079
from bedrock automation that make the

290
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:10,320
most secure controller that's ever been

291
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,560
developed we hope that it will be that

292
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,040
way 20 years from now but who's to say

293
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,279
it will so i'm not a big fan of this

294
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:19,120
insecure by design

295
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,279
we need to learn how to secure things

296
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:23,440
with what we have today in a resilient

297
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,200
mindset so as i kind of move to this

298
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,560
last slide

299
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,560
in comes this concept

300
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,160
of what's being coined micro

301
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,600
segmentation

302
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,480
so what you see in here is the creation

303
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,279
of

304
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:38,320
subzones or micro zones

305
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,120
that allow you to implement granular

306
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,959
control that in every one of the common

307
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:47,760
and well-publicized breaches it would

308
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,320
stop them dead in their tracks

309
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,639
because it limits the ability of

310
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:53,760
services

311
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:57,680
based on the individual assets role

312
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,160
so for instance it's hard to see in here

313
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,079
um there's there's bigger i brought

314
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:03,600
bigger pictures of this reference

315
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,279
architecture if you take a look at

316
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:07,360
something like active directory

317
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,720
active directory should never

318
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,079
initiate

319
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:13,040
comms

320
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,720
with an asset

321
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,760
never

322
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,320
it's there to handle authentication type

323
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,480
services now i'm talking about the

324
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,240
domain services role within active

325
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,920
directory there's dozens of roles so

326
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,760
we'll focus on the key one domain

327
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,120
services

328
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,360
even a server that's running file

329
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,000
services file servers don't start

330
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,120
sessions with clients to start sending

331
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,279
things to them automatically

332
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:39,120
so you start to look at this the number

333
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,240
one gold mine in any hacker's playbook

334
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,120
is to go active after active directory

335
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,200
you do that so that once you have all

336
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,800
these credentials you can start to move

337
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,360
elsewhere well what if you can't move

338
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,480
elsewhere

339
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,079
that's where this starts to come into

340
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:56,800
play into this whole concept around

341
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,760
establishing these micro

342
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,920
segmented subzones

343
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,240
which you can then strictly enforce

344
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,440
communication

345
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,399
for instance engineering workstation

346
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:12,240
no comms should ever be allowed to start

347
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,320
outside of an engineering workstation

348
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,480
now you can never say never but in

349
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,399
almost all cases on an operational

350
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:21,600
system not a dev system but an op system

351
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,200
the engineering workstation is the

352
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,160
originator not the receiver

353
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,639
so when you start to look at this okay

354
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:30,959
you exploit an engineering workstation

355
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:33,040
but the ability to exfiltrate or

356
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,440
laterally move becomes

357
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,079
very difficult because of the micro

358
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:40,000
segmentation that's in place and the

359
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,360
enforcement that's placed on the

360
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:44,800
conduits associated with only a subset

361
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,440
of the authorized assets so what if an

362
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,000
engineering workstation allowed

363
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,560
no inbound access

364
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,480
you would start to say wow it kind of

365
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,120
makes that device appear

366
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,959
hidden to a lot of adversaries that

367
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:00,959
could jump on the network so with that

368
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:02,320
of course we're going to talk more about

369
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,160
this at the cabanas but now i get to sit

370
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,320
down and shut up that was my ten minutes

371
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,480
continuing with uh what joe was saying

372
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,519
is

373
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:11,600
we are focusing on micro segmentation

374
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,160
here and you know the base of zones and

375
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,480
conduits that he just talked about it's

376
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,240
great and we can see it on the image but

377
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,000
then we're not talking about flow of

378
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,680
communication right

379
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,839
do you know the flow of communication

380
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:25,519
that go that is going through your

381
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:27,440
operational site right do you know

382
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,920
exactly where the operator station is

383
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,120
talking to

384
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,959
is it supposed to talk to that is it

385
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:35,120
supposed to move uh vertically or is it

386
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,000
supposed to move laterally right so all

387
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,519
of that flow of communication is what

388
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:42,480
gives us uh pretty much the resiliency

389
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,720
or knowing that flow of information

390
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,160
would give us the resiliency within the

391
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:49,360
network if we secure those systems so

392
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,040
this is a slide where pretty much we're

393
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,440
used to this right we know that

394
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,440
north-south communications are supposed

395
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,360
to happen this is where ot cyber

396
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,920
security pretty much started we needed

397
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,240
or sea level suite people needed the

398
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,560
data that we were producing down right

399
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,800
at that bottom level how much are we

400
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,959
producing we need to figure it out

401
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:10,639
because we need to forecast how much

402
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:12,079
we're going to charge whatever that

403
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:13,680
process it is

404
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,160
so that connection needed to happen and

405
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,639
it just plugged pretty much in this is

406
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:21,920
where air gap got lost um

407
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,920
so this is the data flowing right we

408
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,440
know there is supposed to be production

409
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,519
data moving from the bottom

410
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:28,720
going up

411
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:32,320
because they need this information now

412
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:35,199
is there a reason is there a need from

413
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:37,040
communication flow

414
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,759
the other way back is there any reason

415
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:42,639
it or any other device up top of that

416
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:44,160
network on the office network on this

417
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,279
big graph

418
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:48,399
needs to flow down

419
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:51,279
i really don't think so right the data

420
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:53,519
that is on the bottom can still flow up

421
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,440
security data can still flow up to some

422
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,680
type of seam or some type of sock or

423
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,160
maybe host something at the middle but i

424
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,920
still need to cut you still need to

425
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,800
protect down at the bottom but now we're

426
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,240
focusing more

427
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,120
on the lateral east-west communication

428
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,199
flows right and this is where the

429
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:13,680
micro-segmentation starts happening

430
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,160
if you think about it i want you guys

431
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,240
all you all have an i.t department you

432
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,079
all have services

433
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:22,399
are they using firewalls

434
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:24,399
are they doing micro segmentations

435
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:26,480
within their own networks

436
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,800
of course they are that's still a thing

437
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,480
to protect networks

438
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,720
we need to be applying the same things

439
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,639
within operational sites they know the

440
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:36,240
flow of communication they know how to

441
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,160
micro segment their networks we need to

442
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,800
be applying the same concepts but the

443
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,800
way i like to do it or the way i like to

444
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,720
translate it to people is

445
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,480
there are some policies that they do but

446
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,639
we have to implement it the way we know

447
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,399
operations work right we cannot just

448
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:52,160
implement the firewall down there

449
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,120
because

450
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,440
it might interrupt that process

451
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,880
that's why information is really

452
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,279
important

453
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,519
so obviously we all know the concept of

454
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:03,600
a firewall it's like it's nothing more

455
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,839
than a police

456
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:07,760
traffic device that sits within a

457
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,000
network understands or

458
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,599
sits on the network reads the flow of

459
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:13,119
traffic and depending on the certain

460
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:14,400
rules that it's following it's like

461
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,679
you're allowed to go through you're not

462
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:17,199
allowed to go through that's as simple

463
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:19,439
as it goes um

464
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:21,119
there could be static or dynamically

465
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:23,119
configured they could be user configured

466
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:25,520
or they could be smart as well there are

467
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,760
now a days technology that the firewall

468
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,160
can actually save some steps for you to

469
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,080
be able to configure

470
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:35,199
that communication flow

471
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,360
now the traditional steps and if you

472
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,200
have not configured a file if you do not

473
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,120
have the it experience to be able to do

474
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,919
this um they're not really pretty

475
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:45,679
straightforward right

476
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:47,600
most of the time you need some type of

477
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,600
tap device or poor mirroring on a switch

478
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,280
to be able to gather the data traffic

479
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,520
right you have to gather the data the

480
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,440
second step is you have to analyze the

481
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,240
data it's understanding what's the ap

482
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,760
address coming from what's the ip

483
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,600
address going through and understanding

484
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,240
what ip address is it could be a plc a

485
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,720
user workstation it could be maybe the

486
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,919
theme or the sock log logs going through

487
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:12,080
the security room all of that is very

488
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,600
important to understand that's just the

489
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,520
ip address and that's how you start

490
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:18,799
mapping flow of data right we all know a

491
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:20,480
famous wireshark everybody probably

492
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,120
knows um here but that's a screenshot of

493
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,840
like a data packets uh that or permanent

494
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,480
image of a couple data flows that that i

495
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,600
gather

496
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,280
after that obviously you grab that data

497
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,919
analyze it as i just mentioned um

498
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:36,000
you can go obviously packet by packet

499
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,640
this is a lot of this is an exercise

500
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,559
that you're going to sit down and do you

501
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:43,120
can filter out or create firewall rules

502
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:46,000
that filter out mac address source and

503
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,679
destination mac address depending on the

504
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:49,679
network you can filter out the source

505
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:51,520
and destination port the source and

506
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:54,000
destination ip address and depending on

507
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,640
the type of firewall

508
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,799
you can even filter out

509
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:00,240
the the

510
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,799
application layer right so depending on

511
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:04,720
what you're doing you can even filter

512
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,919
out for example modbus

513
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:10,960
tcp connections these specific write

514
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,080
read

515
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,640
communication that that plc client

516
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:18,320
server are actually meant to be doing

517
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,679
and then obviously after you have

518
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:21,440
analyzed all these data then you have to

519
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:24,080
sit down in front of your file and

520
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:27,200
configure it sit down and say where's my

521
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,960
incoming traffic going through where is

522
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,640
that firewall sitting on the network and

523
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,960
where is the traffic flow

524
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,880
is that firewall rule that i read

525
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,960
incoming on the firewall or is it

526
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,919
outgoing some firewalls are stateful

527
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:41,600
which means they know the state of the

528
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,760
connection so you only have to configure

529
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,600
one way some firewalls are a little bit

530
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,080
less smart or connectionless what means

531
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,760
is you have to configure both ways

532
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,000
including the reply so it's one of those

533
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,440
things that allows you to kind of just

534
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,840
go through but overall that's how you do

535
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,280
it if you take a look at the screen you

536
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:00,559
go rule by rule this is from ip to ip

537
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:02,320
maybe the port numbers you're doing and

538
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,159
the actions specifically what do you

539
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:05,440
want to do with this do you want to

540
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,640
accept it

541
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,880
do you want to drop it maybe you can tie

542
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,960
it to an additional action because

543
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,080
depending on the firewall there's

544
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,919
advanced options

545
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:16,000
and one item here that is missing on the

546
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,360
screenshot is

547
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,600
do you want to log this and maybe send

548
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,000
it to a central log server which is very

549
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,280
important for

550
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,840
audits in the future right so think

551
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,679
about it if there is an incident and a

552
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:29,919
fire will cause something going through

553
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:30,960
that's the first thing they're going to

554
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,480
ask you where they are where are the

555
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,480
logs when you're gonna come and do an

556
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,799
audit

557
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,280
now i mentioned the difference between

558
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,240
uh

559
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,840
there are different types of firewalls

560
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,360
of course and we're gonna be focusing on

561
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,919
industrial firewalls a

562
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:47,520
stateful packet inspection means that

563
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,679
they can they know the connection states

564
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:51,520
so you just need one firewall rule that

565
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,120
will allow the reply to come through it

566
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,360
knows the state of the connection but at

567
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,919
that level you're also only filtering

568
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:01,120
mac addresses uh ip addresses imports as

569
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,400
basic as that

570
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,000
some industries some applications

571
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,679
majority honestly this is enough to do a

572
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:10,240
prop an appropriate micro segmentation

573
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,799
strategy within an operational network

574
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:14,640
some other industries they need a little

575
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,240
bit more and this is where you start

576
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,000
talking about the packet inspection

577
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,640
firewalls which as the name says it goes

578
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,880
all the way down to the packet layer and

579
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:26,480
filters for example a modbus tcp packet

580
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:29,600
function called pdu addresses and

581
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,559
think about the no two the level of

582
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:35,679
expertise it is not just from the it now

583
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:37,520
you need to have somebody that is an

584
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,559
expert

585
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:40,799
at the controller at the modbus who

586
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,720
configure that client server who really

587
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,799
knows what is the communication that has

588
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:46,400
to be that has to be happened between

589
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,960
maybe that scada room and that specific

590
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,039
controller right to be able to get to

591
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:53,120
this function code into the specific pdu

592
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,440
address probably that so you're not

593
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,600
going to have that unicorn it's really

594
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,840
tough to find somebody that can really

595
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:02,159
do firewalls that can really do modbus

596
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:05,120
tcp for example

597
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,080
now

598
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,440
this would not be a sponsored

599
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,200
presentation without a little bit of

600
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,120
information of the sponsor side of

601
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,600
course as you all know i

602
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,600
i work with phoenix contact i am the

603
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,280
senior product specialist for networking

604
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:20,080
and security or cyber security and we do

605
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,240
have available industrial firewalls but

606
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,000
i do want to

607
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,320
focus all of your guys attention i mean

608
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,840
you can see the pictures but i want to

609
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,159
focus on your guys attention on one

610
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:31,760
specific one

611
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,120
it is recently

612
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,559
it's pretty new i mean it's been

613
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:36,559
launched for a year but it's a really

614
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:38,960
nice firewall because

615
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,640
and it's that one right there on the

616
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,480
plastic casing actually the second from

617
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,440
the left

618
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,280
um

619
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,520
is the one in the plastic casing because

620
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,280
we actually added a very nice

621
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,520
functionality that you remember all the

622
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,200
steps that i mentioned to you before the

623
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,039
gathering the analytics and all of that

624
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:56,480
it's pretty much doing all of that for

625
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,000
you okay

626
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:58,799
so

627
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:01,840
and i had that of course

628
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,159
so we have a feature in there

629
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:06,799
i really really like it you don't it's a

630
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:08,640
really low cost firewall that you can go

631
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,720
ahead and get and test it out but

632
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,039
overall the only thing you have to do is

633
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:15,039
kind of put it on the network

634
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:17,039
start literally it's just a start button

635
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:19,120
the same way you see it on the screen

636
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,640
and as soon as you click that start

637
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,480
button for that specific functionality

638
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,480
within the firewall assistant that

639
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,240
firewall system is just kind of sitting

640
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,159
there you can leave it running for a

641
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:29,919
couple of hours or an hour depending on

642
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:32,159
how big your system is or how much flow

643
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:34,640
of data is going to go through

644
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:37,120
but think about it as on the operational

645
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,400
side

646
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,640
is there maybe logs that are sent every

647
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,400
month you don't want to leave that

648
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,799
running a whole month right but there

649
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:46,799
are that is another functionality that

650
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:48,720
will help you there we're focusing on

651
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,559
this one you click on that start button

652
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:52,400
you can go to launch and come back when

653
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,080
you come back and you click that stop

654
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,120
button

655
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:57,200
that firewall assistant will give you

656
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,679
the log traffic and it's not just just

657
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:00,880
going to give you the locked traffic

658
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,960
it's already giving it to you either if

659
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,039
it's incoming so if it started from the

660
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:07,120
external network into the internal

661
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,200
network or you will place it already on

662
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,559
the firewall rule

663
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:12,960
if it started from the incoming network

664
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,600
out so you already have that flow of

665
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,360
course it's not as smart as telling you

666
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,679
well 1.23 plc

667
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:22,799
and 1.4 is your hmi

668
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:24,880
but then that's what you are the owner

669
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,720
right you would kind of start mapping

670
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,960
out okay this should be the right there

671
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,960
is you know the type of poor 443 should

672
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,360
be https connection if you if you see

673
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:36,799
tcp 80 it's http or if you see standard

674
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:39,360
2 2 2 we already know rockwell or modbus

675
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:42,720
tcp is 502. this is how you start and

676
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,799
save some of the steps uh within the

677
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:47,279
specific firewall so it's not you know

678
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:48,559
there's still one more step that you

679
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:50,240
need to do as a user you want to come in

680
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:53,520
here and actually do the action right so

681
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:54,960
after you have analyzed a little bit

682
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,360
more you save some steps you what do you

683
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,039
want to do with the traffic

684
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:00,720
no traffic should be going out of the

685
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,400
operation going to an internet ip

686
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,640
address for example right so you want to

687
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,080
make sure that it's actually fully

688
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:08,320
blocked you can block that just change

689
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,159
the action that would be the only thing

690
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:11,679
and all that time that that little

691
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:14,159
firewall device is actually helping you

692
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:16,960
save within the configuration side

693
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,640
so of course we have additional features

694
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,400
within the different family of the

695
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,159
mguards we have a lot more advanced

696
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:24,720
features but i do want to leave

697
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,960
time for questions and

698
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,360
we any questions that you might have or

699
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:32,400
we will have um obviously a demo

700
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,960
within the cabana uh at four o'clock so

701
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,640
find the things contact cabana and i'll

702
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:37,919
show you guys this specific

703
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:40,480
functionality and obviously

704
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,000
any of the other additional features

705
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,840
within the m guards but

706
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,760
this is pretty much what i you know the

707
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,919
end of the slide or the last slide this

708
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:49,760
slide or this image joel put it at the

709
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,360
beginning and it was so easy for me to

710
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,440
say listen micro segmentation to zones

711
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,919
and conduits could easily be split out

712
00:25:55,919 --> 00:25:57,520
everything where you say there is a

713
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,440
firewall there that's exactly what

714
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,360
they're trying a firewall will allow you

715
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,960
to do the micro segmentation will allow

716
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,360
you to separate those zones and pretty

717
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,520
much create the conduit that is gonna

718
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,279
secure the sounds

719
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:11,679
so that's kind of like the message i

720
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:13,360
appreciate everybody's time and we have

721
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:16,639
a couple of minutes for questions

722
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:26,080
we have uh we have the mic on the back

723
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:28,080
um there is different ranges of prices

724
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,600
and i'll be more than happy to get it to

725
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,440
you on the of the cabana but the little

726
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,880
eleven hundred doesn't go over seven

727
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:35,440
hundred dollars

728
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,440
see so you know i was saying how we stop

729
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,360
project or stop these these campaigns

730
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,279
dead in their tracks this particular

731
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:42,799
solution so i was one of the researchers

732
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:44,880
on dragonfly havocs and watching how

733
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,039
that thing initiated provoked and

734
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:49,039
started moving around all i did was

735
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:51,679
deploy this right away boom done another

736
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:53,520
thing for the security assessors that go

737
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:54,799
out in the field and actually do a lot

738
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:57,200
of this these devices i always have had

739
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,440
one in my bag whenever i deploy i have

740
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,279
it in my tool kit because when you're in

741
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:03,120
a bind and you're under pressure to

742
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,440
develop firewall rules you don't need to

743
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,520
do all these multiple steps i take this

744
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,520
device put it in line it's completely

745
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,760
passive let it run for a while and boom

746
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:14,080
you've got your firewall rules this

747
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,679
really paid off at

748
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:17,279
idaho national labs for the red team

749
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:19,200
blue team exercise well that's kind of

750
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,360
the whole key is initially getting a

751
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,120
handle on your network security we have

752
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:25,200
a question on the back

753
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:28,159
hi i think this question is for joel um

754
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:30,640
hey i'm right here i don't know

755
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:33,600
so um i agree with you know the premise

756
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,840
of micro segmentation and really

757
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,880
leveraging the principles within iec

758
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:40,799
62443 i think my question is before you

759
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:42,720
even get to that point i think there's a

760
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,720
lot of assumptions or things that you

761
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,960
need to do to prepare yourself in order

762
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,200
to do that micro segmentation especially

763
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:52,159
at level one level two and networked or

764
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:54,399
unnetworked assets so can you talk a

765
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:56,640
little bit about how you prepare to even

766
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:59,120
do that micro segmentation to save time

767
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:01,039
and to not have to do it continuously

768
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:02,960
and maybe manually well no this is

769
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,559
actually that's an awesome question and

770
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:06,080
you all got to hear it tonight's repeat

771
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,919
because probably the biggest step in

772
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:10,720
doing this is to understand the asset

773
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,799
exposure of each of the assets so of

774
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:14,320
course and no matter what document you

775
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,960
read outside of 6443 you're not because

776
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,320
the first step is is your asset

777
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:19,919
inventory once you have your asset

778
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:23,200
inventory and having done this for years

779
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,039
the biggest step is the prioritization

780
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:26,320
of assets

781
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,480
so you have to be able to look at your

782
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,960
assets and in the real world the

783
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,720
engineers that actually run these

784
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:35,200
systems know that all controllers aren't

785
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,279
equal there are controllers that are

786
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:40,159
more high priority in terms of loss risk

787
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:41,760
of loss potential impact should they be

788
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,919
compromised so you start to group your

789
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:46,320
assets and create a risk profile

790
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,399
then you see if your infrastructure can

791
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:50,799
handle it and i get really frustrated

792
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:52,399
when the first thing we have to do on a

793
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:54,960
project in order to deploy security is

794
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,799
to create this new network

795
00:28:56,799 --> 00:28:58,399
infrastructure with all new managed

796
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:00,960
switches for instance there are ways to

797
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:03,600
do the segmentation through grouping

798
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,240
physically through what you have

799
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,720
and again it's still taking what could

800
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:12,240
be a flat level one network but creating

801
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,320
physical segmentation through the

802
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,960
establishment of independent switching

803
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:19,919
infrastructure so not converging

804
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:23,520
everything on a 48 port switch but

805
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:26,399
busting that 48 port switch possibly

806
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:29,039
into groups of eight where you can then

807
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:32,159
do that segmentation on the outbound the

808
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:34,480
connection or the uplink associated with

809
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,799
the eight port switch rather than trying

810
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:39,440
to manage that beast around a stack of

811
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:42,640
one two three four 48 port switches does

812
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,000
that help

813
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,240
thank you

814
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,600
so our time's up obviously with 30

815
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,279
minutes you can't do a lot but we sure

816
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:52,960
encourage you to come over to the

817
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,799
cabanas in a couple hours

818
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:57,039
and lots of pictures lots of discussion

819
00:29:57,039 --> 00:29:59,600
demonstrations and lots of talk points

820
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,360
so again i really appreciate it thank

821
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:05,399
you guys thank you for coming

822
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:10,158
you
