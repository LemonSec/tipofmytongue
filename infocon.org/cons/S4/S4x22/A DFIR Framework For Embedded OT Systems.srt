1
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,279
hello everyone thanks for joining us for

2
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:09,200
this talk today

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,920
uh okay with our presentation there

4
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:13,120
so

5
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:14,719
nice to see you here doing one of the

6
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:17,840
last talks of the day uh i hope you we

7
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,760
get to enjoy a bit of this before going

8
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,080
to the cabanas to enjoy

9
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:22,880
so

10
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,560
let's jump straight into a topic we want

11
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,039
to introduce a dfir framework for og

12
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:29,279
systems for better ot systems this is

13
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,599
something that uh most likely many of

14
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:33,120
you if you're here and interested in the

15
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,480
topic probably have already thought

16
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,239
about it like it should probably already

17
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:38,079
exist there should be something

18
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:39,440
but right now we're making sure that it

19
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,760
actually you know gets into something

20
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,719
that we can start working with

21
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:47,360
and to begin uh i wanted to provide an

22
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,200
anecdote let's say i always like to

23
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,800
begin like this and

24
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,879
it was just a reflection from a couple

25
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:54,480
months ago we were already working in

26
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,680
this project

27
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,239
and then i was in a conference in in

28
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:00,079
italy and then there was this french

29
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:01,920
researcher and he started talking to us

30
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,840
about his presentation and he was super

31
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,519
excited he said how amazing it was and

32
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,920
he says my presentation the quest of the

33
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,400
gecko it's gonna be great you should go

34
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,680
and it sounded super friendly super

35
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,840
amazing

36
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,280
the good news is that the talk was

37
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,680
amazing the best news is that it wasn't

38
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,600
as cute as it sounded when he said the

39
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,360
quest of the gecko because this was the

40
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,520
actual gecko

41
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,280
basically what

42
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,240
this researcher was doing is uh he was

43
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,960
working with this specific type of

44
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,360
embedded device it had a proprietary uh

45
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,520
os that he had to actually go and figure

46
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,439
out how to work with it he had to go and

47
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:39,360
figure out basically everything about

48
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,560
the device

49
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,079
uh and then he was saying that it took

50
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:44,079
him a couple months

51
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:46,560
a couple months sounds pretty good you

52
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,840
know because of the complexity and

53
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:48,880
whatnot

54
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,040
uh and you know he's the person that

55
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,040
employed him was or the company was very

56
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,960
happy with the results but the problem

57
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:55,840
is that

58
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,680
when you think about doing this with

59
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,680
every device you have if you were for

60
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,280
example in a company in a larger

61
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,799
organization

62
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:04,399
it sounds almost impossible right

63
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:05,920
because you're not gonna have one device

64
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,200
you're gonna have one of these you're

65
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,878
gonna have uh hundreds probably

66
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:09,919
thousands

67
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:13,360
and then the only way to uh target to to

68
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,520
go after this um

69
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,280
basically to do something about this is

70
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,120
to have a systematic a systematic

71
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,280
approach right and that is basically

72
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,040
what we took into our hands with this

73
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,120
framework and this is why we defined we

74
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,680
need a dfir framework for embedded o2

75
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,280
systems we need to figure out how to

76
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,200
make it systematic so that we can go

77
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,360
look into the devices know what we have

78
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,200
and actually incorporate it not only as

79
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,120
something that one researcher does for

80
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,879
six months even though it's still super

81
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:40,720
valuable but something that we can go

82
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,239
and do uh

83
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:44,560
you know as part of the organization uh

84
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,440
normal processes

85
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,959
so there are two things to consider here

86
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:50,400
the first thing is

87
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,760
why are we pushing this in the first

88
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,519
place of course there are a different

89
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:55,280
set of benefits

90
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,800
the first one is of course that you can

91
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,720
set establish basically a baseline for

92
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,640
the different devices that you have

93
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,239
once you have a baseline then you can

94
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:04,159
know whenever something that is weird or

95
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:05,680
that shouldn't be happening is taking

96
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,519
place so it basically enables you to

97
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:09,599
have better uh visualization better

98
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:11,760
visibility into what's going on

99
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,680
and the second one uh well sorry the the

100
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,239
third thing is about uh

101
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:17,519
supporting other processes in the

102
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:18,400
company

103
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,640
so what we're saying right now is not

104
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,159
come and create something entirely new

105
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:23,760
but what we're saying is

106
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,040
many of the things that you need for

107
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,120
such an uh for having such an approach

108
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,440
for dfr systems that is more systematic

109
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,959
are things that we are already doing

110
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:32,720
that already take place

111
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,799
and that are gonna benefit in different

112
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:36,239
branches let's say your different types

113
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:38,080
of activities in the company so of

114
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,200
course for example if you build an

115
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,959
inventory you're gonna have something

116
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:42,000
you know for procurement you're gonna

117
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,680
have for maintenance

118
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,280
basically

119
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,879
this is something that is already taking

120
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:49,920
place and that you can benefit from

121
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,920
and then on the other side of course we

122
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,760
have the challenges it's not so simple

123
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,120
it's actually well if we're talking

124
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,400
about a fairly complex work it's

125
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,599
something that you know we're not

126
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:59,200
bringing to you right now a full

127
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,640
solution for everything we're bringing a

128
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,480
theoretical framework something that we

129
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,239
think that could be applied and that

130
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:06,640
could be helpful for the community

131
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,439
um

132
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:09,680
so between the challenges of course is

133
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,519
we have few visibility often in these

134
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:12,720
devices

135
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,319
oftentimes the devices might have for

136
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:16,639
example embedded rtos like in this case

137
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:18,000
it was something proprietary that you

138
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,160
have to figure out how to work with that

139
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,160
possibly the vendor is going to help you

140
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,840
but possibly they are not

141
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,199
and so also all of this is time

142
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:26,560
consuming right

143
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,320
and also it might be time-consuming

144
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,800
simply by the fact that oftentimes you

145
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,160
know to interact with one of these

146
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,479
devices you need to figure out how to

147
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:36,800
interact with each one you need to

148
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,639
probably even send someone physically to

149
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:40,320
go and grab the device and physically

150
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,320
connect to it or you know whatever they

151
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:45,520
have to do and most often figure it out

152
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,758
so

153
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,479
good news the good news that we have is

154
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:51,919
that this is something that already

155
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:54,080
takes place in any organization

156
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,600
but the thing that we're trying to bring

157
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,600
up in here is is trying to put both

158
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,440
together in a theoretical framework that

159
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,280
considers both the engineering

160
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,520
perspective and the digital perspective

161
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,320
right up until now we have been thinking

162
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,280
uh or

163
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,039
actually well yeah in general as a

164
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:10,639
community we have been thinking as this

165
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:11,840
idea of like

166
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,520
you know like engineering has uh some

167
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,400
work uh it has different work more most

168
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,400
recently we have started combining it

169
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,320
and you know everyone's started pushing

170
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,639
for that and then when you actually sit

171
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:24,240
down and think through it you realize

172
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,240
that from engineering perspective

173
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,160
you already do things like

174
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,240
root cause analysis uh and you know

175
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,240
those type of analysis where you are

176
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,840
actually trying to figure out what what

177
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,080
could go wrong and how could it go wrong

178
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,840
and from the detail side it's exactly

179
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,280
the same you know all of the analysis

180
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,039
that we can do uh considering you know

181
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:42,960
from from the computer perspective

182
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,400
so the thing that we want to do right

183
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,400
now is to pitch a systematic approach

184
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:50,479
again to do both of these together

185
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:52,160
and this is how it looks like it's

186
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,000
actually uh looks fairly simple but

187
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,600
obviously it comes from a lot of

188
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,280
thinking and discussing uh between

189
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,800
different groups these included actually

190
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,960
work from our consultants and also from

191
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,479
our third intelligence group and from

192
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:04,479
our manage defense group basically

193
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:06,080
everyone getting together and thinking

194
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,919
how should this look like

195
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:10,160
and what you see in here actually on the

196
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,960
left side is uh basically our

197
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,960
our process let's say that our framework

198
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,520
for for nc and response it's basically

199
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,039
something that most people are already

200
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:20,560
familiar with

201
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,720
and why not if you know like

202
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,080
frameworks for instant response have

203
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,919
existed forever and not for ever you

204
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:27,520
know but for a long time with it we have

205
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,199
frameworks for many different things but

206
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:31,759
not specifically for for ot where we

207
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:32,960
have seen that it's fairly different

208
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,360
right and then

209
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,639
we focused specifically on the

210
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:38,639
preparation phase so

211
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:41,120
we focus on uh the three things that you

212
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,280
need to make sure that by the time you

213
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,280
get an incident or by the time you want

214
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,680
to you know do something about

215
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,680
something that you're unhappy that is

216
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,440
happening then that you have enough data

217
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,440
you have enough information and you know

218
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,120
where to go and find it where to collect

219
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,840
it it's three basic steps basically

220
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,160
identifying tools and basically how to

221
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,400
how to communicate with each device the

222
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,560
second one collaborating with oems i'm

223
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,680
going to get more in depth into each

224
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,240
step and the third one identifying and

225
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,360
collecting the data

226
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:13,680
for the first step

227
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,919
device and tool identification okay the

228
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:17,039
first thing that we need to know and

229
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:18,319
this is you know first step in

230
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:20,319
everything that we talk about like ot in

231
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,240
general is to know what we have to know

232
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,360
what we want to defend to know what we

233
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,280
want to analyze basically to scope the

234
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,960
problem

235
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,160
and in this case the first thing that we

236
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,800
can see is communication methods we have

237
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,720
four different types of communications

238
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,479
that we consider in devices this is just

239
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:37,120
like general general theory you can of

240
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,960
course just have a piece of software you

241
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,560
know an application that you use for

242
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,240
communicating with your device

243
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,919
you can use different communication

244
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:46,400
protocols i don't know maybe ftp maybe

245
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,400
ssh maybe telnet

246
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,720
you name it depends on the device

247
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,720
oftentimes you might have a web

248
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,199
gui of course many people are gonna jump

249
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:57,199
when it says like it shouldn't okay

250
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:58,400
maybe you know maybe it should it

251
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,720
shouldn't but they exist period

252
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,400
and then physical interfaces of course

253
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,919
if you're talking about like any

254
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:06,160
connections any direct cables into into

255
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,479
the device

256
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:10,479
putting that all together we came up

257
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:13,360
with this uh gener a general diagram

258
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,840
let's say that that would be an example

259
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,520
of how we would approach this this

260
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,720
problem from from you know this

261
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,720
systematic level and so the first thing

262
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,879
that we'll do is go to take a look into

263
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:24,720
the vendors and assets that we have

264
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,560
these of course are not

265
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,400
any any realistic side or anything it

266
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,919
was just like a recollection that we did

267
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:32,240
of like which ones do you know which is

268
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,599
part of the problem right because no one

269
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:34,399
can

270
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:36,080
i mean most likely no one here knows all

271
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,679
of these models and everything that they

272
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:39,599
have it's something you know like like

273
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:41,200
that probably if you have to deal with

274
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,559
it you might go back you find the

275
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,240
documentation you try to figure out

276
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,839
where it is and if you have all of this

277
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:47,120
in place that is something that is going

278
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,600
to be much easier mainly uh considering

279
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,640
that you might be in the face of

280
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,240
something wrong going on right like like

281
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,360
of an incident basically and so uh this

282
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,760
first one the d20 mx is the one we're

283
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,760
we're going to be focusing uh on today

284
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,600
we decided it's like a like a quick

285
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,120
example you know like like some

286
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,360
additional value that we provide today

287
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,320
um

288
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,920
so i'm not going to get in depth but

289
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,360
basically we're going to describe a bit

290
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,959
more in depth that specific device

291
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,680
there it goes

292
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,000
and uh beyond the data that that we were

293
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,920
already uh showing there this is this

294
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,519
was kind of like like a baseline of how

295
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:22,800
we would like to look at this

296
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,200
information but there we are aware that

297
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,640
there are other pieces of data that

298
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,959
might be very important to collect so we

299
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:31,120
mentioned here three particularly backup

300
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,200
configurations in case you know there's

301
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,839
any change you wanna

302
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:37,360
recover rapidly

303
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,800
second one is technical procedures and

304
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,760
manuals

305
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,440
if you need more information about the

306
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,600
devices oftentimes it's not so easy and

307
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,120
intuitive to just go and interact but

308
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,240
you actually need to go and find the

309
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,519
documentation

310
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,120
this is something that we actually

311
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,040
reproduce in our experiment that we're

312
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,279
going to talk in a couple minutes

313
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:55,519
and so yeah basically it might even be

314
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:57,200
open source but basically the time that

315
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,880
it takes you to go and find it might be

316
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,160
the time that it takes you to go and

317
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,839
actually solve the problem

318
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:03,360
and then the third one is appointed

319
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,360
employees which is basically uh the

320
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,680
knowledge right we want to know who is

321
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,519
able to interact with the device who has

322
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:11,519
the knowledge of what it is how it works

323
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:13,120
and what we can do about it and if

324
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,959
there's no one then again that's that's

325
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:17,600
a void that you probably might know with

326
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,000
anticipation that you might start trying

327
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,240
to address because if something happens

328
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,839
you need to know to have someone that

329
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:26,240
knows it

330
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,720
now that was the first step we get all

331
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,560
the information we got what devices we

332
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,640
have we get we identify what tools we

333
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,640
need to communicate with them and then

334
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,959
we jump into the second which is the

335
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:39,760
collaboration with oms

336
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,320
this might be a bit more

337
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,839
how to say i know that some people when

338
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:45,360
you say collaboration jump and it's like

339
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,120
oh you know that sounds worrying i don't

340
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,399
know what they are doing i know what i

341
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:50,320
do but i don't know the other

342
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,560
uh but for those that keep this

343
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,440
kind of like renunent perspective

344
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,040
what i wanted to say is

345
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,480
simply

346
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,920
it is important to collaborate with the

347
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,920
om and the reason is basically that the

348
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,760
om is the one that knows the most about

349
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,440
the product the same way that you know

350
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,040
the most about what you do they know the

351
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,640
most about what they do and so

352
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,640
oftentimes you might have to like we are

353
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,160
aware of organizations that have

354
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,720
developed very expensive tools to try to

355
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,480
interact with devices

356
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,760
and basically they could have just

357
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,680
reached out to the oem and spare the

358
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,079
price you also for example if you had an

359
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:24,079
incident or something weird is happening

360
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:25,680
they might be able to help you there

361
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,120
might be many different ways in which

362
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,640
they can support which i'm going to get

363
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:31,440
into but just to give a quick example

364
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,000
after this talk if you were going to the

365
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,120
main stage to hear about incontroller

366
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,040
basically for that research for example

367
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,120
of course we started analyzing the one

368
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,800
of those big pieces of ot malware and

369
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,720
it's amazing and the first thing we do

370
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,800
is we actually reach out to the vendors

371
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,000
and then we talk to them and they're

372
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,600
like hey we think there's something with

373
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,360
your product and besides from all the

374
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,440
research that we do that it's you know

375
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,360
it's pretty amazing and whatnot

376
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,600
they jump in they started analyzing they

377
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,040
started reproducing and then they can

378
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,720
verify you know it does affect this

379
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,560
vendor these specific products it

380
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,320
doesn't we believe it might be these

381
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,920
industries basically all of that

382
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,079
additional information that the vendor

383
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:10,800
is able to have that you as an external

384
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,040
uh individual and external group are not

385
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:16,160
going to be having access to

386
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,399
and so this is just a summary of the of

387
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:20,000
the benefits that i was mentioning of

388
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,720
course this helps you to be prepared to

389
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,360
to acquire data they might be able to

390
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,360
help you to have different types of

391
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,959
visibility of course

392
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:30,399
they also might be able to provide you

393
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:32,079
with replacements or for example

394
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:34,240
software licenses if you know at a

395
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,160
certain point you might need it because

396
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,920
something happened and then you need to

397
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,399
to make some rapid changes so having

398
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:42,160
this type of communication is what's

399
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,079
going to help you to immediately be able

400
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:45,040
to jump

401
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,880
and do something about it

402
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,880
uh just just just a reminder all of this

403
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:51,279
is during the preparation phase of uh

404
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:53,600
for for the incident response framework

405
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,200
so all of this is just something that

406
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,399
that we need to

407
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:58,160
have in mind and we that we need to have

408
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,079
repaired so that by the time something

409
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:03,760
happens we are actually able to respond

410
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,200
and we get to a third step the third

411
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,000
step data identification and collection

412
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,480
this is actually the most complicated

413
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,880
and just to let you know well i'm gonna

414
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,800
get into disclaimer in a second but

415
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,880
we're gonna be providing a training more

416
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,200
into this this specific area actually uh

417
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,200
glenn chason somewhere around here chris

418
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,760
is drunk uh ken broska who couldn't come

419
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,440
they will be uh sharing some some

420
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,920
information about how you do that

421
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,279
in case you're interested just just

422
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:31,200
saying on thursday

423
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,000
um

424
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,279
and so for data identification

425
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:34,880
collection we separated in two pieces

426
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,320
right we separated the physical

427
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,560
components from the digital

428
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,920
both of them we consider equally

429
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,160
important uh because any change from any

430
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,760
of the both parts might be very

431
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,760
important for the day bytes

432
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:46,959
it is not important to go through each

433
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:48,480
of these pieces however it's something

434
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,760
that you know we provide you to to um

435
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,440
to be aware to keep it if you want

436
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,959
there's also a blog about this where you

437
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,040
can find all of these these graphs and

438
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,199
and information but basically the point

439
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:00,720
is at the physical level we want to know

440
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,639
yeah what's the device what function in

441
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:04,240
general does it uh provide in the

442
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,639
process where is it located you might be

443
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:08,000
interested in all

444
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,839
having some pictures even even the

445
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:11,120
physical situation like here we

446
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,120
mentioned temperature because uh you

447
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,480
know for example if there's a difference

448
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,320
in the temperature at a certain point in

449
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,639
time it might be the device is working

450
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:20,399
differently is there a reason why the

451
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:22,480
device is working more than normal yes

452
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,560
no those are the type of things you you

453
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,240
might be able to respond

454
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,680
at the digital level

455
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,040
it's basically everything we see from

456
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,399
the computer side

457
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:32,480
of course we want to know what is what

458
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,079
framework does it have we want to know

459
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:35,600
the network traffic we want to know the

460
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,279
logs we want to know errors we want to

461
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:38,959
know basically what you would go and

462
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:42,160
analyze in a traditional

463
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,440
let's say a traditional forensics

464
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,160
exercise whether ot or not

465
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,440
and then we combine all of these

466
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,120
together and

467
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,560
based on that is that we can make some

468
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,240
of some of the decisions and of course

469
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,000
it doesn't mean that you have to have

470
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,440
all of these pieces of data for each

471
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,720
device that you have

472
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,240
what it actually means is that you have

473
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,000
to go and select based on the device

474
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,680
based on the criticality based on where

475
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,680
it's hosted and then make the decision

476
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,680
about what are the pieces of data that

477
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,519
you have access to and what are the

478
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,360
pieces of data that you believe might

479
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,760
help you in the event that you have to

480
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,880
respond to an incident

481
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,600
that being said there's uh our first

482
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,000
disclaimer here that is that we are

483
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,079
talking about forensics so everything

484
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:24,000
that we are discussing right now

485
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,920
is something that you should always

486
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,079
analyze keeping in mind these three big

487
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:30,160
principles right that is uh basically

488
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,320
the order of volatility going first for

489
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,880
data that is more likely to get lost if

490
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,560
you don't respond promptly

491
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,720
uh document the chain of custody you

492
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,639
need to know who was the person that was

493
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:42,320
gathering all this data

494
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,160
when did it take place how did it take

495
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,199
place

496
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:49,519
and of course the evidence preservation

497
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,360
and so

498
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,120
that was basically the framework itself

499
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,199
it's a as you can tell it's it's

500
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:57,440
basically meant to be a high level some

501
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,000
high level guidance on how can we go and

502
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,399
systematically adopt an approach so we

503
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:04,560
can go and try to make this effort of

504
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,399
dfir

505
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,440
much

506
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,600
much more efficient right

507
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,480
but

508
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,320
let's try to give some some example of

509
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,480
applying the framework right

510
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,320
and for this there's a big disclaimer

511
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,320
the disclaimer is

512
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,560
right now in this uh i think nine

513
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,560
minutes with 30 seconds i am not going

514
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,560
to be discussing and showing exactly how

515
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,440
you're going to do this with every

516
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,240
device and making you an expert in dfir

517
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,120
uh

518
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,399
what's going to happen right now is

519
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:31,839
we're just going to walk through one

520
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:33,279
example of a device that we're working

521
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:35,040
with if you want to be the expert go to

522
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,720
training on thursday or and you know you

523
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,320
can start getting more involved but

524
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,680
basically this takes a lot of work

525
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,759
because each device is different each

526
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:43,440
device works differently and you have to

527
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,360
know what tools to use to interact how

528
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,720
are you going to interact with it how

529
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,160
you're going to work with it

530
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,600
that is the reason why we're calling for

531
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,440
this systematic approach it is at this

532
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,759
point in time something overwhelming

533
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:56,240
so we're dropping this first uh these

534
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,160
first analysis to say like okay how can

535
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:02,560
we make it a bit less overwhelming

536
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,880
and so the first thing is uh we chose

537
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:08,400
this d20 mx um that's uh uh so some some

538
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,439
courtesy

539
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:11,760
from um that that chrissy strong was

540
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,520
able to help us obtain that that we've

541
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:14,559
done some some research with these

542
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:16,000
devices before

543
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,839
basically the first thing that we went

544
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:19,679
is to find some documentation

545
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:21,520
and just to let you know we did not use

546
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,280
anything proprietary all of this

547
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,599
exercises it's basically everything was

548
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:27,520
online we went through the documentation

549
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,880
started finding about the tools that

550
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,960
they used so for example there we found

551
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,840
for the d20 mx and sgconfig basically

552
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,320
for the tools to interact with device we

553
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,760
found everything online and we were able

554
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:38,720
to

555
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,960
uh to go from there and to learn it

556
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,400
and then also some general

557
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,000
specifications of what it is from which

558
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,919
the most important probably is this bx

559
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:48,559
works vxworks component for which we

560
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:51,039
actually have a tool that i believe it

561
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:53,760
was open source uh from mandiant that

562
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,160
well if you're curious just uh checking

563
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,360
this block and

564
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,600
you you can pretty easily find it or let

565
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,919
me know and i'm glad to to share that

566
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:03,679
with you

567
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:04,799
and so we started going through the

568
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:06,640
device and this is a bit of like of how

569
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,240
it looks like right again this is just

570
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,919
like over the top how it looks like but

571
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:11,679
the exercise took took much more it

572
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:13,440
actually like we had we had some of our

573
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,280
guys building the the lab and and what

574
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,880
going through it and whatnot

575
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:19,039
this is a very quick and simple setup

576
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:20,559
where we had like uh this first

577
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:22,320
connection the serial port which was

578
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,640
surprised it was us it was a windows

579
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,640
computer then you have this port

580
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,960
connecting to ethernet we had two not

581
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,720
active and not blocked ports that you

582
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,880
know might be might be very important to

583
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,400
know that because you want to know what

584
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,760
type of ports you have you want to know

585
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,120
if they're active or not and then you

586
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,480
want to know if they're blocked or not

587
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,520
and based on that you're going to make a

588
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,640
decision

589
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,640
and then you have here just the normal

590
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,240
power supply right if you see a change

591
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,360
in this obviously that might be

592
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,080
something concerning

593
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,000
we also document to the other side and

594
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,200
these are the pictures that we're

595
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,280
talking about this is a as you can

596
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,240
realize

597
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,000
you know when we go through this this is

598
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,880
a very small lab setup but if you

599
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,320
actually have it you know like like in

600
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,000
the planter would not you're gonna have

601
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,520
this much more complicated a ton of

602
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,440
cables it can get really crazy so the

603
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,799
best documentation you have on this the

604
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:08,400
most likely no one's gonna go and you

605
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,440
know connect something around here

606
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,880
without you knowing

607
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:11,679
so

608
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:13,039
in this case again we documented what

609
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:14,480
ports they had we document the power

610
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,720
termination block device numbers the

611
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,480
location i promise they exist they're

612
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,080
just behind this thing

613
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,360
but basically all the information for

614
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,280
the device and this is pretty much over

615
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,360
the top i insist being such a small lab

616
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,440
this is this is less critical being in a

617
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,799
larger setup is going to be more

618
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:30,480
critical to know specifically what is

619
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,720
there in place

620
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,960
the next one uh we jump to the digital

621
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,200
which is a bit you know it gets a bit

622
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,200
trickier and we decided to use two

623
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,520
different tools the first one and and we

624
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,200
just chose them based on you know what a

625
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,039
documentation we found available we

626
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:46,320
chose them based on what we thought

627
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,320
might be useful and interesting and

628
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,919
basically the best ways we could find to

629
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:51,520
interact with the device

630
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,120
both of them are pretty friendly so

631
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,160
actually it's

632
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:57,840
it's some great news for the d20 mx

633
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,840
the first one was basically the shell

634
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:02,240
that it has it has i believe it was t20

635
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,400
mx has three shells we chose one of them

636
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,520
d20

637
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,120
we chose it because it was friendly and

638
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,039
basically like more similar to other

639
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:10,799
type of shell interaction

640
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:12,240
and then you know immediately we go to

641
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,240
see what are the capabilities of that

642
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,320
shell

643
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:19,120
and then we get the list of uh basically

644
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,200
capabilities that it has

645
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,320
we're not going to go through the entire

646
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,400
list of course i mean

647
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,000
that that's part of what we're saying

648
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,200
that each device is going to have its

649
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,640
own peculiarities and you can choose

650
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:31,039
which of the data you want in here

651
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:32,880
but of course i mean we have to take

652
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,080
some time to at least you know go and

653
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,679
pick up you know like cherry pick a

654
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:37,440
couple of the devices uh sorry a couple

655
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,200
a couple of the commands that we thought

656
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,120
might have some value right so of course

657
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,640
like we were thinking it might be

658
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,559
interesting uh if you want to dump the

659
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:46,880
memory for example uh might be

660
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,159
interesting it might require a lot of

661
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:49,919
research so it depends on whether you

662
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:51,760
have you know a person with a skill set

663
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,200
to go through it and to work with it and

664
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,159
whatnot

665
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:55,679
but assuming you do that might be very

666
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:57,520
interesting uh of course you want to

667
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,880
know the routing table you want to see

668
00:20:58,880 --> 00:20:59,760
if there are any changes in

669
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:02,480
configurations uh or for example ips at

670
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,080
the network level you want to know all

671
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,159
the errors and user logs

672
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:07,600
once again

673
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,000
if you realize this is just a set of

674
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,919
commands that we that we chose but you

675
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:13,440
can basically choose depending on what

676
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,960
your device what the purpose is and how

677
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,640
do you think you're going to be best

678
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:19,760
able to recognize if something changed

679
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:22,000
in the uh in the context of your process

680
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,280
right

681
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,520
so anyway this is kind of like a way to

682
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,840
make it a bit more more specific provide

683
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,679
some guidance into how you would go

684
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:31,840
about working with this tool uh if at

685
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:34,159
the time you get in a rush to go and

686
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:36,400
respond

687
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,320
then the second one which is personally

688
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,919
my favorite is uh

689
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:43,200
we used sgconfig and the reason why i

690
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,400
find it so

691
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,320
uh so you know so nice is because i'm

692
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,440
one of those

693
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,840
people that really love having a a user

694
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:50,880
interface

695
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,880
i know that that command shell can be

696
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,799
sorry that the shells can be much much

697
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:57,120
more powerful in theory but always you

698
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,640
know having some visibility into this

699
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,480
also reduces

700
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,080
the technical requirements from your

701
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,320
from the employees that that you have as

702
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,600
long as they understand the process it's

703
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,360
going to be more likely that everyone's

704
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,039
able to use it

705
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:11,280
so this one actually is much more visual

706
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,559
than than the former

707
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:14,480
but with it with as you config i mean of

708
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,000
course it has like like like more

709
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,520
functionalities but

710
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,120
the quick thing that we found a super

711
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,200
quick value in was what happens if we

712
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,559
just go and drop the different

713
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:25,039
configurations and specifically sjconfig

714
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:27,520
can drop the configurations in xml in a

715
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,039
csv

716
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:30,960
i don't know different formats and then

717
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,440
we drop this xml and we compared it with

718
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,280
a different one to see you know like if

719
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,280
there was a change

720
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,880
and as part of our exercise of course we

721
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,880
did this comparison where we found a

722
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,039
specific table that contains uh

723
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:45,200
information about like registered users

724
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,720
and passwords and whatnot

725
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,559
and we made a small modification to say

726
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:50,320
like okay this is how it looks like now

727
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,159
i create a backup admin i leave a

728
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:54,480
message for myself look how great i am

729
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:57,039
and then you know i can basically

730
00:22:57,039 --> 00:22:58,640
show a very quick comparison that was

731
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,559
possible because you already know that

732
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:02,080
you have this tool that has a capability

733
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:04,000
to go and compare your configurations

734
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,240
right

735
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:09,360
and so the key takes away from all of

736
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:12,080
this uh more than focusing on the

737
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,320
specific d20 mx

738
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,159
uh and that's just an example of you

739
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:18,320
know like how to make it very

740
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,240
very punctual like in a couple minutes

741
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,400
we basically walked through the list of

742
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,000
ways in which you can communicate with a

743
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,799
specific device what might be of value

744
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:29,280
and then basically that when we apply it

745
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,039
in the larger framework becomes a guess

746
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:32,799
becomes some guidance that you can use

747
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:35,120
whenever something is is happening right

748
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,799
so you take these

749
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:38,960
five uh four or five takeaways that is

750
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,400
the first thing is

751
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,880
yes uh we need a systematic approach uh

752
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,159
that's what we are vouching for at this

753
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:45,440
point in time

754
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,720
and

755
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,240
you know i mean i i hope you might find

756
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,240
this find this useful i know that it

757
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,320
there's still challenges for applying it

758
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,559
at a large level it still requires a lot

759
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:56,320
of work but we definitely thought that

760
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,919
it was good to start building this type

761
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:00,640
of frameworks in the case of ot because

762
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,320
all of this is pretty well documented

763
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:05,200
for iot in our case as we just showed

764
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,520
it's a bit more complicated

765
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,200
so yeah basically having frameworks

766
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,200
helps make your life easier the second

767
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,440
thing is about the collaboration

768
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,039
we highlighted a second ago about the

769
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:17,039
original equipment manufacturers how you

770
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:18,080
really want to make sure that you're

771
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,679
collaborating with them but also within

772
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:21,279
your teams you know at the operational

773
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:22,240
level

774
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,440
engineering

775
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,600
i.t whatever departments because for

776
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,520
this type of analysis you need to have a

777
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,919
combination of all of those skills as we

778
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:32,159
proved also within our our immediate

779
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:34,400
team working on the project

780
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,640
then the next thing is that just a

781
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,400
reminder that whenever you work in

782
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,279
anything related to to dfir there are

783
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:42,559
things that are already going on in your

784
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:44,799
organization that you can actually reuse

785
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:46,559
both at the engineering and at the at

786
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:48,720
the network level let's say

787
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,240
and well basically you can benefit from

788
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,320
that and even other other units other

789
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,799
groups might also be able to benefit

790
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:57,039
and finally uh well yeah just keeping in

791
00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:58,799
mind this this is something that most

792
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:00,720
likely in this audience is not even

793
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,880
needed to highlight but engineering

794
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,480
personnel can share tools and knowledge

795
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,720
that might be very useful for this

796
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,480
detailed forensics process that's

797
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,919
something that we add basically because

798
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:11,679
we want to highlight you know like how

799
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:13,520
we are trying to merge these two

800
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,400
cultures

801
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,919
but uh but in the end you know i'm

802
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:17,600
pretty sure that at this point in time

803
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,120
everyone in this room is already aligned

804
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:23,279
with that and and already in agreement

805
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:25,679
that being said general recommendations

806
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:27,840
uh i'm just gonna get in i probably

807
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,919
already repeated this a bit so

808
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:31,200
i'm just going to close highlighting the

809
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,480
three things one of them is the

810
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:33,440
collaboration between the three

811
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,600
departments the second one is making

812
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:38,080
sure that you incorporate uh all of

813
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,039
these

814
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:40,880
analysis into a process because if there

815
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,799
is no process and you can't repeat it

816
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:44,640
and it's not systematic then you're

817
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:47,120
still stuck in the same difficulty once

818
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,279
there's an insulin response and finally

819
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:51,279
awareness which is basically

820
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:52,559
well

821
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:54,159
please if you find this interesting if

822
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:55,279
you're passionate about this type of

823
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:57,360
analysis if you can help us pass a word

824
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,360
and try to make sure that more people

825
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,720
try to come up with these frameworks and

826
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:01,840
and with better ways to make the

827
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,760
systematic so that you can actually do

828
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:06,000
an analysis uh you know at a higher

829
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,640
levels we're going to be super happy and

830
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:09,840
of course make sure that within your

831
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,279
organization that is something that is

832
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:12,799
taking place

833
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:15,360
and that is all for me now

834
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,720
thanks a lot this is the actual team

835
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,400
that wasn't there you're going to meet

836
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,600
at least a couple of them in the
