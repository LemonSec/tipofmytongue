1
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:07,200
how many of you

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,360
believe certified products are

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,000
unhackable

4
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:13,679
and

5
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:16,400
how many of you take this as a challenge

6
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,279
to go hack them

7
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:20,800
so

8
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,080
what is the point of certified products

9
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,080
i'll be talking about

10
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,960
the role of product certification

11
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,800
in the overall ics

12
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,399
security posture

13
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:35,120
and also how standards based product

14
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,559
certification

15
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:37,520
can be

16
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,600
the driving force for secure by design

17
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,000
products

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:42,719
the

19
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:44,800
the current product certification that

20
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,600
are available are based on the isa iec

21
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,719
62443 standards

22
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:53,680
so we will take a quick look at

23
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,920
those standards

24
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,120
you may have seen this graphic which you

25
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,120
know shows up every time you look up 62

26
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:04,080
443 there's quite a few documents here

27
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,119
and

28
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:06,960
you know sometimes we wonder where to

29
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,240
start and

30
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,200
which

31
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,159
little bobby captured really well some

32
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:13,600
time ago

33
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,479
so

34
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:15,600
here

35
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,920
you know the

36
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,799
asset owner is trying to request

37
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:23,200
support for 62 443 but doesn't know

38
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,640
where to start

39
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,640
so we we have to help

40
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,280
uh bobby's friend

41
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,320
so

42
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,479
when it comes to product certification

43
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:35,280
there are uh three

44
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,759
documents which are relevant and those

45
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:41,280
are 3-3 4-2 and 4-1

46
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,680
and we'll look at them quickly and

47
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,759
3-3 specifies the system requirements

48
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:51,040
so

49
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,960
this would apply to complete systems

50
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:56,320
like dcs systems safety systems and

51
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,640
even packaged control systems

52
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,880
then we have

53
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,759
4-2 which specify the technical

54
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:06,240
requirements for components or

55
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,679
individual devices like plcs rtus

56
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:12,640
network devices and also ot software

57
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,080
applications

58
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,879
and finally part 4-1

59
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:18,640
unlike the first two

60
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,560
covers the secure product development

61
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,840
life cycle for the product manufacturer

62
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,360
so

63
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,560
i i when i say manufacturer you know

64
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,280
it's i'm also talking about the vendor

65
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,440
or the supplier the standards use the

66
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,920
term supplier i prefer the term

67
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:39,519
manufacturer so part 4-1 is

68
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:42,640
is really important in my opinion and

69
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,480
we'll spend a little bit of time on this

70
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,440
later in the presentation

71
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,879
so

72
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:51,519
entities like isa compliance institute

73
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:54,000
or iski have developed

74
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,760
certification schemes

75
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,159
like ise secure and

76
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:01,280
under the isa secure

77
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,840
independent

78
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:06,080
labs go out and test products

79
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,599
for conformance to these requirements

80
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:11,840
and

81
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,640
when

82
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,440
a

83
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,159
an entity when an asset owner starts on

84
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:22,080
the journey of 62 to 62 443 one of the

85
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,799
first tasks or activities they perform

86
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:26,560
is risk assessment

87
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,680
and

88
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,519
typically this is done

89
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:31,200
and you know as recommended by the

90
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,239
standards is to divide the facility into

91
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:37,360
zones and conduits

92
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,840
once we have the zones and conduits we

93
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,560
go through the list of threats

94
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,200
analyze their impact and consequences

95
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,560
and the output of the risk assessment is

96
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,879
the target security level for that zone

97
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:55,439
the standard does not

98
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:57,360
exactly specify how

99
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,000
a target security level may be assigned

100
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,080
to a zone or conduit

101
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:02,879
so

102
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:05,519
there are a couple of ways of doing this

103
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:08,400
one is to use the concept of risk

104
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,000
reduction factor

105
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,120
very similar to functional safety where

106
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,879
the you know the goal is to bring down

107
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:17,440
the unmitigated risk down to the

108
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,959
tolerable risk

109
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:22,240
and the other approach is

110
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,800
to base it on the sl definitions from

111
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,120
the standard sl being security level

112
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,759
definitions from the standard

113
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:33,759
so how do we define security levels

114
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:36,639
a good definition of security level is

115
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:38,880
that it is the required

116
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,040
effectiveness of countermeasures and

117
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,840
inherent security properties of a device

118
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,600
or a system

119
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,520
and the standard or the 62443 standards

120
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,440
further define

121
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,800
security levels into four levels and

122
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,759
these are based on the the resources

123
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:59,759
skills and motivation of the threat

124
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,120
actor

125
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,680
so here we see the four levels so at

126
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,000
security level one

127
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,560
the protection is against casual and

128
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,720
coincidental violation

129
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,440
at security level 2 the protection is

130
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,440
from a threat actor with

131
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,639
low resources generic skills at level 3

132
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:20,880
the threat actor has

133
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,360
moderate resources and

134
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,720
specific skills and at four

135
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,440
you know there is extended resources ics

136
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,360
sorry high motivation and very

137
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,479
sophisticated means

138
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,800
there are three types of security levels

139
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,240
depending on the context and the

140
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,600
application

141
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,000
target security level as we have seen is

142
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,520
the desired security level of a zone

143
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,080
um or a conduit and this is the output

144
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,080
of the risk assessment so this is where

145
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,080
we want to be

146
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:57,199
achieved is where we are so this is the

147
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:59,440
actual security level of the zone or

148
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,160
conduit and this includes in addition to

149
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,080
the control system

150
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,400
security level or security capabilities

151
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,800
it also includes the organizational and

152
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,759
physical security measures

153
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:13,680
and finally we have the capability

154
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,720
security level which is what the product

155
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,160
you know the components and systems

156
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,440
provide

157
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:23,039
when properly configured and

158
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:26,639
without any additional countermeasures

159
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:29,520
so the idea is to have

160
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,360
the output of the risk assessment is the

161
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,720
target sls or target security levels

162
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,600
to

163
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,080
then take the control system

164
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,319
features and which are basically the

165
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:42,720
capability sls and try and meet the

166
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,240
targeted cells

167
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,280
so

168
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,240
and

169
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,560
by by configuring them properly and also

170
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,039
applying the organizational measures on

171
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:52,240
top of that

172
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,639
so by the end of this exercise hopefully

173
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:56,000
the achieved

174
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,240
security levels would be

175
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,840
equal or

176
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,840
greater than the target security level

177
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,120
now this

178
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,120
probably sounds pretty straightforward

179
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,520
but we have to be careful when it comes

180
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:13,360
to the selection or assignment of target

181
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,840
security

182
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,599
levels so

183
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:20,479
basing the security level just on the

184
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:22,560
perceived threat or threat actor

185
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,360
resources you know may not be enough

186
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,240
because

187
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,919
threat actors and threat director

188
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:30,240
resources change over time you know as

189
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,319
we have seen

190
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:33,199
and

191
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:34,639
so it's it's really important to

192
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:35,680
understand

193
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,800
what security measures are being

194
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,360
provided at different security levels

195
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,639
because when we

196
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:45,199
you know go out and procure a certified

197
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:47,039
product at a certain level

198
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:49,360
you are getting security measures for

199
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,240
that

200
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,479
security level only

201
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:54,240
so it's it's it's critical to look at

202
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,680
the requirements

203
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,199
from the 3-3 and 4-2

204
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:00,000
as

205
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,720
these are what are directly translated

206
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,800
into the security measures

207
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,440
of the certified product

208
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,440
so we have to ask you know while the

209
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,800
while we are assigning the target

210
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,199
security level ask questions like you

211
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:16,319
know do we need authentication of our

212
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:17,840
you know incoming connections to our

213
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,400
control system do we need pki based

214
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,240
security and so on

215
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,520
and

216
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,800
the

217
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,199
certified products have been assessed to

218
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:31,280
conform to these requirements so

219
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,200
ins you know one of the ways is

220
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,120
obviously to you know list out all the

221
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,719
requirements go through them and pick

222
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:39,120
the ones you want and then

223
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,120
you know try and achieve the security

224
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,080
level

225
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,000
so um

226
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,560
to simplify this process

227
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,200
what we can do and as i will show in a

228
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,839
minute is that we can develop a tool

229
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:54,399
where it will help you pick the target

230
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:57,200
security level so the

231
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,519
the tool basically has

232
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:02,240
abstracted the requirements and

233
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,720
rewarded them into simple security

234
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,720
measures so that you can use them during

235
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,399
the risk assessment

236
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:12,480
so this is the tool and

237
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,440
let's

238
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,920
play the video for this

239
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,480
so here you see that

240
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,399
up up here is the component type because

241
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:22,160
the 4-2

242
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,240
supports different component types and

243
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,320
different specific requirements for the

244
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,920
component types

245
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,640
and this is where the tool will will

246
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,959
suggest or recommend the security level

247
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:34,720
and these are the capabilities or

248
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,279
basically the the security measures

249
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,760
which have been taken from the actual

250
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,920
requirements from the standards so these

251
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,160
are more you know these are simplified

252
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,440
ones so let's say we want to use

253
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,360
identification and authentication of

254
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,959
human users

255
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:53,760
so once we check that we the target

256
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,160
security level goes up to one

257
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,880
let's say we want authorization as well

258
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,240
and

259
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,079
still one

260
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:04,079
whereas if you want to map the

261
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:06,240
permissions to roles

262
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,800
the sl jumps to two

263
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,440
and um let's add multi-factor

264
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,120
authentication because

265
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,880
you know that seems to be the trend and

266
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,320
for a good reason

267
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,360
so then we have sl3

268
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,880
and

269
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,680
up here uh are the actual

270
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,600
number of requirements at each security

271
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,240
level because you know i have grouped

272
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,399
them grouped the common ones with the

273
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:32,959
same security level under the same

274
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:34,480
capability

275
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,839
so if i

276
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:38,320
select public key authentication

277
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,320
the sl2

278
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,640
will jump from one to eight because

279
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,720
there were really seven

280
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,560
requirements under that

281
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,519
and finally just to show a dual approval

282
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:52,320
for human users would need a security

283
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,200
level for product

284
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,600
what is behind this is a simple

285
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,200
spreadsheet which is b sorry uh which is

286
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,920
basically the

287
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,959
requirements from the 62 443 4-2 in this

288
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:10,640
case um

289
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,880
you know copy paste exactly the same

290
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,440
and in this column here

291
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,760
i have sort of extracted them into

292
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,800
simpler

293
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,720
and rewarded them into simpler measures

294
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,680
and these are the applicable sls

295
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,320
so it's a pretty

296
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,720
simple tool you know nothing

297
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,880
i guess fancy or scientific about this

298
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,880
but this is something which can

299
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:36,160
be helpful when you are

300
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,760
coming up with your target security

301
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,519
levels for your zones

302
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:42,160
and and this could be an answer for you

303
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,680
know our little bobby's friend

304
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:46,959
okay

305
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:47,839
um

306
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,600
let's

307
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,000
so now that we have seen the

308
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,480
security levels and and their importance

309
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,680
and uh

310
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:56,399
how

311
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,240
you know their selection will actually

312
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,959
define the controls we get

313
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:02,160
you may

314
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,079
wonder you know what about

315
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:05,040
uh

316
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,160
you know if

317
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:09,279
we haven't even started on 62 443 or you

318
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:12,000
know we are a brownfield facility or can

319
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,040
i just say that a certified product is

320
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:18,480
better than uncertified in general

321
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,160
i would say yes

322
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,440
and

323
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,079
here are the reasons why in the next few

324
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:26,479
slides

325
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:28,639
you know in addition to the advantages

326
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:30,880
we will see in couple of slides

327
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,600
the biggest advantage which i see is the

328
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,560
backing of secure development life cycle

329
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,519
assurance for certified products so this

330
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:41,440
is based on

331
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,399
if you recall part 4-1

332
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:46,480
so under this

333
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,399
assurance certification

334
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:49,200
the

335
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,920
product manufacturers development life

336
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:54,639
cycle processes are audited for

337
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:57,519
artifacts and some of the processes for

338
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:00,480
example are secure by design threat

339
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,959
modeling you know have they done code

340
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:05,839
reviews of their code do they do code

341
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:08,800
analysis do they do testing including

342
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,720
you know pen testing of their hardware

343
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,800
as well as

344
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,720
fuzzing of their protocols

345
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,959
all of that is reviewed as part of this

346
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:20,639
assurance certification

347
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:21,519
and

348
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:25,600
this is not a like a one-time

349
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,120
done deal

350
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,800
kind of a thing this is an ongoing

351
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,320
process

352
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,320
this certification requires

353
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,639
recertification every three years and

354
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:36,639
during that period

355
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,399
we go back and audit

356
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:40,800
you know how many vulnerabilities or

357
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,440
security issues were found

358
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,120
where they addressed in time where the

359
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,920
patches were released in time and so on

360
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,360
and

361
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,120
the the really important

362
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,800
point here is that

363
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:56,399
the sdla certification is a prerequisite

364
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:58,399
for the other two types which is the

365
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,839
system and components

366
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:02,560
so

367
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,720
you cannot have a product a certified

368
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,440
product without the manufacturer having

369
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,720
the sdla processes certified so even if

370
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,959
you were to get the lowest level of

371
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:16,160
certified product sl1 right which is

372
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,440
basically protection against

373
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,040
coincidental

374
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,279
violation you are still

375
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:24,399
being backed by sdla of the manufacturer

376
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:26,639
so this is huge and i think

377
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:27,440
uh

378
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,959
i'd like to just show you some more

379
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:32,880
of the requirements from the standards

380
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,040
straight from the standards

381
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,880
screenshots from 4-1 so in this case

382
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,560
this says

383
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,880
the security requirements of externally

384
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,040
provided components so basically

385
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:48,079
managing the supply chain risk here so

386
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:50,399
think of log 4j

387
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:52,480
you probably have seen

388
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,320
an interview with one of the ics you

389
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,880
know major vendors of ics products

390
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,279
who went on record to say that because

391
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:01,360
they use sdla

392
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,959
they were able to

393
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:05,120
relatively quickly

394
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,360
figure out that whether or not log they

395
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,600
had dependencies on log4j

396
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,120
you know whereas the others were you

397
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,600
know trying to scramble and find

398
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,680
that if that was the case

399
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,920
this next one is

400
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,560
the development environment security so

401
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:23,920
the manufacturer has to protect

402
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,680
the development environment while the

403
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,519
product is being developed

404
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:29,680
now in this case imagine solar winds

405
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:30,880
attack

406
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,000
right

407
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:32,959
and

408
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:34,880
the

409
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,279
product manufacturer has to have a

410
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:40,079
process in place to receive security

411
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:43,440
notifications and also to track those

412
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,959
issues to closure

413
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:45,920
and

414
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:46,880
once

415
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,600
you know they have been found

416
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,600
they are obliged to disclose this to

417
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,279
their users and also provide timely

418
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:57,759
delivery of security patches now this

419
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:00,079
timely delivery you know you know 90

420
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:03,759
days is being thrown over there but this

421
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:05,759
is something that they can

422
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:08,079
define themselves but the the point is

423
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:09,440
that they have to stick to that once

424
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,720
they have defined that point

425
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:16,639
and finally you know this 130 plus such

426
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:18,480
requirements but just the last one i

427
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,560
would like to share is the security

428
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:23,360
hardening guidelines and

429
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,680
this is something that the manufacturer

430
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,040
has to provide

431
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,360
to the end users so that

432
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,360
the product is

433
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,720
can be

434
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,880
deployed configured and operated

435
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,959
securely

436
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:39,759
so now to summarize the overall benefits

437
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:43,920
of certification to asset owners

438
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:47,120
obviously the adoption of the certified

439
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,440
products will help in the adoption of 62

440
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,199
443 standards

441
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:54,000
so this aids in the risk assessment this

442
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,199
aids in

443
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:56,800
you know in

444
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,199
logically dividing your facility into

445
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:02,160
zones and conduits and coming up with

446
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,559
target security levels

447
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:06,319
it also helps in the generation of

448
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:08,240
specifications

449
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,319
which in turn

450
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:13,359
streamlines the procurement process and

451
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:15,679
um again you might you may have heard of

452
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:19,199
a you know major oil and gas company

453
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:21,280
testifying to this saying that their

454
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,280
procurement their procurement process

455
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,679
was was significantly improved because

456
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:27,599
of this

457
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:28,720
and

458
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,880
certified products reduce

459
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,440
fat and sat testing time because the

460
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,039
inbuilt features you know you don't have

461
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:37,840
to test them those have been tested by

462
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,200
the labs

463
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,799
and

464
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:41,679
again

465
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:44,400
you know i don't tire saying that

466
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,559
the there is the assurance that the

467
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:48,880
product was developed using the secure

468
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,640
development life cycle

469
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:53,280
and and finally

470
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,200
it provides an independent verification

471
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,360
of the the claims that the manufacturer

472
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,720
has made

473
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,880
there's one more bullet which i haven't

474
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,960
i don't have it here which is the

475
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,679
post deployment assessment of your 62

476
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:07,679
443 facility

477
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:08,640
the

478
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,679
2-2 security program rating

479
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:14,400
will be immensely you know simplified

480
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,600
when using

481
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,559
certified products

482
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:19,679
so

483
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:21,679
now let's look at some of the the

484
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:24,480
misapplications of certified products so

485
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,360
first one is the improper selection of

486
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,200
target security levels

487
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,880
so this is something

488
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,200
you know we spoke about it's

489
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:36,320
really important to to fine tune

490
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,120
the

491
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,559
process here

492
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:39,440
else

493
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,440
you know you may end up with a lower

494
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,840
security level and then adding on

495
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,679
you know several compensating

496
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:47,760
countermeasures to that or on the other

497
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,600
side you might you might

498
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,080
you know spend too much money for

499
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,000
a higher security level

500
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,080
whereas the risk may not warrant that

501
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,760
much

502
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:58,640
then

503
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,520
the

504
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,919
uh improper application of security

505
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:02,880
levels

506
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:06,480
so slc is the the capability security

507
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,679
level and it's not equal to the achieved

508
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:12,799
security level just because you have

509
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:15,760
uh is let's say sl3 product

510
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,919
it doesn't make the zone sl3 it still

511
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:19,840
has to be deployed

512
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,240
operated and maintained

513
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:25,039
and in and all of that comes through the

514
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:27,200
application of your organizational

515
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,559
policies and procedures on top of that

516
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:33,120
and assuming that you know certified is

517
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,840
unhackable you know obviously this is uh

518
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:36,960
not true

519
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:37,679
so

520
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:38,960
you

521
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:42,160
i you know i i repeat myself but you get

522
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,039
what

523
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:44,640
you select so

524
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,280
depending on the the select the security

525
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,440
level that you have selected

526
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:52,880
that is the the security that you get

527
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:55,120
so don't assume that just because you

528
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,360
have a sl1 product

529
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:00,640
you are uh secure

530
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,360
and assuming that on the other hand that

531
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,280
you know dismissing certified products

532
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,240
saying oh well you know anybody can send

533
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,559
modbus commands to my plc

534
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:13,120
is also not correct because depending on

535
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:16,240
the security level not everyone can send

536
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:20,200
modbus commands to the plc

537
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,360
so

538
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,840
certified product is no silver bullet

539
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,360
always

540
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,840
implement defense in depth

541
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,159
and

542
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:32,320
some areas of improvement and call to

543
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,520
action

544
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:36,240
so before i jump into this

545
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:39,200
s4 and especially stage 2 has been

546
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,200
the platform or launch pad for several

547
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,559
good things and

548
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:44,240
top 20

549
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,360
secure

550
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,919
plc coding practices was one of them

551
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:50,240
which is you know

552
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,799
really an awesome achievement and

553
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:54,720
i recommend all of you to go check them

554
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,880
out i believe they are

555
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,039
here on thursday

556
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:00,840
and

557
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:04,400
so what are the things we can improve um

558
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,679
awareness

559
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:08,000
of certified products and standards in

560
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,520
general

561
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,679
use cases and success stories are

562
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:12,880
missing

563
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,880
so although there are document

564
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,440
placeholders in the standards for

565
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,520
implementation and use cases

566
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,440
those are you know those have been a

567
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,559
work in

568
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:25,760
progress for a long time

569
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,840
i must thank dale for giving me the

570
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,679
opportunity although you know i had to

571
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:32,159
bother him a couple of times

572
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:33,200
and

573
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,159
security level definitions you know

574
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:38,080
the current definitions which are based

575
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,240
on threat actor resources

576
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,400
may have to be re-examined

577
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,120
and instead looked at basing it on risk

578
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,840
and consequence

579
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:49,200
and

580
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,400
this point here there is a valid

581
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,400
confusion

582
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,520
and

583
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,559
i guess

584
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:59,520
question about authentication support by

585
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,880
4-2

586
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,080
so

587
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,559
the requirement is

588
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:06,799
the intent is there in the standards and

589
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:08,480
isa is secure

590
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,960
it's just not worded very explicitly but

591
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:14,080
this is something that is being changed

592
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,760
right now

593
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:18,799
but it does support that

594
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:20,080
so

595
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,559
paid access to standards you know can be

596
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:23,280
an

597
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:26,880
impediment for adoption so

598
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,120
one of the things that

599
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,120
you know as a workaround would be to

600
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:34,480
join the effort right if you join isa 99

601
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,480
committee as a volunteer

602
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,480
uh you get access to the standards you

603
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:41,360
can also become a member of isa

604
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:44,240
and get the access to the standards

605
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,080
these standards

606
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,080
are all

607
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,400
developed by volunteers like you and me

608
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,280
and this is something we

609
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,640
especially from the asset owner

610
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,640
community we we lack

611
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,960
participation and i highly encourage you

612
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,960
to get involved

613
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,640
and

614
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:05,039
there's the lack of certified products

615
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:07,200
at higher security levels

616
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,799
now this could be because of the

617
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:10,960
stringent requirements which you know

618
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:14,240
which is the case but it's also because

619
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,400
i believe there is there has to be

620
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,080
demand for these

621
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,400
so you as an asset owner community have

622
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,600
to demand

623
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,400
for

624
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,799
secure by design products i think it's

625
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:26,400
been

626
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,280
a very long time that we have

627
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,320
spent

628
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,799
time and energy trying to protect the

629
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:36,400
fragile house of ics from the outside so

630
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,400
it's time now to strengthen the house

631
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,520
itself

632
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,640
and

633
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:43,200
demand products with security designed

634
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,720
in

635
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:45,520
so

636
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:48,559
as we saw dale mentioned earlier today

637
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:51,440
this has you know been called for for a

638
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:54,159
very long time so this

639
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:55,440
is

640
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:59,679
dale in 2013 almost 10 years ago

641
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:02,080
and

642
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:06,320
this is almost 20 years ago

643
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,480
thank you and if you have any questions

644
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,400
i can take them and and please use the

645
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,080
mic so that the questions are also

646
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:15,500
recorded in the video

647
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:22,799
[Applause]

648
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:26,720
yes hi my name is aslam from mitre

649
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:29,200
this question is because you are part of

650
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,880
fm i

651
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:33,200
just wanted to find out

652
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,400
have you

653
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,960
what is your observation regarding

654
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:40,559
a request or from the vendor side

655
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:42,799
how many of them are asking or

656
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:45,679
implementing authentication into the

657
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:48,400
real-time system embedded system

658
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:51,360
so what is your observation um working

659
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,200
in fm in this regard

660
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,559
so um

661
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:57,120
okay there is obviously there is a very

662
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,960
clear

663
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,600
need for this and the vendors are aware

664
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,840
of this as well

665
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:06,799
so most of the newer plc manufacturers

666
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:08,080
for example

667
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:08,960
have

668
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:11,520
started implementing this especially you

669
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,200
know the certificates based

670
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,640
authentication

671
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,440
so

672
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,080
we are seeing this more and more

673
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,159
yeah

674
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:21,360
i think the the

675
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,799
the need has

676
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:24,960
been identified and the vendors know

677
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,240
about it

678
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,200
yeah

679
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,200
yes

680
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,159
what about standard 2-4

681
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:35,760
so standard 2-4 is for

682
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:38,000
systems integrators and you know

683
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,080
maintenance and operations

684
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,480
that is something the

685
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,799
uh it obviously it doesn't come directly

686
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:47,120
under product certification but

687
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:50,880
isa secure is also uh in it

688
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:54,320
in its roadmap has identified that as as

689
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:58,320
a future certification of that

690
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,120
yeah

691
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,159
okay

692
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:02,799
um khalid nice opposition yes yeah

693
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:04,880
waiting ready we're in stereo

694
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:05,919
um

695
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:07,200
you seem to work for an insurance

696
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,200
company yeah and know a lot about cyber

697
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,640
and ot

698
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,880
uh is there a business case if you're

699
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:15,200
inside of an asset owning company

700
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,080
uh

701
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:19,360
to and that hasn't yet adopted

702
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,760
the standard is the is there a business

703
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,679
case that you can make like if we are

704
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:25,679
able to show significant compliance or

705
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:28,240
conformance to some of these standards

706
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,120
uh

707
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,440
our insurers or others maybe certain

708
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,799
partners also

709
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:34,640
will uh will give us credit there will

710
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,080
be a way of

711
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:38,159
paying for basically some of these

712
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:40,240
efforts is that happening in the world

713
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,400
is it happening in your world

714
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,559
so

715
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,919
that's a good question and um in general

716
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:49,760
yes

717
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:51,600
anything that will

718
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,919
lower the risk for the insurer

719
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:55,200
it's

720
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,840
obviously it's uh you know encouraged

721
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,200
and

722
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,520
when it comes to adoption of standards

723
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,919
and adoption of certified products this

724
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:07,600
is something then it's very concrete

725
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,840
measure that the asset owner is taking

726
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:10,640
and

727
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:13,200
this is definitely going to to reflect

728
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,799
in the

729
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:16,480
in the insurance okay so just a quick

730
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:19,279
follow-on since the ones over there

731
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:21,279
so you could describe what you're doing

732
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:22,799
to a cfo

733
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:24,720
and say we are going to i'm recommending

734
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:25,520
we

735
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,440
uh increasingly comply with security

736
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,039
level two and then work towards three

737
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:31,039
and some day four and this is what it's

738
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:33,840
going to cost in terms of uh money and

739
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,679
people and technology for us to get

740
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:37,760
there over the next couple years right

741
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,919
that could be compelling

742
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:42,880
to the to the chief financial officer

743
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:45,120
yes and and um as you mentioned in your

744
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,640
first question you can always tie this

745
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:47,679
back to

746
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:49,679
you know the insurance as well right how

747
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:51,760
this would affect the insurance of the

748
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,679
facility okay

749
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:56,399
all right thank you you're welcome

750
00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:58,240
yes

751
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,720
hi good afternoon thank you talk

752
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,440
my name is bill johnson and we are a

753
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:08,000
vendor supplier to the industry okay and

754
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,240
we just completed our second year for

755
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,200
the

756
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:14,640
sock for supply chain audit and that

757
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:17,440
costs a lot of money to do

758
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:20,559
then there's cmmc certification right

759
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:23,120
and people want to map technologies to

760
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:26,000
the nist 800 framework or the cyber

761
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,520
security framework

762
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,760
and now you want a certification as well

763
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:32,240
i could spend all my my time and our

764
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,320
engineers time and

765
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,720
all of our resources

766
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:39,679
being certified by all of the various

767
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:42,000
agencies or right

768
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,520
folks that come about and say hey look

769
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,440
we have all these requirements for you

770
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,600
to go meet

771
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,919
how is this better different

772
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:51,760
and how is it going to help our

773
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:54,240
customers if i'm already certified in

774
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:57,520
one or more of these other frameworks

775
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:59,760
and certifications

776
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,679
how do i justify spending money to go

777
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:04,080
this route and we are by the way members

778
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:08,000
of the isa issa community okay thank you

779
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,399
for the question now that's a fair point

780
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:11,600
and um

781
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,840
so

782
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:16,000
the

783
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,279
sdla for example

784
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:21,200
these are the practices that you would

785
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,240
have

786
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,240
for secure development of your products

787
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,960
anyway right regardless or you should

788
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:27,840
be

789
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,600
anyway regardless of whether you're

790
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:32,159
looking for an isa secure certification

791
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:33,520
or something else

792
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,120
so so

793
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,720
these standards that you mentioned and

794
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:39,679
the frameworks will have a lot of things

795
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:40,799
in common

796
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:42,159
and

797
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:43,520
hopefully that

798
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:44,399
by

799
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:46,240
adding some more

800
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,919
additional requirements you know it's

801
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:50,720
not too much of a burden and

802
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,559
hopefully the you know the customers are

803
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:55,919
willing to offset that for you so

804
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:57,760
obviously when we spend money on this

805
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:00,000
kind of stuff you know that has to be

806
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,480
rolled back into development costs and

807
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,919
marketing costs and that kind of thing

808
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:04,720
so

809
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:05,520
um

810
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,919
if i'm certified with a sock for supply

811
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:09,440
chain audit

812
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:12,320
how many of those requirements

813
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:14,320
can be accepted

814
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:17,840
by the issa community in other words we

815
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:20,240
not have to test for those again

816
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:22,240
not have to get re-certified for stuff

817
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,480
that's already certified or do you guys

818
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,640
just simply say no we don't trust the

819
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,880
the work that those guys are no no

820
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:31,600
that's not the case actually in fact um

821
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:35,200
there is a big overlap between um

822
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,159
there's a big overlap uh between the

823
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:41,399
61 508 certification and

824
00:30:41,399 --> 00:30:43,520
62443 so

825
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,360
their software

826
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,840
management or development practices we

827
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:51,120
do give credit for those uh so so it

828
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,640
doesn't have to be everything has to be

829
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:55,279
from scratch

830
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,799
the the credit will be given where you

831
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:01,039
know it's due

832
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:03,039
okay i think that's all

833
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:07,480
the time we have for thank you
