1
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,200
all right

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,639
so containerized control systems

3
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:12,080
uh we have a lot of goals for this

4
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,679
session i'm going to kind of try to jump

5
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:15,200
right in here because we do have pretty

6
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,960
short time but first i want to say i had

7
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:18,960
a couple of polls leading up to this and

8
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,160
i was a little bit surprised about the

9
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,519
results uh so 25 there abouts of

10
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:25,840
respondents said they're already using a

11
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,840
containerized control system

12
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,439
but the vast majority of respondents

13
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:31,279
said they're a beginner in containerized

14
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:33,520
technology so if you're wondering about

15
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,280
the relevance of this session i think

16
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:36,320
those numbers kind of speak for

17
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,000
themselves right there

18
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,079
what we're going to try to do here our

19
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:42,559
goals is really cover what the benefits

20
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:44,480
and you know the cons and that of

21
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,800
containerized control systems are

22
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,360
um how vendors are in either better or

23
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,120
worse conditions to support owner and

24
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,320
operators

25
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,480
and if they can be you know less

26
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,160
transparent about what they're giving is

27
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,840
containerized control systems the new

28
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,079
black box right

29
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:02,000
and if effective methods really exist

30
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,400
for monitoring the security and

31
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,438
uh

32
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:07,280
you know controlling what we see in

33
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,760
those containerized systems at the end

34
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,479
of this my goal is that that owner and

35
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:13,600
operator should be able to look at this

36
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,040
and go well should they embrace or

37
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,640
should they resist containerized ics

38
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,000
so what does a containerized control

39
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,159
system look like

40
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:23,520
we still have the traditional field

41
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,119
devices you know your plcs your

42
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:26,640
intelligent devices they're all still

43
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,600
out there

44
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,360
the big difference is in the data center

45
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,000
at the scada level systems uh so in in

46
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,680
the containerized system we have a

47
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,320
cluster uh the cluster contains all of

48
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,320
these different components so no longer

49
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,920
are we on the traditional bare metal

50
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,079
we're not even really on the vms we

51
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:43,920
exist in this kind of hyper-converged

52
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,159
infrastructure that has a cluster of a

53
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:48,000
whole bunch of containers that can be

54
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,079
created and destroyed in an instant

55
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:51,840
based on what our needs are

56
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,960
those containers can contain things like

57
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,360
operator interfaces the scada based

58
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,479
system your protocol gateways

59
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:01,840
all of your logging systems your

60
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,840
databases service buses for

61
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,200
communication between all of those

62
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,880
different components

63
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,598
your security components can be in there

64
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:10,878
and then there's things like sidecars

65
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:12,480
which we might get into a little bit if

66
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,119
we have time

67
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,879
so our operational concerns

68
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:21,040
the

69
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,720
nature of

70
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,200
containers is that they're disposable

71
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,120
they are created essentially to be

72
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,360
destroyed uh they can be created on

73
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,440
demand they can be destroyed on demand

74
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,840
they can crash and be re be replaced

75
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,720
with a new clone very quickly but that

76
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,879
disposable nature is not necessarily

77
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:42,239
compatible with the mission critical

78
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:44,879
systems that we have in a scada type

79
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:48,400
system or any ics control system

80
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,360
so

81
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,280
these systems containerized systems were

82
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,519
originally designed for availability

83
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:56,080
over reliability

84
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,720
in our world reliability really matters

85
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,319
so we have to make sure that we

86
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:01,440
implement

87
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,760
control systems in a way that are highly

88
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,120
reliable

89
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,800
so this can this can be done with

90
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,200
contain containerized technology but

91
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,720
it's very important that it be done

92
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,319
right

93
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:13,519
one of the biggest challenges that we

94
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:14,959
see that i'm going to talk about again

95
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:16,080
and again and again throughout this

96
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,080
presentation is the continuity of

97
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,760
containers data

98
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,000
so if you have containers that are

99
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,519
coming into existence and going out of

100
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:25,680
existence what happens to the data in

101
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,760
the phase in between is there

102
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,840
appropriate overlap does that data get

103
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,760
transferred correctly or does it get

104
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,599
lost

105
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:35,200
one of the last big challenges is the

106
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,720
increased complexity of this

107
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,040
architecture i mean this is leagues

108
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,200
ahead of something like bare metal base

109
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,560
data systems

110
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,120
so being able to manage and maintain

111
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,640
them is very fundamental it's key

112
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,560
impacts of these concerns

113
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,480
so that typical container lifespan could

114
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,879
be seconds minutes hours it's not

115
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:57,519
generally days weeks years that being

116
00:03:57,519 --> 00:03:59,200
said containers can persist for pretty

117
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,879
long periods of time but it's not

118
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:02,879
necessarily their design

119
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:04,640
the persistence of data again i'm going

120
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,720
to harp on this over and over again

121
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,239
is really important between that

122
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:09,840
container end of life and the

123
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,439
reincarnation

124
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:13,599
generally speaking if a new container is

125
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:15,920
stood up before the other container dies

126
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,358
there's a moment of time in which you

127
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:19,759
can transfer data ensure that there's a

128
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,320
nice smooth handoff of power but if a

129
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,639
container crashes and a new one has to

130
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,880
be spun up to take its place how do you

131
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,520
ensure that no data is lost in between

132
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,040
that that process

133
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,400
now it comes down to persistent

134
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,800
databases your data can't be handled by

135
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,240
the individual containers they have to

136
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,680
be handled by specialized databases that

137
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,600
have persistent data and all of the

138
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,199
containers can reach out to that to get

139
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,759
the information they need

140
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:47,759
you need centralized oversight

141
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:49,600
orchestration is very key in a

142
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,919
containerized space inside of the

143
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:53,600
container they create their own virtual

144
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,759
networks that are changing constantly as

145
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:57,759
the containers change and move and shift

146
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:58,720
around

147
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,639
the network is rebuilt and redesigned

148
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:02,639
constantly without good orchestration

149
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:04,080
those networks can become incredibly

150
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,080
messy and can lead to dropped packets

151
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,600
now we're only talking a few packets

152
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,000
here not massive amounts of data and in

153
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,919
the i.t world we see that sometimes they

154
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:14,000
just don't care data gets retransmitted

155
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,840
it's no big deal as everyone in this

156
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,720
room knows in ics that can be a critical

157
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,880
impact if we start to lose data

158
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,639
even just a few packets here and there

159
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:23,919
so we have to have really good

160
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:26,240
orchestration in the containers

161
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,479
in the clusters to ensure that we don't

162
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:30,400
have messy networks that lead to dropped

163
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,520
packets

164
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,960
last big impact because of that

165
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,800
complexity you need to have personnel

166
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,320
that have the skill and knowledge

167
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,160
required to be able to maintain and

168
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,000
support these and do the monitoring

169
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,840
appropriately you're going to find a lot

170
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:42,960
of folks out there that are familiar

171
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,080
with containers they're not new

172
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,039
technology they're new ish but there's a

173
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:49,120
they're used widely it's all over the

174
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,160
place

175
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,360
you're not going to find a lot of people

176
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,080
that have ics specialized knowledge and

177
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,080
also container specialized knowledge

178
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,000
it's a relatively rare breed although it

179
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,560
is growing

180
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,560
so the operational benefits the cool

181
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,880
stuff

182
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,000
probably one of the single biggest

183
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
benefits and one of the main reasons

184
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,440
that we are seeing a move in this

185
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,759
direction that's being supported by

186
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:13,919
owner operators not just by vendors is

187
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:16,080
that you can have rolling updates

188
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,840
so you can have security patching to a

189
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,000
live system without downtime so it's no

190
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,080
longer that take your plant offline once

191
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,160
a year and do all of your security

192
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,800
updates all of your software updates and

193
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,319
any of your feature enhancements they

194
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:31,039
can now be rolled to a live system

195
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:33,600
it is critical when you're doing this to

196
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,199
be able to test it so one of the things

197
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:36,479
that you must have if you're going to

198
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,800
switch to a containerized control system

199
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,039
is a test bed a replica of your

200
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:42,960
production system that allows you to

201
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,960
test all of your security patches all of

202
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,400
your updates all of your feature

203
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,960
enhancements before rolling them into

204
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,639
your production system

205
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:53,280
but if you do the testing appropriately

206
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,840
you can roll any update into a live

207
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:59,280
system without down time huge benefit

208
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,440
scada changes can also be rolled into

209
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,960
live environments but that is a whole

210
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,720
different talk it is incredibly

211
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,479
complicated and i would not recommend it

212
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:07,919
for any novice

213
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:09,120
so all those people that said they're

214
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,960
beginners in container technology on the

215
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,039
poll you don't want to roll scada

216
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:15,680
changes into uh into a live system uh

217
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,800
you want to make sure you know what

218
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,840
you're doing first it's it can be messy

219
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,000
another huge benefit and one of the

220
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,680
other main reasons we're seeing vendors

221
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,520
move towards this is dyn or not just

222
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,360
fenders sorry

223
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,960
owner operators moving towards this is

224
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,440
the dynamic scalability

225
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,560
so if you

226
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,560
have a very static manufacturing

227
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,440
facility let's say potatoes in chips out

228
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,039
you know recipe management system in

229
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:41,199
there a few machines this isn't really a

230
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:42,400
benefit for you and in fact

231
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,919
containerized control systems are

232
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:45,520
probably not the appropriate way for you

233
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,039
to go

234
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:49,680
this is really more geared towards

235
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,120
systems we see

236
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,960
where

237
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,280
they have changing demand so where i

238
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,520
come from in the energy utility industry

239
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,400
we're seeing

240
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,039
a huge move towards this in the

241
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:03,599
distributed energy resources you have

242
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:06,560
tons of devices all over the place some

243
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,759
small some large connecting to utilities

244
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:11,360
at varying rates

245
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,039
and they come either through aggregators

246
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:15,520
or through direct connects depending on

247
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,319
their size but it can change day to day

248
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:20,639
and it scales up over time so dynamic

249
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:22,479
scalability gives us a huge advantage in

250
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:23,520
this

251
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,680
we have the ability to

252
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,160
grow our system on demand more people

253
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,039
want to connect all right we spin up new

254
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:33,839
containers we have so replicas of the

255
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:35,760
same container right we can have as many

256
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,200
as we need up to our hardware

257
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,559
limitations

258
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,559
to match the demand

259
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,000
on demand

260
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,040
for each given connection and as those

261
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,959
connections die off for whatever reason

262
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:49,360
we can scale back down dedicate hardware

263
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,360
resources to other needs so when we're

264
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,959
managing our own data centers this is a

265
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:54,480
huge advantage

266
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,560
this is probably the number one reason

267
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,480
that we are seeing this movement in the

268
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,839
electrical utility industry is because

269
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:03,440
those of those of us in the utilities

270
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,120
that are being forced towards the

271
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,360
distributed energy resource management

272
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,320
systems

273
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,480
uh this is huge this is this is our main

274
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,959
benefit

275
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,920
so devops uh this was talked about a

276
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,360
little bit earlier today i was actually

277
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,399
glad this was brought up um

278
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:24,320
we are seeing a movement and and

279
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,320
certainly within the container space

280
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,320
this is almost exclusively the agile

281
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,440
development

282
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,279
method is followed

283
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:32,959
and and in this

284
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:35,519
we will see more iterative designs so

285
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:37,279
instead of the very traditional sense

286
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,519
where you buy the package you get the

287
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:41,360
package you test the package you install

288
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,440
it and you leave it alone for 10 years

289
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,440
we're not seeing that anymore

290
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,680
now it's you get this little piece and

291
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,680
you test it and you install it and you

292
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,959
get a new little piece and you test it

293
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:52,560
and you install it and so on and so

294
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,519
forth

295
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:55,680
this has some benefits certainly we've

296
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,279
seen improvements in reliability with

297
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:58,000
the

298
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,080
agile development method

299
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,160
you know you don't have to wait

300
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,640
years for your bug fixes anymore they

301
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:08,240
can be deployed in weeks or months

302
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,920
security updates can come a lot faster

303
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,399
so there are definitely benefits here

304
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:13,360
the

305
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,399
continuous development cycle

306
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:18,160
does have drawbacks though that we will

307
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,399
get into here in just a second

308
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:22,240
uh but you also get the regular feature

309
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,680
drops right so

310
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:26,880
huge benefit for for both the vendor and

311
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,120
for the owner operator

312
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,399
if another operator wants a new feature

313
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,160
they can request it and the vendors

314
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,839
usually have a method by which to get it

315
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:37,680
into the next iteration and you can

316
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:41,760
quickly have that iterative design

317
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:42,880
all right

318
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,279
so the benefits of the this vendor

319
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:46,800
support method

320
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,079
so the small

321
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:50,560
and continuous updates can be deployed

322
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,480
to a live system i've talked about this

323
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,240
a couple of times but

324
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,640
this is this is huge in a lot of senses

325
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,880
because no longer are you stuck with

326
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,880
the control system you bought until you

327
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,160
buy a new one

328
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,640
you can have continuous updates either

329
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,000
through software

330
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,959
security patches or features that can be

331
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:11,200
added at any point in time to your

332
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,399
product

333
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:15,519
and the feature requests are now no

334
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:18,000
longer a major update you can go to your

335
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,800
vendor and say hey i need this feature

336
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,079
and they can build it either into the

337
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:23,600
system as it is or they can actually

338
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,839
build it as effectively a bolt-on a new

339
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:28,240
container because the cluster can host

340
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,160
any number of containers

341
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,760
and if they

342
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,920
add a new container to that and they

343
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,920
update the orchestration they update the

344
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,600
communications bus

345
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,560
they can

346
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,720
have all of that merged together

347
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,880
and bolt in a new feature to your scada

348
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,200
system effectively on demand

349
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,279
and instead of talking about

350
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:49,200
you know possibly years to get new

351
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,399
features

352
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,480
some vendors could turn that around in

353
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,680
months

354
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:54,839
maybe even

355
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:57,519
less there is also lower development

356
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:00,000
costs incurred by the vendors typically

357
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,440
not universally

358
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,200
with this technology

359
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,200
and from what i've seen that does seem

360
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,959
seem to translate into more features and

361
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:08,320
functions that are available to owner

362
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,399
and operators i'd say that it translates

363
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:11,600
into a lower cost for owners run

364
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,800
operators but i i have not seen that yet

365
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,320
it is highly vendor dependent some

366
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,680
vendors are very much into this

367
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,519
technology some are

368
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:21,519
just looking at it now and some have

369
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:23,440
never looked at it

370
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,959
so there's there's a lot of variation

371
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,839
there now the other side of this

372
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:29,600
uh

373
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,000
the agile testing method

374
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
is an involved process like i said

375
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,399
earlier it's not just buy the thing test

376
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:38,320
the thing deploy the thing forget about

377
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,320
the thing it's

378
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,720
constant testing you have to have a test

379
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,800
bed you have to be testing every update

380
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,240
you have to be testing every software

381
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,360
patch every new feature they have to be

382
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,360
tested and then deployed test tested and

383
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,000
then deployed and over and over and over

384
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,639
so you have an endless testing process

385
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:58,720
which is a huge change a very big shift

386
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,800
from what we're traditionally used to

387
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:01,920
and that's something that has to be

388
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,160
planned for

389
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,160
most of these in fact everyone that i've

390
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,839
seen every control

391
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:09,760
containerized control system has a

392
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,519
significant amount of open source or

393
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:13,519
third-party technologies in it

394
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:16,079
not necessarily a bad thing it does add

395
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:18,240
some challenges though

396
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,079
because there's so many different

397
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:21,600
components that are all integrated

398
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,079
together to make these

399
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:26,800
management of it becomes complicated

400
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,480
you have to have

401
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,480
good monitoring systems to be able to

402
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:33,760
look at what's in the container and

403
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,440
appropriately

404
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,040
adjust and control

405
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,720
your updates to ensure that all of that

406
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,920
open source software which could be

407
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,920
hundreds of different packages

408
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,760
is all up to date has all of its

409
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,680
vulnerabilities and security patching

410
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,880
deployed

411
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,560
and that can be a challenge but there is

412
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,760
software to help with that which we'll

413
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,000
talk about here in just a bit

414
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,839
um the challenge that comes with that is

415
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:55,199
a large number of software update

416
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:56,560
sources

417
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,399
ideally your vendor should be providing

418
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,399
you all the updates for every open

419
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:02,000
source piece of package that they've

420
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,079
delivered in their product

421
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:06,800
but the reality is if you want to verify

422
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,720
that you have to go out to the different

423
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,480
sources of this open source software and

424
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,680
check for that

425
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,600
again there's there's packages that help

426
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,519
you manage that but it is something to

427
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:16,560
think about

428
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,000
so this makes your steady state look a

429
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,160
lot different uh and

430
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,519
change management really becomes your

431
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:23,519
friend when change is constant

432
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:25,519
it's really important to be able to

433
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:27,519
manage those changes know where you are

434
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:29,120
know where you're going so if you're

435
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,279
looking at constant change change

436
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:33,680
management is key

437
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:36,320
so what can hide inside of clusters

438
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,399
from the outside world clusters do kind

439
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:40,240
of look like a black box

440
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,480
and it's important to have

441
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,120
lots of visibility into them

442
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,519
first step on that is good contracts

443
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:49,199
you have to have stringent

444
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:50,560
cyber security requirements in your

445
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,800
contracts and i cannot emphasize this

446
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,560
enough you need to have software bills

447
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,079
and material you need to know what

448
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:57,600
you're getting delivered because of all

449
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,959
that open source because of the third

450
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:00,720
party applications that can be contained

451
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:03,040
in these and and are contained in these

452
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,120
it's highly important to get software

453
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,360
bills and material i know we're kind of

454
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,560
new to talking about that in this

455
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,800
industry but it is fundamental

456
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,360
you should not proceed without a good

457
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,440
software bill of material

458
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,880
visibility to those internals like i

459
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:17,680
said

460
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,680
externally from the cluster

461
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,360
they look a little bit like a black box

462
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,279
things go in things come out but what

463
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:25,839
happens inside from the outside view is

464
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:27,279
a little unclear

465
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:29,440
so it's it's really important to have

466
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,199
something inside of these clusters that

467
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:33,199
provide you with visibility

468
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:34,880
to what's going on

469
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,800
vulnerability management

470
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,279
huge huge here you gotta look at all the

471
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:41,040
software that's in there keep track of

472
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,920
all of it and have specialized container

473
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,519
vulnerability management systems that

474
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:47,680
can see inside the container see what's

475
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,480
installed and respond appropriately to

476
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:53,759
vulnerabilities when they're discovered

477
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:56,399
security solutions and practices

478
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:58,240
there is specialized software available

479
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,720
for containers that provide discovery

480
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,519
monitoring and protection

481
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:06,560
they are not like your typical

482
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,759
systems that you see outside the

483
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:09,360
container world although they serve the

484
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,639
same functions

485
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:12,480
they are installed within the container

486
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,759
i'm not here to plug any one vendor

487
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:15,040
there's actually quite a few of them out

488
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,519
there and they're all very good

489
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:19,040
they all have their pluses and minuses

490
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,959
but it depends on how you're using them

491
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:22,079
some of those things that they can do

492
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:24,240
that's really key is they do provide log

493
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:27,040
capture from inside the cluster and

494
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,880
deliver that to your sim outside of the

495
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,600
cluster and that is huge right because

496
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,199
you want to have that visibility into

497
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:34,959
the cluster itself

498
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:36,800
active enforcement is another big

499
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,079
component

500
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:39,440
i know active enforcement is not

501
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,360
necessarily always smiled upon in our

502
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,440
industry but i think that

503
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,440
while network active enforcement may be

504
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,040
turned off it's important to have

505
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,839
protection against things like rogue

506
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:50,880
containers a road container can be a

507
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,399
container that's been compromised and is

508
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:53,680
now doing something it's not supposed to

509
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,440
be doing or a container that's not even

510
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,399
supposed to be there to begin with

511
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:00,320
signed container images is another thing

512
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,839
enforced by these security tools that

513
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:03,360
goes right to that

514
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,039
this is also really important if you can

515
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:06,480
work with a vendor and they can sign

516
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,119
their images with us with a certificate

517
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:11,599
the security tools will not allow a

518
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:13,760
container to come into the cluster

519
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:17,039
unless it's cloned from a signed image

520
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:18,720
huge protection there i can't speak to

521
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,760
that one enough that is very key

522
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,760
in credential management what this

523
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,439
allows is that you can have identity

524
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:27,439
providers that are outside the cluster

525
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:29,120
managing the credentials inside the

526
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,320
cluster

527
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:33,360
you'll see a lot of delivered clusters

528
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,440
that have default credentials built into

529
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,640
them because you know that's how the

530
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,080
vendors run it they don't have an

531
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,760
identity management system like the

532
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,360
owner operator does

533
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,520
so the security solutions allow you to

534
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,039
integrate your existing identity

535
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:48,640
management system into the clusters and

536
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,559
all of the internal credentials which

537
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:52,640
are contained in them

538
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,240
inside the container credentials are

539
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,160
slightly different than outside but the

540
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,160
security tools help integrate them so

541
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,559
they're really not

542
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:03,280
and contrary to what some vendors might

543
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,200
tell you not everything needs to run as

544
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,679
root uh typically everything will be

545
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:09,200
delivered in the containers all

546
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,600
applications running as root and that

547
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,520
can usually be restricted to some level

548
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,880
it helps prevent things like road

549
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,559
containers because it's a lot harder to

550
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:18,160
compromise the

551
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,160
application to then compromise the

552
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,880
container that contains that application

553
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,720
the security tools that are out there

554
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,360
today are not ics specific uh that

555
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,880
that's important but it's not

556
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,640
necessarily critical

557
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,160
i have heard that there is movement

558
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,520
towards that direction from some of the

559
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,120
vendors and there may even be some i'm

560
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,799
not aware of but to my knowledge there

561
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:39,360
are none that are ics specific yet

562
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,320
and

563
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,679
we'll see when we get there

564
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:46,160
all right so should you embrace or

565
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:49,120
resist containerized ics

566
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,799
this is really the goal here and we had

567
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:52,640
a pretty short period of time so i'm

568
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,160
hoping we can get most folks there but

569
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,200
it's highly dependent on your

570
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,360
organization again if you're doing

571
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:00,000
potatoes in ships out this probably

572
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,160
isn't the right technology for you

573
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,799
if you're really struggling with like

574
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:06,480
virtualization and you don't want to go

575
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,160
that way if you're not looking at

576
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,440
already doing hyper-converged

577
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,480
infrastructure

578
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,840
then you probably don't want to make the

579
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,440
leap to containerization if you go

580
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,720
straight from bare metal to

581
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,400
containerization it's going to be a

582
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,200
painful move and i would strongly advise

583
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,240
against it

584
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,880
but you know to each their own um

585
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,320
so then

586
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,760
you have to really ask yourself if you

587
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,600
have the will desire and the personnel

588
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,360
to support it again as i mentioned

589
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,120
earlier this does take specialized

590
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,840
personnel to maintain to monitor to

591
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,080
manage if you don't have the people with

592
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,160
the skill set it's important to have

593
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,320
them first before you move to a

594
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,760
containerized system so if you're

595
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:42,880
looking at vendors that have a

596
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,799
containerized solution

597
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:46,080
and thinking about going that way if

598
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,240
you're part of that 25 that said yes you

599
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,080
have one and also part of that that

600
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,799
percent that said what is a container

601
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:54,480
it's very key to

602
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,480
make sure you have the personnel so

603
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,240
training is important here you can take

604
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,160
your ics people and you can train them

605
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:03,039
in container technology it's not some

606
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:05,520
super crazy out there technology that no

607
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,360
one's familiar with there's lots of

608
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,440
information available even just free

609
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,559
online

610
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:12,320
but it's important to have the people

611
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,840
who are willing

612
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,520
to support it and have the skills and

613
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,440
knowledge to do so

614
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,880
the other thing is do you already have

615
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,720
your own redundant data center or a

616
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,720
desire to build one

617
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,320
containerized control systems are not

618
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,919
something that lend themselves to being

619
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:27,919
ran on a single server on a rack

620
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:30,799
somewhere in a closet that never really

621
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:33,120
gets touched they run on racks and racks

622
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,360
and racks of servers and data centers if

623
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,039
you really want to have a good system

624
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:39,520
they need to be redundant data centers

625
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,440
container technology does lend itself to

626
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,960
redundancy quite well because you can

627
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,280
replace containers on a web

628
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,480
so

629
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,400
if you have redundant data centers or a

630
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,760
desire to build one it might be the

631
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,280
right way for you

632
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:54,240
and really as the individual

633
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,480
you know individual organization you

634
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,400
need to ask yourself if those benefits

635
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,559
really outweigh the risks right so is

636
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:03,120
scalability hugely important to you if

637
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:06,000
you don't scale then there's really no

638
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,720
need for containerized solutions unless

639
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,280
the other benefit of live updates is

640
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,400
what matters

641
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,559
the live updates is a huge benefit i

642
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:16,480
mean i don't want to beat around that

643
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:19,360
being able to roll security patches to a

644
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,440
system without downtime

645
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,840
is a game changer for this industry

646
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,440
and if we

647
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,200
see things continue to move in that

648
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,400
direction

649
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,559
then us as security professionals in the

650
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:33,760
ics world don't have to

651
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,520
worry about those patches that are a

652
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,360
year old that we haven't deployed yet

653
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,360
because we'll be able to put them into a

654
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,840
production system without downtime

655
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:44,960
that is a huge huge benefit and

656
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:47,280
one of the main drivers i think in the

657
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:50,640
acceptance of this technology

658
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,320
so with that

659
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:55,559
any questions

660
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,200
hey brian i really appreciated your talk

661
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,640
um

662
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:07,039
in your opening architecture slide

663
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:08,480
it looked like you

664
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,880
excuse me

665
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,480
it looked like you were

666
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,400
putting plc's to the side of the

667
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,799
containerization part

668
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:18,799
and you also mentioned be really careful

669
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:21,039
about trying to do scada

670
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:22,480
with containers

671
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,080
so i just wondered what are the sort of

672
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:26,000
like first use cases that you think make

673
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,799
sense for containerization in ics like

674
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:31,840
doing what to solve what problem yeah so

675
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,919
the stuff we're already seeing today

676
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:36,159
so the scada system itself can be

677
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:39,200
contained in containers

678
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,720
but typically we don't see the physical

679
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:44,240
i o in there uh virtual i o that's a

680
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,520
different conversation i've had with

681
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,039
some folks and and we'll see where that

682
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:48,720
goes uh

683
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,320
but some of the first use cases we're

684
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,400
seeing at least in my experience are in

685
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,799
the electric utility industry because we

686
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:57,039
have such scalability needs

687
00:22:57,039 --> 00:22:59,039
for our control systems so we're seeing

688
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:00,880
those distributed energy resource

689
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,840
management systems derms as we call them

690
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,360
appear in that because they're they're

691
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,600
largely scalable and that's our huge

692
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,400
benefit

693
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,600
but i think we're going to see more and

694
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,039
more i have talked to a few vendors

695
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:13,200
outside of that industry that are moving

696
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,120
towards this largely because it's it's

697
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,520
easy for them to develop new products

698
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,039
and because of those those rolling

699
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:20,799
updates um so i think we're going to

700
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:22,080
continue to see the movement towards

701
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,520
that direction

702
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:26,480
can i ask a follow-up question go for it

703
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,720
my follow-up question is like

704
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:31,600
is it data aggregation is it data

705
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,080
exfiltration is it

706
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,799
user interface stuff is it analytics

707
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:38,320
like what are the

708
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,559
things people are doing specifically

709
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:42,000
sure yeah

710
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,080
um so yes all of that uh

711
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,760
again this is relatively new technology

712
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,039
i was actually a little surprised that

713
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:50,960
25 of the respondents the pulse said

714
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,640
they're already using a containerized

715
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,279
ics i knew they were out there i'm

716
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:57,840
involved in some of them uh that was a

717
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:00,960
bigger response than i expected though

718
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,039
but yeah we're seeing a lot of that

719
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:05,279
deployed already

720
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:07,120
the traditional uses of containers right

721
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:10,080
are more in the i.t data centers

722
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,360
hosting

723
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:14,240
huge web applications that kind of stuff

724
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,400
in the in the control world

725
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:19,679
we're starting to see the movement of

726
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:22,480
these systems into containers

727
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,840
largely to support them i think i've

728
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,200
wandered off your question a little bit

729
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,159
so i apologize about that

730
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:32,039
thanks a lot yeah absolutely

731
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:35,679
you mentioned that the

732
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:37,279
uh container security software isn't

733
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:38,240
necessarily

734
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:41,520
ics specific yet what changes to those

735
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:42,880
uh systems do you think they would need

736
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:45,360
to make to make them ics specific yeah

737
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,360
absolutely great question um so a lot of

738
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,360
it's going to be protocol support right

739
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,159
so

740
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:52,159
one of the things that these

741
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:54,559
uh solutions provide is your ability to

742
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:56,720
not to monitor network traffic very

743
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:57,919
similar to what we see outside of a

744
00:24:57,919 --> 00:24:59,919
container but a lot of them don't have

745
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:02,720
ics specific protocols supported yet and

746
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,919
and i think that's probably one of the

747
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:05,919
biggest needs for those internal

748
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:07,039
container

749
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:09,039
security monitoring tools

750
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:11,360
in the ics world is to support

751
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,840
ics civic

752
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:14,720
protocols make sense

753
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,960
thank you

754
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:19,919
so uh

755
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:20,880
you

756
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,640
other sides are yeah no it's good you

757
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,640
asked a question or you referenced a

758
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,240
little bit about hypervisors do you see

759
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:29,120
hypervisors as being a step towards

760
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,600
containers or do you see

761
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,440
a straight jump to containers in some of

762
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,880
the ics space

763
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,039
yeah so

764
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:40,000
i have seen people jump from bare metal

765
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,760
straight to the container world and i

766
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,039
would like i said earlier i wouldn't

767
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:45,919
recommend it um certainly an

768
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:48,559
understanding of virtualization is

769
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:51,039
beneficial to containerization

770
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:53,200
the technology is similar it's kind of

771
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:56,559
the next evolution of virtualization

772
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:59,919
so a good solid understanding of

773
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:01,440
virtualization is is going to be

774
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:04,000
important in monitoring and managing a

775
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,679
containerized system and then one

776
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:07,200
follow-up you mentioned testing is being

777
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,120
critical so one of the things we've been

778
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,279
looking at in labs is

779
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:13,679
virtualizing using hypervisors for

780
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:15,679
substations

781
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:17,919
if you start getting into the size of a

782
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:19,520
test environment that you need do you

783
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,600
see a test environment being

784
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,760
a representative of the various types of

785
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,840
substations the small intermediate you

786
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,760
know 230s whatever it might be or do you

787
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,919
see a test environment needing to be

788
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:32,240
an exact virtual representation of the

789
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,159
entire scada system

790
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:35,520
yeah

791
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:38,000
so it does not need to be exact but it

792
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,880
should be very representative of

793
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,320
certainly probably scaled down for the

794
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,480
test environment trying to manage a test

795
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,159
bed that's the exact same size as a

796
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:49,039
production system could get unwieldy so

797
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:51,120
yeah a scaled-down version would be

798
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,840
really good

799
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,520
hey brian

800
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:58,559
good talk uh i just had a question

801
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:01,520
that was intriguing the live updates and

802
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:04,159
patches to systems and

803
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:06,159
large thermal plants come to mind you

804
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:08,159
know that hey you got to wait until next

805
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:10,640
spring before we do anything yeah have

806
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,559
you seen any adoption of containerized

807
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:15,120
security around those types of

808
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,000
large

809
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,039
i'll call them legacy systems

810
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:23,440
yes um so yeah i'm very aware of some

811
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,919
adoption to legacy systems i can't

812
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:28,399
directly talk about but yeah it's out

813
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:30,320
there um certainly there's some

814
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,559
resistance to it though and i think uh

815
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:34,480
appropriately so

816
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,480
you know people are

817
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:37,919
again back to personnel if you don't

818
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:39,600
have the people to support it it can be

819
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:40,640
a very

820
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:43,360
dangerous thing to do

821
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,039
so yeah there is some movement towards

822
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:47,120
these legacy systems being containerized

823
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:49,200
but i would say it's much less than

824
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,200
we're seeing the management systems

825
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:54,960
being containerized great thanks

826
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,200
i guess i have the last one all right so

827
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,960
i'll ask you to predict the future in

828
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,799
that so we've done the work that we've

829
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:03,039
done on containers has been for

830
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:05,200
functionality but then also as a

831
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,440
protocol adapter type stuff

832
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,279
in that you can hide the south side

833
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:11,600
device that speaks dmp3 modbus so that

834
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,080
you can move on to a newer world right

835
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:16,080
so what do you think it's going to take

836
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:18,159
in the future to have

837
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:20,320
a lot of what happens in this

838
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,399
gateway world that sits on top of these

839
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:25,600
edge devices is we're trying to showcase

840
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,200
what the future would look like when

841
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,279
some of these principles are adopted and

842
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:31,039
get to the edge what do you think it's

843
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:32,799
going to take for a protection relay

844
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:35,600
basically to run some lightweight

845
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,840
version of containerization it doesn't

846
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,840
have to do a lot but at least it brings

847
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,360
it into the world where you can update

848
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:42,640
it you know

849
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:45,919
yeah so i like where your head's at um

850
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:47,600
i think it's cool

851
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,520
you know from a sense of like oh this is

852
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,919
super neat cutting edge technology uh i

853
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:53,919
do think we're pretty far away from that

854
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:56,159
um you know maybe not necessarily far

855
00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:57,919
away from vendors wanting to do it but

856
00:28:57,919 --> 00:28:59,120
pretty far away from owners and

857
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:02,080
operators wanting to adopt it

858
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,240
you know i've for years in this industry

859
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:07,120
heard talk of virtualized relays and i

860
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,880
know of very few people who have adopted

861
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:12,480
virtualized relays so going to uh relays

862
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:15,200
that have containers on them

863
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,200
we're probably pretty far away from it

864
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,480
uh but i would say there's certainly

865
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,480
some benefits again that scalability

866
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:23,039
might really you know serve key there

867
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:25,120
but uh yeah i don't think we're we're

868
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,360
not there today certainly and i i don't

869
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,320
think we're going to be there in the

870
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:31,679
near future but perhaps the far future

871
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:35,320
all right thank you everyone
