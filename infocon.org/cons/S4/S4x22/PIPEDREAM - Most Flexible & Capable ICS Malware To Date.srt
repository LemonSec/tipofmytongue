1
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,680
please welcome rob to the main stage to

2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,960
kick off day two of s4

3
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:15,000
all right hello hello

4
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:18,320
all right thanks folks welcome welcome

5
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,080
appreciate you waking up and coming to

6
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,439
this even though i'm pretty sure

7
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:22,960
everybody was having a good night last

8
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,279
night um but i want to talk about a

9
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:27,119
pretty serious topic uh even though i'm

10
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:29,279
standing here in a parrot t-shirt and

11
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,119
looking quite ridiculous

12
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:33,600
but i wanted to make sure that uh the

13
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,360
adversary knows how little we actually

14
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:36,640
think of them so

15
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:39,920
when we talk about uh this case i know

16
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,680
there's a lot of questions and folks

17
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,440
rightfully so have a ton of questions

18
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,879
and i'm not trying to go through every

19
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:46,239
technical detail that's already in the

20
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:48,559
reports uh or that's already been shared

21
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:50,719
out what i really want to focus on is is

22
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:52,640
some of the lay of the land of

23
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,239
broader and putting this into context

24
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:55,600
especially knowing there's a lot of

25
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,039
people brand new to the community

26
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:59,199
including here dale always does a

27
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:01,199
phenomenal job welcoming folks into our

28
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:03,359
community but i also want to clear up

29
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:04,479
some of the things that are really

30
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:05,920
important for you to focus on i've heard

31
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,920
a lot of different versions of this

32
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,159
information already as it comes out from

33
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:12,240
media and similar so i want to make sure

34
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,439
that you leave with the right

35
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:14,960
information and understanding of how to

36
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,720
think about this in context of your

37
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,280
security in your industrial operations

38
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,320
so

39
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,880
first up as we think about

40
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,360
the capability here as i

41
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,280
get it clicking nope all right we're

42
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,400
gonna i'm gonna start off that way

43
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,000
and for the stagehands if you just

44
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,159
progress me to slide one there thanks

45
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:35,920
so when you look at the ics threat

46
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,320
landscape as we understand it today

47
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,840
one of the important things to

48
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,880
understand

49
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,880
at first is the ics cyberkill chain so

50
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:43,920
many of you have been exposed to that

51
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,360
over the years mike asante did a great

52
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,640
job writing that

53
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,000
a couple years ago

54
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,240
and it puts into context the things that

55
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,280
we care about most because we don't care

56
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,119
about a phishing email hitting a power

57
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:57,520
company or a manufacturing company i'm

58
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,360
sure someone does i'm glad you do

59
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,640
there's i.t security people doing a

60
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,000
wonderful job there but from the

61
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,880
industrial context some random campaign

62
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,200
focused on hitting power and bank and

63
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,800
financial services and similar it's not

64
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,720
all that interesting but what becomes

65
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,720
interesting what becomes that stage one

66
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,760
if you will

67
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,520
is when that adversary is actually

68
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,440
trying to target those companies because

69
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,120
of their industrial operations so they

70
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,360
might not be in the industrial networks

71
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,360
yet but they're not just going after

72
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,640
credentials of whoever works at the

73
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,840
company they might be going after the

74
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,200
engineers and operators they might be

75
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,720
going after the oems and the vendors

76
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,640
that support those operations they might

77
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,120
be stealing engineering drawings off of

78
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,040
integrator networks they're not in your

79
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,760
ics yet but they are trying to be there

80
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,080
that would be that stage one i

81
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,319
colloquially will call them ics curious

82
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:43,840
they're ones that we look at but don't

83
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,160
obsess about it's kind of actually quite

84
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,760
interesting that it's in a way like a

85
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,640
hurricane path where in most aspects of

86
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,319
cyber threat intelligence or most

87
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:54,480
aspects of tracking adversaries you

88
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,519
don't really get to forecast too often

89
00:02:57,519 --> 00:02:59,519
but when you can see adversaries

90
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:01,519
learning and starting their operations

91
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:03,920
and realizing that it takes years to get

92
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,519
to a place where you're really good and

93
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:06,640
understand the engineering and

94
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,519
operations not just the digital parts

95
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:11,680
you can kind of forecast so in that

96
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,400
category of those ics curious stage one

97
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,400
actors if you will those are the ones

98
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,560
that some of them will progress some of

99
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,720
them will not but it's interesting to

100
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,200
see who are they targeting victimology

101
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,599
sets where are they operating how are

102
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:27,760
they doing their jobs that's where it's

103
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,599
again kind of that forecasting

104
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:30,959
eventually it gets to that smaller

105
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:33,599
subset which is that stage two capable

106
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:35,599
actors those are the ones that are not

107
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:37,280
yet doing disruptive or destructive

108
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,000
actions but they're in the ics networks

109
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,080
they're stealing hmi screenshots

110
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,080
historian data they're doing the right

111
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,200
actions

112
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,200
maybe it's intellectual property theft

113
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,120
but a lot of that activity could also

114
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,879
progress really quickly to disruptive

115
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:52,640
operations and they're building the

116
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,360
knowledge reticent to be able to go and

117
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,200
do the types of attacks that concern us

118
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,599
most and then finally you get into that

119
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:01,680
group the very small group that has

120
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,920
actually achieved their goals whether or

121
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,680
not that their goals may be grander in

122
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,519
scale than they've achieved as a debate

123
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:08,879
but they are actually able to get to a

124
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:10,480
phase where they're disrupting or

125
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,159
destroying equipment disrupting

126
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:14,560
operations that's that stage two act

127
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,000
they've sort of finished out the kill

128
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,120
chain if you will and as of today we'll

129
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,680
be talking about chernovite which is the

130
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,600
latest one that actually achieved that

131
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,680
stage two now

132
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,520
also in the names i'll just note they're

133
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,800
all made up it doesn't matter they're

134
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,120
silly names they're just there to talk

135
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,960
about a cluster of intrusions that is

136
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,280
doing this activity basically

137
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,000
a an ability for us to learn the tactics

138
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,400
and techniques learned who they target

139
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,840
learn how they're accomplishing their

140
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,440
goals we don't really care about the

141
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,280
attribution of it there are people out

142
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,720
there that care about attribution that's

143
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,720
totally fine at dragos we don't you'll

144
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,040
never see us do attribution

145
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,360
generally i apply the simpsons rule for

146
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,040
folks when folks are like oh was it

147
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,400
russia was it china

148
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,800
like cool the simpsons did it

149
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,440
and if that doesn't change the action

150
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,800
you're going to take then the

151
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,960
attribution is pointless if it's

152
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,639
actually going to change your action

153
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,320
fine hey go have a conversation about

154
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,880
attribution but for network defenders

155
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,280
90 of the time we find that attribution

156
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,639
has nothing to do with the actions

157
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:16,160
you're going to take so just assume the

158
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,080
simpsons did it don't worry about it and

159
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,759
focus instead on the capabilities and

160
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:21,039
the ways to actually defend your

161
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:22,160
environment

162
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,639
so when it comes to uh next slide please

163
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:27,039
when it comes to the chernovite group

164
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:29,280
the thing to take away here and the the

165
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,199
real key points to clear up some of the

166
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:32,960
discussion that's taken place

167
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,919
number one this was caught this group

168
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:37,440
was caught and their capability was

169
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,240
caught prior to the employment of it at

170
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,759
their target sites that does not mean it

171
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:45,680
was caught before they ever deployed it

172
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,600
i've seen a lot of interesting

173
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,440
rumors and theories and things out there

174
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,520
i'll talk about that in a second but i'm

175
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,680
being very precise with my language here

176
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,000
it was caught before it was employed for

177
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,680
its disruptive and destructive

178
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:01,120
operations at the target sites um it was

179
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,280
not yeah thanks yeah so yeah we were

180
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,319
ahead of the adversary that's pretty

181
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:07,520
good um so this is

182
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,639
not

183
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:11,039
something that mandiant or drago's found

184
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:12,880
and i've seen a lot of conversations

185
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,199
about that i find the whole discussion

186
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:17,039
about who found it first quite pointless

187
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:18,639
it's a weird measuring contest that i

188
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:19,840
don't understand

189
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:20,880
all that matters is getting the

190
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,400
information out to the community to take

191
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,600
action but dragos nor mandiant

192
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,440
found the malware both teams did

193
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,600
phenomenal work i was always glad to see

194
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,440
that they were on the case as well but

195
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,759
what happened is an undisclosed partner

196
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:36,639
found it and then called us and said hey

197
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:38,000
we want to share this with you we don't

198
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,560
really have all the context around this

199
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,759
we don't really know what to do with

200
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:43,120
this they're really really capable

201
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,919
people but hey you're specialist in ics

202
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:47,840
why don't you take a deeper look at this

203
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,280
and that's when we got involved from the

204
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,360
very start and started analyzing it and

205
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,639
that's when we identified it as

206
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:54,160
pipedream as this collection of

207
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,759
capabilities we'll talk about that in a

208
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:58,160
second there's a bunch of rumor mills

209
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,000
going on about well who is the partner

210
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,759
and what happened and maybe maybe

211
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:03,520
somebody hacked the government or like

212
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,840
none of that it's not that clever it's

213
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,360
not that interesting it's not that

214
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,759
spooky of a story the reality is though

215
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:10,960
the partner just doesn't want to be

216
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,400
disclosed and we're respecting those

217
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,520
choices additionally that partner

218
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,560
understands

219
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,319
as we all do that this capability was

220
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:19,919
caught ahead of time and we were all

221
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:22,960
concerned about when it became public

222
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,479
what would happen

223
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:26,080
would potentially the adversary take

224
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,919
that opportunity to then try to use

225
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:30,000
their capability out in the world would

226
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,039
we be

227
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:33,039
accidentally rushing the adversary to do

228
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:34,560
an operation and when you're talking

229
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,919
about industrial operations and the

230
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:37,520
safety and the operations around them

231
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,800
the last thing we want to do is put

232
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,560
anybody in harm's way so we all wanted

233
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,840
to be very thoughtful about that and i

234
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,039
really appreciate my colleagues at

235
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:45,360
mandiant for also respecting that

236
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,199
sensitivity and making sure all of us

237
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,560
are kind of keeping our mouth shut on

238
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,479
the pieces that don't help the defenders

239
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:52,639
but could help the adversary

240
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,479
the other thing that i'll highlight just

241
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:55,840
right off the bat is the government's

242
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,840
involvement so you saw the advisory from

243
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:01,199
sizza doe fbi and nsa and as a former

244
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:04,319
government analyst without trying to

245
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:06,479
spread doubt in the interagency process

246
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:08,720
to have a bunch of government agencies

247
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,800
all come together to actually coordinate

248
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,319
something responsibly across the

249
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:14,639
community that's hard and that's a lot

250
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:16,000
harder than i think people ever give it

251
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,720
credit for and sizza absolutely deserves

252
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,319
credit for kind of leading that charge

253
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:21,520
and all the different interagency

254
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,120
partners for getting the information out

255
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,039
in the way they did and how they did it

256
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:26,560
in the respectful manner they did it it

257
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,639
was just phenomenally well done

258
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:30,240
so when we look at

259
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,840
chernovite the other thing that i'll

260
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,279
highlight that i think has been another

261
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,719
misconception

262
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:36,159
is there's been a lot of talk about

263
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:38,399
schneider electric and omron and there's

264
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,159
been a lot of talk about well these

265
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:42,080
devices are kind of off the shelf just

266
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,919
run-of-the-mill devices and you might

267
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,760
find them anywhere which technically

268
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,279
could be true but it is missing the

269
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:49,760
point first of all pipe dream is all

270
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,720
detail is not specific to schneider

271
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,440
electric and omron in our analysis in

272
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,600
our assessment the schneider electric

273
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,680
and omron pieces of it is about a

274
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,480
configuration for the initial target set

275
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,240
what does that mean it means that this

276
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,480
capability was developed to be deployed

277
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,720
across a wide set of geographies a wide

278
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,640
set of industries it is without a shadow

279
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,560
of a doubt the most flexible and capable

280
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,880
ics framework that we've seen

281
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,279
but the schneider and omron pieces of it

282
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:19,920
were about initial targets so when we

283
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,600
come out and make statements like we

284
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,560
assess

285
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,320
that this was targeted towards u.s

286
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,839
liquid natural gas and key electric

287
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:27,680
sites we're saying that with confidence

288
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,440
we're saying that for a reason

289
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,920
and anybody putting a view of oh well

290
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,839
schneider electric plcs are vulnerable

291
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:35,680
or omron plc's are vulnerable all that

292
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,200
it's not accurate and it's missing the

293
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,360
point it is just stating that if you

294
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,320
have both omron and schneider electric

295
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,480
and you're in u.s electric or liquid

296
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,200
natural gas you should go hunting

297
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,839
you might actually be one of the targets

298
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:52,000
if you're not you should be looking at

299
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,080
this as a framework to model most of

300
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,839
your security program after about how to

301
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:57,600
deal with this type of threat because i

302
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,519
think we will see it in the future this

303
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:01,200
is a very flexible framework they were

304
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,440
probably spending years developing this

305
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,560
and this is not something that they're

306
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,160
just going to give up because again it's

307
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,760
not about patching vulnerabilities or

308
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,680
sharing indicators it's just taking

309
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,440
advantage of native functionality in the

310
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,200
environment which is what a lot of us

311
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,959
have been concerned for a lot of times

312
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:16,560
exploits vulnerabilities malware that

313
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,000
kind of stuff gets a lot of attention in

314
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,600
the i.t security community and

315
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,360
industrial security if you just know how

316
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,120
to manipulate the physical environment

317
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,480
you know how to manipulate logic you

318
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,800
know how to use the ics protocols that's

319
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,160
more dangerous and that's what we care

320
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,839
about and that's what they've done

321
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:31,600
the other thing that i'll highlight just

322
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,320
from a mental model perspective is every

323
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,839
year i see people get on stage and it's

324
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:37,760
well-intentioned i'm not trying to throw

325
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,600
stones here but i see people talk about

326
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,480
what the adversary will and won't do

327
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,920
hey here's the

328
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,160
information here's the capability but oh

329
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,880
don't worry russia china iran whatever

330
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,480
they're not going to actually attack u.s

331
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,320
infrastructure unless there's a war in

332
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,680
the u.s like

333
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:57,440
it's so so silly and and here's why you

334
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,279
get to define everything about your

335
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:00,480
security program

336
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,320
absolutely everything i've been on the

337
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,760
offensive side of the house before it's

338
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,760
not as easy as people make it out to be

339
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,440
you have to play in the world of the

340
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,200
defender i don't know your network i

341
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,240
don't know your architecture i don't

342
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,519
know your ics i don't know anything

343
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:13,279
about you and i'm trying to figure it

344
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,399
all out

345
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:16,240
it's hard all right like i'm glad it's

346
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,240
hard screw the adversaries but but it's

347
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,279
hard you get to define everything

348
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:23,200
but the one thing you don't even get a

349
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,040
vote on is whether or not you're a good

350
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,200
target so just move that out of the

351
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,519
discussion prepare for it and don't

352
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:31,279
worry about well they wouldn't do this

353
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:33,360
or okay you're inside the kremlin or

354
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,720
you're inside the pla today and you're

355
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:35,600
having conversations about what they

356
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,680
will and won't do stop it move that out

357
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,000
of the way because this in many ways

358
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,680
changes the mental model about how we

359
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,160
view attacks on infrastructure because

360
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,320
they were trying to deploy this in our

361
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,399
assessment they were actually going to

362
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:50,480
do disruptive operations here in the

363
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,880
united states on those sites and we're

364
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,480
not at war with anybody and talk about

365
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,360
ukraine

366
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,639
conflict going on you can talk about all

367
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:58,959
those things the united states is not in

368
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:01,120
war with anybody and the idea that an

369
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,480
adversary was actually going to try to

370
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,720
take down key infrastructure sites

371
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,480
anyways i mean there was definitely

372
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,000
moments in our team that were like what

373
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,360
are y'all doing you know you just want

374
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,720
to smack them outside the head like are

375
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,880
you insane but yeah they get a vote

376
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,240
there that we don't

377
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,839
um so the other thing that i'll

378
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:18,240
highlight if we go to the next slide

379
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,600
is again when we talk about the

380
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,120
schneider electric and omron devices

381
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,079
yeah there's a bunch of them that you

382
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:23,519
should look at and there's a bunch of

383
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:25,360
them again that you should think through

384
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,399
but

385
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:28,320
focusing on things like vulnerabilities

386
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,839
and focusing on things like product

387
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:32,959
lines truly is missing the whole point

388
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:35,040
even with the cves down on the slides

389
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,279
that talk about lazy cargo's capability

390
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:39,040
which we'll talk about in a second it

391
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,440
doesn't it's not actually required they

392
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,040
can use a known vulnerability it's been

393
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,480
a vulnerability out in the community for

394
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,800
a long time but they don't have to

395
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,240
and we talk about the asrock driver

396
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,240
but they actually can do it on any

397
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,320
motherboard and so it's a very very

398
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,560
flexible framework it's not specific to

399
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,399
any given product line or so forth but

400
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:00,320
next slide please

401
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,000
so when we look at pipe dream we think

402
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,160
of this not as an individual piece of

403
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,399
malware but as a collection of tools

404
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:08,079
and the tools are down the bottom as we

405
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:09,360
identify them

406
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,959
another question that came up i'm sure

407
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:12,480
is like is pipe dream and in control are

408
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,920
the same thing yes well why didn't you

409
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,440
guys coordinate a name because when we

410
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,800
got contacted by the partner and started

411
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,480
working this we had no idea anybody else

412
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,320
was even involved that by the time we

413
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,920
found out mandiant was involved and even

414
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,160
though i'm glad they were was when

415
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,440
reports were getting written to go

416
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,440
public with this information so

417
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,600
there was no coordination on on between

418
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,800
the vendor side of the house it was

419
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,639
coordination with the partner

420
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:34,399
um and so when you look at pipe dream

421
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:36,079
again the thing to also think about

422
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:37,440
trenovite the group that would be

423
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,720
deploying this

424
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,639
is they're an effects team they're not

425
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:42,720
an access team so i get a lot of

426
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,399
questions on well

427
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:46,560
how would they break in well actually

428
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,560
they probably wouldn't

429
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,720
um you would generally have some other

430
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,480
team that's knocking down the door you

431
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:55,040
have the access development team but the

432
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,720
effects team are the folks that actually

433
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,000
come in to deploy capabilities and

434
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,839
achieve effects and that's trunovite and

435
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,440
we've seen that before

436
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,360
we track a group called comma site which

437
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,959
is a group that essentially kicks down

438
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:06,399
the doors to electric companies followed

439
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:08,560
by electrum electrum ends up deploying

440
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,760
capabilities they were the ones

441
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:12,000
responsible for the 2016 electric outage

442
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,480
in ukraine you see that handoff that

443
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,480
takes place and it's

444
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,320
kind of hard to pick up on that but very

445
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,079
often very very every now and then we

446
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:22,160
get a good view into that and the thing

447
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,800
again to be aware of there is this team

448
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,880
can sort of ride on the back of any

449
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,199
other of those access teams so don't

450
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:30,959
think about how am i blocking them from

451
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:33,120
getting in focus on how am i detecting

452
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,519
and responding to them once they're in

453
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,519
the other thing to think about

454
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:39,920
is the underlining capabilities and

455
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,360
again i'll walk through these in depth

456
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,600
but the underlying capabilities are

457
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,959
really meant for any industrial

458
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:48,079
environment right using opc using modbus

459
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:50,320
using native functionality

460
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,560
so again just focusing on any one piece

461
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,560
missing the point but any one of these

462
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,519
capabilities could be used in isolation

463
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:59,839
so it's not our assessment that all of

464
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:01,360
pipe dream would be deployed in any

465
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,440
given attack this is a very very

466
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,880
flexible framework they can use

467
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,480
individual pieces of it they could use

468
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,680
all of it together i'll walk through

469
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,279
some of those scenarios but they don't

470
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:11,199
have to all right so let's take a look

471
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:12,720
at these and again next slide please and

472
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:13,760
i'm going to try to put this into

473
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,160
context so when you look at lazy cargo

474
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,240
and we use that ics cyber kill chain as

475
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,240
a frame of reference this is the

476
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,839
capability that would be leveraged in

477
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:23,760
kind of that stage one so somebody's

478
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,440
already knocked down the door the access

479
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,160
team is given access to chernovite and

480
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,759
then they come in and they deploy this

481
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:32,399
lazy cargo capability this malware and

482
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:34,240
the interesting thing here again is

483
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,800
folks are focusing on the asrock driver

484
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,720
and the ability to get

485
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,440
code execution on that system and and

486
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,720
actually make sure that they have

487
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,880
persistence on that system

488
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,120
but asrock is just the driver they were

489
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,800
using in that initial configuration same

490
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,000
thing with that schneider omron

491
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,839
discussion i had earlier it's not

492
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:55,040
specific to it so every single windows

493
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,160
device

494
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,279
that has

495
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:58,720
a motherboard so all your different

496
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,079
windows devices

497
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:02,880
any of those motherboards actually work

498
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,320
in the same way that they're trying to

499
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,839
do the asrock driver again though

500
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:06,800
somebody's still got to kick down the

501
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,320
door somebody's got to get them there

502
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,680
like you've got to have admin privileges

503
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,600
already but after that what they're

504
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,279
doing to load this capability in the

505
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:15,600
unsigned driver is not as rock specific

506
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,279
it just works with any different driver

507
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:18,480
set in any different motherboard or

508
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,759
virtual machines next slide please

509
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,440
the other stage one capability that they

510
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,519
have in this is dust tunnel so when you

511
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:27,600
look at dust tunnel it is essentially

512
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,680
the implant itself so think about access

513
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,360
team kicking down the door think about

514
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,040
lazy cargo getting put on the system to

515
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,040
get to get execution and persistence

516
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,880
think about the

517
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,800
dust tunnel capability as actually being

518
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,800
the mechanism to have long-term

519
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,560
capability on that system reaching out

520
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,480
to command and control addresses being

521
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,839
able to interact with the target

522
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:47,199
environment on a persistent and

523
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:49,440
continual basis so this would be the one

524
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,800
that you would look for kind of at the

525
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,560
later stages which would be command and

526
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,639
control related and how the adversary is

527
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:56,240
actually interacting with your

528
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,000
environment it's got all the normal

529
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,440
kinds of things that you'd expect

530
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,440
virtual machine defeats and similar so

531
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,800
it's got kind of its anti-frenzied

532
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,319
capabilities that you would expect in

533
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:07,439
any given modern malware but the the big

534
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:09,280
thing there again is the exfiltration

535
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,119
and the interaction with the system next

536
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:13,039
slide please

537
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:13,919
this is where it starts to get a little

538
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:15,359
bit more interesting

539
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:17,520
mousehole being a stage two capable yeah

540
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,679
next slide please mouse hole being a

541
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:21,679
stage two capability now so something

542
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:24,079
that you would use in the ics networks

543
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:26,720
and something that could be used for

544
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,480
either developing knowledge in the

545
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,160
environment using opc to actually

546
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,760
identify the tags and information around

547
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,120
the environment enumerate the different

548
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,600
type of equipment et cetera or you could

549
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,600
also use it as a standalone attack

550
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,360
module where you're actually able to go

551
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,480
right and interact with clients over opc

552
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,200
the

553
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,720
interesting thing here while we don't

554
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,400
want to build up the adversary

555
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,240
personally i think they're but

556
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,520
while we don't want to build them up

557
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,120
this one is pretty clever

558
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,799
when you look at the opc module they

559
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:54,559
essentially took the crash override or

560
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:58,000
indestroyer opc module from before and

561
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,679
really honed it in not saying they're

562
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:00,960
sharing code i'm not saying it's the

563
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,679
same team but they paid attention they

564
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:05,919
watched what happened with electrum they

565
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:07,760
watched what happened in electric power

566
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:10,400
sites in 2016 ukraine and they learned

567
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,240
from that and they took the opc module

568
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,360
which was

569
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,440
okay at the time but kind of not

570
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,760
perfected and they really stepped it up

571
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,240
to build a really good opc module in

572
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,440
terms of how they can target those

573
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,880
environments and again that's not

574
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,440
schneider omron or anybody specific that

575
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,280
is just opc one of the most common

576
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,600
protocols across industrial environments

577
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,360
um so something that you'd be definitely

578
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,760
looking for is the interaction of

579
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,280
systems with your controllers your

580
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,120
equipment your historians your hmi alarm

581
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,440
servers things like that using opc in a

582
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,960
way that you're not currently using in

583
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,840
your environment next slide please

584
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,000
after that there's evil scholar so evil

585
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,760
scholar is the one that's getting the

586
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,360
attention with the schneider electric

587
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:52,240
kind of discussion there and yes it does

588
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,240
target schneider electric controllers

589
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,919
yes it is

590
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:57,280
sort of specific to them in the

591
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,440
configuration but it's not specific to

592
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,880
them in a capability because it's

593
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,720
actually taking advantage of code assist

594
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,559
and codices is an underlying software

595
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:05,919
framework that's in

596
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:08,240
tons of different uh manufacturers it's

597
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,080
actually one of the more common ones uh

598
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,080
for my software build materials crowd

599
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,200
i've been seeing a lot of svon

600
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,120
discussions over the years this is the

601
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,160
one that's like yeah that's a really

602
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,799
good use case for s-bomb of what all

603
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:20,480
products do i have that have that

604
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,720
codices framework in it you will find

605
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,720
that there's a lot of vendors who are

606
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,160
putting out their products that don't

607
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,840
know that that version of code assist

608
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,280
and that framework is actually in their

609
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,880
products there's plenty that do

610
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,480
but you want to go figure out where they

611
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,400
are and make sure you can take advantage

612
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,360
of that in terms of a defensive posture

613
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,880
the thing here that i find really

614
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,640
interesting about evil scholar

615
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,720
is this is really where you can truly

616
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,480
interact with plcs

617
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,679
from a command line interface or

618
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:47,360
actually mirroring kind of an interface

619
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,480
to them

620
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,679
everything that you'd want to do with

621
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:50,559
them

622
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:51,919
interacting with them crashing

623
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:53,600
controllers stealing information off of

624
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,440
them all that kind of fun stuff but if

625
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,120
we go to the next slide the thing that i

626
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,720
actually find quite interesting is the

627
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,600
proxying capability so a lot of us think

628
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,960
about our industrial environments in

629
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,400
terms of segmentation you think about

630
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,480
62443 you think about nerf sip you think

631
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,520
of all these different standards and

632
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,280
frameworks and if you look at all the

633
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,120
standards and frameworks over the years

634
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,600
about 95 percent of the guidance tends

635
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,760
to be preventative in nature

636
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,640
patch password segment access manage

637
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,960
antivirus edr like it's all how do you

638
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,880
prevent things from happening which

639
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:25,039
leaves very little space if you're

640
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:26,400
following a standard or framework or

641
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,400
regulation to then invest in detection

642
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,240
response and recovery less than five

643
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,240
percent of your resources which is why

644
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,840
we have this big gap in the community

645
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,120
and i usually joke around that we have

646
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,960
the equivalency of schrodinger's ics

647
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,480
like we're just not looking inside the

648
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,159
box to see if things are okay and we're

649
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:42,159
just assuming all the magic is happening

650
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:43,919
but in this capability this plc

651
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:46,400
enumeration capability and how it works

652
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,720
this bypasses all of that

653
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:49,840
the moment you're actually in the

654
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,159
environment now you can start using the

655
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:54,720
native control environment to then proxy

656
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,919
yourself plc to plc so if i'm working on

657
00:20:57,919 --> 00:20:59,360
like an engineer workstation as an

658
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,720
example and i get access to the

659
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,159
controller which that's the whole

660
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:03,440
purpose of the engineering workstation

661
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,039
it has that access

662
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:06,880
this capability with evil scholar i can

663
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,960
start proxing through that controller to

664
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,559
other controllers in the environment

665
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:12,080
even if i didn't have access to them

666
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,679
from the engineer workstation so if

667
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:15,039
you've got kind of a nice segmented

668
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:17,039
environment and you kind of set it up

669
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:18,799
where a lot of your controllers are in a

670
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:20,640
situation where they can't be accessed

671
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,960
they can just burrow right through

672
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,320
anything that they have access to any

673
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,559
other controller set up an interface

674
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:28,320
leverage common protocols like modbus

675
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,480
tcp and then go and interact with all

676
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,480
those other systems so a lot of you are

677
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,559
doing ingress and egress monitoring kind

678
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:37,200
of that north and south this is the holy

679
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,320
crap you really need to be doing

680
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,840
east-west you really need to be able to

681
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,120
understand what's happening in that

682
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,799
environment not just who's coming in and

683
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:43,679
out of it

684
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:45,280
so really put a focus there if you're

685
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,880
trying to keep up with capabilities like

686
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,240
evil scholar

687
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,919
next slide please

688
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:51,440
the other one that is getting the

689
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,960
attention of course is the omron module

690
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,559
which was bad omen

691
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:56,480
another really capable framework this

692
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:59,679
one is uh essentially it's very specific

693
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:02,720
to omron in many ways um but of course

694
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,039
capturing data capturing packet captures

695
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:06,880
you know getting implants on the systems

696
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,559
yeah all of that's nice and sure it can

697
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:11,039
be used for developing knowledge and

698
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:12,799
modification of the system but the

699
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:15,440
attack part is quite clever where

700
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,360
they're actually not only doing wiper

701
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,360
functionality which is interesting but

702
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,919
more impactful is actually being able to

703
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:23,919
interact with the actuators the physical

704
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:25,280
equipment on the other side of the

705
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,480
controllers

706
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,640
so they're essentially relaying ethercat

707
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,640
commands to that equipment if you go to

708
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,000
the next slide we can actually see kind

709
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,679
of a representation of this and these

710
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:35,440
are just kind of standard drawings on

711
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,720
the left we've highlighted some things

712
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,960
with our standard omron kind of sport

713
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,120
drawings and so you've got this ability

714
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,120
from a system that has

715
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:46,480
bad omen on it to interact with the

716
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,480
fins protocol that omron uses or the

717
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,400
omron controllers themselves

718
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,559
start doing ethercat control directly

719
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:54,480
off the control system and directly off

720
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,480
the plc than to hitting things like

721
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,400
servos and motors and similar so if you

722
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,320
have a bunch of physical equipment if

723
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,320
every industrial environment does on the

724
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,919
other side of that plc on the other side

725
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:05,360
of the controller that physical

726
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,400
equipment is what they can start

727
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,320
interacting with through these commands

728
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,880
and those ethercat replay of commands so

729
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,720
pretty interesting again on the other

730
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,559
side of the chart you'll see

731
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:16,240
kind of what the interaction would look

732
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,159
like you could take a look at this from

733
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:20,320
a network detection perspective as well

734
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,919
on seeing the ability to set up that

735
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:23,679
interface interact through the fins

736
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:26,159
protocol with the controller and then do

737
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:27,520
anything that you would want with that

738
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,440
controller clearing memory configuring

739
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:32,320
it reconfiguring it setting logic

740
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,880
crashing the plc anything your operators

741
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:35,840
and engineers could do with the

742
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,440
equipment they can now do again it's

743
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,280
that native functionality

744
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,039
so i really want to foot stomp that that

745
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:43,039
when you're dealing with really good

746
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:44,960
adversaries no matter how much jerks

747
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,080
they might be

748
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,159
they're really going towards that living

749
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:50,400
on the land native functionality type

750
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,400
capability if you're just checking for

751
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,760
vulnerabilities and exploits and all

752
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:56,159
that stuff you are absolutely missing 90

753
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:58,559
of the game next slide please

754
00:23:58,559 --> 00:23:59,840
so let's talk about some attack

755
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:00,720
scenarios and we'll talk about

756
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,559
mitigations and we'll wrap it up

757
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:05,039
so how might all this be leveraged again

758
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:07,760
it has not been employed for the attack

759
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,120
so we're taking some liberties here on

760
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,640
what we understand and how these things

761
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,159
can be used

762
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:14,000
and it's just sort of a logical

763
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,400
exploration of what the capabilities are

764
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,880
so when you look at the stage one aspect

765
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:21,279
it is very reasonable to focus on lazy

766
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:23,120
cargo and dust tunnel that's the stuff

767
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,480
that we would expect to potentially be

768
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,440
in the it networks or that stage one

769
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,200
it could be in the it networks starting

770
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,720
to interface with those control

771
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,480
environments or the points that you have

772
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,320
access maybe an i.t historian or

773
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:35,919
something like that as an example so

774
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:38,080
somebody else comes in opens the door

775
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,600
then chernovite comes in deploys

776
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,440
pipedream in the pipedream capabilities

777
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,039
you've got lazy cargo and dust tunnel

778
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:44,080
those would be the two that you would

779
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,080
expect to find those it networks that's

780
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,360
where they're getting persistence on the

781
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,200
system setting up command control

782
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,360
enumerating accounts and in some way

783
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,360
moving laterally or moving into your

784
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,679
control environment next slide

785
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:57,440
when we then look at the stage two

786
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:00,159
aspect they could use any one of these

787
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:02,480
or they could use them together in our

788
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:05,039
assessment the initial configuration of

789
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:07,600
this the initial target set they would

790
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,080
have been using them together it was not

791
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,080
if you have schneider or omron it was

792
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,640
you had schneider and omron okay so the

793
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,799
initial configuration was to use them

794
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:19,120
together but you don't need to use them

795
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,559
together and again you don't need to do

796
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:23,120
it just on schneider omron environments

797
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,039
um and even though i'm talking to stage

798
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:27,039
two here i'll do a quick tangent to note

799
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:29,600
like these control systems are in much

800
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,440
wider places that are getting discussed

801
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,039
so without trying to

802
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:34,400
share with the adversary things they may

803
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,440
not know

804
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,360
there's real concern when you find this

805
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,120
exact set of configuration not in some

806
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,559
small manufacturing environments that

807
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:42,480
those are important too but you'll find

808
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,080
these not only again liquid natural gas

809
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,720
sites combined cycle plants but you'll

810
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,240
find these in like backup auxiliary

811
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,840
units for nuclear power plants so the

812
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,440
idea that these are just some random

813
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,919
control systems off the shelf is very

814
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:55,360
much missing the point about where these

815
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:57,760
things are deployed but when you look at

816
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:00,080
the again the stage two capability

817
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,320
mouse hole is that one again opc

818
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,080
enumeration being able to figure out if

819
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,320
you were using it with everything you

820
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,080
necessarily wouldn't actually execute an

821
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,840
attack with this module you would use

822
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,360
this to figure out what all is in the

823
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,720
environment kind of all that network

824
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,159
discovery that defenders should be doing

825
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:16,000
your adversaries got to do it too so

826
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,360
figuring out all the different actual

827
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,120
control equipment in that environment

828
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,799
then using the evil scholar capability

829
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:22,320
on the schneider electric controllers or

830
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,840
other controllers that they wanted to go

831
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:26,080
after especially with the ability to

832
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:28,320
manipulate those and then using bad omen

833
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,760
especially on the physical equipment

834
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,840
side being able to interact with the

835
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,600
controllers on those servos those

836
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,840
actuators the various other side of the

837
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,360
plc if you will

838
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:38,480
next slide

839
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,840
so when we think about this just as an

840
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,120
abstract this is kind of how we put it

841
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,880
together with the classic purdue model

842
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,240
also i'm going to take this opportunity

843
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,919
to do a quick tangent those of you that

844
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:47,279
keep claiming the purdue model is dead

845
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:48,880
please stop it read the paper the purdue

846
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,480
model is about time not your network

847
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,720
architecture anyways so on the purdue

848
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:53,760
model here

849
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,520
when you're looking at the way that

850
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,960
these capabilities will be used

851
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,799
obviously again level four it depends on

852
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:00,080
how you've actually architected your

853
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,760
environment but kind of those level four

854
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,200
capabilities is that what we call that

855
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,960
stage one you're getting down to that

856
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,799
level two level one pretty quickly when

857
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:07,600
you're talking about the other

858
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,760
capabilities so i would expect for you

859
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,120
to find these types of capabilities in

860
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:13,120
those environments it's very real uh

861
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,960
reasonable that a bunch of you go cool

862
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,400
what are the indicators

863
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,080
i i don't actually think that's the

864
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:20,000
right investment of your time i'm not

865
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,679
able to share the indicators because the

866
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:23,440
partner had very restrictive sharing

867
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,279
rules appropriately so

868
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:26,960
i would give them to you if i have them

869
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,080
i can't

870
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,520
but more importantly it's not actually

871
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,200
deployed anywhere in the world in terms

872
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,799
of its actual effects so focusing on

873
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:34,799
those is missing the point again what we

874
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:36,559
see in all these different ics attacks

875
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:38,559
is the technical indicators

876
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:40,640
change very very rapidly it's the

877
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,320
tactics and techniques those those

878
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,080
procedures if you will that you really

879
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,000
need to focus on so focusing on these

880
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,279
portions of your network with these

881
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:48,960
styles of capabilities will help guide

882
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,320
you to what you should be looking for

883
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:53,200
and how to be looking for it next slide

884
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,200
in terms of mitigations

885
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,480
these are the mitigations that were put

886
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,360
out

887
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,960
i am not going to go through all of them

888
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,720
i just want to highlight a couple things

889
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,399
these are all very preventative in

890
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:04,240
nature that's the guidance that

891
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:05,679
typically comes out is how to prevent

892
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:08,480
stuff again a lot of your focus an

893
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,399
overly sized piece of your focus should

894
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:11,840
be how do i detect and respond to these

895
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,360
things not how do i prevent it because

896
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,120
there's a wide range of ways that it

897
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,559
could get into your environment

898
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:17,760
the other thing i'll note is there are

899
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,200
recommendations here like change default

900
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,360
credentials and if i just put out an ics

901
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,640
advisory that was like change your

902
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,080
default credentials most of you would

903
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,520
just like start booing and throwing

904
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,120
stuff at me like i get it

905
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,080
but

906
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:31,279
in this case on the schneider electric

907
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:33,279
plcs you'd be wanting to take a look at

908
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:35,360
changing the default configurations the

909
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:37,279
module takes advantage of like admin

910
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:38,960
passwords and similar that can be

911
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,279
changed on that controller and so it's

912
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:42,559
not saying you should go around and

913
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:43,679
change all the credentials in all your

914
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:44,880
environments i think that'd be a waste

915
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,559
of time but on those specific

916
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:48,159
controllers if you have them and you're

917
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:50,080
worried about this capability that would

918
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,760
be an appropriate control in this

919
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:52,960
situation

920
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,480
the other thing of course that i'll

921
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,240
highlight is just the ics focus sensor

922
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,360
response plan

923
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,640
even though we're a technology company

924
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,640
we take a lot of instant response cases

925
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,960
and just nine times out of ten folks are

926
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:05,520
unprepared the ot staff is not talking

927
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,600
to the i.t staff or vice versa the

928
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,360
executives and the board have a rosier

929
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:10,640
view of the security posture of that

930
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,720
company that is in reality and it just

931
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,159
spends a lot of time where we can't

932
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:15,120
answer

933
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,720
50 of the questions or more that you're

934
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:19,760
trying to ask so i would use

935
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,520
chernovite i would use this pipe dream

936
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,919
capability to go model out a tabletop

937
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:26,240
exercise of what would this look like in

938
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,880
our environment do we even have the data

939
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,880
to detect it do we even have the data to

940
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,720
answer the questions that we have if i

941
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,480
was going to build an ics security

942
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,559
program from scratch i would end up

943
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:38,720
modeling off of this capability to start

944
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,880
with probably ransomware and this one

945
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,399
ransomware and likelihood this one on

946
00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:45,279
the impact side next slide please

947
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:46,880
this is just to be left in the slides

948
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,399
we're not to go through all this but the

949
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:50,480
mitre attack for ics framework that

950
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,320
mitre put out it's phenomenal

951
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,080
opportunity to look at those tactics and

952
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,840
techniques of the adversaries when we

953
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:58,159
look at pipe dream and chernovite

954
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:00,880
they have the ability to do more of the

955
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,720
framework than any other adversary we've

956
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:03,919
seen i think it's something like north

957
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:05,840
of 30 of all the different known tactics

958
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,200
and techniques they can take advantage

959
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,200
of so the good thing is if you were

960
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,799
already doing the things we've been

961
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:12,640
talking about for years you're in a

962
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:13,840
really good place

963
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,200
you can detect those kind of behaviors

964
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,240
if you're going to detect those kind of

965
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,120
environments if you're doing the

966
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,799
east-west monitoring if you're doing the

967
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:20,159
type of security that we've been talking

968
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:21,520
about you're in a great place and should

969
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:24,320
not be freaking out if you haven't you

970
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,240
really are behind and you want to go

971
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,480
take a look at this and hurry it up

972
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,080
next slide

973
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,760
there's resources for you again in terms

974
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,279
of kill chain paper the year in review

975
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:34,799
which comes with the threats discussion

976
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:36,880
we had and then the pipe dream report

977
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,159
next slide

978
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:41,120
cool so before i leave the stage i

979
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,559
know very well that there's plenty of

980
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:43,919
adversaries out there that watch these

981
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:45,200
videos

982
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,399
you know you're sitting around in your

983
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:48,720
office and you think you're clever

984
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:49,919
and so i want to do something a little

985
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:52,240
bit uh weird and i hope you just hang

986
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,760
with me for a second

987
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,760
but for the folks that deployed this and

988
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,120
think you're cool and the security

989
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,320
community usually builds you up and

990
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,600
tells you how exciting you are and

991
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,679
assigns like pandas and crap to you and

992
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:03,679
you get cover stories and all that crap

993
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:05,679
i just want to let you know that you are

994
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:07,120
an embarrassment

995
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:09,840
uh the fact is we found your capability

996
