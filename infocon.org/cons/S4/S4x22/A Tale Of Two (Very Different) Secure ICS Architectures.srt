00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:07,200
hello

2
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:09,840
so a tale of two very different secure

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,000
ics architectures

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,639
so what is a secure acs architecture

5
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:16,960
well you all know the purdue model and

6
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,840
you might remember the s4x19 panel is

7
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,760
the purdue model dead

8
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,199
some people thought it was still

9
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:25,199
accurate today and others thought it was

10
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:27,279
not relevant anymore especially when

11
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:28,880
considering cloud

12
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,960
traditionally there has been a rigidity

13
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,920
to what a secure architecture is

14
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,480
and here is an example of rigidity the

15
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:37,680
dmc

16
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,680
imagine you need a new interconnection

17
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,200
with your ics

18
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,000
well it's simple put a proxy server in

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,399
the dmz and only allow incoming

20
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:48,960
communications to the dmz

21
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,199
it used to work but does it still make

22
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:52,640
sense today

23
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,440
well maybe not in all cases

24
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,360
and so let's see how we can think about

25
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,399
the future of ics architecture having in

26
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:02,879
mind this year's s4 motto

27
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:05,360
no limits

28
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,680
and so let's take an example i've been

29
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,479
working for various companies that have

30
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:13,840
a large variety of control systems

31
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,320
first historical businesses such as

32
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,640
power plants nuclear chemical or

33
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,080
refineries

34
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,960
but also new businesses such as solar

35
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,400
and wind farm

36
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,400
these various businesses can now be

37
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,439
found within the same company

38
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:32,400
for these companies the the existing ics

39
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,560
cyber security policy needs to be

40
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,560
adapted to new usages and businesses

41
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,119
so for these companies how can we define

42
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:43,280
cyber security requirements and rules

43
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,240
that would apply to the entire company

44
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,240
in this presentation we will compare and

45
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,159
contrast the requirements and

46
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:52,960
corresponding secure ics architectures

47
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,520
of two different businesses within the

48
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,680
same company

49
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,360
but first an assumption

50
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,520
to narrow the discussion i will only

51
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,399
discuss command and control systems so

52
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:08,639
no monitoring and no safety systems

53
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:11,038
and now let's deep dive in our two use

54
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:12,480
cases

55
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,800
so first the historical business so

56
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,200
power plant and refinery so here we

57
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,360
usually have big plants on a single

58
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,000
geographical location with many people

59
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,760
working on sites

60
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,840
these systems are designed to operate

61
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,000
locally so on a single geographical

62
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,560
location and autonomously

63
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,720
there is only a few interconnections and

64
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,560
they are usually not essential to the

65
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,040
industrial process itself

66
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,879
there is a high volume of assets on the

67
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:41,040
network and pretty standard industrial

68
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,760
assets and the industrial process is

69
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,000
usually complex with a lot of common and

70
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,800
control requests

71
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,360
now the new business the solar and wind

72
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,599
farm use case here we have industrial

73
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:55,040
sites that are geographically

74
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,280
distributed and that are communicating

75
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,360
through the internet

76
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,640
so we can find iot common and control

77
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,440
operated from external partners or even

78
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,840
from the cloud there is a lot of small

79
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,560
sites without any human presence and a

80
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,959
few assets on the network we usually

81
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,200
have data loggers and inverters mainly

82
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,959
on these networks

83
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:18,959
these systems are also operated from the

84
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:19,920
cloud

85
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,560
so from a common and control perspective

86
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,360
there is only a few um operations

87
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,720
possible and it's mainly start and stop

88
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,120
and these systems are also about energy

89
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,080
management and optimization the idea is

90
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,400
to gather data and optimize energy

91
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,480
production

92
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,159
so would you have the same architecture

93
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:42,159
and cyber security requirements for both

94
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:43,440
cases

95
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,360
probably not

96
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,519
so let's start with the historical ics

97
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:49,760
secure architecture so here we have a

98
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,840
pretty standard ics architecture

99
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,319
following the purdue model so we have an

100
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:57,439
industrial site with a dedicated ot

101
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:59,280
network and a single geographical

102
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,680
location and so here we find standard

103
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,920
assets such as the scada servers the

104
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,680
workstations the plc's sensors actuators

105
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,400
and this ot network needs to communicate

106
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,040
with the it network and so we do that

107
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,400
through a dmz

108
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,120
with two firewalls one firewall between

109
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,440
the ot network and the dmz and one

110
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,680
firewall between the dmz and the iit

111
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,720
network

112
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,720
and here we do not have any direct

113
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,880
communications between the it network

114
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,120
and the ot network everything goes

115
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,560
through the dmz

116
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,800
and when do we arrive in this dmz well

117
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,720
we have a bastion server for remote

118
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,280
access for example we have update server

119
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,000
antivirus servers and we also can have

120
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,080
some file servers or other application

121
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,840
servers

122
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,199
then what we have next in this

123
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:47,520
architecture we probably have a wide

124
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,600
area network for the company connected

125
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,800
to the company network data center

126
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,880
and here in the data center we may have

127
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:58,639
a central services dmz and also

128
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:01,520
the main and probably the only internet

129
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,759
gateway so actually the remote access

130
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:05,280
goes through this so the remote

131
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,320
workstation will connect to the

132
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,360
vpn of the company then access the first

133
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,400
bastion server in the data center and

134
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,120
finally get to the industrial site first

135
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,800
on the best end server and finally

136
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:23,440
accessing ot assets on the network

137
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,199
so what are the key requirements for

138
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,680
this architecture well we have a dmz

139
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,600
between the it and the ot network

140
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,360
protected by firewalls and so two

141
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,360
firewalls like i said earlier

142
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,039
second point we have no direct

143
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:37,600
communication between the it and the ot

144
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,720
networks everything goes through the dmz

145
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,639
third we have a protocol break in the

146
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:45,840
dmz with relay servers of proxy

147
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,240
and forcepoint there is no local

148
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,680
internet access

149
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,360
on the ot network we have to go through

150
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,880
the i.t network to go out on the

151
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,160
internet

152
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,960
so would this architecture work with our

153
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,360
solar and wind farm use case

154
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,360
so first let's try to apply the same

155
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,280
architecture principle to this second

156
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,720
use case

157
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,199
so we still have our ot network on the

158
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:09,840
main operator site however here we only

159
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,080
have workstations and engineering

160
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,720
workstations on this

161
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,360
operator site the industrial process is

162
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,880
actually elsewhere

163
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,759
but then what do we have so the dmz zit

164
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:24,560
network the company network data center

165
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,880
and so still the remote access

166
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,720
but there where is the rest of the

167
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,360
industrial uh process so we have

168
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,759
industrial sites with

169
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:36,560
ot network and only a small assets

170
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,520
on this

171
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,560
network

172
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,280
but how can we interconnect these sites

173
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,759
with our main operator sites

174
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:46,800
and maybe a constraint here to start so

175
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,759
actually we wanted to implement mpls for

176
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:52,880
this network however we met with telecom

177
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,960
operators and they said that it was not

178
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,000
technically feasible to implement npls

179
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,120
on 20 of the sites due to geographical

180
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,280
constraints so here we have to use the

181
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,840
internet to interconnect the sites

182
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,800
so if we follow our previous

183
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,199
architecture principles what do we have

184
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:13,520
so we have a dmz we have a first

185
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,360
firewall between the ot network and the

186
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,479
dmz

187
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:19,039
we have a second firewall or router

188
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,759
between the dmz and the internet

189
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:23,759
since we need to communicate with the

190
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:26,319
main operator side but the only internet

191
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:28,479
access is the company network data

192
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:31,360
center we will have vpn ip sectionals

193
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,599
between these industrial sites and our

194
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:35,039
data center

195
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:37,039
we are not allowed to have any direct

196
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:39,840
communications so we have relay servers

197
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,240
in our dmz so here to make the

198
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,919
industrial sites communicate with the

199
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:45,919
main operator site we go through the

200
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:49,120
whole i.t network of the company

201
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,039
and then what do we have next because i

202
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,960
haven't forgotten the scada servers they

203
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,879
are hosted in the in the cloud in an

204
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:57,199
infrastructure as a service and here

205
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:00,160
similar constraints so the first dmd the

206
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,240
first firewall the second firewall the

207
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:06,879
vpn ipsec tunnel uh the proxy server

208
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:09,520
but does this architecture really work

209
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,919
and let's take an example with the most

210
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:14,240
boost flow for example between the main

211
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,160
operator site with the operator

212
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,599
workstations and the plcs or the scada

213
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:20,639
servers

214
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:23,120
with the plcs well

215
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,039
here we go through the whole i.t network

216
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:26,400
to make these sites

217
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,599
communicate with each other

218
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:31,120
but

219
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,240
actually can we really implement a proxy

220
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,799
in the dmz or shouldn't we authorize a

221
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:39,440
direct communication

222
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,839
these industrial sites and their main

223
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:43,679
sites

224
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:46,240
and you may have noticed that there is a

225
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,200
lot of

226
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,920
dmz's and firewalls in this architecture

227
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,320
and for the small industrial site so we

228
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,399
have two firewalls per site

229
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:56,560
and actually it might be feasible if we

230
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,040
only have a couple of sites but imagine

231
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,000
you need to interconnect 300 industrial

232
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:02,880
sites

233
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,680
well it does not scale and it seems a

234
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,160
bit too much for this architecture so

235
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,720
let's try something else

236
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,120
so what could we build and implement

237
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,800
that would still be considered as a

238
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,880
secure architecture for our solar and

239
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,880
wind farm use case

240
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,320
so like i said

241
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,800
many different ot networks and these

242
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,640
industrial sites that are geographically

243
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,200
distributed we have our main operator

244
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,080
site

245
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,399
with only workstations we have our

246
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:32,800
industrial sites with no human presence

247
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,480
and only a couple of assets on the

248
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,120
network and we have the scada servers

249
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,880
hosting in the cloud

250
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,600
and these sites need to use the internet

251
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,760
as a transport means to communicate with

252
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,600
each other

253
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,160
so what can we have here and

254
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,720
one secure solution would be to

255
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,120
implement and virtually create a wide

256
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,480
area network leveraging sd1 technology

257
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,480
but remember our meeting with the

258
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,519
telecom operators earlier well it's them

259
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:03,600
were recommended to implement

260
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,440
sd1 in this architecture but what is sd1

261
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,640
software defined wide area network so

262
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,200
here you virtually create your wide area

263
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,399
network

264
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:17,920
with a network of vpn tunnels over any

265
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,079
physical network so this way you can

266
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:21,839
have very different

267
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:23,360
physical network

268
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,760
like public internet different operator

269
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:29,440
networks radio and still build you one

270
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,760
using logical segmentation

271
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,240
so what do we have here so we will have

272
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,200
sd1 edges at each location

273
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,320
with embedded next generation firewalls

274
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,760
and we will build vpn tunnels between

275
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,680
each of the locations so we will make

276
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,440
communicate the main operator site with

277
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,519
the industrial sites and the cloud

278
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:51,920
communicate with industrial sites

279
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,480
however the industrial sites themselves

280
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,760
won't be

281
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,279
connected to each other but because

282
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:59,040
there is no real need

283
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,560
of communication between these

284
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,240
industrial sites

285
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,279
and

286
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:05,440
within this vpn tunnels we will

287
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,320
implement network filtering to only

288
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,880
allow legitimate communications so the

289
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,440
modbus flow for example

290
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,560
and we can

291
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:18,079
also add detection by activating ids

292
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:22,480
functionalities on these sd1 edges

293
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,160
but where is the rest of the

294
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:27,519
architecture so we still have a dmz but

295
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:29,440
here we have a dmz between the ot

296
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,920
network and the internet directly so we

297
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,399
do not go through the it network anymore

298
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:37,360
and what do we have in this otdmz we

299
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,360
have different zones protected by

300
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,000
different firewalls we have the central

301
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,800
services dmv and the external dmz so the

302
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:48,079
remote access will go through here again

303
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:50,000
so we have the remote workstation that

304
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,560
will connect to the global ot vpn then

305
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,880
access the bastion server on the central

306
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,440
services dmz and finally be able to

307
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,440
connect directly to the industrial

308
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,560
assets through the sd1 architecture and

309
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,320
network

310
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,639
and what do we have also in the central

311
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:08,880
services dmz still the updates and

312
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,440
antivirus server and here these servers

313
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,000
will get their updates directly

314
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,560
from the internet through a url

315
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,639
whitelisting through proxies for example

316
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:20,720
on the external dmz and then these

317
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,560
servers with will distribute their

318
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,600
updates

319
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,639
directly

320
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:27,920
on the ot network through the sd1

321
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,760
architecture

322
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,600
and imagine in this architecture you

323
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,519
need to interconnect

324
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,440
external partners for example our

325
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,120
external cloud

326
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,800
well you can have additional flow

327
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,800
controls and analysis

328
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:41,680
with

329
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,680
relays and proxies for example for

330
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:47,600
standard protocols such as https or sftp

331
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,160
and you can also have a network probe

332
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:53,279
for industrial protocols

333
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:55,519
but where is the iot network in this

334
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:57,519
architecture because we still need to

335
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:00,079
have interconnection with the it network

336
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:02,880
however the interconnection won't be at

337
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,360
the main operator site level the

338
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,079
interconnection will be done directly

339
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:10,800
through the cloud with a dedicated

340
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,440
firewall between the central otdmz and

341
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,959
the iit network

342
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:18,240
and we probably have another one network

343
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,560
to interconnect the sites with the cloud

344
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:23,120
for the iot network

345
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,200
so what are the differences with this

346
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,519
architecture and the previous one

347
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:31,040
well here we have ot communications

348
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,639
that are not going through the it

349
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:35,760
network anymore we have a dmz between

350
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,639
the ot network and the internet directly

351
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:41,600
and we only have one global dmz for the

352
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,839
ot network

353
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:45,360
so what are the key requirements for

354
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,920
this architecture first we have the vpn

355
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,000
ipsec tunnels between the industrial

356
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,839
sites that are communicating through the

357
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:54,399
internet and in this architecture we are

358
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:56,639
using sd1 technology

359
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:59,199
second point we have a global dmz

360
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:02,160
between the ot network and the internet

361
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,000
so we do not go through the it network

362
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,199
anymore

363
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:06,720
third point we have firewalls with

364
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,800
restricted firewall rules and so we have

365
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,279
firewalls at each location of the ot

366
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:14,079
network we have firewalls in the otdmz

367
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:16,079
and we have firewalls to protect the

368
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:18,399
internet and the iot network

369
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:19,920
and first point

370
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,000
we have a network probe in the dmz for

371
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,959
flows analysis and especially for flows

372
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:27,040
that cannot be proxified and have relays

373
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:30,160
of proxy

374
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,760
so to sum up this architecture um here

375
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,839
for the solar and wind farm use case we

376
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:37,920
have a multi-connectivity using the

377
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,120
internet

378
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,839
we have we are leveraging sd1 technology

379
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:44,480
to create a fully distributed industrial

380
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,120
network over the internet with a large

381
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,720
cloud strategy

382
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,120
and we adapt the purdue model and place

383
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,800
the components based on their

384
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,279
functionality and not

385
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:56,839
where they are

386
00:14:56,839 --> 00:14:59,440
geographically in

387
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,800
in the network

388
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,560
because the internet tends to be

389
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:05,120
represented as a level five which is not

390
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,920
really accurate and especially in this

391
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,760
case

392
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,680
however be careful because this

393
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,600
architecture is actually riskier than

394
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,160
the historical one and maintaining a

395
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:19,040
good cyber security level is difficult

396
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,519
and drifts can be observed over time

397
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:24,279
especially with sd1 for example with a

398
00:15:24,279 --> 00:15:27,360
misconfiguration of one of the sd1 edge

399
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,800
we could

400
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,320
completely

401
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,560
expose one of the industrial sites

402
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,279
directly on the internet

403
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:37,680
so here we have several requirements

404
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,920
that needs to be respected to protect

405
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,920
the industrial assets

406
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,040
first

407
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,120
we need to control the communications

408
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,759
from end to end and the communications

409
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:50,959
needs to be secured based on their level

410
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:53,360
and the business need so for example the

411
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,240
vpn tunnel the network filtering and

412
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,320
based on the use cases we can have also

413
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,360
relays

414
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,199
authentication and encryption for the

415
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:04,399
communication as well as detection

416
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:06,560
and actually in this architecture rigor

417
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,120
is key and what i like also about this

418
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,120
architecture is that cyber security

419
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:15,519
basics will need to be respected finally

420
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:18,639
but now how can we define cyber security

421
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:22,079
requirements and differentiate this ics

422
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:24,480
secure architectures and we are still

423
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,480
working on the same

424
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,759
company

425
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:29,759
so actually this architecture for the

426
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:31,680
solar and wind farm case can be

427
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,759
considered as a secure one

428
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:36,000
however it might be too risky for the

429
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,720
power plant use case and earlier we said

430
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,959
that the historical architecture

431
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:42,720
would be a bit too much for the solar

432
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,480
and wind farm use case

433
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,240
so maybe can we build something around

434
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,720
risks

435
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:51,360
so let's try to build an ics

436
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:54,240
classification methodology so here the

437
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,639
goal would be to uh classify our

438
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:58,320
industrial systems

439
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,399
and not the industrial sites completely

440
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:02,880
because there can be many different

441
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,640
industrial control systems within the

442
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,240
same industrial site

443
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,240
so here we will try to put our

444
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,000
industrial control systems on a risk

445
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,160
matrix and try to differentiate their

446
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,160
criticality

447
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,640
so actually we use a risk-based approach

448
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,199
following the iso 27k

449
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:19,919
and

450
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:23,039
in my case i took the nc which is the

451
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:25,679
french national security agency

452
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:28,480
ics classification methodology as a base

453
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:32,480
and i adapted to it to the context so i

454
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,320
won't detail the whole methodology but

455
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,559
only give you the main points

456
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:39,919
so first we have the impact so here we

457
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:43,440
use the company global hcc

458
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,080
impact scale and it needs to be adapted

459
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,640
to all businesses within the company

460
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,280
so we have an exp an impact scale on

461
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,919
several types of consequences like

462
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:55,840
environment human

463
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:59,360
image financial and the global

464
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:02,240
impact will be the maximum rated

465
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,960
impact by consequence

466
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,960
then we have the likelihood and here we

467
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,640
can have several factors that can be

468
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,840
considered

469
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,240
first the attackers level are we talking

470
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,400
about a non-targeted attack are we

471
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,799
talking about a private organization or

472
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:19,679
even a state organization

473
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:21,840
then we have the functionality so here

474
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,000
are we talking about a monitoring system

475
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,320
a command and control system or a safety

476
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,679
system

477
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:30,240
then we can consider the connectivity

478
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,720
am i talking about an isolated network

479
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,120
am i interconnected with a corporate

480
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,559
network

481
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:39,520
do i have a distributed network using a

482
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,720
public

483
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,120
network or private network

484
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,520
and another factor to consider would be

485
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,000
the level of access control so here we

486
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,919
are talking about identification

487
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:52,720
authentication and access control

488
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,960
so for each of this factor we will get a

489
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,440
number and then we have a formula to get

490
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,280
the final likelihood

491
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,600
and then with the impact and likelihood

492
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:05,440
we can put our ics on a risk matrix that

493
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,480
will give

494
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,799
give us the classification of the ics

495
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:10,799
and in this case we have four classes of

496
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:12,960
ics possible

497
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,120
and something important do not forget to

498
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:18,080
consider regulation because you may have

499
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,320
um

500
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:24,240
ics classification a minimum for certain

501
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,559
control systems so if you consider for

502
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:30,000
example uh critical infrastructures

503
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
so let's try this classification with

504
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,799
our two use cases example

505
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:38,000
so first we consider the impact so for

506
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,720
the power plant or refinery business

507
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:43,120
case here we have a high impact because

508
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,760
we have high hcc risks so we will

509
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,320
probably have an impact three

510
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,320
however for the solar and wind farm use

511
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:53,840
case here there is no hcc risk and

512
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,919
actually we cannot do much remotely

513
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:57,600
because i just started

514
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,000
starting or stopping the production so

515
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,159
actually here the highest impact will be

516
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:04,480
financial due to the loss

517
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,840
of production so here probably an impact

518
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,280
too

519
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,760
then for the likelihood to make to make

520
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,000
the case easier here we will consider

521
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,559
the same functionality the same attacker

522
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:19,039
level and the same access control so

523
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:20,640
it's the connectivity that will make the

524
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,000
difference

525
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,559
so here for the power plant and refinery

526
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:26,320
we have a low connectivity because we

527
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,120
have

528
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,960
an industrial network on a single

529
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,280
geographical

530
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,120
location and there is only a few

531
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,520
interconnections with the it network so

532
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,120
with the formula we will get a

533
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,960
likelihood of two

534
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,120
but for the solar and wind farm we have

535
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,880
eye connectivity because we have

536
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,200
geographically distributed industrial

537
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,120
sites that are communicating through a

538
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,400
public network

539
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,080
so with the formula we will get a

540
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,760
likelihood three

541
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:54,720
so in terms of classification we end up

542
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,799
with a class 3 system for the power

543
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:59,200
plant and refinery and a class 2 system

544
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,120
for the solar and wind farm

545
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,120
so we have a different classification

546
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,840
for our two use cases and so we can have

547
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,159
different cyber security requirements

548
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:10,640
for the different classifications so for

549
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,799
example for class 3 system

550
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:16,000
we could make mandatory to use mpls for

551
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,679
distributed network

552
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:20,080
we could forbid the use of

553
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,200
cloud

554
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,520
and external partners performing command

555
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,919
and control on their

556
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:27,280
systems

557
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:30,640
and however for class 2 we could allow

558
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,720
the use of public network

559
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,280
having vpn tunnels and network filtering

560
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,440
and we could allow command and control

561
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,080
from the cloud having vpn tunnels as

562
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,440
well but

563
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:44,240
also detection and network probe for

564
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,720
example

565
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,320
but

566
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,640
can it be sent simple well

567
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,400
unfortunately no

568
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:56,000
so let's take a step back on our example

569
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,159
what was the main decision factor for

570
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:00,159
the secure architecture it was

571
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:02,400
connectivity and impact

572
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,919
because for our

573
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:05,919
power plant and refinery

574
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:08,960
we have high hcc risk and so we do not

575
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,440
want to have a lot of interconnections

576
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:14,000
but for our solar and wind farm use case

577
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,600
there is not a lot of hcc risk and we

578
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,720
can allow to have

579
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:21,760
multi-connectivity using the internet

580
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,760
for example

581
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:27,280
but can we use additional factors uh and

582
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,440
can additional factors be considered to

583
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,120
help with the classification and

584
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,559
requirements

585
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:33,360
well

586
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,760
yes we can consider for example multiple

587
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,480
expositions because in this presentation

588
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,880
i talked a lot about cloud

589
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,120
interconnections but we can also

590
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,880
consider interconnections with

591
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,640
applications on the corporate network

592
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:49,120
for example and here we need to consider

593
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:51,679
and to consider the system as a whole

594
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:53,520
and consider the implications of

595
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:56,320
interconnection for the whole system

596
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,840
and for example

597
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:00,720
i talked a lot about the central

598
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:04,159
services otdmz but here since we are

599
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:06,080
talking about the same company do you

600
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,880
think we can mutualize the same zone for

601
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:12,240
our two examples or is the risk of

602
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,799
compromising our power plant through the

603
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:18,480
solar and wind farm is too high

604
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,120
and you can also have other factors to

605
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:24,480
consider regulations like i said earlier

606
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:27,520
but also physical access and if you talk

607
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:30,400
about iot you can also talk about device

608
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:33,919
access control and data confidentiality

609
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:37,039
but in the end be pragmatic and do not

610
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:39,600
stick to a formula you need to consider

611
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,159
key factors and make your classification

612
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:43,840
accordingly

613
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:46,000
and so one idea could be to build

614
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,919
architecture patterns so you can

615
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:50,480
identify several use cases for your

616
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:53,600
company and build reference architecture

617
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,600
based on risk analysis

618
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,279
and this will need to be maintained

619
00:23:57,279 --> 00:23:59,440
regularly as business needs and

620
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:02,840
technical capabilities evolve

621
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:05,120
regularly here the idea would be to

622
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,279
respect global cyber security

623
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:10,159
requirements for your ics depending on

624
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:12,640
your classification but then for the

625
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,880
detailed implementation you can use the

626
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:17,360
architecture patterns as a guide and

627
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:20,000
build adapted architecture for each of

628
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,039
your new use case

629
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,919
so now takeaways for the presentation

630
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:27,919
so we've seen that control systems can

631
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:30,320
be very different and thus the security

632
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:33,200
rules and architectures can be different

633
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,360
so we think that the historical ics

634
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:38,000
secure architecture is not applicable to

635
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,640
the new usages and that the purdue model

636
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,880
needs to be adapted

637
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,880
but what are the key factors to have in

638
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,600
mind for an architecture decision

639
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,480
well first what does the control system

640
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:53,760
do and what are the business needs

641
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,159
then what would be the impact and

642
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:58,880
especially in terms of hcc

643
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,600
and third what is my level of exposition

644
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:04,320
for my system especially in terms of

645
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,799
transport means but also in terms of

646
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:09,360
applications and other systems connected

647
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:12,159
to these applications

648
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:14,320
so the idea would be to document

649
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,799
concrete use cases for your company

650
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:18,240
because it will help in your

651
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:21,039
classification and architecture decision

652
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:23,039
and so i would recommend to

653
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:25,279
consider launching a task force to

654
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:27,360
support your projects and build secure

655
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:31,679
architectures for new ics usages

656
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:33,360
and the final thoughts

657
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:36,159
how can we find the right balance

658
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:37,600
because having different secure

659
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:40,159
architectures is good

660
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:42,880
for each of your new use cases but only

661
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,799
up to a certain level of

662
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:46,720
manageability because you will need to

663
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:49,039
manage these solutions and architectures

664
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:50,640
within your company

665
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,960
so unfortunately you cannot have as many

666
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:56,559
architectures as control systems

667
00:25:56,559 --> 00:26:00,200
thank you for your attention
