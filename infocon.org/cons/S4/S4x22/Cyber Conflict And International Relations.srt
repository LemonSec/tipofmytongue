1
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:07,120
good morning everyone i really want to

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:09,280
thank dale for inviting me to speak

3
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:10,559
today because

4
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:12,240
there's nothing like talking about cyber

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,240
security to a room full of cyber

6
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:15,759
security experts

7
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:16,560
it's

8
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,880
intimidating and it can be fun

9
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,439
it's intimidating because you guys have

10
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:23,600
robust situational awareness about the

11
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,439
domains you're experts in

12
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:27,119
but maybe it'll be a little bit fun

13
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:29,599
because perhaps i can give you a

14
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:31,519
slightly different lens from which to

15
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:34,079
look at the same data as the same facts

16
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:36,079
the same trends the same events that

17
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:38,239
we're all looking at every day

18
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:41,280
so my lens is that of national security

19
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,559
and today

20
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:45,680
that includes war modern warfare and

21
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,600
international conflict

22
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,239
over the past two decades driven in a

23
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:52,800
large part by the internet revolution

24
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,199
we have set the conditions for modern

25
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:57,920
warfare and it's all playing out in the

26
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,359
war between russia and ukraine

27
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:03,199
now modern conflict is simply going to

28
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:04,799
be different than anything we've seen

29
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:07,520
before when most people think about war

30
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,680
they think about guns and tanks and

31
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:10,720
missiles

32
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:14,159
not electrons but it's electrons it's

33
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:16,240
cyber that's going to change the face of

34
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,400
modern warfare and it requires us to

35
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,159
adjust our perspective

36
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:22,000
there's three ways in which cyber is

37
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,520
changing war that i want to touch on

38
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,439
today there's a lot more but these are

39
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:27,600
the three that i want to focus on

40
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,600
the first is technology

41
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,680
the second is social media

42
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,320
and the third is data

43
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,119
now

44
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:36,960
i have this slide up

45
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,720
not just because i love standing in

46
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,960
front of it for absolutely as long as

47
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,799
possible

48
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:44,000
but also

49
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,200
because the hack of russian car charging

50
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,439
stations was the first time an iot hack

51
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:55,360
took place in the context of war

52
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,520
and this hack didn't just deface these

53
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,520
car charging stations it meant that

54
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,600
russians couldn't charge their cars it

55
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,600
meant that russians couldn't drive their

56
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,119
cars

57
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:06,960
this hack also highlights another theme

58
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,318
that i'm going to hit on repeatedly

59
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:11,120
today and that's the increasing

60
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,879
privatization of war capabilities

61
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:17,360
okay so let's start with technology now

62
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,959
you guys have all seen some version of

63
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:22,160
this slide before right by 2025 it's

64
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,280
predicted that we're going to have

65
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,319
somewhere between 27 billion and 37

66
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:28,400
billion connected devices

67
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,519
you all also know that the growth in iot

68
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:33,360
devices expands the cyber threat

69
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,560
landscape

70
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,400
now when you put on the lens of modern

71
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,599
conflict

72
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:40,319
the rate of growth of connected devices

73
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:43,519
the expanding hyper-connected ecosystem

74
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:45,200
that we all live in

75
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,840
is inherently fragile more fragile with

76
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,680
each connected device

77
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,440
and this fragility creates the

78
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,000
foundational risk and the foundational

79
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,760
opportunities in modern war

80
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,760
who would have thought that electric car

81
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,400
charging stations would act as an attack

82
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,360
vector during a war

83
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,000
now as we look to the future of smart

84
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,400
cities we can imagine a time when these

85
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,080
attacks are going to be more than just

86
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,400
mere annoyances but

87
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,360
represent the possibility of systemic

88
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,840
failure for our cities

89
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,920
peter singer and august cole wrote a

90
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,680
book called burn-in which explores this

91
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,959
topic and i recommend everyone read it

92
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:28,480
here's another slide you guys have all

93
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,720
seen some version of before right

94
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,560
it's the expanding drumbeat of cyber

95
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,879
attacks of breaches of ransomware

96
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:37,760
attacks of ip theft of data theft

97
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,920
what's interesting when you look at it

98
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,760
from the lens of modern conflict is that

99
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:45,840
privatization is blurring the lines

100
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,799
between criminal and state actors and

101
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:50,000
actions

102
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,400
are russian ransomware gangs just

103
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,879
criminals are they proxies for the

104
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:56,400
kremlin

105
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,519
if the colonial pipeline hack took place

106
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:00,959
today

107
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:03,920
would that count as an act of war

108
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,519
would that invoke article 5 of nato and

109
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:10,400
mean that both the u.s and europe have

110
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,280
been pulled into this conflict

111
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,120
we have never responded to criminal act

112
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,519
with military response it's just not how

113
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,600
democracy works

114
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,560
but while our response to crime to

115
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,479
espionage and to war is not unified

116
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:31,840
the use of crime and espionage as part

117
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:32,880
of war

118
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,919
as part of strategic global competition

119
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:38,960
is becoming increasingly unified by our

120
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,400
adversaries

121
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,800
a real-time example of this took place

122
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,960
when early in the russia-ukraine war the

123
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,440
russians hacked viasat

124
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,240
now biden had previously said that an

125
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,639
attack on u.s infrastructure would lead

126
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:54,560
to a u.s response

127
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,360
and

128
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,919
with this attack we see the complexity

129
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:00,720
of that decision-making process

130
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,440
does an attack on a u.s

131
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,639
telecommunications company that

132
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:07,440
primarily impacts ukrainian and european

133
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,639
customers count as an act of war

134
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:12,800
does it warrant retaliation

135
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,360
does it invoke article 5 of nato

136
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,520
the impact of this attack went far

137
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,080
beyond ukraine's borders does that mean

138
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,360
that the war

139
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,199
now has expanded beyond ukraine's

140
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:24,639
borders

141
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:27,039
importantly with the viasat attack

142
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:29,440
we witnessed cyber war extending into

143
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,840
space for the first time and we need to

144
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,440
move quickly to secure space assets

145
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,360
now speaking of space

146
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,680
what happens when a u.s company provides

147
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,840
critical capabilities to a country

148
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:45,039
during wartime elon musk with starlink

149
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:47,440
provides ukrainians with a distributed

150
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,240
and privatized communication alternative

151
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,320
that's much more resilient to attack

152
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,720
than viasat

153
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,759
now

154
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:58,240
one of the complexities of cyberwar is

155
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,479
this issue of attribution now if you

156
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:02,160
look on the

157
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,360
left side

158
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,800
you'll see that with traditional

159
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,960
military conflict the ttps for

160
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,199
attribution are well understood when we

161
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:11,199
launch missile attacks we can tell where

162
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,560
they were launched from whether it's

163
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,759
land air or sea cyber is very different

164
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:17,840
and you can see that with the cyber

165
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,199
attack slide

166
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:21,919
the physical location of the attack has

167
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:24,400
very little to do with who's actually

168
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,080
behind that attack

169
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,000
now here's a video of an attack that

170
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,680
took place actually it's not an attack

171
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,919
it's multiple attacks that took place a

172
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:33,199
few weeks ago

173
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:35,199
if you look at this closely you'll see

174
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:38,160
that san francisco is attacking new york

175
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,840
i actually think san francisco at some

176
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,680
point attacks australia while brazil

177
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,759
attacks the midwest

178
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:45,919
getting to perfect attribution in cyber

179
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:47,520
is more like putting puzzle pieces

180
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,479
together

181
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:50,479
we can do it we're actually really good

182
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:51,599
at it

183
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:54,160
but can we do it with the certainty that

184
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,960
you need to justify military retaliation

185
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,199
especially retaliation that's timely

186
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:01,520
that's proportional and that's accurate

187
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,479
during an active conflict

188
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:06,400
now cyber attribution is further

189
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,400
complicated by the fact that our

190
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,199
adversaries russia china iran north

191
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:13,120
korea

192
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,039
they deny that they were behind these

193
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:17,520
attacks it allows them to operate in the

194
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,080
gray zone below the threshold of war

195
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,160
keep in mind that once attribution is

196
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,039
made then the public expects action to

197
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:26,000
follow

198
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,919
this is why we sometimes see the u.s

199
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:29,759
government hesitating to attribute a

200
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:32,319
particular attack to a particular actor

201
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:34,880
especially if it's the nation state it's

202
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,120
to manage escalation risk

203
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,199
and you know we saw that with viasat

204
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:40,960
because while some cyber security firms

205
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,280
have definitively said that russia was

206
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,840
behind the viasat attack the united

207
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,919
states has not yet named russia as the

208
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:49,599
source of that attack

209
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:51,919
attribution of that attack to russia

210
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:54,639
today creates a lot of complexity when

211
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:57,039
you put on the lens of modern conflict

212
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:58,960
now i just touched on a few ways that

213
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,520
tech transformation is impacting modern

214
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,960
conflict there's a lot of other ones and

215
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,199
we could spend days talking about it the

216
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:07,199
important thing to keep in mind is that

217
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:09,840
the velocity of technologies change for

218
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,160
the first time in human history is

219
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,360
outpacing our ability as humans to adapt

220
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,199
and to gain mastery

221
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:19,759
harvard professor e.o wilson famously

222
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:22,560
said years ago the real problem with

223
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,720
humanity is the following

224
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,280
we have paleolithic emotions we have

225
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,599
medieval institutions and we have

226
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:31,599
god-like technology

227
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:34,159
and it's terrifically dangerous and it's

228
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:37,679
now approaching a point of crisis

229
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:39,599
okay so let's turn to the second area i

230
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:41,279
want to discuss and that's the

231
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:44,320
transformation in social media social

232
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,040
engagement and social interaction

233
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,920
what we have today is a social ecosystem

234
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,000
that's dominated by a few technology

235
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,080
platforms that are driving entirely new

236
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,240
types of behavior that it turns out

237
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,800
we're completely unprepared for

238
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,040
some of these behaviors are authentic

239
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,880
but a lot of them are not

240
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,560
and that includes misinformation

241
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,519
disinformation mal information and flat

242
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:08,880
out lies

243
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,880
keeping in mind by the way

244
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,279
that false and negative news have a

245
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:15,839
virality that truth can't match isn't

246
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:18,560
that amazing by the way that we prefer

247
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,760
we prefer

248
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,560
false and negative news to the truth

249
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,800
that's our cognitive biases

250
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,640
and it's all changing not just social

251
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,880
dynamics at a tremendous cost to our

252
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:29,920
children

253
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:33,440
but it's also changing the face of war

254
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,320
this new social ecosystem can catch even

255
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,480
the most sophisticated investors off

256
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,279
guard as was the case when we saw a rate

257
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:43,680
on the securities market coordinated on

258
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:47,200
reddit that cost sophisticated investors

259
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,959
19 billion dollars twitter can change

260
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:52,080
history

261
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:56,240
on may 2nd 2011 a pakistani man tweeted

262
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,640
live in jalalabad that he was hearing

263
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,320
and seeing helicopters in the middle of

264
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,040
the night which was a pretty rare thing

265
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,279
now that was as the us was preparing to

266
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:07,600
raid bin laden's compound

267
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,079
if either osama bin laden or the

268
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:12,000
pakistanis were paying attention to

269
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,839
twitter that night

270
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:16,320
the entire outcome of that mission and

271
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,040
potentially history would have been very

272
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,240
different

273
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,160
now social media can also have an

274
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,399
incredibly positive outcome through the

275
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:26,720
lens of modern conflict the early

276
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,120
lessons from the ukraine war is that

277
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,079
social media and information warfare can

278
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:34,720
be a determinative factor in the outcome

279
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,079
of conflict

280
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:38,640
before russia's invasion of ukraine

281
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,959
zielenski's approval rating was 26

282
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:42,399
percent

283
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:44,640
after the invasion it was over 90

284
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,920
percent his selfies his videos his talks

285
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,760
together with all the images that were

286
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,519
crowdsourced and stitched together

287
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:54,079
showing a united ukraine fighting for

288
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:56,399
freedom have fundamentally changed the

289
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:58,959
dynamics of those war in favor of

290
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:01,600
ukraine which is otherwise completely

291
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,320
outmanned and under-equipped in a

292
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,920
traditional military sense

293
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,560
as a result of this infowar campaign the

294
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:13,440
ukrainian public became mobilized

295
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,200
germany went from committing a few

296
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,000
helmets to committing anti-tank weapons

297
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,800
switzerland switzerland which had

298
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,519
been neutral throughout world war ii and

299
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:26,800
in the face of nazi atrocities shed that

300
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,360
historic neutrality and came out against

301
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,079
the war even halliburton suspended

302
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:34,800
operations in russia

303
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,519
public sentiment has driven

304
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:40,240
public policy and corporate policy in

305
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,360
this war

306
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,760
and by winning the like war

307
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,720
the ukrainians actually stand a fighting

308
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,600
chance against russia

309
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,680
now of course we have to touch on deep

310
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,600
fakes now you guys have all seen the

311
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,320
obama and the joe rogan d d fake so i'm

312
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,839
not going to share them with you and a

313
00:11:57,839 --> 00:11:59,760
couple weeks ago there was a really bad

314
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,160
deep fake of zelinski conceding the war

315
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,760
floating around facebook but that got

316
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,480
taken down pretty quickly now we all

317
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,320
know that the technology for deep fakes

318
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,279
is ubiquitous is out there anyone can do

319
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:13,600
it high school student actually middle

320
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,880
school student could probably make a

321
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,560
deep fake these days

322
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,440
what i want to show you is a video that

323
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,000
thrasher magazine made about four years

324
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,800
ago that can help us imagine what could

325
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,040
happen here if you put some resources

326
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,440
against the concept of hey i'm uh glenn

327
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,120
larson today we'll be shooting jeff

328
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,040
doing a 360 inward healed on the

329
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:37,639
legendary el cabra stair set

330
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:50,189
[Music]

331
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,839
all right right here

332
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,000
and pop

333
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,240
that's what it takes to make these

334
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,560
things look legit you know

335
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,639
i think i was about 16 or 17 when i

336
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:10,000
found out the truth about how skate

337
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,360
videos are made

338
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,240
i mean

339
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,160
before i thought the 900 was actually a

340
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,360
real trick

341
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,760
and i figured out it's just as fake as

342
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:22,160
someone landing on the moon all right

343
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,040
okay

344
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:26,240
was that real was it a parody maybe

345
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,880
maybe not who knows but the truth is

346
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,399
that the human eye can't tell the

347
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:32,480
difference anymore and consider what

348
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,079
happens when it's just not an individual

349
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,920
making a deep vape but you actually use

350
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,399
resources you use technology it's going

351
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:40,720
to get harder and harder

352
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,519
to tell the difference between truth and

353
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:44,880
lies

354
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,880
and by the way if you think cyber

355
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,959
attribution is hard try mapping

356
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:51,279
information flows this is a network

357
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:53,920
graph by the company blackbird.ai

358
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,680
that's tracking a narrative around

359
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,320
russia ukraine for one organization over

360
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,040
a two-week period each color represents

361
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,240
an attribute red is misinformation the

362
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,000
other colors represents communities

363
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,959
personas organizations individuals

364
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:11,440
traditional social media tools cannot

365
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,560
grapple with the complexity of traffic

366
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,360
traffic tracking these data flows and

367
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,760
how they relate across social media

368
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,320
platforms the sophistication of the

369
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,560
tools that are required to do this are

370
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:27,199
truly next level

371
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:28,079
okay

372
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:31,440
so let's turn to the third aspect

373
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,040
of modern cough link that i want to talk

374
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,120
about and that's data and i really want

375
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,639
to focus on the intersection of physical

376
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:41,519
and digital data and the fusion of those

377
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:43,600
two things

378
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,079
it's hard not to be either

379
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:49,360
incredibly impressed or incredibly

380
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,399
terrified by how effectively china has

381
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:54,000
fused the digital and the physical

382
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,120
domains

383
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,519
china's social scoring system combines

384
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:00,000
data and intelligences from a multitude

385
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,279
of sources

386
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:03,279
correlates them in real time applies

387
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:05,519
intelligence and analyzes it to generate

388
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:08,639
a social score that determines in real

389
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:11,199
time whether someone represents a threat

390
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:12,959
to the state or whether they're

391
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:14,480
trustworthy

392
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,240
and if you think that doesn't happen in

393
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,320
the west you're dead wrong

394
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,680
but it's just not driven by the

395
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:20,639
government

396
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:22,639
the faces of the riot website was

397
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:25,360
created by a teenager in washington dc

398
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,440
who used open source intelligence and

399
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,959
open source software to identify 6 000

400
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:33,360
pictures of people's faces

401
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:36,399
at around the riot on january 6th in a

402
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:38,959
complete role reversal from china the

403
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:41,199
u.s citizens use of surveillance

404
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:44,399
technology informed the u.s government's

405
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:46,959
understanding of what happened during

406
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:48,639
the capital riots

407
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:52,399
in this case the u.s government needed a

408
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:55,600
distributed decentralized and privatized

409
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,399
citizen army to help identify these

410
00:15:58,399 --> 00:15:59,839
individuals

411
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:01,600
and you know it gets more granular than

412
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,839
that the new york times assembled a

413
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:06,480
clear picture of how the combination of

414
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,279
mobile phone data advertiser data and

415
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:12,320
social media data can be used to fully

416
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,959
reconstruct one man's participation in

417
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:17,839
the riot from his home in kentucky

418
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:20,240
all the way to washington d.c

419
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,480
to his time at trump rally

420
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,079
all the way to the steps of the capitol

421
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:26,560
building and with precision his

422
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:30,639
movements inside the capitol building

423
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:33,120
similarly the ukrainians have been able

424
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,920
to track russian troops using the same

425
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:38,000
kind of technology that made ronnie

426
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,800
vincent so easily trackable

427
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,880
at technology on phones

428
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,160
has become

429
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:47,279
targeting technology in war

430
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:49,680
now on the positive side all of this

431
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,600
data can also be used to establish

432
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,639
ground truth when lies are so ubiquitous

433
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:56,800
hawkeye 360 is a private company that

434
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,199
uses a constellation of satellites to

435
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:01,120
track radio frequency signals around the

436
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,079
world

437
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:05,520
in april 2020 as beijing announced that

438
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,359
the pandemic was completely under

439
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:10,000
control and that 70 of the ports in

440
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,880
wuhan were back up and operating hawkeye

441
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,160
360 imagery showed that they were not

442
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,160
that the that the port was essentially

443
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,640
still shut down to traffic

444
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,199
basically unmasking beijing's lies the

445
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:25,760
red dot is is the red circle is wuhan

446
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,039
and you can see the difference between

447
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:28,960
the traffic and wuhan and the shanghai

448
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:29,919
ports

449
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:32,400
once again the power of privatization

450
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,760
comes to life

451
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,679
with capabilities like those of hawkeye

452
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:36,960
360

453
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,600
society has access to intelligence and

454
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,600
information that used to be the sole

455
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,679
purview of government it used to be that

456
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:46,160
only governments could track the assets

457
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,000
of other governments that's no longer

458
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,760
the case and think about the

459
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,400
implications of that from a from the

460
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,440
perspective of modern warfare

461
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,840
the ubiquity of satellite imagery is a

462
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:01,280
game changer spacex has now democratized

463
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,360
satellite launches with low-cost and

464
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,280
frequent launches you pay by the

465
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,679
kilogram you obtain a quote online and

466
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:09,039
today the price for launching a

467
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:10,720
satellite is somewhere around a hundred

468
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,799
thousand dollars with off-the-shelf

469
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:14,720
components that you can carry in your

470
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:15,760
arms

471
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,000
you can task these satellites by the way

472
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,640
you can task these satellites with apps

473
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,760
like spy mesat using your smartphone and

474
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,240
as a result close to 8 billion people

475
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,640
have access to high quality space

476
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,840
imagery

477
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,360
prices range from the hundreds of

478
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,600
dollars to the thousands of dollars for

479
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,840
images of vic varying quality and

480
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,880
they're available for purchase to anyone

481
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,360
the iranian government use commercial

482
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:44,720
satellite imagery to monitor anal assad

483
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,720
air base in iraq

484
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,640
as it prepared to launch

485
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:51,760
dozens of ballistic missiles against u.s

486
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:54,480
and allied forces coalition forces now

487
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,480
just think about that the iranian

488
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,720
government used commercial satellite

489
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:02,880
imagery to target u.s forces

490
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,360
planet earth will soon be entirely

491
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:08,320
instrumented from space to earth

492
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,400
generating data which when fused with

493
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,880
intelligence fundamentally transforms

494
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,360
modern conflict both from an offensive

495
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,840
and a defensive perspective

496
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,840
we're used to living in a world where

497
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,160
there have been always been places and

498
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,840
activities and locations that have been

499
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,200
invisible to us

500
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,600
we're moving to a world where every

501
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,840
square meter of planet earth is

502
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,320
instrumented and available to purchase

503
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,000
for individuals

504
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,720
this means that secrecy is harder

505
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,720
this means that clandestine operations

506
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:39,760
are harder

507
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:43,679
this means that deception is harder

508
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:45,600
hours before putin announced the start

509
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,360
of special military operations on

510
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:50,559
february 24th a group of open source

511
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:53,600
intel analysts in california tracking

512
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,919
traffic flows on google maps

513
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:58,240
called out that the invasion of ukraine

514
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,640
by russia had begun

515
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,960
ukrainian radio radio watchers is a

516
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,720
collection of private open source

517
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:07,360
analysts who use software-defined radios

518
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:10,080
to intercept unencrypted russian radio

519
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:13,120
communications to identify russian plan

520
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:16,159
and prevent the attacks making signals

521
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:18,799
intelligence sigin decentralized

522
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:21,280
distributed and privatized by the way

523
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,039
there's really good question as to why

524
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:25,280
the russians are using unencrypted radio

525
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,440
communications and it either means that

526
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,280
they just haven't modernized the way

527
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,600
they'd led the world to believe or that

528
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,320
they're having problems encrypting and

529
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,320
exchanging private keys we'll find out

530
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,320
at some point

531
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,080
now let's play this forward

532
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,520
if you stitch together these three

533
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,600
inputs to modern conflict technology

534
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,760
social media and data what does it all

535
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,679
mean as we look to the future

536
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:49,360
looking at the russia ukraine conflict

537
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,280
what everybody wants to know is how's

538
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,880
this going to turn out

539
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,799
and maybe there was a time when you

540
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:57,360
crunched enough numbers and you worked

541
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,200
really really hard you could make

542
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,799
reliable predictions

543
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:01,840
today

544
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,760
with these new conditions for modern

545
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,559
conflict we need to assume that reliable

546
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:08,880
predictions are really hard to make one

547
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,120
and we have to embrace the fact that we

548
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,039
live in the world of conditional

549
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:14,400
probabilities

550
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,200
now anyone hear a poker player

551
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,080
anyone so i play texas hold'em try to as

552
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,320
often as i can i don't like omaha

553
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,400
but you know what makes a great poker

554
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,640
player right it's someone who's mastered

555
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,200
the concept of conditional probabilities

556
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,039
and that's the world that we live in

557
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:33,440
except the velocity is changing the

558
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:36,480
cards are being dealt much more quickly

559
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,159
some cards are dealt face up some are

560
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:41,440
dealt face down but every single card

561
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:44,240
changes the outcome of any given hand

562
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,960
and requires us to reassess our next

563
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,080
move

564
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,000
and great poker players don't just play

565
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,440
their hand they don't just play the

566
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:54,240
cards they play the player

567
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,200
today

568
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,760
we're playing russia and putin

569
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:00,880
their game is aggressive but it's loose

570
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,640
that changes the outcome

571
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,720
the next hand might be against

572
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:07,760
beijing and xi they play an entirely

573
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,799
different game their game is disciplined

574
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:13,520
it's professional and it's tight

575
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,520
and they're playing to win the world

576
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,960
tournament

577
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,679
and you can bet that they will reassess

578
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:22,559
as every card is dealt

579
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:26,640
in 1945 eisenhower's genius in planning

580
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:29,440
for d-day was recognizing the fact that

581
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:32,400
plans don't survive first contact with

582
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,880
the enemy his willingness to adapt to

583
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:37,280
the situation on the ground unlike say

584
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,600
the french and their maginot line was

585
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,600
the difference between victory and

586
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,840
defeat for the allies

587
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:46,240
when we don't adapt our thinking

588
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:49,520
when we suffer failures of imagination

589
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,440
horrible things can happen

590
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,960
when the first world trade center

591
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:55,360
bombing happened in 1993

592
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:56,880
we assumed that it was an exception and

593
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,799
that it would never happen again

594
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:01,039
these dangerous embedded assumptions we

595
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:02,240
hold on to

596
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,320
get in the way of our ability to be

597
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:07,520
agile and to adapt it's how we miss the

598
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,640
japanese plantain to attack pearl harbor

599
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,120
it's how we miss the rise of populism

600
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,520
it's how we dismiss the viability of a

601
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:19,039
trump candidacy over and over again it's

602
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:21,360
how we miss the threat that al qaeda

603
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:24,000
represented to the homeland

604
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,240
agile software development is a

605
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,559
methodology that allows us to code with

606
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:31,520
a mindset of continuous adaptability we

607
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,679
will have to mirror this mindset of

608
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:36,000
systemic experimentation

609
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,480
with agile conflict response

610
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,880
and we have to make sure that we reduce

611
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,520
unnecessary friction in decision making

612
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,760
as we move toward an agile and adaptive

613
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:48,480
decision-making model including in how

614
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,360
we organize in the us government

615
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,600
general nakasoni who's the commander of

616
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,440
cyber command and director of nsa

617
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:58,240
recently testified to con to congress

618
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,960
that the unity of effort is critical in

619
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,480
defending our nation

620
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:05,039
enabling the speed and agility necessary

621
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:07,520
to meet the strategic challenges posed

622
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,120
by our adversaries

623
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:12,080
we have great early examples of this the

624
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,400
russia small group was a coordinated

625
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:17,120
effort between nsa and cyber command

626
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,279
that effectively interrupted russian

627
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:20,400
interference

628
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:23,440
efforts with the 2018 midterm elections

629
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,360
those lessons were carried forward to

630
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,919
the 2020 elections which they also

631
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:30,960
effectively protected

632
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,279
in the russia-ukraine conflict we have

633
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:35,760
adapted our approach to intelligence and

634
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:38,480
it has paid off tremendously

635
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,400
historically the intelligence community

636
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,880
held onto its collections very tightly

637
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:45,440
it was very close we classify them and

638
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,440
we limit disclosure to a very small

639
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,840
group of allies and and that happens for

640
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,840
a really good reason by sharing

641
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,919
intelligence you reveal sources and

642
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:56,320
methods and you risk putting people at

643
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,799
risk and losing access that's by

644
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:01,039
definition very hard to get and very

645
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:03,039
hard to maintain

646
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:05,360
real-time disclosure of classified

647
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,600
information which is what we've done in

648
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:11,440
this war is a stunning change in policy

649
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:14,320
by disclosing specifics about troop

650
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,400
locations about coup attempts about

651
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:19,279
false flag operations the united states

652
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:21,440
was able to claim a first mover

653
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:24,080
advantage in the information war space

654
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:27,279
and by doing that we pre-bonked putin's

655
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:28,640
attempts at misinformation and

656
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:31,440
disinformation we informed the public

657
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,960
which has changed the dynamics of this

658
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:35,360
conflict we mobilized the ukrainian

659
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:38,159
public we shored up faltering alliances

660
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:40,240
and made it really hard for countries

661
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,840
and organizations to stay on the

662
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,679
sideline and get away with just making

663
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:45,440
performative statements

664
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:48,080
we fundamentally changed the extent of

665
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,480
the sanctions that were imposed we armed

666
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,080
the war fighters with the information

667
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:54,400
they needed to defend their homeland and

668
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,559
we've potentially deterred certain

669
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:58,880
actors and certain actions

670
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:01,120
we not only showcase our incredible

671
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,840
intelligence community capabilities but

672
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:06,240
how those capabilities with a different

673
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:09,200
approach can quickly change the

674
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,679
situation on the ground

675
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:13,360
looking at the situation on the ground

676
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:14,720
ukraine is

677
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:17,840
so massively outmatched and outmanned

678
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:20,400
from a traditional military perspective

679
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,720
from their troops that their soldiers

680
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,880
they're outmatched four to one their air

681
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:27,679
force is outmatched 13-1 their navy is

682
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:30,400
outmatched 16-1 putin's assumption that

683
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,640
this was going to be a three-day war

684
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,960
wasn't wrong from a traditional military

685
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,159
perspective

686
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:38,559
but this isn't a traditional war

687
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:41,200
this is a modern war where cyber

688
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:44,080
technology social media and data and

689
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,279
intelligence

690
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:47,840
some of it from government sources

691
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,360
but much of it

692
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:52,720
distributed decentralized and privatized

693
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:55,120
has enabled a new set of conditions

694
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:57,679
where with constant experimentation

695
00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:02,559
amazingly ukraine stands a chance

696
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:04,559
in this world of decentralized

697
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:06,559
distributed and privatized

698
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:09,120
agile conflict response interesting

699
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,679
things can happen let's organize an army

700
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:14,080
of hackers this can happen either in

701
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,840
coordination with the government or not

702
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,760
in this case it was in coordination with

703
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,840
the ukrainian government

704
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:23,279
some 400 000 multinational hackers have

705
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:25,520
joined forces to support ukraine's

706
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,440
effort by the way that's twice the

707
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:30,960
number of soldiers in ukraine's army

708
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,880
let's use twitter to share lists of

709
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,679
russian and belarusian targets

710
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:37,200
and just in case you're wondering

711
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,039
whether a hacker army can actually make

712
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:41,120
a difference don't forget that one

713
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,520
really really angry hacker managed to

714
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:46,559
take down north korea's entire albeit

715
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:48,480
limited internet

716
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:51,120
a hacker army can represent significant

717
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:54,159
power that is immensely relevant in the

718
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:56,399
context of modern conflict

719
00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:58,799
and the next conflict is sure to be

720
00:27:58,799 --> 00:27:59,919
different

721
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:02,399
you can be sure that our adversaries are

722
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:04,720
watching this war play out and taking

723
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:07,440
away lessons just as we are

724
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:10,880
china is not only watching russia and

725
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:13,360
all of their missteps they're not only

726
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:16,399
watching ukraine and all of their early

727
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:17,679
successes

728
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:20,159
they are watching how the u.s

729
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:21,520
plays its hand

730
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:24,399
and what kind of player we intend to be

731
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:26,559
on the world stage

732
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:28,640
after watching how the u.s military

733
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,279
performed during operation desert storm

734
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:33,520
the chinese government realized it had

735
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:36,399
to overhaul its approach to military

736
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:38,799
and move from a from a conventional

737
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:42,000
military mindset to an informationalized

738
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,720
military mindset the lessons from this

739
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,880
conflict will be different

740
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:49,200
whether it's the effectiveness of drones

741
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,279
whether it's the fundamental issues with

742
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:53,520
having a conscript army

743
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:56,159
or whether it's the importance of not

744
00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:59,200
ceding this cyberspace or information

745
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:02,480
war space you can be sure that beijing

746
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,720
will not make the same mistakes that the

747
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,240
kremlin has

748
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,240
our adversaries will learn

749
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:11,200
they will adapt and modern warfare will

750
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,000
evolve again

751
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,720
now i want to end where i started the

752
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:19,600
velocity of change in society is

753
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:22,240
accelerating at a pace that outstrips

754
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:25,279
our ability as humans to adapt and to

755
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:27,840
gain mastery there was a time when we

756
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:30,080
had centuries to adapt to new

757
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:32,720
technologies the printing press took 200

758
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:35,440
years to have global reach the

759
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,120
industrial revolut the agricultural

760
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,960
revolution also took 200 years the

761
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:41,360
industrial revolution was 100 years

762
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:42,399
today

763
00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:44,960
arguably we have four simultaneous

764
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:47,440
revolutions going on we have the energy

765
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,360
revolution we have the ai quantum

766
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,039
revolution we have the biology

767
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:53,200
revolution and we have the media

768
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:57,600
revolution and it gets even more complex

769
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,840
in addition to all this technological

770
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:02,480
upheaval we're going through a period of

771
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:05,760
intense social change with growing rifts

772
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,200
in society

773
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,919
from social justice and income inequity

774
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:12,960
to climate change a global pandemic the

775
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:15,520
decline of democracy and freedom

776
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,279
the rise of authoritarianism and

777
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:20,559
populism and economic crises around the

778
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:22,640
globe around the globe

779
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:25,279
these are seams in society that are ripe

780
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:28,320
to being exploited in altogether new and

781
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,720
devastating ways leading to forms of

782
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:33,120
conflict that we're entirely unprepared

783
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,080
for

784
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,799
to protect the values we believe in to

785
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:39,679
protect freedom and democracy we must be

786
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:42,640
creative and agile with an altogether

787
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:45,279
new way of looking at technology and its

788
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:47,520
impact on society on international

789
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:50,240
conflict and international relations and

790
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:52,080
guess what

791
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:54,159
whether you want to be or not

792
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:57,360
you guys are the front-line forces

793
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:58,880
you're protecting our systems you're

794
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,559
protecting our data you're protecting

795
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:02,840
our people you're protecting our

796
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:05,760
organizations and yeah you're protecting

797
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:08,399
freedom and democracy

798
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:11,039
and you can bet that the next adversary

799
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:12,080
we face

800
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:14,640
is taking the lessons from this war to

801
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:15,679
heart

802
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:21,559
i hope you guys do as well thank you
