1
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:06,879
i'm honored to be here it's great to be

2
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:08,960
here this presentation has taken 44

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,840
years in the making to get to this point

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:14,559
i grew up as a as a westinghouse abb guy

5
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:16,880
for 35 years and i've been with duke now

6
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,439
eight and a half so i'm a newbie at duke

7
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:21,680
which is interesting and this is a

8
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,359
problem that i don't want to stand up

9
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:25,519
here and articulate problems that duke

10
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:27,279
has but i think every company has this

11
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:29,519
problem duke is aligned in generation

12
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:32,238
transmission distribution ami metering

13
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:34,719
asset monitoring can be its own group

14
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:35,920
there's these different groups and to

15
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,640
get the cross pollination is difficult

16
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,480
so i offer all of you part of what i

17
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:41,680
want to talk about today is kind of

18
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,600
lessons learned a little bit and aha

19
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:44,719
moments

20
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:46,320
so

21
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,280
yeah i'm going to take you on a lab tour

22
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,120
through mount holly we'll go back to the

23
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,640
history of our team just a little bit

24
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:53,840
and go through some of the things that

25
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,520
we've learned

26
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,199
moving along and then i'm going to talk

27
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:00,079
about the importance of xero trust so i

28
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:01,680
haven't started the presentation yet i'm

29
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,039
telling you what the presentation is

30
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:06,240
going to be right so zero trust and then

31
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,479
how it works and why it's important aha

32
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:09,680
moments

33
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:10,720
so

34
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,960
people are still coming in

35
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,159
are you ready to get started you ready

36
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:16,799
for the presentation okay

37
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:18,880
by show of hands how many of you of you

38
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,400
in your head have a definition of what

39
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,040
zero trust is

40
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,880
looks like all of you so i don't want to

41
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,640
hear your answers yet but when we get to

42
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,600
the end

43
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,680
somebody tell me if my definition of

44
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,920
zero trust matches

45
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,320
what your definition is all right

46
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,320
so and how we got there so this talk

47
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,240
zero trust applications for the grid

48
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,960
internally we call it ztag i like the

49
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,960
name and what we've done is we've taken

50
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,079
ci cd specifically kubernetes and we've

51
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:48,240
overlaid it on top of a microgrid we're

52
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,840
getting ready to overlay it on top of a

53
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,520
test feeder

54
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,360
we can go into the details of exactly

55
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,040
how that works

56
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,719
going through life i've been looking for

57
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:59,119
distributed pki for a long time now and

58
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,640
i kind of ran into it so let's get

59
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,159
started

60
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:04,079
all right so

61
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:06,799
i live at the little

62
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:08,639
red dot right here the mount holley

63
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,959
microgrid is where i hang out a lot that

64
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:13,440
place was built in 1968 or so it's been

65
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,840
around a long time it's a training

66
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,920
facility for a lot of the lakes that

67
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,520
have been built in the nuclear site at

68
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,000
mcguire and the marshall steam plant and

69
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
it's been a training facility for a long

70
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,800
time the emerging technology office us

71
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,280
we moved in there in about 2015 and

72
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,040
during covid we've put a lot of money

73
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,959
into this place so

74
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:35,599
it's much nicer than it was it's better

75
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:39,040
than 1968 tables and chairs right which

76
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,200
is interesting so this feeder is about

77
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,200
five miles long you can see we're at the

78
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,920
end we have 1.2 megawatts of customer

79
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,080
solar hanging on the end

80
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,760
and

81
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,680
yeah we have all this equipment and it

82
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,879
hangs out there and we live there

83
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:57,760
so here's the overhead picture of it

84
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,200
one point that i would like to make

85
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,040
along the way here on distributed we're

86
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,480
really working on distributed

87
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,560
intelligence you know the grid has been

88
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,360
centrally managed centrally centrally

89
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,200
controlled

90
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,080
big generation but now with renewables

91
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,760
people call them durs if you're from the

92
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,760
south it's ders

93
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:19,120
it's so much solar wind battery all this

94
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,200
kind of work is taking place so the

95
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,360
pendulum is swinging to more distributed

96
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,360
systems when i look at the microgrid

97
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,599
here that you're seeing you see 150 kw

98
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:29,120
of solar up there

99
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,879
a lot of different stuff there's 400

100
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:33,440
meters at the top for for testing 400

101
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,360
meters over here here's some solar

102
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,200
there's a new chunk of solar here that

103
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,720
you'll see from me in just a minute that

104
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,959
i've added

105
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:43,840
the campus runs not all of it but this

106
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,319
building which is where our main lab is

107
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:49,599
it runs as a microgrid we're islanded 85

108
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:53,040
86 of the time we're off the grid

109
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,720
if we lose comms

110
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,720
we continue to function

111
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,640
so it's a distributed autonomous

112
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,480
function and one more point on this i

113
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,400
really love these two units right there

114
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,080
they're from a company called source

115
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,840
everybody looked us up you know some

116
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,200
people may love it some people may not

117
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,799
whatever but it's a distributed

118
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:10,720
autonomous function there's two types of

119
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,840
panels in this thing one is solar panel

120
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,519
that runs a pump in the bottom the other

121
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:18,478
piece is a dehumidifier it takes 4.6

122
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:20,639
liters of water out of the air and

123
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,639
drives a little uh water fountain right

124
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:24,560
next to it which is you can't see that

125
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,080
one in this but close

126
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,120
and so

127
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,960
in a place where you have to walk miles

128
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,040
to get a jug of water it's very nice

129
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,040
thing but my point on that is it's a

130
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,199
distributed autonomous function i would

131
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,880
ask this question to the group we're

132
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,040
running our microgrid that way why don't

133
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,960
we run our cities that way our buildings

134
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,639
that way why don't we have that focus of

135
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:44,880
abstraction layers on top of this thing

136
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,320
i don't want to micromanage everything

137
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,759
on the inside of it i want it to do its

138
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:49,520
own thing and then i'll put a nice like

139
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,280
a good object-oriented programmer i'll

140
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,960
put an abstraction layer on the outside

141
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,800
of it

142
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,400
so just some pictures here of the lab

143
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,919
we've really fixed it up it's a lot

144
00:04:57,919 --> 00:04:59,759
prettier if any of you that are

145
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,199
colleagues out there that have been to

146
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:03,039
the lab and you haven't been recently i

147
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:04,800
invite you all to come to mount holly

148
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,360
north carolina 14 miles

149
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,680
to the northwest of charlotte

150
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,080
is where we are we're doing an awful lot

151
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,280
of stuff here where you design a circuit

152
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,120
with a schematic editor

153
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,720
this equipment is from a company called

154
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,880
typhoon it's one of the fastest hardware

155
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,960
in the loop simulators in the industry

156
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,600
so if we want to design equipment and

157
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,120
put it in the field we run it in the

158
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,800
simulator here running on top of the

159
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,800
real circuit that it's going to be part

160
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,039
of and then when you have hardware in

161
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:34,880
the loop type stuff you can actually

162
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,520
press the buttons on the on the devices

163
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,520
it feeds into the simulation and this

164
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,520
there's a feedback loop going on all the

165
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:45,039
time so it's really nice stuff

166
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,560
the

167
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,000
this is bay five

168
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,080
um i've built bay five in the last year

169
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,919
and a half all the loads in here are dc

170
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:54,080
so this is essentially a dc microgrid

171
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,360
although we haven't provisioned the

172
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,759
battery yet you can see i have an e-bike

173
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:00,560
all the lighting is done with dc 24 volt

174
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,880
100 watts

175
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,039
per out of shade

176
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:07,199
all the monitors run off straight off dc

177
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:09,840
the point in this is 85 of the loads in

178
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,600
your house today

179
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,680
and going up your refrigerators all have

180
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,600
dc motors there's an ac front end on

181
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,080
them so if i have pv and i have electric

182
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,400
vehicle or i have a battery

183
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:24,080
why do i go to ac only to go back to dc

184
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,680
you know so we're getting rid of wall

185
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,840
warts that's my my life mission before i

186
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,840
before i pass out and die right is to

187
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,520
get rid of wall warts yeah here you go

188
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,520
hallelujah brother all right so these

189
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,759
these wall warts so you end up i think

190
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:37,280
the room of the future will end up

191
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,400
having

192
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:42,000
240 is what europe uses right 240 ac rms

193
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,840
so take 240 times the square root of two

194
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,759
you get 350 volt dc

195
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:48,080
so we have one plug it's ul certified

196
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,039
from anderson it's a 350 volt dc plug

197
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:53,199
and we have those on the wall over here

198
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:55,120
i don't mean to talk about ac so dc over

199
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,960
here that's that those guys are plugged

200
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,360
into 350 volt dc and then everything

201
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,720
else is usbc and usba type connections

202
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,039
and i think usbc is moving up to 48

203
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:07,280
volts kind of like in the poe range but

204
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,840
i think poe is capped at 100 watts and

205
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,240
usb is going to advance to 240 or so

206
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,840
that's coming all right enough of

207
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,880
that this way

208
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,759
more about bay five dc just added 19.2

209
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:21,680
kw of solar

210
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,840
also a core attack electric vehicle

211
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,960
charger that is directly wired into a dc

212
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,560
panel at 350 volt dc so as far as i know

213
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,960
that particular charger it's the only

214
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,800
one i know in north america that's

215
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,720
directly plugged into a 350 volt dc bus

216
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,520
every everybody else what we did was the

217
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,840
version that we have

218
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:46,000
there we um

219
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,240
we there there's no transformer in that

220
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,199
most of those will have a

221
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:50,400
vehicle-to-grid thing has a big

222
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,759
transformer in the base of it it weighs

223
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:54,000
about 400 pounds that does not have that

224
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,160
so anyway that's enough about dc this is

225
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,120
a cyber conference all right one more

226
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,560
thing that we're doing to the lab is

227
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,800
we've added a mile and a half of test

228
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,400
speeder on the inside this is kind of a

229
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,919
lousy slide but

230
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:08,080
we added 31 polls in the last six months

231
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,440
or so we're getting ready to start

232
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,520
commissioning in the next month

233
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,599
so the idea is to do distributed

234
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:16,319
intelligence applications so the idea is

235
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:18,160
that i have different boxes out there

236
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,120
and they

237
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,520
actually manage this chunk of the feeder

238
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,000
distributed not managing it from from

239
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,160
scada you know i don't mean to be sort

240
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,800
of an anti-skater guy i am a distributed

241
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,639
scada guy that's where we're headed

242
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:34,559
history of our our team

243
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,159
so um

244
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:38,159
yeah the years i did westinghouse abb

245
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:39,919
you know i wrote code in meters for a

246
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:42,000
long time and then

247
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,399
i took this job with duke in this r d

248
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:47,920
group in 2013 and rayford smith told me

249
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,040
become

250
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,279
a cyber expert become a security guard

251
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:53,360
and go wow so that's why i'm intimidated

252
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,519
by you guys right so one of the first

253
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:57,839
things i just really realized is that

254
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:00,080
the grid is like a coconut

255
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,160
and that it's hard on the outside it's

256
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,839
mushy on the inside and we put firewalls

257
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:05,760
everywhere now i don't mean to you know

258
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,360
put down firewalls but i think we need

259
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,839
to do zero trust and move on beyond this

260
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:13,519
in 2015 2014 2015 we did we were on

261
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:15,200
stage at sands

262
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,360
with this setup right here we had abb

263
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,440
microscada on one side of the stage and

264
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,680
we had this particular unit that's a

265
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,240
mock-up of a substation we broke in we

266
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,399
plugged in a raspberry pi we watched the

267
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:30,160
network traffic we saw the the um

268
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,000
what's the right term the controller the

269
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,720
rtac on top and then we saw very easily

270
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,959
just watching network traffic we see

271
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:39,279
what the outstations are we did an arp

272
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:41,600
spoof we took over the rtac and then we

273
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,600
just pounded the protection relays with

274
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,000
binary outputs turn the power on and off

275
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,839
so we oscillate the power

276
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:50,000
and and we burn you know what i would

277
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,480
really do is have 30 substations wake up

278
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,240
at the same time oscillate the power and

279
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,839
burn everything up you know to the best

280
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:57,440
of my ability that's what i would do if

281
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,360
i was one of these guys right but my

282
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,959
takeaway from that was we have no

283
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:03,120
cryptographic identity for these devices

284
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,720
and we definitely don't have encryption

285
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,399
going on between any of them so it's all

286
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:08,160
clear text protocol stuff

287
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,839
so that was a big takeaway at that point

288
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:12,000
in time we started working with publish

289
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,800
and subscribe protocols

290
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,519
the the idea of i'm the client i'm the

291
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:19,920
rtac or i'm the the controller box i'm

292
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,920
the client and all of you are servers

293
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:22,800
and i'm going what do you got what do

294
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:23,519
you got what do you got what do you

295
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:25,040
already got all day long crunch what do

296
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,640
you got what do you already have crunch

297
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,000
and i do that all day i would rather

298
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,320
have you guys publish on a message bus

299
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,640
that came out in the 90s with tipco and

300
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,640
websphere and this stuff you know mqt is

301
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,399
fantastic as is

302
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:37,839
um you'll see and just say we've done

303
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:40,160
work with dds we did all this exploring

304
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,560
with tpm 2.0 chips to see how you can

305
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,200
hide identity and hot keys

306
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,000
we employed we deployed silent defense

307
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,600
from security matters at the time in the

308
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,920
lab and i got a big aha on that in that

309
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,079
i have a um

310
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:56,160
the one line looks great you'll be

311
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,959
island reconnect kw adds up everything's

312
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:01,040
great but the it under the hood is

313
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,760
really unhappy you know ntp's devices

314
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,839
aren't getting time we have um

315
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:07,839
we have ups trying to go through our

316
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:10,079
firewall to reach their mothership for

317
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:12,240
whatever reason you see all kinds of

318
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,320
stuff when you use these kind of tools

319
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,399
it's basically wireshark on

320
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:18,399
steroids is what this thing is

321
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,720
uh we moved on to nats we love gnats as

322
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,560
an application layer broker i love this

323
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,320
thing it's fantastic we can drill into

324
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,200
that

325
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,600
so what we've done is we've overlaid a

326
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,440
kubernetes cluster on top of our

327
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,120
microgrid we're getting it's got six

328
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,519
nodes we're getting ready to add a coupe

329
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:35,600
cluster on top of our nine of them on

330
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,040
top of our test feeder that's where

331
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,480
we're headed

332
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,000
so what's the point in all this is to

333
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,600
reach zero trust

334
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,800
so hawaii

335
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,120
you know why are we doing this

336
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,399
today we have no cryptographic

337
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:48,240
identities kind of a bummer

338
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,040
to deploy and patch applications in the

339
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,120
field most of the time we have to roll a

340
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,519
truck out to polls and boxes hanging on

341
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,920
poles and in substations it's very

342
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,480
difficult to patch

343
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,240
we need better situational awareness

344
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,600
duke has rolled

345
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,760
silent defense out now to over 600

346
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,480
substations so now we're not blind from

347
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,920
the beyond the gateway inside of

348
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,920
substations we're seeing the stuff take

349
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:12,720
place

350
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,720
i think power systems engineers and all

351
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,000
of us need to think in terms of

352
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,760
abstraction layers

353
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,760
and have a distributed autonomous

354
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:20,720
function

355
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,320
and put an abstraction layer on it that

356
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,480
makes sense a lot of the 61 850 work

357
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,320
over the years with semantic modeling

358
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,760
the work that we've done in open field

359
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,720
message bus all this is going after that

360
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,639
distributed intelligence with a nice

361
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,399
abstraction layer on top

362
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:36,000
and then the whole concept of you know

363
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,760
what do you do on prim what goes to the

364
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:38,720
cloud

365
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,760
quite frankly is a big gap the guys that

366
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,079
are working in the cloud that can stand

367
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:46,320
up 50 000 netflix containers and a

368
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,519
heartbeat

369
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:50,240
stand them up and make it go this is an

370
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,639
amazing world there's a lot taking place

371
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:53,839
in our world

372
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:55,600
at the lower levels we have power

373
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,680
electronics work that's taking place

374
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,920
it's phenomenal but the i.t in this

375
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,600
particular piece of the world i think is

376
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,320
weak because we'll develop a great box

377
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,399
power electronics does all kinds of cool

378
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:09,120
things and then we slap a 1978 modbus

379
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,399
stack on it

380
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:11,440
and

381
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,279
that segment whatever it's talking to

382
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:15,200
will never be secured

383
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,560
not unless you do something really

384
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,880
bizarre so we're trying to avoid this

385
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,399
we don't want that to happen so that's

386
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:23,920
just a protection relay right that um

387
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,839
its boundary got set so high that it

388
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:27,360
never had never opened it should have

389
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,279
opened then it failed to open

390
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:31,760
the the opposite of that would be set

391
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,920
the boundary so low that it that it

392
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,519
opens all the time you know every time

393
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:37,040
you turn around it's open and the power

394
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,800
is off you know so which one do you

395
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:39,680
prefer

396
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,399
has to be just right so here's a picture

397
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:44,959
we we've used just for the nodes in a

398
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:46,959
coup cluster we've used these industrial

399
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:49,440
pcs from the company well yeah we've

400
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,639
used industrial pcs and so i've got one

401
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:55,360
node that sits on top of that solar

402
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,000
field up there and on top of a dc bus

403
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,079
and some stuff

404
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:02,160
i've got a gas generator that's kind of

405
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,160
a collection the heart and soul of the

406
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,600
microgrid is

407
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,839
this piece when we island he takes over

408
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:10,639
this is an abb inverter with

409
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:13,839
a saf 650 kw battery we have grounding

410
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:15,680
experiments going on here's the point of

411
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,839
common coupling when we open way one

412
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:19,360
we're islanded when we close it we're

413
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,120
back on and we have to pay attention to

414
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,880
all this sort of stuff to make sure it

415
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:26,240
operates seamlessly of course

416
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:28,639
another graphic of you can see the cube

417
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:30,639
cluster here overlaid on top of the

418
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:31,839
microgrid

419
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:33,839
this is really overlaid on top of that

420
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:35,680
hardware in the loop simulator and we

421
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,680
will overlay that on the test feeder as

422
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,680
we move forward this year and then what

423
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,720
i've got running in the node

424
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,800
orchestrator up here is all this open

425
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,560
source tools

426
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,399
everything we're doing in this is open

427
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:48,399
source by the way and if you guys need

428
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:49,920
access to any of it we'll figure out how

429
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,760
to get it to you right

430
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,160
the idea that the the amazing thing to

431
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,959
me is let's say there's a an app that

432
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:59,360
needs to be an app a workload that needs

433
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,680
to be deployed on one of these nodes

434
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,079
these nodes can run multiple workloads i

435
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:06,079
make a change and get i've tested the

436
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:08,160
heck out of it i changed the loco no

437
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,639
code declarative stuff fleet picks it up

438
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:13,120
and forms the cube cluster

439
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,120
the k3s agent on each of these nodes

440
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,880
which you'll see in just a second to

441
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,199
pull down the new node that it needs and

442
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:20,880
the way containers work is you bring in

443
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,959
a new one and there was a talk yesterday

444
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:24,240
that was excellent i mean you bring in a

445
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,160
new one and you want the old one to die

446
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,160
right so there needs to be you know

447
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,680
studies on how to hand that off if

448
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,360
there's data problems that was mentioned

449
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,480
in the talk

450
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,480
so um but anyway this is this is the

451
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,920
work that we're up to and you know why

452
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:38,000
are we doing this so we can patch so we

453
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,399
can deploy distributed applications so

454
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:42,320
that we can have zero trust security and

455
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,759
we're gonna hit on that

456
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:45,600
now whoops

457
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,279
all right so here's what a node looks

458
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,120
like so picture the smallest one i've

459
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,880
got is a little compulat box it's about

460
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,440
this big you know and it can run many

461
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,839
many many docker containers and then say

462
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:58,240
a little bit bigger like an seo 3360 or

463
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,720
an onlogic box it's an industrial pc

464
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,040
basically you know and and i'm not

465
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,160
trying to make sure that they're

466
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,600
necessarily hardened for where we're

467
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,600
going at this point because the idea is

468
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,839
to put a node on top of this stuff

469
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:11,519
so what we've done in the microgrid is

470
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:13,680
let's say there's six devices three

471
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,279
speak modbus

472
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:17,920
three speak dnp3 we put a node on top of

473
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,880
that and we hide the legacy protocol now

474
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,639
we think we'll be able to do max sec in

475
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:24,560
the future on these segments but we hide

476
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,480
the legacy protocol and on the north

477
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,880
side we're publishing that's

478
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,680
and we have when the device first goes

479
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,040
to the field

480
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,199
we have a tpm out here and the spire

481
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:37,839
agent does at a station with the spire

482
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:39,440
server in this case we're going all the

483
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,240
way back to the cloud to our to our nos

484
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,040
and

485
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,680
is saying yeah you're a valid guy you

486
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:48,240
can go and work now so we have trusted

487
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,959
hardware and only trusted workloads each

488
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:53,759
one of these is an application or in the

489
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:56,079
spire world or the spiffy world these

490
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:58,079
are called workloads so you can see we

491
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:00,800
have a ptp time

492
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:01,839
server

493
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:04,079
we've got time series database this guy

494
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:06,160
is is actually running the microgrid

495
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,439
he's doing the optimization of the

496
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:09,839
microgrid i could have three of those

497
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:11,280
scattered across different nodes

498
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,359
kubernetes can put them wherever and run

499
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:15,359
a raft algorithm such that only one of

500
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:17,359
them is doing control but the others are

501
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:18,959
are listening and if one dies then the

502
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:21,199
other picks it up right that's kind of a

503
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:23,199
nice thing and that's not hard to do and

504
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:25,760
then the real essence of these six south

505
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,760
side devices in the example i gave is

506
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,000
this open fmb adapter what it does is

507
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,360
it's an open source piece of software

508
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:34,160
written by adam crane it it pulls dnp

509
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:37,039
three pulls modbus each that would be

510
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:39,760
six workloads actually of six adapters

511
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:42,320
pulls it brings it back turns it into an

512
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:45,120
open fnb sort of 61 850 data structure

513
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,360
to harmonize data which we all need in

514
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,360
the world harmonize the data and then

515
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,000
publishes so at this level of the six

516
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,360
nodes they're all doing encrypted

517
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:56,640
traffic and each one of these guys has

518
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,400
got a

519
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,240
has gotten it's a little bit fat we're

520
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,760
looking for something smaller it's got

521
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,760
an envoy wrapper around each one of

522
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:04,720
these because if you look at him you

523
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,320
call them a workload but it's actually a

524
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,919
kubernetes pod

525
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:10,480
so it's wrapped with envoy an envoy

526
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,799
knows how to talk to the spy agent and

527
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:14,720
so every one of these workloads is

528
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,320
having their leaf certificate and their

529
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:19,760
little trust bundle refreshed by aspire

530
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,840
server that is running on another node

531
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,679
in the microgrid so what we've done is

532
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:27,360
we've taken the intermediary ca concept

533
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:30,240
and we've put the ca in the microgrid

534
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,080
and that guy is signing for all the

535
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,919
workloads and we can do it every hour we

536
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:35,600
do it once a week once a month whatever

537
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,919
you like but then the abstraction layer

538
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:40,320
the the main spire server is a federated

539
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,880
guy the one in the microgrid he then at

540
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,679
a slower cadence gets his certificate

541
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:48,000
refreshed from a level above which could

542
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,919
be in the substation or it could be up

543
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:51,520
in the cloud or wherever you want to put

544
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,440
it so

545
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:56,400
you know i'm not claiming to um have the

546
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,160
answer to everything in the world right

547
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,600
i'm sure there are holes in anything

548
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:00,880
that you can build

549
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,480
but in looking around for what's best

550
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,240
practice coming from the cloud service

551
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,400
providers and the lack of zero trust

552
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,640
security in the grid

553
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,960
we built this and

554
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,960
it's it's all open source

555
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,320
it should go

556
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,559
if it's not this i challenge you what

557
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:17,679
will it be

558
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:19,679
if it's not something like this it will

559
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:21,520
be something like this and i really

560
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:24,160
worry a big worry is that we get a

561
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:27,120
really good security solution from from

562
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,720
one vendor let's say

563
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,080
and then we're locked in they're going

564
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,080
to lock us in the full stack

565
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,760
and these layers need to be

566
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,960
interoperable and i you know i'm not big

567
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,400
i don't i don't think government should

568
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,160
mandate you know what what free

569
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,160
enterprise should do but it's it's a

570
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,480
little bit a little bit crazy in that we

571
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:47,120
can't get a model that will protect us

572
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,440
all you know in the in the control

573
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,919
system community this architecture can

574
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:53,600
run in factories it can run on the grid

575
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,760
any control system architecture so

576
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,200
another little view of it you know i've

577
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,120
got a node up here and this node is

578
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,280
really hiding these guys

579
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:04,320
with multiple ports hanging off the back

580
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,400
and doing protocol translation and then

581
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,240
now we have another world but really

582
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,559
what we're saying is we would like this

583
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:13,120
functionality that's in this thing

584
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,240
to run

585
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,320
ultimately in the edge device so the

586
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,799
cognizant guy that was here this morning

587
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:20,240
ah that was a great talk you know he's

588
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,679
saying i can do all kinds of crypto and

589
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:23,840
8-bit micros you know so

590
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,600
what really what we need is a pub sub

591
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,600
protocol on the edge device and we also

592
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,200
need a um

593
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,520
just the ability to refresh keys in the

594
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,679
thing and to do all this securely so it

595
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:35,360
could reach we want it to reach

596
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,760
ultimately not be a bump in the wire

597
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,440
sitting on top of everything but go to

598
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,799
the edge device there are places where

599
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:43,039
the bump is perfect if the bump is a

600
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:44,480
radio and today it's a pass-through

601
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,159
device it should be a more intelligent

602
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:48,320
bump than than just being a freaking

603
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,480
pass-through radio come on you know

604
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,840
so uh

605
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,520
let's see where are we i think that's it

606
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,960
so what are we getting we're giving zero

607
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,880
trust my definition is

608
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,679
uh cryptographic identity that before i

609
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:01,200
talk to you ben

610
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,039
we're going to prove who we are somehow

611
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:04,799
if i can't prove just with the direct

612
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:06,799
thing i'm going to do at a station

613
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:09,039
somehow but hopefully you we exchanged

614
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:10,480
certs and your cert

615
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,159
and master have been signed within the

616
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:14,400
same domain so we trust each other and

617
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,280
then we can speak full mtls as what we

618
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,200
should be up to now the protection guys

619
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,880
are going to complain it's too slow

620
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,960
right so we just need to tackle the

621
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,880
problem and focus on it there's ways to

622
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,360
be slow and fast this way is also to

623
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,360
design your world your circuits and

624
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:32,000
everything to run as slow as possible

625
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,520
put a control system on top that just

626
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,120
runs as low as possible figure that out

627
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,880
you know so we just need to think about

628
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,360
it more than rather than just saying no

629
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:42,640
so we can patch situational awareness we

630
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,520
really need to drive the

631
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:44,960
interoperability these are all the

632
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,559
things that we can get from a system

633
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:48,880
like this so i think that's it

634
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,240
so what are we in the business of we're

635
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,080
trying to keep the lights on you know

636
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,960
and that's my sleeping dog

637
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:58,080
yeah all right so we got three minutes

638
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,799
thanks for listening

639
00:22:01,050 --> 00:22:03,600
[Applause]

640
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,840
please questions questions let's talk

641
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,919
about this stuff

642
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:10,480
anybody

643
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:12,159
if i can't answer it i'm going to ask

644
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:15,440
you to call dwayne bradley in my holly

645
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:18,880
hey david thanks great presentation

646
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,480
complexity sometimes the enemy is

647
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,320
security would you

648
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,000
care to just point at anything you think

649
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,240
might be too complicated in any of this

650
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:29,200
or is not not a worry well getting the

651
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,120
ttl right you know when you're when

652
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,679
you're doing csrs really quick and

653
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:36,159
getting things resigned what happens if

654
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:38,320
you get stuck we haven't done this yet

655
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,520
we haven't

656
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,760
said a storm came through this thing is

657
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,159
dead for 10 days

658
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:45,679
what is the technique for bringing it

659
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:48,000
all back online i see that as a you know

660
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,080
complexity weakness if we can't solve

661
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,120
that i mean i don't think it's a hard

662
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,320
problem to solve but we just haven't

663
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,000
done that one yet you know but that's

664
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,520
one that i think is key

665
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,280
right what happens when things don't

666
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,640
work and if you ever wrote control

667
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,120
system programs in your life you know

668
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,960
fifty percent of it is air handling i

669
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,039
mean it's at least fifty percent is when

670
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:07,760
things don't go right what do you do

671
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,600
next one

672
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,760
yeah you talked about this as maybe like

673
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,440
a future work but how are you

674
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:16,320
authenticating the endpoint devices like

675
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:19,200
the ieds and that type of stuff uh we're

676
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,440
not really not in this case we put a

677
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,600
bump in the wire on top of them now the

678
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,440
solution that i've seen that has existed

679
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,960
for a long time is this thing called

680
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,960
maxsec

681
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:31,520
we haven't gone to the trouble to

682
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:32,880
use

683
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,480
in this container system running on a

684
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,480
node right i could put

685
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,520
a copy of a fat client software

686
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,520
that knows how to talk to that

687
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,279
particular device this is how i would do

688
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:46,000
south side patch management in a legacy

689
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,720
environment right but have we gone in

690
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,720
and tried to read stuff out of it to

691
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,320
identify that it's correct well no the

692
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,480
system's prone to weakness if you pull

693
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,240
that edge device out and put a new one

694
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,320
in that's a clone but it's a bad clone

695
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,080
no you can do that

696
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:03,520
but the maxsec piece secures that last

697
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:06,960
uh three feet of ethernet yeah and the

698
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,880
way it does it is somehow when they come

699
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,200
alive they do some bit of identity i

700
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,720
believe or at least there has to be the

701
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,880
max algorithm in there and they end up

702
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,799
they start with a symmetric key

703
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:19,200
and then they can renegotiate throughout

704
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,760
life new symmetric keys so this last

705
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,240
three feet of ethernet is a symmetric

706
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,320
key thing that's called mac sec it came

707
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,159
out of the um

708
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:30,159
it came out of the telecom space with

709
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:32,159
cisco and all this but nobody that i

710
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:33,600
know of has implemented this in the

711
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:34,559
industry

712
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:37,279
but by default that's a shared key

713
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:39,600
say that max uses a shared key by

714
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,200
default shared key but i thought they

715
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,600
can uh they can rotate that key

716
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,320
during an encrypted session you you can

717
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,080
but you've got to do things like have a

718
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:51,120
discrete separate key for each link yes

719
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,799
right that type of thing yeah but you

720
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:54,880
know the bad thing about security is or

721
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,320
the good thing is i mean

722
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,679
it's got to be

723
00:24:57,679 --> 00:24:59,919
it has to be seamless and hidden you

724
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:03,279
know that has to work

725
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:05,679
but i am advocating this okay most of

726
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:08,000
the time we have a box and i'm willing

727
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,600
for this next step i'm willing to give

728
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:12,000
up that last foot or so

729
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,080
until the stuff we're talking about ends

730
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,559
up in the edge device

731
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:18,480
so what one thing if you don't mind

732
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,080
please what is what is the mapping

733
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:22,320
between uh this bump and the wire and

734
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,159
the endpoint devices do you is it one

735
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:26,880
dimension or it can be one of many one

736
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:29,840
to one if it's a radio on a pole

737
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,679
that's pretty typical one to one you

738
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:34,159
know recloser in the field or one to

739
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:36,159
many in the microgrid case

740
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:38,320
okay but the work we're doing at the

741
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:39,919
container level is to say we don't

742
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:41,200
necessarily have to take containers to

743
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,880
the edge but the work that we're doing

744
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,799
there at least a couple of the pieces of

745
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:47,760
it should go into that edge device

746
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,679
quite frankly i'm burned out on the mp3

747
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:51,279
and modbus

748
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:55,360
1978 1991 that's all we know how to do i

749
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:57,039
guess

750
00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:58,720
all right anything else oh yeah sorry

751
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,600
one last question uh david in the

752
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:04,480
implementation of these boxes are they

753
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,919
double nick devices where you've

754
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:07,600
actually isolated the thing that you're

755
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:10,240
protecting we've done both we've plugged

756
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,000
them all into a switch that way we can

757
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,559
run the old system that pulls everything

758
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:15,919
and then we can switch and run the new

759
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:17,279
system and so but everything's going

760
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:19,200
through a switch that's one now we have

761
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,000
done

762
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:20,799
uh

763
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:22,480
the on logic boxes happen to have four

764
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:25,279
ports so so one to four in that case

765
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:27,200
right so it kind of depends but we're

766
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,880
still in i mean

767
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:31,279
it's not a deploy it's deployed it's a

768
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:32,799
real system it works you can come to

769
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:34,320
mount holly and see the one line and all

770
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:35,919
this stuff running but it's you know

771
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:38,480
we're not selling it it's not it's not

772
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,880
product ready for sure

773
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,360
but the challenge is please let's build

774
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:45,279
a system like this

775
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:46,799
or what are we doing in this in this

776
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:48,159
country you know if we're not building

777
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:49,679
something like this

778
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:51,440
we're just hiding behind firewalls is my

779
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,480
view you know

780
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,799
this guy marcus raynham put together a

781
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:57,360
presentation he's like doctor dr jekyll

782
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,919
and mr hyde in 1996 that talks about

783
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:02,080
firewalls and he goes the good things

784
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,840
about following bad things good things

785
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,600
that's good this argument's been going

786
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,600
on forever i just think you need you

787
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:08,720
need

788
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,960
uh identity attestation and then we can

789
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,640
talk yeah

790
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,000
thank you okay

791
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
okay so one more real quick

792
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,760
what do you need to help build something

793
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:20,159
like this what can we do to help wow

794
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:22,559
let's um let's i've got a spec

795
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:24,000
i've got a speck on everything that you

796
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,520
saw here let's let's read through and

797
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,440
talk about it and then i would love to

798
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,360
have somebody come in and say well

799
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:31,360
here's how we'll break it let's break it

800
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:32,880
what are the use cases that we could

801
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,720
actually put in place the use cases that

802
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,320
we're deploying in mount holly we call

803
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,600
them under the term distributed

804
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,279
intelligence one is is volt bar

805
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:40,720
management of the new test feeder that

806
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,640
we're building just volt var stuff

807
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,880
voltage management flizzer fizzer's

808
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,480
there just waiting to be done the

809
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,399
microgrid tends to be sort of just an

810
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:50,320
optimization thing and that you know

811
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,760
what are the rules for islanding and

812
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,679
reconnecting

813
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:55,360
another thing that i'm completely hyped

814
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,200
about is

815
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,360
external circuit design and tools that

816
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,279
suck in the circuit and are smart enough

817
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:03,120
to identify what the pieces are the

818
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:05,039
components generate the open fmp

819
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:06,720
profiles of what the traffic's going to

820
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,399
be right the one you cannot get is

821
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:09,840
status let's say it's a complicated

822
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,840
battery you know you can get readings

823
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:14,640
and status at this level here and

824
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,399
controls you can do all that as a

825
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:18,960
standard harmonized but let's say i

826
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,399
really want to get intricate about that

827
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:21,919
battery because something ain't right

828
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:23,840
right that's like a bit string of at

829
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,760
least 20 48 bits where each bit means

830
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,760
something you know so at that point i've

831
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,679
got to have back i need that thing to

832
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:32,159
publish just a blob and the blob shows

833
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:33,600
up and here i need to have a special

834
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,919
piece of code that knows how to decipher

835
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:37,679
that saf battery in order to show what's

836
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:40,720
going on right so the architecture this

837
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,320
kind of architecture stuff is there for

838
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,640
everybody to start pounding on

839
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,480
okay all right

840
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:49,679
we'll get with you later is that it

841
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:51,279
thank you guys very much it's an honor

842
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:54,840
to be here absolutely
