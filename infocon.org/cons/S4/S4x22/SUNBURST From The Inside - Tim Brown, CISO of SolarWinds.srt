1
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:07,680
it's great to be here um conference has

2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,920
been really insightful in a number of

3
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:10,880
ways

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,880
uh you know i'm generally an i.t guy an

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,200
i.t security guy so listen to the ot

6
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,520
stories and everything with ot has been

7
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,600
really fantastic

8
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,880
so um today i'm here to talk to you

9
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,439
about the solarwinds attack and this one

10
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:26,240
i'm going to

11
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,240
talk a little bit differently

12
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:29,840
so this is actually a presentation i

13
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:31,920
haven't done so much in the past is

14
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,160
really what the lessons learned were for

15
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,719
the days the months the weeks uh

16
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:38,640
following the event

17
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,559
so um

18
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:42,320
i i've been with solarwinds for about

19
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,800
five years i was running security before

20
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,680
the incident still running security now

21
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:51,280
um and it really went through everything

22
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,640
so let's start with a quick brief uh

23
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,719
introduction of what happened so

24
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:00,399
december 12th um 2020 you know early

25
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:02,320
early in the morning on

26
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,519
uh saturday i got a call from our ceo

27
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,320
saying fireeye just called me and they

28
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:11,600
said that we've um you know ship tainted

29
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,799
code

30
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:13,840
and

31
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,600
what what happened after that was just a

32
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,479
whole series of events um you know with

33
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:20,320
firearm telling us that that's what

34
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,520
happened we didn't really need to

35
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:24,000
investigate so much it's not a normal

36
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,080
incident you yeah the information that

37
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,560
they came with was allowed us to be able

38
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,200
to you know really um investigate

39
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,119
quickly understand that yes this was

40
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:36,560
real no question that it was real

41
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,400
so then the question of who did it

42
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,400
impact what went on how did we go

43
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,560
through this who was the threat actor

44
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,320
you know in this type of incident you

45
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,759
really can't

46
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:47,759
spend too much time attributing to the

47
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:49,600
threat actor you know you let others do

48
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,040
that

49
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,399
but the you know the whole process was

50
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:56,799
you know interesting to say the least so

51
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:58,479
i'm going to skip over the basics the

52
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:01,119
basics have been documented sunburst has

53
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:02,880
been documented really well by a lot of

54
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,880
the researchers

55
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,040
sunspot which was the insertion into our

56
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,199
code was documented by many

57
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:10,878
so i'm not going to go into those

58
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:12,640
details i'm going to spend the time

59
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,560
really talking to you about what it was

60
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,760
like

61
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,760
happy to answer other questions after

62
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,640
the fact about any details session

63
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,560
essentially the you know the threat

64
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,640
actor came into our environment

65
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,920
started with the email um email early on

66
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,120
so they started doing email

67
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,840
reconnaissance as early as

68
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,000
december 2019

69
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
then they came in and did a test run in

70
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,640
november so that test run did nothing

71
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,720
basically it was a no-op but it proved

72
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,280
they could insert code into the system

73
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,200
secondly then they came back in march

74
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,760
with 2500 lines of code

75
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,200
that code

76
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,959
essentially stayed the same between

77
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:53,519
march and june they didn't put the sort

78
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:55,760
that code into our source control system

79
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,519
they inserted the code into the build

80
00:02:57,519 --> 00:02:59,360
environment so

81
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,519
bypass the source control system went

82
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:03,360
straight to the build environment

83
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,920
inserted that code into an ephemeral or

84
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,640
or a virtual machine that spins up and

85
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,920
down

86
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:13,879
and then went away in june so a lot of

87
00:03:13,879 --> 00:03:16,800
mission-centric models were utilized by

88
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,040
the threat actor and that's kind of the

89
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,560
threat actor that we have to deal with

90
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,920
in the future

91
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,680
so let's start

92
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,680
what was the first days like

93
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,799
really crazy you know as much chaos and

94
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:31,040
a much time sensitive as you could

95
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,400
imagine so this was in the middle covid

96
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,879
so we're all working virtually

97
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:39,200
we get on cell phones we start talking

98
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,640
to people we

99
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,480
understand what happened we proved what

100
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,879
happened pretty quickly

101
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:48,640
we were able to um search our back ends

102
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,120
and determine um hey is this anywhere

103
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,879
can we find this code anywhere in our

104
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:55,040
environment the answer was no we

105
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,879
couldn't find the code we knew it was in

106
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:59,360
product because we can decompile

107
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,840
c sharp code so we could decompile it

108
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,000
and see the code was there

109
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,599
we figured out the code was in certain

110
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:08,239
versions so we figured out a lot of

111
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:09,840
information

112
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,560
in basically a day and a half so

113
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,720
saturday we stayed virtual sunday we

114
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,320
were all went to the office

115
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,959
um and when i say all there was probably

116
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,000
about

117
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,680
10 to 12 folks that were in our war room

118
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,080
from a number of different parts of our

119
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,479
org to be able to at least figure out

120
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:31,600
when on what what went on and one of the

121
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,160
goals that we had was hey we've got to

122
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,960
issue a 10k it was a public company we

123
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,080
had to say we have a material event that

124
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,360
occurred and here's what that event was

125
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,720
so the language and the terms inside of

126
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,720
that 10k were extremely important to

127
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,479
have accurate extremely important to

128
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:52,000
have correct

129
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:52,960
so

130
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,120
sunday all in the office

131
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,040
by sunday morning around

132
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,199
2 30 a.m or so i guess that would be

133
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:01,120
monday morning we ended up being able to

134
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,759
issue our 10k and so what do we know at

135
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:05,199
that point in time

136
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:06,880
we knew that the

137
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,039
threat actor was mission centric very

138
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:10,720
focused on what they were doing we had

139
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,360
information on the threat actor from

140
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,680
fireeye and mandy at that time we know

141
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,199
the code was you know pretty novel

142
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:21,280
we knew the code was well written we

143
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,759
know the code size we knew that the

144
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:25,759
insertion point we knew that our source

145
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:28,560
code systems were not done

146
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,199
we knew the campaign was crafted we

147
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:32,880
don't didn't know actually who the end

148
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,520
target was we knew the models that were

149
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,360
associated

150
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,800
as i said before we had known that the

151
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,639
source code wasn't affected or source

152
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:44,639
code control system wasn't affected but

153
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:46,880
the build system was affected we didn't

154
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,960
know exactly what we didn't know exactly

155
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,840
how but we knew enough to be able to say

156
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:54,160
that we knew the upper end of affected

157
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,120
clients we knew that 18 000 customers

158
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,840
had downloaded an affected version we

159
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,400
knew that three versions were affected

160
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,960
so we know that scope of versions that

161
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,479
were affected were produced between

162
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:09,199
march and june we had produced uh

163
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:11,039
versions after that that did not have

164
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:13,840
the code in it so we knew those things

165
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,360
and that's essentially what we put to

166
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,360
the street on

167
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,840
sunday night

168
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,520
so um

169
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,759
i guess at this point you know what are

170
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:25,039
the lessons

171
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:27,440
you know first days are beyond intense

172
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,919
it is you know crazy your incident

173
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:33,280
response program helps but it is

174
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,680
very very different it's different than

175
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,960
any other incident that you ever have

176
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,639
my team runs our incident response

177
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:43,440
process we deal with a lot of incidents

178
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,600
so i call everything an incident i try

179
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,280
to practice my

180
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,680
uh incident program with everything so

181
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,360
if you lose a laptop

182
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,759
and a laptop happens to be unencrypted

183
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:55,039
that's an incident for me it goes

184
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:57,039
through my process it gets tied it gets

185
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:59,680
tagged somebody reports a vulnerability

186
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,880
outside

187
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,280
of one of my products i have 40 or so

188
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,960
products so somebody reports a

189
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,720
vulnerability that gets treated of an

190
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,800
incident so i consider my incident

191
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,199
program for basic incidents pretty rock

192
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:13,759
solid i mean we do it all the time

193
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:17,759
this type of thing was so beyond normal

194
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:20,880
that it was um just not what you had

195
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:21,919
expected

196
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:25,680
so a couple of things um partners um we

197
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,440
got really lucky with a partner that we

198
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,479
engaged

199
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:30,479
believe it or not it was a legal team

200
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:33,599
so we used dla piper as our legal

201
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:36,160
partner now i found out dla piper's the

202
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,840
largest legal firm in the world but i

203
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,080
didn't know that their forensics team

204
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:43,120
was incredible so their forensics team

205
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,759
helped us with a number of things

206
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:50,080
so their forensics team has

207
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,479
the relationships with the right level

208
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:55,440
of the right people to get involved so

209
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,039
when we look at saying okay how do we

210
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:59,680
bring in we start with dla then we bring

211
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,080
in crowdstrike's forensic team so

212
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,400
crowdstrikes team really threat hunt

213
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:08,479
team we got b team on day one by sunday

214
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:10,879
we got the a team so

215
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:12,960
it was um

216
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,639
getting them involved from the hunt

217
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:16,879
perspective was critically important for

218
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:18,639
a number of reasons

219
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:22,080
we also involved fbi we involved cisa

220
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,840
sister we were working on was something

221
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,360
else

222
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,080
throughout the process uh the sisa team

223
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,639
was incredible right so

224
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:32,958
what they were right there in the dirt

225
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:35,440
with us they were right there at two in

226
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,000
the morning with us and their whole

227
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,479
objective was to amplify the truth so

228
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:42,240
when they say and jen said that she

229
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,919
doesn't want to be a regulatory body she

230
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,120
wants to be

231
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,120
helpful in the environment their

232
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,360
motivations are very pure in what they

233
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,040
do

234
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,000
so

235
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,120
you need to make sure that you have a

236
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,120
cross-functional team ready you have to

237
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,360
they have to be ready and willing and

238
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,200
able and you have to have cell phones

239
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,720
for them and you have to have the

240
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,320
ability to communicate to them at a

241
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,560
moment's notice

242
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,279
the response at this scale can't be

243
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:09,360
handled by a single person or a single

244
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,959
team so you really do need a coordinator

245
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:15,279
and that coordinator for us ended up

246
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:18,560
being the cyber team for dla ended up

247
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,959
taking on that coordinator role

248
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:23,519
so then i could focus on certain things

249
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:25,120
our engineering teams could focus on

250
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,040
things marketing teams should focus on

251
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:30,160
things so focus isn't important you know

252
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,320
every word matters time's not in your

253
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,600
side i remember one of the quotes my ceo

254
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,440
said at the time at about two in the

255
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,680
morning we had so many people reviewing

256
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,000
what our 10k was he said yeah we just

257
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,160
had reviews they put a comma and that

258
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,680
comma cost us 20 grand um but

259
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,320
the amount of legal

260
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,080
looking at things and making sure

261
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,320
everything was right but don't expect

262
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,000
this to be the end

263
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,200
prepare for

264
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,800
you know the weeks ahead this is only

265
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,480
the beginning

266
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,560
so what happened in the first week

267
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,560
we organized into different teams and

268
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,120
with a leader on each one of them uh

269
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,279
engineering had a team so how did they

270
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,519
get in what happened how did our code

271
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:12,959
get affected what was going on with the

272
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:15,120
build system all of those things that

273
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,399
was their role that was their lane to

274
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:21,200
stay in i.t how did they get through our

275
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,320
i.t controls now we had very reasonable

276
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,040
i.t controls in place we were spending

277
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,720
kind of more on the security side than

278
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,959
the industry um

279
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:33,680
and they got through so were my security

280
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,839
controls good enough to thwart the

281
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:38,640
russian svr absolutely not they were not

282
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,320
they got through they were able to

283
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,360
insert code into the back end so a lot

284
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,560
of our

285
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,279
push forward beyond the incident is to

286
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:49,279
be exemplary we'll talk about kind of

287
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:51,680
how we do that in different places

288
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,360
business escalation and customer

289
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,480
outreach so this went live on sunday

290
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,720
essentially by monday morning we were

291
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,560
getting calls from every nation of the

292
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,760
world

293
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,160
and every special project of the world

294
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,440
remember at this point in time we're

295
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,839
trying to develop the the anti-virus or

296
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:09,200
the virus for

297
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,160
anti-virus for covet so first question

298
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,480
on u.s government's mind was does

299
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,800
anybody involved in

300
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,880
i can't remember the name of the project

301
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,839
um but anybody involved in the creation

302
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:23,120
of the

303
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,800
anti-virus

304
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,720
affected that was one of their first

305
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,560
things they gave us a list

306
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,200
and said hey anybody here on the list

307
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,800
then different governments are saying

308
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,079
hey who's involved who who in this

309
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:38,160
country is involved who in this country

310
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,320
is involved then large customers want to

311
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,000
have meetings and understand what's

312
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,120
going on

313
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,320
so business escalation customer outreach

314
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,120
critical and being prepared to handle

315
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,360
those escalations very very critical at

316
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,800
that time

317
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,360
communications

318
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,440
we had not

319
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,560
done a test of this magnitude uh but we

320
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:03,760
knew we had to communicate on mass so we

321
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,480
we stood up uh websites we start banners

322
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,160
on our websites we pointed people to

323
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,959
information we had faqs so we're

324
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:13,680
updating that information constantly

325
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:17,279
over the over the weeks afterwards and

326
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,200
you know one of the reasons why you end

327
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,160
up with so many long nights

328
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,160
and just the other thing you expect is

329
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,880
is nights you know days start at seven

330
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,120
six they go until you know three and

331
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,800
even three in the morning basically

332
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,560
every morning reason being is you're

333
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,800
doing so much during the day meeting

334
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,959
with customers meeting with governments

335
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:39,279
meeting with the fbi meeting with a

336
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:41,360
meeting with everybody then when do you

337
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,200
get time to review all the documents

338
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,639
that you want to push out

339
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:46,480
that's at one in the morning

340
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,440
so

341
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,600
it and they need to be done

342
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,000
so you just have to assume that that is

343
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,240
the life

344
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:58,320
so law enforcement absolutely involved

345
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,000
more pushing information to law

346
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
enforcement and

347
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,760
you know law enforcement was after the

348
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,000
attribution side of the world so we were

349
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
pushing information to them really

350
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,560
wasn't resp in involved in the response

351
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,600
as much

352
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,480
uh engaged additional help so one of the

353
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,200
things that we found was that we needed

354
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:22,079
help especially on the um

355
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:24,560
on the build system

356
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:25,519
model

357
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:28,560
and investigating our software

358
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,240
development practices and where the

359
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,560
builds may have been

360
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,959
affected so

361
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:37,040
crowd straight great team great great

362
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:40,320
hunting team not developers per se

363
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,760
not really experienced in the

364
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,800
development world so kpmg forensics team

365
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,880
came in and focused there they

366
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,560
essentially looked at every check-in for

367
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,880
two years they started looking for build

368
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,320
environments they started looking for

369
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,959
build systems with our teams and and

370
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,279
looking over all over could we find a

371
00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:00,240
build system that had the code that

372
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,959
actually got inserted uh turned out in

373
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:05,519
february we found a build machine that

374
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:07,600
had crashed because of other mechanisms

375
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,279
that got backed up

376
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:11,360
since that build system crashed and was

377
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,440
backed up we actually found the source

378
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,480
to sunspot and found the source too

379
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:20,160
super uh it sunburst and sunspot so we

380
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,399
found the insertion point turned out the

381
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:23,760
code that they inserted into our

382
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,320
environment they had decompiled so they

383
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,560
built it compiled it decompiled it and

384
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,120
then inserted it into our system so all

385
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,639
markers were removed but it was still

386
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:36,959
yeah from a researcher's perspective you

387
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,959
never find the code so actually being

388
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:41,040
able to find a code was a big deal

389
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,480
didn't tell us much because we had

390
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,560
already decompiled everything ourselves

391
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,720
but it was still very interesting to be

392
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,040
able to see that we found that so don't

393
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,360
be afraid in one of these instances to

394
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,600
you know engage additional help also

395
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:57,199
involve chris chris krebs and alex damos

396
00:14:57,199 --> 00:14:59,920
chris gave us entry points into the

397
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,760
defenders of the world

398
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,519
and that was a big thing he gave us

399
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:05,120
introductions to be able to talk to

400
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,199
everyone so

401
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:09,839
the national defenders work slightly

402
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:11,920
different across the world but great

403
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:15,600
missions um really still on the kind of

404
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,600
pure mission side

405
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,800
um

406
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,800
communication what we knew to customers

407
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,079
you know we told them what we knew we

408
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:23,920
told them what we didn't know

409
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,320
we put information online we put faqs

410
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,680
online we

411
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:30,079
move people to those um

412
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:32,079
got people to those we sent out mailing

413
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:33,839
to every one of our clients or every one

414
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:35,839
of our customers that we knew

415
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:37,759
one of the things that turned out

416
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:39,440
didn't work well was we didn't have

417
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,920
contact information for everybody we had

418
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,480
sales contact information for everybody

419
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,720
not security contact information for

420
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,639
everyone so

421
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:50,880
after incident we put a inside of our

422
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,399
sales force we now have a security

423
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:55,680
contact named security contact inside of

424
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,839
every customer or every customer that

425
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:00,480
gives us one so that that way we can

426
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,880
communicate to the right people but we

427
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,279
were finding that we weren't getting to

428
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:08,560
every client there

429
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:11,279
so enable support teams so you have to

430
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:13,040
remember when this was going on our

431
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,279
support queue was going like crazy i

432
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:18,320
think at one point it was 19 000 deep

433
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,560
so we're looking at this support queue

434
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,560
that is growing and growing and growing

435
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,639
we're trying to get back to everyone and

436
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:26,800
we have a business escalation model that

437
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,480
says okay for certain customers for

438
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,240
certain things for certain you know

439
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,680
anybody said i'm a government of the

440
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,680
world we would talk to them those types

441
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:38,320
of things but it was all all outreach um

442
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,279
yeah so the world is on fire um great

443
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:44,880
research being done um and since we

444
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,800
would not talk to press

445
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,959
press invents other things

446
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:51,680
they talk to old disgruntled employees

447
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,839
they talk to others they try to get

448
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:56,320
headlines and just expect that right

449
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:59,759
news is news and they want news and

450
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:01,600
a lot of the researchers

451
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,680
really did top-notch work

452
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,919
no question

453
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:08,240
but it is you have to understand

454
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:11,280
different motivations occur during this

455
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,199
this period of time people want to use

456
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:14,799
it to get a name people want to use it

457
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:16,799
to build their business and you know i'm

458
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:18,559
not against commercialization by any

459
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:20,720
means it just is what it is

460
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:24,640
when i say that ciso was pure cis

461
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,959
only mission was to amplify truth

462
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:28,960
getting to that truth with them was a

463
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,200
struggle but once we got to it they

464
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,000
really did amplify really well but we

465
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,360
had researchers coming out of the

466
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,799
woodwork of just trying to give

467
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:38,960
different information or trying to you

468
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,039
know get in the press and get quoted and

469
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:42,960
all of those things happened

470
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,520
so you just have to expect it

471
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,840
um

472
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,679
let's see

473
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:53,840
yeah so if you had if we had fi

474
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,240
gone through and tried to

475
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:59,280
fight every miss um

476
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:02,000
a communicated message that was coming

477
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,760
over media there's no way we would have

478
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,880
been able to do what our job was so

479
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,280
you know the fbi did not raid our

480
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:12,080
offices that was in the press we did not

481
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,559
disrupt the voting systems that was in

482
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:16,799
the press we did not you know all of

483
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:19,520
those things happen so lessons learned

484
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,480
uh

485
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,000
you'll be outnumbered you'll be

486
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,600
outclassed you will be out maneuvered uh

487
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,480
no question right yeah microsoft was

488
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,960
upset because we were mentioning that

489
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:33,600
o365

490
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,600
had the potential to

491
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,480
have

492
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,080
be corrupted

493
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,400
okay so in our case with what they

494
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,480
utilized was an illicit consent grant

495
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,559
which means somebody had privilege they

496
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:46,960
put the illicit consent grant model into

497
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,320
place in our o365 environment and that

498
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:53,280
enabled emails to be read

499
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:56,880
um a model that they have you know said

500
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:57,840
exists

501
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,880
they said we were one of 60 when they um

502
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,280
first communicated during during uh

503
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,120
testimonies and then it turned out

504
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,760
another 250 customers had that same

505
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:10,880
model implemented it against them but

506
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,760
calling out that microsoft o365 had a

507
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:17,600
problem was terrible right for microsoft

508
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,600
and so when you look at out communicated

509
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,440
outnumbered you know we were dealing

510
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,880
with microsoft's

511
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,799
communication we were dealing with fire

512
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:26,400
eyes we were dealing researchers of the

513
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,120
world so expect that you're outnumbered

514
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,960
you know remember what others are going

515
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,799
through so no matter what you're going

516
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:34,720
through you know it may have ruined my

517
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,880
christmas but every one of our customers

518
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,480
needed to research are we using

519
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,400
solarwinds are we using an affected

520
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,600
version so even though they truly

521
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,960
affected ones that were exploited was

522
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,360
yeah what we say now is under 100 right

523
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:52,799
we're truly exploited by this everybody

524
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:55,039
in the world was looking at it so we

525
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:56,960
ruined everybody's christmas and

526
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,320
remember that

527
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,919
when you're doing things bring in the

528
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:01,760
correct partners

529
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,760
and don't be afraid to change partners

530
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,320
or ad partners as you need create

531
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,960
escalation models for each focus area

532
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,960
don't fight the small stuff

533
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,039
there's so much false stuff

534
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:14,880
going on it's okay not to have the

535
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,559
answers

536
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:19,600
investigations take time but it's

537
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,600
important to be aggressive and don't

538
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,240
miss things and really grow a hard shell

539
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,679
you know if i listen to all the bad

540
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:27,440
things that were being said about me

541
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,520
during this kind of time frame i

542
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,799
wouldn't have been able to get anything

543
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:32,799
done so essentially you have to just

544
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:35,360
turn off press and focus on the

545
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,919
customers and get things done

546
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:40,080
the months that fall out

547
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,960
so investigation continue

548
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,200
threat hunting kpmg

549
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,799
scrubbing the build systems and code

550
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:50,080
repositories uh we continue with fbi

551
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,159
briefings every time we we found

552
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:54,159
something meaningful we essentially

553
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:57,200
followed up on every anomaly that you

554
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,440
see within the environment so

555
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,760
crowdstrike kpmg in our environment

556
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,480
until about may deeply so they find

557
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,600
stuff

558
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,360
expect them to find things and expect

559
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,520
that your list of things to fix to be

560
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,799
pretty big

561
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:12,559
we found the source and we made it

562
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:14,400
available in february

563
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,600
we testified for the house and senate um

564
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,520
we expanded customer meetings to include

565
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,840
governments of the world industry groups

566
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,159
everyone so we went out there and

567
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:26,880
purposely targeted the isacs of the

568
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,440
world we purposely targeted any group of

569
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,600
individuals that we could get to

570
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,840
um you know we were having meetings with

571
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,640
you know 800 people so and the meetings

572
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,480
focused on you know this is what we know

573
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,159
this is what happened you know this is

574
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:42,159
what we're doing about it

575
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:44,320
we implemented an orion assistance

576
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,159
program so we were helping anybody that

577
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:48,640
needed to upgrade and doing it out of

578
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,320
our dime so it said you're running an

579
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,159
affected version let's help you get off

580
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:54,799
of that so we did that on you know

581
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:57,919
basically paid for that um we one of the

582
00:21:57,919 --> 00:21:59,760
big things that people didn't see is we

583
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,360
revoked our prime

584
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:04,399
our signing cert

585
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,760
so the the cert that was utilized to

586
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:11,200
sign those builds between march and june

587
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,640
we revoked

588
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:16,720
and that revocation process

589
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:19,520
we used the same search to sign many of

590
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,280
our other products

591
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,600
so what we had to do is rebuild every

592
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:26,640
product solo and sell and ship a new one

593
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:29,760
out and do it quickly

594
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:32,080
certificate authorities are

595
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,559
very reasonable and you can work with

596
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:36,480
them the first date they gave us was

597
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,320
like five days

598
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,640
and we were able to talk to them and

599
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,720
negotiate to about a month

600
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,120
but yeah don't think the first answer is

601
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,120
the right answer because there was no

602
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,039
way we could get everything rebuilt in

603
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:52,480
five days um and this it was a very good

604
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:55,280
plan to you know basically revoke our

605
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,039
cert so therefore those versions that

606
00:22:57,039 --> 00:22:58,720
were affected will not be able to run

607
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,799
without warnings anywhere

608
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:03,280
um created a two-way build products

609
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:06,080
process so we quickly said okay this

610
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,919
this affected our build environment so

611
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:10,720
what can we do so january 25th build

612
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,720
implemented two ways so essentially we

613
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:15,440
go from source code uh build process

614
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:18,000
pipeline to product we now decompile the

615
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,080
product check the hashes for every

616
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,840
source file and the hashes for every

617
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:24,640
library and then compare them and don't

618
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,799
ship until all of those compares are

619
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:28,960
done now slightly different between

620
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:31,360
different language so that was january

621
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,559
time frame

622
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:34,400
we're now on to three-way build

623
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,280
processes so we have three pipelines for

624
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,840
for build we have a security pipeline we

625
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,600
have validation pipeline we have a

626
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,600
development pipeline

627
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:46,320
anytime we do a build a production build

628
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,640
we build three times no one person has

629
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:51,520
access to each of those builds and then

630
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:54,480
we um so you have security associated

631
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,559
but then we compare those three bills

632
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:58,240
there's some white papers listed at the

633
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,240
end of this that go into details on the

634
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,679
build process

635
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:03,600
but we also submitted that back to open

636
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,200
source

637
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:08,080
we really finished in for information on

638
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,240
investigation about may and then

639
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,640
published a root cause analysis

640
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:15,200
so lessons learned

641
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:18,000
be humble be honest share what you can

642
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,960
take ownership for it right it happened

643
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,360
so there's no way you should be able to

644
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,039
hide from what happened

645
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:27,600
um develop a plan to tie everything

646
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,919
together and partner with others to help

647
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:33,200
help with the experience so our plan to

648
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,400
kind of tie our response back was titled

649
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:39,200
secure by design and that moniker is

650
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,520
kind of where everything fits you know

651
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,360
if you have a cool name expect it to be

652
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:47,440
utilized and it is so microsoft came up

653
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,600
with the attacker name how many know

654
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,520
what it was

655
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,520
yeah it was new bellium so do you

656
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,679
remember new bellium or do you remember

657
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:56,960
solarwinds

658
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,720
so

659
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,039
so you'll see everywhere in the press

660
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:04,880
solarwinds attacks uh or attacks email

661
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:07,919
for department of justice solarwinds

662
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:10,400
attacks this solarwinds attacks it as

663
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,480
opposed to the solarwind the the people

664
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:15,919
that attack solo ends have also attacked

665
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:17,520
so we got

666
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:20,880
uh our name got very much tied together

667
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,919
with the attacker and a lot of press

668
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:26,159
just kind of latches on to that because

669
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:27,840
it's easier

670
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,360
with additional research focused

671
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,200
additional vulnerabilities be found so

672
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,679
you have to be prepared to respond so

673
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:35,760
that what that means is that when we had

674
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,520
our incident we had researchers around

675
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,440
the world finding additional things into

676
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,679
the into our products and reporting them

677
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:44,320
some responsible some not responsible

678
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,880
but you had to be ready to prepare with

679
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,720
updates you have to be able to be

680
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,039
prepared to do those things be prepared

681
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:53,279
to take hard questions right so so many

682
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:55,679
hard questions from so many people

683
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:58,320
take the opportunity to become exemplary

684
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,559
um this is you know one of the big

685
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:02,960
lessons right how do we

686
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,400
how do we come out of this how do we

687
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,320
come out of this with our you know our

688
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,320
customers still loved our products our

689
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,080
still customers still wanted to move

690
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:12,640
forward with us but how do we make sure

691
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,799
that they're comfortable doing that we'd

692
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:16,720
be exemplary so

693
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:19,360
the build process exemplary nobody does

694
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,600
triple builds with you know all those

695
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,440
verifications

696
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:26,720
for you know my own internal teams i run

697
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:29,200
three socks or actually four i have um

698
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:32,320
crowdstrike sock i have secure works all

699
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,080
the information goes into them i have my

700
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,400
own sock and i have kpmg doing low and

701
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,720
slow basically threat hunting against my

702
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,960
environment so more visibility into the

703
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,720
environment yeah people don't

704
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,799
necessarily do that we stood up our own

705
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:47,279
red team for doing a lot of things so

706
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:49,279
when you can find ways to be exemplary

707
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:51,840
in the market do that and share as much

708
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,840
as you can with the community very very

709
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,279
critical

710
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:58,400
so final thoughts uh pivotal event

711
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,480
caused many changes across the globe

712
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,640
yeah many csos thank me for helping with

713
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,400
their budget

714
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:08,080
many csos thank me for surviving

715
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,240
right because i am one i am the one that

716
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:13,600
lived um so it spurred a lot of

717
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,440
conversations on public-private

718
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,600
partnership you know the executive order

719
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,360
was a result of

720
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,679
what we went through a lot of the

721
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:23,279
information sharing

722
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:25,520
mechanisms that we're going through are

723
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,679
a result of what we go through so the

724
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:30,159
event has caused some good on the

725
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:32,159
outside

726
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:34,399
increased it has increased level of

727
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:37,039
transparent expected of vendors so we

728
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:39,039
talk a little about contracts and other

729
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:40,320
things you know the amount of

730
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,480
information we're willing to share is

731
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,159
much more than we were before the

732
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:47,360
incident um yeah just quickly ken bible

733
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,039
cso4

734
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:50,799
dhs

735
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:53,440
he came to me and said tim you know

736
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,799
understand you went through this stuff

737
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:56,480
understand these things here's what i'm

738
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,760
going to do i'm going to send you 12

739
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,840
questions and i want them answered

740
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:02,000
completely and what i will do is i will

741
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,480
ask anybody that is wants to replace you

742
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,799
to answer those same questions

743
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:08,880
so we publish these questions as well

744
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,159
but it was like what's your network

745
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:12,080
design what do you use for tools what do

746
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,600
you how do you protect the environment

747
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:16,240
how do you protect code so as opposed to

748
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,919
generic answers i answered them very

749
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:20,080
specific i said we run check marks and

750
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:22,080
white source on every build i have 44

751
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,159
pairs of palo altos that protect my

752
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:26,399
network i run rapid 7 for a

753
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:28,799
vulnerability scanner i have

754
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:31,279
so you name it right but stuff you would

755
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:34,320
not normally do that's what we did and

756
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:35,919
from a vendor perspective that

757
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:39,039
transparency is now expected by others

758
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:41,520
contracts have changed and transparency

759
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:44,159
is expected from others so brought the

760
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:46,399
supply chain conversation the forefront

761
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:48,399
and we hope the lessons can help others

762
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:49,760
right and that's the big thing that we

763
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,760
can kind of take out of this

764
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,919
so lead by example

765
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:56,559
um and here's a few links to some

766
00:28:56,559 --> 00:28:58,480
different resources for us

767
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,240
so i don't know how much time i've got

768
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,840
for a couple questions

769
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:02,799
do i have

770
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:04,480
two

771
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:07,679
any questions from folks

772
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:13,840
they're gonna make you walk

773
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,240
so the question everyone wants to know

774
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:19,039
tim is how did you save your job

775
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:20,640
yeah no no

776
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,799
great point so i would have fired me if

777
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:24,799
i didn't have the right skills

778
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:27,760
all right plain and simple now

779
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:30,240
luckily through my career i'd done a lot

780
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,679
of different things i had talked to a

781
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:33,200
lot of people around the world i was

782
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,880
very comfortable talking in large

783
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:37,200
environments i'm very comfortable taking

784
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,880
ownership for things

785
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:42,159
um if you're a back room cso start

786
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:44,000
building those skills

787
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,320
because without those skills you have to

788
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,640
remember i'm on on the phone with the

789
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:51,600
highest levels of you know every major

790
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:54,240
corporation in the world sometimes with

791
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,720
you know hundreds of people on the phone

792
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,880
and hard questions being asked that i

793
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,720
had to answer

794
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,960
develop those skills if you're a cso

795
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,960
because i would have fired me i couldn't

796
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,960
i wouldn't i would absolutely have fired

797
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:09,120
me if i didn't have those skills but i

798
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,720
did and

799
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:14,159
i became essential to our response

800
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:17,200
and you know uh sue darker was asked of

801
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,440
that question so our ceo was asked to

802
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,880
ask that question well why didn't you

803
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:23,200
fire tim he said well if i was going to

804
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,200
hire somebody i would hire tim

805
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:28,559
so that was his answer

806
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:31,039
all right question over here oh perfect

807
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:32,799
not a question actually it's a comment

808
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:33,919
thank you

809
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:35,200
thank you for your transparency and

810
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,919
thank you for what you've done

811
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:39,600
thank you

812
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,919
i just want to say you you moved the

813
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:44,000
needle it did ruin everyone's christmas

814
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
and it became the poster child for lots

815
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,840
of things and the way you've handled

816
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:50,240
this has been exemplary and should be a

817
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,919
model for everyone else so thank you

818
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:53,679
thank you for your transparency

819
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:55,279
thank you very much and remember it

820
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:56,720
takes time

821
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,159
so one

822
00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:00,240
one final thought on that just remember

823
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:03,279
that the press will be ruthless to you

824
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:06,080
and until the corner is changed it took

825
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:08,720
about six months maybe seven months

826
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,640
before that

827
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:13,120
corner change so you know just keep

828
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,640
going and

829
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,720
they would eventually as your customers

830
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:19,600
do they change and they you know the the

831
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,840
title unprecedented uh attack on

832
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:24,320
presidential response was the title of a

833
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:27,039
ciso uh magazine article

834
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:30,000
um that you know that i was focused on

835
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,600
but the um

836
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:34,240
the big thing was that the press had

837
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,320
changed they saw it as an unprecedented

838
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,640
attack and they appreciated our response
