1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,240
foreign

2
00:00:05,299 --> 00:00:07,080
Edwards I'm the vice president of

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:09,300
operational technology

4
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:11,700
what I want to talk about in this

5
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:13,920
session and what Glenn was going to talk

6
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,940
about is why tenable why why do you want

7
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:20,760
to choose tenable as your partner in

8
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:24,359
this space and what else are we doing in

9
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:26,760
this space outside of what I would

10
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:29,220
characterize as pure

11
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:33,120
OT right tenable's a big company right

12
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,680
35

13
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:37,920
000 plus customers half of the Fortune

14
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,980
500

15
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:44,160
when I was hired I I worked for the

16
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,160
chief technology officer at the time

17
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:50,039
Renault derasal and Renault wrote nessus

18
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:52,320
right so everybody in this industry

19
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,420
including myself and I have no technical

20
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:56,699
chops anymore right I'm a guy who wears

21
00:00:56,699 --> 00:01:00,360
his suit jacket uh everybody has touched

22
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:03,199
nessus right we have

23
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:07,920
10 million plus nessus agents and

24
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,500
installs out there I think something

25
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,780
like that so

26
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:16,200
what I want to impart upon you I guess

27
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,880
is that

28
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:20,700
um we are a little bit different of a

29
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:23,100
player in this OT cyber security Market

30
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:25,920
than some of the Pure Play

31
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,320
OT cyber security vendors that are for

32
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,180
the vast majority of them are startups

33
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:33,479
right and into G2 was a startup when we

34
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:37,200
acquired them in 2019 and that became

35
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,079
the tenable OT portfolio

36
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:44,340
right so tenable is a company global

37
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:49,020
presence 24 7 365. we've got depth in

38
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:52,680
Services training engineering etc etc

39
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,700
etc

40
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:57,060
research and development we ourselves do

41
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:00,299
a lot of zero day research on these

42
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:02,520
devices so I have worked with our

43
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,619
researchers who have coordinated

44
00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:07,860
vulnerabilities in plc's with the PLC

45
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:11,038
manufacturers and so we devote a quite a

46
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:13,620
significant portion of our budget to

47
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:15,780
these types of r d efforts and we

48
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:18,420
believe that that brings us closer to

49
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:21,959
the problem and helps us understand how

50
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:23,760
do we better detect it how do we give

51
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,860
our customers better advice on how to

52
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:28,560
mitigate it well if we helped find the

53
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,140
problem it keeps it keeps them all fresh

54
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:32,340
right

55
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:34,920
so I think if you any of you were in my

56
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,959
earlier uh conversation this morning

57
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:39,540
which was around OT maintenance I went

58
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:42,480
through the OT product a little bit I'd

59
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,220
like to kind of go over some of that

60
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:46,200
again so apologies if you were in both

61
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:49,980
sessions so when we acquired into G in

62
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:54,840
2019 we primarily acquired it for its

63
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,840
strength in the active query capability

64
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:59,400
indigee had a patented capability that

65
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,840
allowed it to reach out to these

66
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:04,019
industrial control system devices and in

67
00:03:04,019 --> 00:03:06,060
the native language that they speak so

68
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:09,060
Siemens controller we ask the controller

69
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:10,739
very politely

70
00:03:10,739 --> 00:03:12,720
who are you what do you do what's your

71
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,300
firmware and it answers back

72
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:17,640
it was very different than what most of

73
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:20,159
the industry was doing was listening

74
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:23,340
passively parsing that data and then

75
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:25,500
quite frankly taking educated guesses

76
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,420
based on what they could get out of that

77
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:30,360
data stream and we were doing it too

78
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,640
tenable had an existing industrial

79
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,800
security product that that's exactly

80
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,319
what it did it basically took the data

81
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:40,739
in we wrote parsers or plugins to

82
00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:42,959
identify it using nessus network monitor

83
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:44,760
which is the passive version of nessus

84
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:47,940
and we we got feedback from our

85
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:50,400
customers that it wasn't good enough

86
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,760
that you needed sensors everywhere or

87
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,860
you needed span ports everywhere or you

88
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,659
needed access to all of these networks

89
00:03:57,659 --> 00:03:59,819
that in the OT space can be highly

90
00:03:59,819 --> 00:04:03,780
segmented and drilled down or remote and

91
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:06,840
so this active capability basically if

92
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:09,900
you've got a routable path to the device

93
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:12,180
we can go out and lightly touch the

94
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:14,760
device and get that data back so we've

95
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,798
got some customers that use very little

96
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:19,440
to no passive ingest capability they use

97
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,600
only the active capabilities to reach

98
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,940
out in these sort of large Network

99
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:26,340
implementations right

100
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:30,900
well tenable is probably best known for

101
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,940
nessus and vulnerability management

102
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,440
right risk-based vulnerability

103
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,500
management so our intent take that data

104
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:40,680
roll it into the VM engine and now we

105
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:43,139
can go and tell you every cve and every

106
00:04:43,139 --> 00:04:45,000
vulnerability that is known that we can

107
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,180
map back to those specific devices

108
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:50,280
awesome right so now we've got that

109
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:53,160
whole VM side on the OT side

110
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,060
um

111
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:56,460
when you combine that in large

112
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:59,220
corporations and our largest customers

113
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:01,800
tell us this they don't want to have to

114
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,240
manage

115
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:07,259
that data on the OT side in maybe a

116
00:05:07,259 --> 00:05:09,060
hundred different plants

117
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:11,340
and corporate they want to pull that all

118
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:13,740
together so on day one when we Acquired

119
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:16,380
indigee and announced that acquisition

120
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:18,660
that data already flowed into tenable

121
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:20,040
security Center which is their

122
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,419
on-premises vulnerability management

123
00:05:21,419 --> 00:05:24,900
product and into tenable i o which is

124
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,520
our cloud-based vulnerability management

125
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:30,479
product right so we believe fully in the

126
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:32,340
giving you I hate the term but the

127
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:34,020
single pane glass or the holistic

128
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:36,360
solution it really matters from a

129
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:39,919
vulnerability management perspective

130
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,060
however

131
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:46,320
vulnerability management is not the end

132
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:50,100
game right it's a part of securing your

133
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,259
overall uh

134
00:05:52,259 --> 00:05:54,900
infrastructure right so what we

135
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:57,900
recognized was becoming one of the key

136
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,759
uh

137
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:03,840
enablers of especially ransomware was

138
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,539
lateral movement using credentials that

139
00:06:06,539 --> 00:06:09,419
had been compromised right so credential

140
00:06:09,419 --> 00:06:12,060
management identity management was

141
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:14,340
becoming a huge thing for our customers

142
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:16,620
and a massive challenge so the next

143
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:18,660
acquisition that we went and did was a

144
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:21,840
company called alcid and alsid had a

145
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,580
technology that allowed them to

146
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:25,740
essentially audit your active directory

147
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:29,280
implementations and come back with hey

148
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,620
did you know that you've got domain

149
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:34,680
admin on all of these boxes here or did

150
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,060
you know that you've got this group

151
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:39,060
policy object misconfigured that is

152
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:40,560
leading to

153
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,220
um

154
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:43,440
challenges in how you're managing and

155
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,960
controlling your identities and in the

156
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,940
OT space

157
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:52,319
we you know we see people who have uh

158
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:54,600
basically shared credentials across the

159
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:57,479
segments or even integrated active

160
00:06:57,479 --> 00:07:00,060
directories right so the OT system is

161
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:01,620
reaching out to a corporate active

162
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:03,780
directory server for for those

163
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:05,819
credentials and that's not necessarily A

164
00:07:05,819 --> 00:07:07,500
recommended practice right

165
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:10,639
so we we believe that

166
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:12,360
understanding the vulnerability

167
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,759
management landscape where are you

168
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:17,100
vulnerable what devices are vulnerable

169
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:21,660
what are those software vulnerabilities

170
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:24,180
it's incredibly important to couple that

171
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:27,180
together with who are the users on that

172
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:30,300
box what privileges do they have what

173
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:33,599
challenges or weaknesses in in that

174
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:36,060
configuration exist

175
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:39,300
so we'll pull that back into

176
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:42,780
the common data Lake and be able to tell

177
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:46,259
you hey not only do you have significant

178
00:07:46,259 --> 00:07:48,599
software vulnerabilities here but you

179
00:07:48,599 --> 00:07:51,060
have some very high privileged accounts

180
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:53,280
running on that box and when you put

181
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,919
those two things together now you've got

182
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:57,599
a real problem

183
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:02,160
okay so uh we believe that you know a

184
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,780
vulnerability I guess is a vulnerability

185
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:05,520
is a vulnerability which is what the

186
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,680
title of the original Talk was right so

187
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,919
it's kind of like you have to manage

188
00:08:10,919 --> 00:08:14,400
these weaknesses whether they're in

189
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,680
software volumes like from the vendor

190
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,180
right you get the piece of software from

191
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:19,500
the vendor it's got a weakness in it

192
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,539
whether it's an identity sort of

193
00:08:21,539 --> 00:08:23,759
vulnerability or whether it's a

194
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:25,500
configuration vulnerability so you know

195
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,060
I talked earlier in my other session

196
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:30,720
about tenable OTS capability to read the

197
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,380
logic out of the controller and to be

198
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:37,260
able to snapshot that logic and then we

199
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:39,719
can basically baseline or do a diff on

200
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:41,640
it and tell you what changes have

201
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:42,719
happened

202
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:44,640
well maybe those changes came from the

203
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,260
engineering workstation but maybe they

204
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:48,680
came from malware from compromise right

205
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:51,120
we will continue to build on those

206
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,300
capabilities to you know evaluate the

207
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:58,200
security posture of that logic

208
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,200
so we're not done yet we keep we keep on

209
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:05,279
the m a train here right so

210
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:09,120
our new Chief product officer Nico pop

211
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:13,080
so Nico is is been watching and

212
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:15,000
evaluating this

213
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,760
everything is Shifting to the cloud and

214
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,760
I'm an old hardcore OT guy right I'm a

215
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,500
control system engineer and I thought I

216
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:25,920
would never see the day when OT and

217
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,560
scada was moving to the cloud

218
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,200
a couple years ago I was at an

219
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,500
International Event and a company pulled

220
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:37,580
me aside and they said

221
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,100
we just basically cut a contract with a

222
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:43,339
cloud service provider

223
00:09:43,339 --> 00:09:47,940
to take our entire scada system all the

224
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:50,220
front-end processors all of the

225
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:52,440
communications gear

226
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:56,339
and put it into the public cloud

227
00:09:56,339 --> 00:09:58,740
the only thing that they have in their

228
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:01,019
sort of substation or pumping station is

229
00:10:01,019 --> 00:10:04,200
a water utility pumping arrangements and

230
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:07,080
that is the sensors the rtus everything

231
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:09,420
else is in the cloud they said holy crap

232
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:12,839
what what you well this in the cloud why

233
00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:15,060
why why did you do that what what's the

234
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:16,320
justification

235
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,500
and they said

236
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:22,620
when we looked at the math and we went

237
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:26,820
through how many dollars it took us to

238
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:31,200
maintain the metal the servers the racks

239
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,100
the air conditioning the power

240
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:37,500
the whole infrastructure to manage their

241
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,420
own mini data centers that were their

242
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:41,459
scada front-end processors and all these

243
00:10:41,459 --> 00:10:43,800
you know racks of Dell software whatever

244
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,899
what vendor they used

245
00:10:45,899 --> 00:10:49,019
they said we found out that when you

246
00:10:49,019 --> 00:10:51,120
looked at the cost

247
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,060
we could hire we could buy that from the

248
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:57,600
cloud service provider at a fraction of

249
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,800
the cost

250
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,560
not only that but the added bonus was

251
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,200
that the cloud service provider

252
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,000
guaranteed us

253
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,100
99.99999 however many nines you want to

254
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:10,079
buy it's just however big your contract

255
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:13,019
is right you can buy as much reliability

256
00:11:13,019 --> 00:11:15,920
or availability that you want

257
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:19,740
and as an added bonus

258
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:23,100
if it goes down the contract says that

259
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:25,740
you'll get paid back right I mean so

260
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:28,019
they give you guarantees for that

261
00:11:28,019 --> 00:11:31,380
availability contractual guarantees and

262
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:33,060
so when they looked at it they said it

263
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:34,860
did not make sense for us to maintain

264
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,839
that architecture anymore

265
00:11:36,839 --> 00:11:38,820
so and that was a couple years ago so

266
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:41,339
I'm going oh okay maybe Marty should

267
00:11:41,339 --> 00:11:43,260
readjust his thinking a little bit and

268
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:47,100
there is some genuine solid use cases

269
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:50,040
for this kind of capability

270
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:53,519
so and then and this wasn't part of the

271
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:55,680
decision process but the next

272
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,140
acquisition that tenable made is a

273
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:00,240
company called uh

274
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:04,440
curex and their uh claim to fame is

275
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:09,000
basically doing the analysis of

276
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,880
the infrastructure as code in those

277
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:14,579
cloud or in those devops kinds of

278
00:12:14,579 --> 00:12:18,720
situations and Shifting the analysis of

279
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,820
your vulnerability management and your

280
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:23,940
security profile to the left as far as

281
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:26,940
you can so you're essentially evaluating

282
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:30,360
your code as it's being written

283
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:34,220
you are recommending or automatically

284
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:36,899
patching that code remediating the

285
00:12:36,899 --> 00:12:39,540
vulnerabilities in that code as it goes

286
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:41,399
to prod right so as you're shifting

287
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:43,380
stuff to production you're closing the

288
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:44,940
vulnerability before it almost even

289
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:47,519
exists and so if you're familiar with

290
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:50,880
this environment uh Terra scan is their

291
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:54,060
open source platform that is very

292
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:56,220
similar to nessus right so this is kind

293
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:58,760
of fits with tenable sort of community

294
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:03,360
uh desire in that we have these tools

295
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,459
that are available at free or at low

296
00:13:05,459 --> 00:13:08,399
cost to our users right

297
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:11,399
so I got thinking about oh okay well

298
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:13,920
how's this how's this all fit with OT

299
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:17,880
and I I must admit that

300
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,820
I didn't see it a lot until it was

301
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:23,820
yesterday I went to

302
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:26,459
um I went to the the presentation on

303
00:13:26,459 --> 00:13:28,980
containerization

304
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:32,399
and so now we see people in the OT and

305
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:34,880
ICS space

306
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,320
containerizing all of these critical

307
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:40,200
components within their

308
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:43,079
OT environments right well

309
00:13:43,079 --> 00:13:46,920
we can apply these same Technologies to

310
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:49,139
container security that we can apply to

311
00:13:49,139 --> 00:13:51,540
the cloud security right so you want to

312
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:53,880
evaluate the security that's inside this

313
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,440
container that's doing this one thing

314
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,079
okay we have a product that can do that

315
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:03,180
so I I see this Vision or this

316
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:07,139
transition in the ICS and OT space

317
00:14:07,139 --> 00:14:10,740
where we're moving slowly like kind of

318
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:13,200
like how my hair moves slowly we're

319
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,720
moving away from

320
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,880
all of our own Hardware all of our own

321
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:21,600
metal to not necessarily public Cloud

322
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,519
infrastructures all the time but maybe

323
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:26,120
it's a cluster of you know a kubernetes

324
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:28,560
containers right that we're using or

325
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,060
whatever your container of the month

326
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:32,459
club is

327
00:14:32,459 --> 00:14:37,019
tenable I believe is the company that is

328
00:14:37,019 --> 00:14:39,300
well positioned to follow that

329
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:42,420
transition right so if you invest in

330
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:45,660
tenable ot to solve those OT problems on

331
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:48,420
those physical platforms now

332
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:50,220
tomorrow

333
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:54,000
will solve those problems for you in the

334
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,519
cloud on a container wherever wherever

335
00:14:56,519 --> 00:14:59,519
the technology goes we're very well

336
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:03,540
positioned to adjust and adapt and

337
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:06,360
provide you those Solutions in your

338
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:09,060
critical infrastructure applications

339
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:13,740
so that's that's kind of Marty's uh

340
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:16,380
short form version of what my chief

341
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:18,240
technology officer was kind of going to

342
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,699
lay out for you and seeing that this is

343
00:15:20,699 --> 00:15:23,100
a fairly small crowd I'd like to open it

344
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:25,920
up to questions and okay full disclosure

345
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,660
we're a publicly traded company so I'm

346
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:30,060
not going to be able to answer any and

347
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:32,160
all questions but I'll try to do my best

348
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:35,040
and kind of into this ask me anything

349
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:38,699
sort of session sir so we have a mic

350
00:15:38,699 --> 00:15:41,599
Runner I think

351
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:50,100
so um we do have some business units

352
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:51,779
that's talking about uh putting some

353
00:15:51,779 --> 00:15:53,660
critical I guess components in the cloud

354
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:57,600
and I did go to that uh containerized uh

355
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,600
session one thing that that one thing

356
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:03,420
that we have concerned with is that the

357
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:06,240
throughput if you put of the control

358
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,079
systems if you put all this in the cloud

359
00:16:09,079 --> 00:16:12,000
I mean I guess my question is like what

360
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,820
you what do you think of that because

361
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:17,940
for me my my uh the right local is that

362
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:20,220
the Drupal is going to be much slower

363
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:22,320
so so you're actually losing some of

364
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,839
their fail abilities

365
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:26,880
um it's a it's an interesting

366
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,760
perspective that you have because I

367
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,199
actually would say that my perspective

368
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:33,540
is exactly opposite of that that once

369
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:36,779
you go to a containerized sort of

370
00:16:36,779 --> 00:16:40,079
platform or a cloud-based platform you

371
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:42,420
can essentially buy or scale to whatever

372
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:45,899
size you need right so you can grow or

373
00:16:45,899 --> 00:16:48,120
Shrink almost in real time to whatever

374
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:51,300
the application needs I think from a

375
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:53,699
latency perspective we might see some

376
00:16:53,699 --> 00:16:55,680
stuff that's still closely coupled to i

377
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,660
o in certain applications like if you're

378
00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:00,300
looking at protective relays for example

379
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:01,860
and I think the gentleman who is doing

380
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:04,199
the presentation you know talked about

381
00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:05,520
that right if you've got something

382
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,500
that's solving in microseconds or

383
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,720
milliseconds yeah it's probably not

384
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,579
going to be in a public Cloud it's not

385
00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:13,740
going to be an AWS East one you know

386
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:15,900
somewhere right it's going to be close

387
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,299
coupled

388
00:17:17,299 --> 00:17:19,980
could it be containerized in a piece of

389
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:22,280
Hardware that sits beside yeah probably

390
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:27,419
so I think that I think that for me the

391
00:17:27,419 --> 00:17:29,520
advantages clearly are the scalability

392
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,860
right you can kind of spin this stuff up

393
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:34,799
and down uh I really loved the way that

394
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:37,799
he was talking about uh you know

395
00:17:37,799 --> 00:17:40,679
evaluating the code basically as it's

396
00:17:40,679 --> 00:17:42,660
being written and that that fits right

397
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:44,900
into what we see on the Enterprise

398
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:48,539
devops side we haven't adopted that yet

399
00:17:48,539 --> 00:17:51,780
like I I can't wait for the day that if

400
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:54,179
I was still a controls engineer if I was

401
00:17:54,179 --> 00:17:55,799
writing ladder logic or function

402
00:17:55,799 --> 00:17:58,020
sequence block logic or some sort of

403
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:00,419
control logic that there's actually an

404
00:18:00,419 --> 00:18:04,500
engine that's evaluating my logic as is

405
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,660
as I'm writing it to make sure that I

406
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:08,820
don't screw it up right so as long as

407
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:11,340
I've articulated the objectives I

408
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,919
haven't you know put myself into a

409
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:16,919
security weakness or even a function a

410
00:18:16,919 --> 00:18:19,740
function weakness right I mean it

411
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:22,200
it kind of blows my mind as an old

412
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,660
hardcore you know you write your logic

413
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:28,080
you compile it you pray you hope that it

414
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,780
runs and it runs it compiles overnight

415
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:32,400
and you come in and there's a printout

416
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,799
on a dot matrix printer of these you

417
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:36,480
know eight million errors because you

418
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,480
missed a comma on line four

419
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:41,520
that's where I come from so I I think

420
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,919
that we'll get through those challenges

421
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:46,740
that's that's my belief anyway

422
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:49,520
ma'am

423
00:18:51,059 --> 00:18:54,120
so as we're evolving also from a

424
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:56,820
procurement perspective I'm still seeing

425
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:58,580
a lot of companies reference security

426
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:02,039
requirements and very much an OT context

427
00:19:02,039 --> 00:19:04,799
and you know nerk's new guidance is is

428
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:06,660
really helpful

429
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:09,000
um so I'm curious about if you have any

430
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,100
thoughts on how you would sort of tune

431
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:14,160
your requirements or take advantage of

432
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,660
additional visibility with

433
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:17,700
infrastructure as a code and you know

434
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:19,140
cloud-based

435
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:21,000
um cloud-based types of SAS and

436
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,799
platforms yeah for sure it's an

437
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:24,660
excellent question

438
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:26,720
um

439
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,100
first of all I'm really happy to hear

440
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:30,600
that people are actually putting

441
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:31,919
security requirements in their

442
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:34,140
procurement you know language or in

443
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:35,460
their contracts right because that

444
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:38,820
hasn't always been the case uh I think

445
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:40,320
we're going to have to be flexible right

446
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,480
and one of the things that that I've

447
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,640
seen come out of the government recently

448
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,380
that I think has been fairly widely

449
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:48,059
criticized is there seems to be a

450
00:19:48,059 --> 00:19:50,220
pendulum swing back to very prescriptive

451
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:52,740
technical controls which are very hard

452
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:56,160
for asset owners to implement in a

453
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,780
flexible way right so we need to get

454
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:00,539
more outcome oriented performance-based

455
00:20:00,539 --> 00:20:03,380
kind of uh

456
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:06,480
objectives right rather than these these

457
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,039
technical controls

458
00:20:08,039 --> 00:20:11,280
I think that if you follow that kind of

459
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:15,539
process then the the how specifically

460
00:20:15,539 --> 00:20:18,600
that you do it so as we go to an extreme

461
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,700
like infrastructure as code where it's

462
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:23,460
basically a Control Function has code

463
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:26,400
right I think that we can adapt I think

464
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,140
that we can move forward I think that it

465
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:31,200
will actually help simplify some of the

466
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,320
procurement and I mean we sort of a

467
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,419
tangential thought that just came to my

468
00:20:36,419 --> 00:20:39,179
mind is when I sit down and talk to you

469
00:20:39,179 --> 00:20:41,100
know Chief information security officers

470
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:45,179
or I talk to the procurement people they

471
00:20:45,179 --> 00:20:47,340
love companies like tenable that they

472
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:50,520
can do vendor consolidation and what you

473
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:52,860
mean you can actually give me what I

474
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:56,520
took four vendors to do before so that

475
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:57,960
coupled with things like Enterprise

476
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:00,179
licensing where

477
00:21:00,179 --> 00:21:02,940
we really aren't going to care where

478
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:05,400
your asset lives right so you have an

479
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,160
you have a hundred thousand Enterprise

480
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:11,580
machines and you need to have 50 000 you

481
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:14,100
know iot or or control system devices

482
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:16,860
you know you buy a pool of licenses and

483
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:18,120
and you're going to be able to shift

484
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:20,160
those around dynamically no matter if

485
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,900
it's vulnerability management active

486
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:23,039
directory

487
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:27,059
OT iot and I think that enabling our

488
00:21:27,059 --> 00:21:29,640
customers with that flexibility really

489
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:32,179
streamline some of the the procurement

490
00:21:32,179 --> 00:21:35,039
issues so I I don't think I quite got

491
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:37,020
your question answered but I'm confident

492
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:39,960
we can we can get there in the end

493
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,700
sir

494
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:44,039
oh man look at that Polly's bringing his

495
00:21:44,039 --> 00:21:46,940
skateboard in

496
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:50,059
he's trying to sneak in the back too

497
00:21:50,059 --> 00:21:52,740
unfortunately I've been in this OT space

498
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:55,320
too long but I know everybody almost so

499
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:57,000
certainly great to see you Michael

500
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,159
milray from National resilience we are

501
00:21:59,159 --> 00:22:01,340
one of the fastest growing biopharma

502
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:03,120
manufacturers in the country we're

503
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,220
bringing manufacturing back home

504
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:08,059
we're bringing it back

505
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:11,100
we're also a close Ally partner with the

506
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:13,159
Department of Defense manufacturing

507
00:22:13,159 --> 00:22:14,720
various

508
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:18,240
Partners as well so large yep yep large

509
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,940
uh monoclonal responses to various bio

510
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:23,580
threats man-made naturally occurring we

511
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:26,280
decided to go down the tenable route and

512
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:28,860
and have gained a lot significant value

513
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:31,440
not only in the act of polling active

514
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,059
query to really understand the machine

515
00:22:33,059 --> 00:22:35,460
State Integrity of our controllers of

516
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:36,900
our OT

517
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:39,240
but also Asset Management

518
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:41,760
our automation control system Engineers

519
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,360
are getting a lot of value of the

520
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:47,640
ability to enumerate what we have what's

521
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,860
the current machine State Integrity what

522
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:51,720
changes have happened so just on an

523
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:54,000
asset management and because of that

524
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,980
they've become part of the security team

525
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:58,020
and I think in absence of that if we we

526
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:00,360
have a gap there nothing happens so will

527
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:01,860
we enumerated all these vulnerabilities

528
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:05,100
that are still there two years later but

529
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:06,900
because the automation team has come out

530
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:08,580
and we told them later now they have a

531
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:10,380
second job as part of the ICS security

532
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:12,840
team we kind of snuck that in later

533
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:15,000
you know it's it's uh

534
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
we had a panel earlier

535
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,059
um this afternoon with servicenow and

536
00:23:21,059 --> 00:23:23,820
FedEx and we were talking about you know

537
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:26,159
just because you discover or find some

538
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:28,080
of these weaknesses right you find a

539
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:31,020
vulnerability in some asset you need to

540
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:33,059
have the workflow and the Automation in

541
00:23:33,059 --> 00:23:34,919
place to be able to assign that to

542
00:23:34,919 --> 00:23:37,679
somebody to track who's doing it and

543
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:39,960
then you know in some cases in the

544
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,780
Enterprise side of things we can

545
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:44,159
actually

546
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:45,120
um

547
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,820
when we cut the when we the integration

548
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:50,220
with servicenow and like uh automation

549
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:52,380
sort of providers when we cut that

550
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:53,880
ticket that says hey you need to go

551
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,380
patch this thing

552
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:57,539
it assigns the ticket to the remediation

553
00:23:57,539 --> 00:24:00,059
team the remediation team says okay I

554
00:24:00,059 --> 00:24:02,700
patched this thing it can actually fire

555
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:04,919
off another scan that goes back and

556
00:24:04,919 --> 00:24:07,320
checks that it was fixed before it

557
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,480
closes the ticket right so yeah that

558
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,340
kind of Automation and being able to

559
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:14,159
switch between the workflows I think is

560
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:16,080
hugely important and no I didn't pay him

561
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,900
as a paid Advertiser but I love the

562
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:20,520
asset management the two areas that I

563
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:23,100
think would move even closer to that

564
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:25,440
holistic single pane of glass Panacea

565
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:28,320
that you referred to as better

566
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,120
understanding machine State Integrity

567
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:32,220
before it becomes a package so at the

568
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:34,980
process oriented level the physics which

569
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:37,020
we all know it's it's not for every type

570
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:39,000
of attack for but for very stealthy

571
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,960
attacks for supply chain attacks apts

572
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,940
understanding change with changes in

573
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:47,100
frequency and voltage and then having

574
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:49,320
that core correlated that a networking

575
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:51,240
layer that because then you can start to

576
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:53,460
rule certain behaviors completely out as

577
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:56,100
hey this is not yeah this is not good I

578
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:58,140
think that and then a deeper

579
00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:00,600
level firmware analysis and then I think

580
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,880
it's single pane of glass I think you've

581
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,159
solved all the world's problems and I

582
00:25:05,159 --> 00:25:06,360
don't know if I've solved all the

583
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:07,980
world's problems but I I don't

584
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:09,900
necessarily disagree and I'm also a big

585
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:12,980
fan of the uh

586
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:15,659
consequence driven cyber-informed

587
00:25:15,659 --> 00:25:17,700
engineering or CCE the Idaho National

588
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:19,620
Laboratory has been doing right so you

589
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:22,559
you start to analyze those things and

590
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:25,020
build the safeguards into the physics

591
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:27,240
right so that you're you're not relying

592
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:30,179
on the the cyber-based system to do the

593
00:25:30,179 --> 00:25:32,640
protections so in the last couple

594
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,020
minutes here if there's any other

595
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:38,340
questions you know we we uh also didn't

596
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:41,220
stop at at the uh the cloud or or

597
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:43,500
infrastructure as code edge we've also

598
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:46,440
recently announced that we've purchased

599
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:49,320
the company symptom and that is going to

600
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:51,480
help us with attack path analysis right

601
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:54,000
so now we can do automated analysis of

602
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,279
the attack paths that are happening

603
00:25:56,279 --> 00:25:58,919
through all of these interconnected

604
00:25:58,919 --> 00:26:02,580
so the end message as I get more people

605
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:05,520
in the room is that tenable is the right

606
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:08,340
partner to partner with on the

607
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:11,400
Enterprise side as well as the OT side

608
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:14,220
as well as in the containers and in the

609
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:16,620
cloud we're going to have the technology

610
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:19,679
if we don't already it will be developed

611
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:21,480
to basically Harden your critical

612
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:24,120
infrastructure profile under that

613
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:27,419
holistic single pane of glass so with

614
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:29,520
that thank you for coming to my

615
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,260
presentation and I'll give Andrew a

616
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:33,419
couple minutes that he can use

617
00:26:33,419 --> 00:26:34,280
thank you

618
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:37,359
[Applause]
