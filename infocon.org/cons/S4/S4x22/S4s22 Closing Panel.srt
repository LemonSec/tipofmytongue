14
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,010
i've told some of you

15
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:35,920
[Applause]

16
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,719
absolutely

17
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:44,239
they do a great job every year but we

18
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:45,200
had the

19
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,280
challenge of moving the date

20
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,520
and then she had the challenge of i had

21
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,600
two years of things to think of things

22
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,440
that i wanted to add so i kept adding

23
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,280
more to it and more to it and more to it

24
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,039
so it made her job tougher and tougher

25
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:58,800
but she did a great job she had a great

26
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,199
team from barbara edwards who helped her

27
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:02,800
on the stages

28
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,519
i had a great team i had

29
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:06,560
i had

30
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,360
najo eyefield on the main stage i had

31
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,080
kate vaja on this stage she did a great

32
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,000
job with this stage and stephanie

33
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,280
downstairs

34
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,560
you know just they i didn't have to

35
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,920
worry about the stages they ran the

36
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,759
stages so it was great

37
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:21,759
we had everlast doing the av here

38
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:23,439
pearson over at the

39
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:25,759
fillmore they were really helpful

40
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:27,280
and then

41
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,280
and then really the speakers

42
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,920
i mean we spend a lot of time we put our

43
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,280
speakers through the ringer a little bit

44
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,960
they send something in we go back and

45
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,360
forth back and forth back and forth

46
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,960
but we really want to put together a

47
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,240
good show for you things that are

48
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,920
bleeding edge and the speakers i think

49
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,680
really came through this year so please

50
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,960
can you join me in thanking them

51
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,840
and since we started

52
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,360
late the call for papers is coming in

53
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,280
june so we're already starting for next

54
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,600
year so if you thought of something you

55
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,360
have a feel for s4 you've been here you

56
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,280
know what s4 is like you know what works

57
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,560
at s4

58
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,320
if you think of something when the call

59
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,080
for papers comes out it's a really

60
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,399
simple process you just email us two to

61
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:12,560
three paragraphs we'll give you a quick

62
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,720
yes no or more likely we'll go back and

63
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,640
forth to see if it's a fit

64
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,560
and sometimes there's great sessions

65
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,400
that just aren't a fit so

66
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,920
you know there's a lot of other events

67
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,680
they can go at but we're always trying

68
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,920
to put together the best agenda we can

69
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,360
every year

70
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,040
and then the last

71
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,560
thing i want to just thank is i want to

72
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,800

coming here spending a week of your time

75
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,879
especially after everything we've been

76
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:40,800
through the last two years to come here

77
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,959
and i would say to come here in such

78
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:44,400
generous spirit

79
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,239
you know the way you all work together

80
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:49,280
it was really touching um

81
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:53,280

it's being refurbed

89
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:10,400
so it's not available at all next year

90

the lowe's which is on 16th and collins

92
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000

93
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,879
guarantee you will make it feel very s4

94

heard a lot

121
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:22,880
but i always like to ask kind of a weird

122
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,919
question what aren't we talking about

123
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:28,080
what are we missing that's important and

124
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,520
that you should be thinking about for

125
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,600
next year so zach i'll start with you

126

that she did so obviously

139
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,160
cce is a really good thing dale and you

140
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,840
should just come on board you can watch

141
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,000
the podcast where annie and i

142
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,320
argue about cce i'll include a link in

143
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,000
the next email and we argue ourselves

144
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,680
and it's one of those things that uh you

145
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,120
know keeps it fresh but you know one of

146
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,160
the things that we were talking about

147
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,080
some of the stuff earlier but as i was

148
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,600
over on the side i thought about it i

149
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,440
looked through the different uh agendas

150
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,720
i said the one thing that there was

151
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,840
nothing on was it ot convergence this

152
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:20,960
year

153
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,960
and and dale goes i don't know what that

154
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,560
means right i mean we've been arguing

155
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,440
about this discussing it papers you know

156
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,840
fights probably in plants somewhere but

157
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,360
it didn't make the agenda at all it

158
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,320
didn't really make much of our

159
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,199
discussion um you know and if it means

160
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:38,240
we move past it i think that's good um

161
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,560
if i think we've given up then that's

162
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,479
bad well so it was

163
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:44,160
so what do you think well i mean it's

164
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,199
almost like i don't believe in

165
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:46,720
convergence you know that so i believe

166
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,800
that there's interdependence right it

167
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,960
and ot will never converge the the

168
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,520
fields have to have such specialization

169
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,800
that you know we would go beyond

170
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,479
unicorns you know and i don't even know

171
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:58,080
what's beyond the unicorn

172
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,919
and so i think that understanding those

173
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:01,759
those interdependencies and making sure

174
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:03,520
that we use the best skills from from

175
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,440
each of those domains is where we really

176
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,520
need to go but the key really is to make

177
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,600
sure that management understands how

178
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,120
they're operating their plans right if

179
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,560
they want to converge converge right

180
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,319
they want to have you know split

181
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:16,160
capabilities that's fine but don't just

182
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,240
you know leave it up hanging in the air

183
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,160
one you you can think even sometimes in

184
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,560
i.t there are fields in i.t whether it

185
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,120
could be you know your erp system or or

186
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,600
some sort of e-commerce farm quote those

187
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,919
don't converge with desktop management

188
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:32,240
they are they are separate so maybe that

189
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,520
is a better word you have any thought on

190
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,960
that megan

191
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,199
yeah i mean i think the itot convergence

192
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:39,199
has been happening over the past 10

193
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:41,280
years right it's like when to to your

194
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,360
point is that the conversation is done

195
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,800
have we said everything that we need to

196
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,039
say i'm honestly surprised that we don't

197
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:50,479
see more arguments in favor of

198
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:52,880
the the hyper connectivity can actually

199
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,880
equate to more security but i i think

200
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,319
that the messaging and the marketing

201
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:58,080
around that is super hard especially if

202
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,680
you're looking at things in terms of a

203
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:03,199
6243-3 context i don't mean to throw out

204
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:05,840
jargon with you all but um i i do think

205
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,000
that that that's a big point i think

206
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,680
another thing that we didn't talk a lot

207
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,680
about was just standardization of

208
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,240
security features and systems of systems

209
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,039
approaches as well and um you know zack

210
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:19,680
here is certainly a a rose between two

211
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,919
thorns you might say today but

212
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:23,890
uh i haven't been called a rose

213
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:26,639
[Laughter]

214
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:29,039
yeah i mean i think itot was kind of an

215
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:30,400
obvious thing or is it just an

216
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,720
undercurrent now at this point yeah very

217
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,880
good how about you megan anything that

218
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,160
you think

219
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,639
we didn't hear about that surprised you

220
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,160
or worries you

221
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,360
you know i'm always very interested in

222
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,599
kind of the policy element so i started

223
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:47,120
my career out more in kind of homeland

224
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,199
security policy and organizational

225
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:51,280
theory so i always look at

226
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,759
at the uh the industry as a whole in

227
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:55,520
terms of how are we measuring our

228
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,199
maturity i think that we're on a

229
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:59,919
spectrum i just don't know how to detect

230
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:02,000
where we are on the spectrum in terms of

231
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,160
an industry that is maturing for ics

232
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,160
security um

233
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,240
you know i'm i came from an emergency

234
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,919
management background as well so i tend

235
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:11,919
to always pull that threat and that i

236
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:14,080
could make the point easily to you all

237
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,199
that

238
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:17,759
ics cyber security is a form of a

239
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:20,080
disaster science and disaster science

240
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,400
has been studied you know pretty pretty

241
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,280
much

242
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,240
since the 1920s the 1930s we studied it

243
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,720
with hurricanes tornadoes we understand

244
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,759
likelihood we have great data sets

245
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:33,839
you're seeing some of that come up now i

246
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:35,360
don't think that it's where it needs to

247
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,279
be but everyone in the audience you're

248
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:39,599
all emergency managers congratulations i

249
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:41,679
mean that's truly the view that i have

250
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:42,719
well you know what i'd like to add you

251
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:43,919
know we were talking about this before

252
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,040
and a lot of the things some of the

253
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,880
things we have been talking about i

254
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,120
think that um over the last 15 years of

255
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,440
s4s um as a community we've determined

256
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,120
that yeah we really are key to risk

257
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,279
management in organizations right so you

258
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:56,959
know you know once again a lot of topics

259
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:58,399
that used to just all be about security

260
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:00,399
secure that you know hack this hack that

261
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:02,240
now it's about reduce the risk here

262
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,480
identify risks perform mitigation so i

263
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,880
think the community is maturing a lot of

264
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,560
it has to do with some of the

265
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,720
competition we we now have for uh for

266
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,720
funds um used to be that was like how to

267
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,560
make the business case for security and

268
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,440
then we got to the point where we were

269
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,279
making business cases and then we were

270
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:19,200
competing with the other business cases

271
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,640
so now we're becoming more and more

272
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,920
relevant and as a community i think

273
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,680
we're understanding that

274
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,000
you know i won't rehash

275
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,800
my amazing keynote that was related but

276
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,959
completely different from cce but

277
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:34,399
i think that

278
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:37,120
what i see a lot of is in presentations

279
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,200
i see people

280
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,519
say well i shouldn't say security so

281
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:43,120
i'll put risk

282
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,000
you know so it's i i think i like the

283
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,920
language turning but i you know it's

284
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,040
kind of what you were saying with this

285
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,959
emergency i think we're still

286
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:52,959
on this branch where we tend to look at

287
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:55,040
everything saying what is the security

288
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,279
implication of this as opposed to what

289
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:00,560
is the risk or the emergency preparation

290
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,240
now zach you mentioned uh when we were

291
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,200
talking about this you mentioned

292
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,560
workforce

293
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,320
you thought that was an issue that maybe

294
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,920
we didn't hit hard enough here yeah and

295
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,519
i think you know and sometimes there may

296
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:12,320
be some some thematic biases from the

297
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,720
person that chooses the

298
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,880
content um because i'm sure inl must

299
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,200
have put something like that in there

300
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,399
but

301
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:22,480
but because um

302
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,000
especially over the last two years of

303
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,519
people in lockdown

304
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:27,040
you see a lot of competition now with

305
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,959
people who you know would like to just

306
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:30,720
do their jobs at home

307
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,640
and uh and even brings in conflict with

308
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,000
with people in organizations who are

309
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,160
operational and they can't operate that

310
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,000
plant from their living room and the

311
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,079
people that can and so we want to figure

312
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:41,279
out how we can

313
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,040
once again make sure everyone is as part

314
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,200
of the mission understands the impact

315
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,880
but try to make both sides happy which

316
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,519
is which is always a difficult thing but

317
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:52,959
at the same time um and and nothing was

318
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:55,440
said about a million you know open cyber

319
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,920
jobs or something like that um

320
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,360
for that workforce we have to make sure

321
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,959
that we're making you know more secure

322
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:03,200
systems better software etc so we don't

323
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,160
need to have all of those extra

324
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,760
cyber professionals i do want to give a

325
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,920
plug we were hoping that the um

326
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,200
the national con

327
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,720
cyber informed engineering strategy

328
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,320
would have been signed out by the

329
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,240
secretary of energy this week and then

330
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,279
try to announce it here it's in the

331
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:19,279
works it'll be coming but i know even

332
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:20,800
one of the unsolicited response folks

333
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,399
was talking about you know

334
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:24,480
requirements you know at each phase and

335
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,920
not just the requirements but also the

336
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,680
traceability like a safety requirement

337
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,600
like a feature and so hopefully that

338
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,360
strategy as it starts coming out and

339
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,560
being applied you know we're working

340
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:35,360
with universities with cymani um to uh

341
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,640
to apply some of these things and

342
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,000
hopefully we'll have some ways to

343
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,480
actually you know trace requirements uh

344
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,720
and not just talk about build security

345
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,320
and building code for building code i

346
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,760
did the fire analogies and everything

347
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,360
else but actually have a way to do it

348
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,200
and once again so schneider's been you

349
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,279
know a leaning forward in some of these

350
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:53,200
things for quite a long time and so

351
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,800
i know you must have

352
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,399
so when we when we're talking about

353
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,959
workforce and um you know i you could

354
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:01,360
argue that product security within the

355
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,000
overall ics or ot security is even a

356
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,560
smaller domain and it's super funny if

357
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,480
you've been in the product security

358
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,839
space over the past 10 years

359
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:13,200
working with i'll tell you it's

360
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,560
something funny i found out over the

361
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,079
past year that apparently the u.s

362
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:18,160
government calls the ics vendors the

363
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,160
seven sisters okay

364
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,040
and

365
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,279
i worked i worked at ge i've worked at

366
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:25,200
rockwall automation and i'm at schneider

367
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,800
electric now they're all wonderful

368
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,519
companies but i tell you so many of us

369
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:31,519
have been on each other's teams and we

370
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:33,440
go to other companies and we learn and

371
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,920
we're taking the best of breed from

372
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,519
from the learnings of all of these

373
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:40,399
programs and so collectively

374
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:41,680
i don't know that we're doing it in a

375
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,079
very intentional way but it is happening

376
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:45,680
we're sharing and we're growing the

377
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:48,480
discipline of product security for ics

378
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,279
security but it's so incestuous i mean

379
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:53,680
we all know one another so many of us

380
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,399
actually started at ge i told dale

381
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:59,040
earlier i said i have my job and the

382
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,120
life that i have now because of project

383
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,360
base camp i'm not joking with you i was

384
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,720
working in

385
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,079
government for the commonwealth of

386
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:08,079
virginia in emergency management and

387
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:09,519
traditional critical infrastructure

388
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:12,480
protection and a gentleman corey jackson

389
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,560
he knew me from fbi infraguard and he

390
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,440
said

391
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,920
i know you don't know cyber but we can

392
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:21,200
teach you cyber we can't teach people

393
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,480
the knowledge that you have around

394
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,560
emergency management and how to write

395
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,320
integrated and coordinated response

396
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:29,040
plans and how to work with dhs and all

397
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,120
these other entities and so when

398
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,519
project-based camp happened

399
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:36,480
ge saw it the other seven sisters saw it

400
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,079
and they responded and they started

401
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:41,120
staffing up in reaction to

402
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,040
uh to project base camp so they knew

403
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,320
that they needed to do something and

404
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,480
that's how i got into

405
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,480
a piecer but when we talk about

406
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,320
workfirst in general i can tell you

407
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,880
something that i saw across come across

408
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,040
the past years that siemens announced

409
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,199
during the pandemic that they were

410
00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:00,079
moving to a model i think they called it

411
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:02,160
work where you're most productive and of

412
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,079
course since uh again it's a very

413
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:06,079
incestuous you know community we all

414
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:08,160
kind of share the same people and it's

415
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,320
almost like trading in the nfl you know

416
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,480
is so and so going over this team is so

417
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,800
and so going to that team uh maggie

418
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,880
maraganti and i were playing a fun game

419
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,880
and we were like which vendor would be

420
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,800
what football game i'll let you all have

421
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,560
the same conversation and let it play

422
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,800
out it's a little bit funny but

423
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,880
i was like man that's a bold move by

424
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,639
siemens they could take some of our

425
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:31,199
people or and so you you monitor these

426
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:33,680
things and you monitor um what other

427
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,760
companies are doing and how you can best

428
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,279
position yourself and give yourself some

429
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:38,800
maneuver room when it comes to your

430
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,800
workforce because you want to you want

431
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,639
to keep and retain the best talent

432
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:44,639
possible you know i hope that you know a

433
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:45,920
bunch of out here will stay in your

434
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,120
current positions for the next six

435
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,360
months so linkedin and my contacts list

436
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,880
you can normalize again because you know

437
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,519
so you don't see those little balloons

438
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:55,120
you know wait you move where when what

439
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,040
you did something so so please help me

440
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,639
out here but

441
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:00,240
you know when you say that what siemens

442
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:03,360
did work where you're most productive

443
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,360
who decides that

444
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,880
the individual

445
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,959
really yeah i mean they basically they

446
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:11,120
said if you've been remote you can stay

447
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,040
remote so work if you want to go into

448
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,560
the office go into the office if you

449
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,560
want to work from home then work from

450
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,839
home at least that's the way that i

451
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:19,199
interpret it of course i can't speak

452
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:21,360
from siemens but it was a notable item

453
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,360
that i remember during the pandemic

454
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,959
directly impacting workforce and i

455
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:25,839
thought i thought it was really

456
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:27,920
innovative yeah and you know and we

457
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,759
discussed this you know earlier um you

458
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:30,800
know

459
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,320
apple's doing one thing google's doing

460
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,920
another it's going to take i think the

461
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,000
next 18 to 24 months you know people are

462
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,440
going to be disaffected with having to

463
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,720
go back to the office they're going to

464
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,480
stay and try and find a job where they

465
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,759
work at home they're going to realize

466
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:43,600
that they don't have team dynamics and

467
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,000
may not be recognized as much and so how

468
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,759
do you trade off that you know really

469
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:49,680
additional work-life balance for the

470
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,360
work balance that you

471
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,120
you know so it's going to it's going to

472
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,720
take us all a couple of years i think to

473
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,000
get back on track and i think the

474
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,440
numbers are going to be interesting i've

475
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,600
seen some successful organizations even

476
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,800
in this industry where they have

477
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,480
distributed teams

478
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,160
and the company pays a fair amount of

479
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,600
money to bring them together every

480
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,639
quarter you know so they work on their

481
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:10,560
own wherever they have to most the time

482
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,079
and then one week a quarter they get

483
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:13,600
together somewhere beautiful in the

484
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,720
world and

485
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,560
and do something but i don't know how

486
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,759
that wins with the numbers you don't

487
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:19,519
need the big building anymore so maybe

488
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:22,160
that pays for that but well to see well

489
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,880
let's let's move on to another issue

490
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,800
uh we had

491
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,079
you know

492
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:29,920
i always save a few spots because things

493
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,639
sometimes happen right before s4 we had

494
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:34,160
a bunch of things we had triton and

495
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,759
before that i think we had the first

496
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:38,160
ukraine attack and the second ukraine

497
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,399
attack and then i started saving spaces

498
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:42,320
and nothing happened for years and years

499
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,240
and years but this year some things

500
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,839
happened we had

501
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:47,839
we had obviously in control and pipe

502
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:51,120
dream and in destroyer 2

503
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,959
and we got some technical presentations

504
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:54,880
but megan what do you think it means i

505
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,880
mean what is there anything we should

506
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,440
read in the fact that we had three

507
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,839
kind of new semi-advanced tools out

508
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:04,400
there that were discovered

509
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,039
i

510
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:06,959
i mean the the obvious thing for me to

511
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:09,039
say is that the activity is picking up

512
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:10,559
but i mean but

513
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:13,679
we all we all kind of know that right

514
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:15,119
yeah and you know of course you know

515
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:17,599
well no the predecessor in that chair

516
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:19,359
would always tell us that there's no

517
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:21,679
activity he would say that the activity

518
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:23,439
wasn't picking up because we we did we

519
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:25,839
got went many years without

520
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:27,679
a substantial

521
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:28,720
event

522
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,160
yeah i and

523
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,080
and i saw i saw a lot of his commentary

524
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,840
on twitter where uh there was a

525
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:34,960
particular

526
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,760
attack and he said um this actually was

527
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,720
not an ot attack this was something that

528
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,520
downstream ultimately impacted ot and i

529
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,600
won't say that he was you know outright

530
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,520
wrong like i could follow the same logic

531
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,520
right

532
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,120
well you know i think that um there was

533
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,960
a period of attack and then

534
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,799
consolidation you know seeing what

535
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:56,559
worked and what didn't i think that

536
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:57,919
maybe you know both the offense and

537
00:17:57,919 --> 00:17:59,200
defense were

538
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,559
you know getting their acts together but

539
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:02,000
of course you know once again the the

540
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,400
designs on ukraine you know i mean we go

541
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,679
back to the time when we couldn't say

542
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:07,600
who that actor was and so now there's

543
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,080
there's no need to pretend um but um

544
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,160
there's there's also the weird dynamic

545
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:12,799
of

546
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:14,960
of people trying to help hey how can i

547
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,120
how can i help dod you go and do this

548
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,559
and like please don't right you know i

549
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:20,080
think you know let's let's let's all

550
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,919
make national policy in our own little

551
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:24,080
way um and you know that that could be

552
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,480
fun um but it's um

553
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,679
you know we're seeing all sorts of

554
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:28,960
different actors you know raise their

555
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:31,200
head and then in some cases not raise

556
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,320
their head which is going to be just as

557
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,160
interesting do either of you have any

558
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,720
thoughts on how it was handled like the

559
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,559
response because it's you know it's been

560
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:40,640
out for a week or two did

561
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,320
the vendors did oh i guess maybe i

562
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,520
shouldn't have that might not be fair to

563
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,280
ask you but did if you do have a comment

564
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,799
you're more than welcome to how do we

565
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:49,679
feel like the community did the vendors

566
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:52,240
the researchers the companies that put

567
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,559
out information i think it felt i think

568
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:57,840
it felt different this time i think

569
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,480
i think that there was a recognition of

570
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,360
the effort and the work that went into

571
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,400
kind of

572
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,480
analyzing what was going on and getting

573
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,919
the information out there and

574
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:09,679
understanding it in a very open and

575
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:12,000
transparent matter i don't think that it

576
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,120
was a lot of uh like the finger pointing

577
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,120
or a lot of the negativity i mean even

578
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,880
from the press the way the press reacted

579
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,320
to it i think that most people kind of

580
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,400
saw it for what it was and at the end of

581
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,600
the day we

582
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,760
you know we're proud of the response

583
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,679
we're proud that no one was attacked i

584
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:29,919
mean there are many data points here

585
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:32,000
that all of us in this room should

586
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,600
should feel good about because as a

587
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,720
community collectively we we want if

588
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,000
it's going gonna happen we want it to

589
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,240
happen in this way but i will say this

590
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,320
from my opinion the the overall thing

591
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,400
and again like people will tell you any

592
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,480
conversation with megan sanford turns

593
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,559
into a strategy discussion okay i always

594
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:52,240
get a strategy and we we live in such a

595
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,720
moment in time day by day when these

596
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:57,840
events happen and i really worry that

597
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,000
we're not analyzing what the data is

598
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,760
telling us in the background we were

599
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:04,000
talking earlier that again i'm bringing

600
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,720
it back to disaster science but

601
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,880
we have things in emergency management

602
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,480
traditional emergency management and

603
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:13,039
disaster science

604
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:14,880
research and just the community and the

605
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,960
collective as a whole where we have data

606
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,400
states we can look to that tell us

607
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,400
likelihood of events occurring so when i

608
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,600
worked in traditional critical

609
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,919
infrastructure protection we could tell

610
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:25,360
you through

611
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,440
through risk models that were very well

612
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,600
calibrated on any given day the

613
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,400
likelihood of an ied attacking a

614
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,840
particular type of building in a

615
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,640
particular type of geography we almost

616
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,120
got to that level of precision after 9

617
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,120
11 with physical infrastructures and

618
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:43,440
physical attacks but we were only able

619
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,400
to get there because we had correlates

620
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,799
of terrorism of terrorism index we had

621
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:50,720
the correlates of war index that was

622
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:53,200
started at the university of chicago the

623
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,840
cow the correlates of war basically it's

624
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,919
a large data set that anyone can access

625
00:20:57,919 --> 00:20:59,679
but it tells you these are all the wars

626
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:02,240
that have occurred in the history of

627
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,720
human civilization this is who started

628
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,799
the war who fought in the war what type

629
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:08,720
of weapons were used how many people

630
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:09,679
died

631
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:12,240
this is a data set that people can study

632
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,240
and students can research and we have

633
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,480
that for terrorism events as well

634
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,400
but we don't have that for cyber we have

635
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,960
no way to calculate likelihood i've been

636
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,640
saying that we've been doing security

637
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:25,840
the same way for the past 3 500 years as

638
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:28,400
civilizations we identify those assets

639
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,720
that are most significant to us

640
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,640
and we put really big walls around those

641
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,400
assets and then we completely ignore

642
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,679
likelihood

643
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:38,320
that's not that's not risk management

644
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,919
yeah well you know so one thing i've

645
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:41,679
heard and and the government is an

646
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:43,520
interesting place now you know some you

647
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,200
know asset owners you know we're calling

648
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,120
their vendors in different cases um

649
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,400
because they're they're getting the

650
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,080
information fast they have capabilities

651
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,840
you know there's you know different uh

652
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,120
you know organizations that have done

653
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,960
analysis and it's and they're they'll

654
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,360
call the government and say hey um you

655
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,799
know what's happening there we're

656
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:01,600
hearing this from over here and and

657
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,200
they don't want to get it wrong

658
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,600
and so they wait but by waiting you know

659
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,360
they can either delay some types of

660
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,120
response or seem like they're not on top

661
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,039
of it um so i think that that jenny

662
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:13,360
still is going to be kind of responsible

663
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,559
for for

664
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:16,000
upping that pace just a little bit more

665
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,520
to try and keep up with with the

666
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,880
industry which has you know really you

667
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,640
know gotten pretty smart about how these

668
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,919
things you know come about and then what

669
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:23,200
to go do with them

670
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,280
yeah you know i haven't i've been so

671
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,960
busy getting ready for this and i

672
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,720
haven't had time to dig deep in this and

673
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,159
i probably will and i'll write something

674
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:32,559
but seeing that mandiant

675
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:34,720
presentation

676
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,280
and they had that one module

677
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,760
in in controller that basically was

678
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,760
taking advantage of insecure by design

679
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,679
so you get on there and then you have

680
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:45,520
this swiss army knife that does all

681
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,120
these things and

682
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:50,000
in a way i feel and it was extensible so

683
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,600
right now it's doing this but then it's

684
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,280
going to have a siemens plug-in it's

685
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,120
gonna have a dmp3 plug-in it's gonna

686
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,679
have you know a heart plug-in

687
00:22:57,679 --> 00:22:59,760
i feel lucky that we didn't get that for

688
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,520
10 years yeah i mean because it was

689
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,520
envisioned back at base camp 10 years

690
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,840
ago it was that a lot of the people in

691
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,280
this room could have built something

692
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,720
like that i wasn't a former digital bond

693
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,640
employee i'm writing this i i hope not

694
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,679
okay

695
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:12,799
i was thinking wow i wonder where they

696
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:14,400
went to school and learning

697
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,799
a cool technique you know i i so that's

698
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:18,720
something and i do wonder i i mentioned

699
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,159
it to jenna at the end of our interview

700
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:22,799
i just wonder if i don't think it will

701
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:24,559
be but i hope this will be a wake-up

702
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:26,960
call that hey this this thing that once

703
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,480
it gets inside you talked about those

704
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,480
walls megan well once you get inside

705
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,159
this walls you let something like this

706
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:34,240
loose it's it's going to wreak some

707
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:37,360
havoc out there okay let's let's shift

708
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,120
here

709
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,640
i have um

710
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,080
you know i did a lot of work on the

711
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,919
detection space a lot of analysis on

712
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:46,159
that space and and that space is kind of

713
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:47,760
i wouldn't call it mature but it's past

714
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,559
the early stages now we've kind of had a

715
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:52,480
sorting out of the vendors but we're

716
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,799
seeing something rise now in the s-bomb

717
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:56,960
area the s-bomb firmware analysis area

718
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,880
and that seems to be if there's going to

719
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,120
be one that's the leading candidate with

720
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,720
you look at the number of companies you

721
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:05,520
have several companies

722
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:08,799
with some level of ot focus

723
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:10,880
creating s-bombs finding vulnerabilities

724
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,559
finding weak configuration firmware

725
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:14,960
software analysis

726
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:17,039
and we had some talks here we had eric

727
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:20,640
byers we had jens weisner we had a

728
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,480
two-hour session on the s-bomb that was

729
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:25,760
pretty well attended so it seems to be

730
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,440
something that is gaining momentum

731
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,120
because of supply chain security and

732
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,559
everything

733
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:32,880
you can address this question either way

734
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,880
you can make a prediction as to which

735
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,720
way you see it going what you see which

736
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,120
way do you see this going or what you

737
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,640
see as one or two of the major

738
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:41,919
challenges

739
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:43,520
well you know so so

740
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:46,720
okay inl we do s-bombs so

741
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,480
i should say that i like them right and

742
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,320
and i do but i'll make sure i'm saying i

743
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,559
like s-bomb i um you know we're hoping

744
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:54,640
that we get the traction you know across

745
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,400
the industry and the utilization and

746
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,200
once you know we get some

747
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,600
standardization um but then sometimes

748
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,200
you know i'm afraid that you know a lot

749
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,200
of times we get halfway into the

750
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,880
deployment or development of something

751
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,159
and then we see something else you know

752
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:07,679
the shiny thing syndrome and all of a

753
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:09,919
sudden we go the other way now so um you

754
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:12,000
know of course a software bill of

755
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,720
material is is not the same as a

756
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,000
hardware bill of material great so we

757
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,480
have h-bombs um the what distributed or

758
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,480
digital you know bill of materials is

759
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,720
out um i personally like the federated

760
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,559
bill of materials and i like dropping

761
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:27,360
those wherever i can um and so

762
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,640
but but you know we we have all these

763
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,240
things i was i was surprised i i was

764
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,000
very concerned at first when the uh the

765
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,120
the csaf presentation made it sound like

766
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,799
you know it's like what stop don't do

767
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:38,720
s-bomb i've got another solution i'm

768
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,640
like oh god not again but i realize that

769
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,400
they're complimentary and and uh and

770
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,000
once again for those of you that do want

771
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,559
to you know write a uh proposal to deal

772
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:47,919
you know if you can make a pretty

773
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:49,760
controversial title

774
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,679
right you know it always helps it always

775
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:53,120
helps so um

776
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:55,360
but yeah so

777
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,799
any thoughts megan

778
00:25:56,799 --> 00:26:00,240
so yes i support s-bombs like that like

779
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,679
i can't imagine a vendor getting on

780
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:03,520
stage would say no i'm totally totally

781
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:06,880
against the s-bombs no i think that um i

782
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,480
think that it's a good indication of

783
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,240
again maturity increasing in the

784
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:13,039
industry i think that uh customers

785
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:15,279
appreciate transparency i think that s

786
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:17,520
bombs are a great vehicle for that from

787
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,360
a very tactical and operational

788
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,600
standpoint it's like everybody's like

789
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,440
you know i'm gonna get these s-bombs and

790
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,279
i'm like okay well if you if you have an

791
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:26,799
asset inventory that you're pretty

792
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:28,400
confident about then you can actually

793
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,400
use it to help correlate vulnerabilities

794
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:33,760
but i mean if you don't then it's kind

795
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,200
of like i think that this is still

796
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,360
playing out its value is still playing

797
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:39,440
out but i do see immediate value in

798
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,279
providing things for purposes of

799
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:42,559
transparency

800
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:44,480
well also saying the the eric byers talk

801
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,000
about vex you know we've been talking

802
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
about context you know for a long time

803
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,279
and and that is really you know where

804
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:51,679
we've come with that right so um that

805
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:53,120
was a rob lee that said vulnerabilities

806
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,360
don't matter right and of course and and

807
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,720
what he meant was insignificant

808
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,000
vulnerabilities don't matter you know

809
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,840
vulnerabilities that can't be exploited

810
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:02,320
those that are not impactful and so so

811
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,120
you know

812
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,640
rob wherever you are i hope i i said

813
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:07,039
that right um but um

814
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:08,720
so we need to be able to to use things

815
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:11,039
like s-bombs things like vex um to help

816
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:12,640
because the tsunami is coming yeah there

817
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,159
are a lot of vulnerabilities um you know

818
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:15,919
we talked about project base camp and uh

819
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:17,919
and i got with reid later you know one

820
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:20,320
of his slides know mentioned that um you

821
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,640
know 30 percent of the the cves in the

822
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,480
first year you know had uh proof of

823
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,760
concepts and it got down to eight

824
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:28,080
percent you know in 2019 but i asked him

825
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,919
you know like hasn't the number of cves

826
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:31,440
you know gone up said yeah it has so the

827
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,360
raw number of actual proof of concepts

828
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,799
has been about the same

829
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:36,640
right but we're just finding a lot more

830
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,000
vulnerabilities

831
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,520
but we're still finding about the same

832
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,360
level of impactful ones and i think that

833
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,960
you know once we understand how to

834
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,039
identify those quickly right we'll be

835
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:47,200
key to uh to making them

836
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:50,080
it's sometimes things reach critical

837
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,000
mass you know whether they're right or

838
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,600
wrong they reach critical mass and it

839
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:54,960
just happens

840
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,799
i always say that with terminology a lot

841
00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:58,159
of people

842
00:27:58,159 --> 00:27:59,919
push back on terminology but at a

843
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:02,080
certain point everyone thinks this means

844
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,000
that so you know whether and we run into

845
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,880
this with iacs and ics and ot and all

846
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:07,600
that

847
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:08,320
and

848
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,159
i wonder if

849
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:12,640
patching everything has reached critical

850
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,880
mass even if it doesn't make sense like

851
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,399
from a risk perspective

852
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:18,080
you know i've been on the record saying

853
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,679
i think

854
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:23,840
probably 80 90 of the patching in ot

855
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,360
is not what you should be doing from a

856
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,440
risk management standpoint it's it's not

857
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,279
wrong it doesn't hurt things you can

858
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:30,960
patch if you want but it's not where i

859
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,880
would spend my time and money i'd do

860
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:36,240
other things but every time i read

861
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,760
any guidance

862
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:40,640
from cisa from industry organizations

863
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,799
it's always patch patch patch patch

864
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:45,120
patch and i don't know if we can fight

865
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:47,440
back that wave even if you could come up

866
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,279
with a persuasive argument we just might

867
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:51,200
have lost i hate to say to dale i agree

868
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,120
with you um and i think that the product

869
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,960
person will hear too um you know you

870
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,799
need to do regression testing on on

871
00:28:56,799 --> 00:28:58,799
certain important patches right and if

872
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:00,080
once again we're coming up with all

873
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:02,000
these vulnerabilities you cannot test

874
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,080
every combination so what if this one

875
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,279
works with that one

876
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:06,399
and all of a sudden you know i don't

877
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:08,559
have you know lights to play my uh my

878
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:10,320
oculus you know you know one night

879
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,480
because we did all those patching so so

880
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,840
i think that um i don't think they're

881
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,039
right about that i think that you know

882
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:16,880
we people need to be able to understand

883
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,880
their own environments and and patch

884
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,960
them where they're appropriate yeah

885
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,320
so

886
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:23,919
here's here's the thing with patching if

887
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:25,919
you look at the user experience of

888
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:27,919
patching from an end user customer

889
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:30,960
standpoint this is hard and to your

890
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:33,600
point in some cases without proper

891
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,679
testing patching has the potential to

892
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:37,120
break things in your operational

893
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,880
technology environment

894
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:41,360
many years ago i remember being in a

895
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,600
meeting uh with with the government

896
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,279
entity and i'm not i'm not going to say

897
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:47,919
which entity it was but um we were

898
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:50,720
saying that we don't have hot patching i

899
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,640
think that like everyone in this room

900
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,399
obviously knows that you cannot hot

901
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:56,080
patch something like you can in i.t you

902
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:58,960
cannot do it in ot so if an asset owner

903
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:02,559
is going on shutdown for 48 or 72 hours

904
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:05,679
they have that small window of time to a

905
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:08,720
play a mountain of patches not just from

906
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:11,200
schneider electric not just from ge not

907
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,200
just from siemens not just from morocco

908
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,760
automation they have to get it all in at

909
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:18,480
the same time and this government entity

910
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,640
said well couldn't you know couldn't

911
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,399
they just have like double redundancy

912
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:24,240
with the lines or something and someone

913
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,640
said well if you have a lathe okay if

914
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:29,120
you have a complex piece of machinery

915
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,200
uh the government entity was suggesting

916
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,960
well if you have one

917
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:35,679
just buy another one so you can bring

918
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:38,720
one down and keep another one up

919
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:41,039
and we were just kind of like

920
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:43,039
they they don't they they can't like

921
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:44,480
they don't have money for that nobody

922
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:48,399
nobody's gonna gonna do that so

923
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:50,480
i think schneider um have asked the

924
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,480
government to make that regulation that

925
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:53,760
if you want to buy one you should buy

926
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:57,120
two i think you shouldn't have argued

927
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,960
so i mean yeah it was i mean it was kind

928
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:01,519
of wild you know because you um

929
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:03,760
again it's we're we're a small industry

930
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,679
and so i think what seems very obvious

931
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:08,159
to us is not obvious to other people and

932
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:10,240
the worst thing that we can do is kind

933
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,480
of have this you know elitist attitude

934
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,559
about what we know what they don't know

935
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:17,279
right but no what we know is not obvious

936
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:20,159
to many people and so shutdowns and

937
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:22,240
patching and doing the regression

938
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:24,480
testing it's not it's not obvious to

939
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,399
everyone they don't know why this

940
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:28,880
industry just has so many problems yep

941
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,960
so so when we're drinking beer later and

942
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,720
if we guess which agency will you like

943
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,000
kind of nod your head or something or

944
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,600
like yeah all right let's we'll see

945
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,679
maybe we'll know okay i think megan i

946
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:39,440
think i'm more optimistic about the

947
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:42,000
ability to patch than you are i think we

948
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,440
especially as we're getting more things

949
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,600
virtualized i think it's it's becoming

950
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:46,720
easier

951
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,399
and such

952
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:50,640
the value of patching is what i push

953
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,640
back on quite a bit if i've got some

954
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,559
system that you know i don't need a

955
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:56,880
vulnerability to exploit what am i

956
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:59,200
really gaining by patching the the tired

957
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,640
thing i always say the insecure by

958
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,159
design argument

959
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:05,120
just going back to s bomb for one second

960
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:07,039
i'm still trying to figure out i'm going

961
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:08,559
to be fascinated to watch i think it's

962
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:09,840
going to play out over the next three

963
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:12,000
years but if you look there's this huge

964
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,240
set of problem that the vendors have

965
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:16,640
right you have these complex products

966
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,960
you have to create these s-bombs you

967
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,880
have people that want them so as a

968
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,880
vendor side you have you know a

969
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:25,679
schneider a siemens a rockwell or even a

970
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:27,039
smaller you have all these different

971
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:28,240
product lines all these different

972
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,840
development teams you have to figure out

973
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,600
how are we going to create all these

974
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,279
s-bombs and make them available to the

975
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:34,799
degree we want

976
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:36,399
and you have this other big circle of

977
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:38,320
the customers that have all these

978
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:39,679
different products

979
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:41,279
right from all these different vendors

980
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:43,279
that they have to figure out how do we

981
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:45,039
get these in what do we do with them

982
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:46,640
what does it mean when we get all this

983
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,640
data and i'm just fascinated by the

984
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,159
middle between that

985
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:51,760
what is going to be

986
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:54,000
the vehicle the business models and such

987
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
that's going to connect those big

988
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,320
complex systems and i don't i don't know

989
00:32:58,320 --> 00:32:59,919
the answer but that's what i'm watching

990
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:01,600
closely you know but i think that that's

991
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,360
a good point um

992
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:04,640
so so i think we need to go down the

993
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:07,039
path of s bomb i don't know where it's

994
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:08,799
going to end right and hopefully you

995
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:10,720
know asset owners others aren't going to

996
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:13,120
spend a lot of money on technology with

997
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,880
with little benefit but i think there

998
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:17,360
will be benefit to s-bomb um it may not

999
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,760
end up solving the full set of problems

1000
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,840
that we think it does now and we may not

1001
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:24,320
know what problems it solves you know

1002
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,320
later until we do it but i think we need

1003
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,159
to do something like that because the

1004
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:30,399
interdependencies of software really

1005
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:31,760
drive us to have to know you talked

1006
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,760
about an asset inventory i mean s bomb

1007
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:36,159
is an asset inventory of your software

1008
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:39,679
and you have to have it

1009
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:42,000
let's tackle one more

1010
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,640
security features in ics products so

1011
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,640
we're starting to see them

1012
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,640
you're probably getting requests i know

1013
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,399
inl is always trying to figure out what

1014
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:52,799
the next one was you were one of the you

1015
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:54,640
actually started the detection space

1016
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,720
right with the

1017
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,720
so was it called sofia or what was the

1018
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,640
original that was sophia yeah sophia the

1019
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,720
original so things come out of inl so

1020
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,399
you're always looking at the future

1021
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:06,960
really out there okay yeah and derek's

1022
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:09,199
here too right so um

1023
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:11,040
i guess to put it in the form of a

1024
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,480
question

1025
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:15,440
what do we see as the future of security

1026
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:18,480
features in these products do we think

1027
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,639
that's because we've seen some come out

1028
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:23,119
and we see kind of mixed pickup on them

1029
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:25,199
you know as as i gather there some

1030
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:27,440
people ask for them but i i at least in

1031
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,599
my own limited personal experience i

1032
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:31,760
haven't seen widespread use of them do

1033
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,359
you see these being

1034
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:35,440
increasing and used do you see them kind

1035
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,520
of just slowly easing out or something

1036
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:38,639
in between

1037
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:40,320
i think they're increasingly being used

1038
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:43,440
i think if you if you pay attention to

1039
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:46,079
the products that vendors are coming out

1040
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:48,719
and i tell customers

1041
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:51,520
they should look for or the easiest way

1042
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,879
if you're kind of a

1043
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:54,960
working in procurement would be to look

1044
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:58,640
for iec 62443 for an individual product

1045
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:01,119
it would be 4-2 right is this product

1046
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:04,560
4-2 certified is it sl security level 1

1047
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:07,760
security level 2 for a system is it 3-3

1048
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,520
is it security level 1 is it security

1049
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:12,160
level 2. i think it's a differentiator i

1050
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:14,400
i think that

1051
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,400
it's it's healthy competition

1052
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,079
and i think that customers should be

1053
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:20,400
looking for products that are certified

1054
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:23,920
to the standard and i say 62443 because

1055
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,520
what this industry needs a lot of right

1056
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:28,320
now is standardization and consistency

1057
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:29,839
you mentioned that we tend to kind of

1058
00:35:29,839 --> 00:35:32,480
jump around like maybe we'll get 80 done

1059
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,839
with something and then it's like oh

1060
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:35,599
shiny object syndrome over here and now

1061
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:37,040
this is the new big thing we're all

1062
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:39,280
gonna like huddle around that and become

1063
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,680
experts in this too but no i think that

1064
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:43,599
some some good old-fashioned standards

1065
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:45,520
and consistency and

1066
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:47,440
steady administration

1067
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:49,839
is what ics security needs right now and

1068
00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:51,280
you should you should be looking for

1069
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:53,520
this in your products and

1070
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,200
many years ago and i don't know if zac

1071
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,720
you remember being in this meeting with

1072
00:35:56,720 --> 00:36:00,079
me but uh we were there it might i

1073
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:02,400
believe it was in washington dc

1074
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:05,599
and it was uh i was there some other uh

1075
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:07,359
chief product security officers from

1076
00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:08,800
vendors were there

1077
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,560
and one of the chief product security

1078
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:13,760
officers said you know i relish the day

1079
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,760
that security features and products and

1080
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:18,079
systems are no longer a competitive

1081
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:20,160
advantage or a differentiator for

1082
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:21,359
vendors

1083
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:23,920
and then zach tudor said yeah well i

1084
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:26,480
relish the day that they are there you

1085
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:28,720
go that's it and we're almost there in

1086
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,720
some cases but so so one of one of the

1087
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:32,320
things though is that you know security

1088
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,880
features are great um and so you know

1089
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,800
your manufacturers you know are good at

1090
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:37,920
making them we need to make sure that

1091
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,200
our integrators know how to put them

1092
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:41,119
together so my cymani guys aren't here

1093
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:43,359
but they're touting that um with again i

1094
00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:44,560
shouldn't talk about you know against

1095
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:46,240
one of my own programs

1096
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:47,440
but um

1097
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,440
that's a tradition

1098
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,880
but um but they're they're talking about

1099
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:51,760
some of the things they're doing and

1100
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:52,800
they are using cyber informed

1101
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,560
engineering and other things but the

1102
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:56,640
ability to uh to compose compose secure

1103
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:58,880
systems out of these secure uh um you

1104
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,240
know artifacts and i'm like that's

1105
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:02,160
composability it's still a hard problem

1106
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:04,160
right and so the interfaces the

1107
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,680
integration of security features

1108
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:07,040
especially across different kind of

1109
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,480
vendors

1110
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,000
things is is still going to be very

1111
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,599
difficult so the features are important

1112
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:13,599
they need to be there and also they

1113
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:15,440
shouldn't be optional right i mean we're

1114
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:16,880
still getting the folks oh okay well you

1115
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,800
know can i get it without the brakes um

1116
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,480
because it'll be you know a lot less

1117
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,800
expensive um we're seeing that in 5g

1118
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,320
everyone's like well 5g is much more

1119
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,400
secure than the others i mean we have

1120
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,920
all these different security features in

1121
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,359
there but almost all of them are

1122
00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:31,520
optional right and so and most people

1123
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,960
don't know how they interact with each

1124
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,800
other once again we have a program for

1125
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,560
that at the lab as well along with a

1126
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:38,400
bunch of other you know labs and vendors

1127
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,880
so so how we implement those security

1128
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:43,359
features um in parallel in tandem is

1129
00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:45,040
going to be very important to how secure

1130
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:47,920
something actually is

1131
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,800
you mentioned six two four four three

1132
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:53,280
um and you're sort of

1133
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,200
quasi-governmental with the labs do a

1134
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:57,520
lot of work with the government i wonder

1135
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:00,320
zach i'll give you a first crack at this

1136
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,720
how does all these requirements that

1137
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,720
we're getting from the government

1138
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:06,960
affect what megan said you know she said

1139
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,560
saying we should look at six two four

1140
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:09,839
four three but now if i'm in the

1141
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:11,839
pipeline industry i'm dealing with these

1142
00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:14,480
new tsa regulations yeah and then i you

1143
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,400
know i didn't give jen too much of a

1144
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,920
hard time i actually was going to put up

1145
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:20,400
a slide with a list of all the documents

1146
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,320
that sizza has put out in the last two

1147
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,240
years that you are supposed to comply

1148
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,680
with and you know how they kind of

1149
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:27,839
overlapping now she did i think it's

1150
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:29,520
good she's pointing to one document

1151
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:31,200
these requirements but that's another

1152
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,440
document so but it's but it's fine and

1153
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:34,880
it's got an appendix that that points to

1154
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,079
all those other yeah

1155
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:38,160
so it's okay so i'm just wondering you

1156
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:40,079
know if if you're an asset owner

1157
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:42,560
especially if i'm a businessman

1158
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:44,240
i'm saying well i'm critical

1159
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:45,680
infrastructure the government says this

1160
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:48,000
is what i should be doing that probably

1161
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,480
is one of the first places i'm looking

1162
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,240
to tell me what to do i mean it's been a

1163
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:53,839
complex problem for a long time you know

1164
00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:56,000
years ago

1165
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,240
i guess it was a combination of due and

1166
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:59,839
dhs put together the procurement

1167
00:38:59,839 --> 00:39:01,760
language recommendations

1168
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:03,200
for asset owners and the thing is that

1169
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:04,560
once again the level of maturity wasn't

1170
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,000
there a lot of times they just took the

1171
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,200
entire thing it was supposed to be if

1172
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:08,960
you need this this paragraph if you need

1173
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,640
this use this paragraph and instead they

1174
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,160
would take like the whole 20 page you

1175
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:13,839
know appendix and just throw in and ask

1176
00:39:13,839 --> 00:39:15,680
avenger to do every security thing under

1177
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:17,599
the sun right which is you know almost

1178
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:18,720
where we're at with you know what you

1179
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,400
say they're all this different guidance

1180
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:23,040
um i think you know it's also concerning

1181
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,480
um we want to make sure that we don't

1182
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,160
have such substantially different

1183
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:28,480
requirements for oil and gas at least

1184
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,800
from the government etc because you know

1185
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,160
most of us here like to be able to go

1186
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:34,240
from domain to domain we we help with

1187
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:35,839
expertise but if we're so specialized

1188
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:37,599
once again i mean it's going to be you

1189
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:39,040
know really bad if you know john

1190
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:41,440
cusamano has to not be able to to

1191
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,839
transfer his knowledge into a new domain

1192
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:45,920
well now that donna's here she can do

1193
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,599
another two domains and they can tag

1194
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:48,480
team it

1195
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,760
so i think that might be the first

1196
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,599
husband and wife attendees we've had

1197
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:52,560
could be

1198
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:54,720
uh well we're almost out of time here i

1199
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:56,160
promised everyone we'd get to the beer

1200
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:59,280
by four do you have any last words megan

1201
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,520
you know i just say i love being here

1202
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:03,760
with you all i look forward to it every

1203
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:06,800
year um dale thanks so much obviously i

1204
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,480
mean just from my personal standpoint

1205
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:10,960
the promotion around ics for ics you

1206
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,160
know kind of

1207
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,520
you really are one of the people that

1208
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:15,520
helped that idea and that dream come to

1209
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:17,440
life you know i think that

1210
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:18,480
um

1211
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:21,040
we're seeing more of an uptick there and

1212
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:22,880
i'm looking forward to seeing you know

1213
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:25,920
in five years if we

1214
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,920
try to have more coordinated responses

1215
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:29,599
if we try to have consistent let's see

1216
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:31,040
if we try to

1217
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:34,160
not recreate create our own new way of

1218
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:35,680
doing something when something else

1219
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,280
already exists that's being done that we

1220
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:40,240
can borrow from other industries um but

1221
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:42,240
it's been a great week i'm

1222

00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,440
years ago for s4 number one and i

1230
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:01,280
remember when when dale was planning to

1231
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:03,040
have this uh this conference you know to

1232
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:04,640
kind of highlight some of their own work

1233
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:06,079
but it was because there was no place

1234
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:07,599
else to highlight it and he said you

1235
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:09,359
know this is called you know the scada

1236

security symposium right yeah and he

1238
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:15,119
said i want to create a community of

1239
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:16,960
scada researchers and it started out

1240
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:18,640
very small and it was you know going to

1241
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:20,319
stay small for a bit but it's like nope

1242
00:41:20,319 --> 00:41:22,240
you know i see i need to do it and we

1243
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:24,000
would always talk about you know either

1244
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,319
