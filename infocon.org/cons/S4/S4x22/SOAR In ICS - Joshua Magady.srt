1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,240
foreign

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,340
all right you guys can do better than

3
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:10,500
that come on let's try that again come

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,900
on come on I know it's 9 A.M

5
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:14,639
all right all right I feel a little

6
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:16,560
better I I feel like I'm taking the

7
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,600
stage away from Josh though again my

8
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,220
name is Jay Spann I'm with swim Lane my

9
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:21,600
title has actually changed now I'm

10
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,460
Alliance the solution manager as well as

11
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:25,800
the automation evangelist for swim Lane

12
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,019
but uh Josh you need to tell everybody

13
00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:30,900
who you are since you really I know a

14
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:32,040
little bit of a bait and switch there's

15
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:33,660
a little bit of a mix-up on who would

16
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:35,579
actually be able to make it here uh

17
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:37,140
today just because our schedules are

18
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:39,120
kind of hectic but I'm Joshua maggoty

19
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,520
I'm the global r d and Technical lead

20
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:42,480
um and head of our Solutions

21
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,460
architecture division uh with Burns and

22
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:46,430
McDonald the 1898 and Co

23
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:47,040
[Music]

24
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:47,760
um

25
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,800
and uh we're here to talk about soar

26
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,980
today

27
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:57,300
uh as we all know the cyber security

28
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:00,360
industry loves its buzzwords right um we

29
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:02,460
like to merge

30
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:04,500
um Concepts together repackage it call

31
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,360
it something different

32
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,640
um so it really kind of begs the

33
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,820
question is soar yet another one of

34
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:14,460
those buzzwords and and actually let's

35
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:15,600
pause there for a minute if you don't

36
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,640
mind Josh what what does sword mean

37
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,020
let's have the audience tell us what

38
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:21,320
does soar stand for

39
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:25,380
oh nobody knows come

40
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:27,720
yes security orchestration Automation

41
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:30,900
and response and as Josh has pointed out

42
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,360
that is very much a term that we see

43
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,900
used but you you have to keep in mind

44
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:38,820
that what you're really looking at here

45
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:42,060
is how can we do automation that's the

46
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:44,100
biggest key piece because once you

47
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:46,200
understand there is a way to take all of

48
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,659
those manual tasks all those things that

49
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:50,759
are manual tedious repetitive monotonous

50
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:53,460
types of tasks and look at is there a

51
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:55,380
tool or a way that we can use to make

52
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:57,540
sure this happens every time all the

53
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:59,820
time consistently and take away that

54
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,619
manual effort that's what you're really

55
00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:03,299
looking at so don't let the buzzwords

56
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:05,759
fool you and and honestly it wouldn't

57
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:08,280
surprise me if we see soar kind of fade

58
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,139
and have another term that kind of

59
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:12,720
incorporates soar and xdr and and you

60
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,280
know things like that well and you you

61
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,560
really lead into you know some

62
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,940
additional topics I'm going to hit on

63
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:20,099
that that soar isn't necessarily just

64
00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:22,140
about the automation portion I mean it's

65
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:25,920
it's commonly viewed that way but it

66
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,560
it's really a combination of three

67
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,260
separate Technologies right

68
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:34,080
um you've got security uh incident

69
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,239
response right so that's that's really

70
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:39,599
your case management capabilities that's

71
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:41,700
managing your tickets

72
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:42,660
um obviously that's security

73
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:44,400
orchestration and automation that's the

74
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,900
part that everybody talks about the cool

75
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:48,239
part of soar and then you have a threat

76
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:50,459
intelligence platform right so you're

77
00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:52,800
aggregating and disseminating your

78
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,560
threat intelligence and infusing it

79
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,780
um with the rest of

80
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:59,760
um you know the the information that you

81
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,620
have coming in from your environment

82
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:03,840
yeah and really I mean you make a great

83
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,840
Point Josh in the sense that you know a

84
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,760
true automation platform is going to be

85
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:11,280
able to take any element of information

86
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,459
as long as you can tie to it through you

87
00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:16,560
know your API or if you want to do it

88
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,120
some other programmatic way you

89
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,560
certainly can but the API is certainly

90
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:22,260
the most common but the idea is if there

91
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:24,360
is an element of data that you can look

92
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,940
at see integrate great then you can

93
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:28,800
incorporate it like the slide shows you

94
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,019
can start to take those elements and

95
00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:32,879
build it into more than just the

96
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,879
automation itself exactly

97
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:38,159
uh so I'd like to take a minute and just

98
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:40,739
kind of talk about sore in the context

99
00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:44,099
of risk right so this is the engineering

100
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:45,900
bow tie I think this has been presented

101
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:48,720
you know probably to death at S4

102
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,060
um but uh you know I really I really

103
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:53,540
enjoy using it because I get a lot of

104
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:55,799
mileage out of it when I'm talking to OT

105
00:03:55,799 --> 00:03:57,239
stakeholders right because this is

106
00:03:57,239 --> 00:03:59,519
something they leverage a lot when

107
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:02,280
they're doing uh has Ops but just a you

108
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,959
know kind of a brief refresher on it

109
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:06,239
right you've got your hazard you've got

110
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:08,400
your top event right so that's the first

111
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,780
time that

112
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:12,659
um you know the an event could

113
00:04:12,659 --> 00:04:14,519
potentially trigger your consequences

114
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:17,279
you've got your threats on the

115
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:19,858
um right hand side and your consequences

116
00:04:19,858 --> 00:04:21,540
sorry I said that backwards your threads

117
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:22,800
on your left hand side and your

118
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,120
consequences on your right hand side

119
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:27,660
right so we want to put controls in on

120
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:29,520
the left hand side that reduce

121
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,020
likelihood and then we want to put

122
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:33,060
controls in that reduce impact on your

123
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:34,800
right side yeah when we're talking about

124
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,240
if you don't mind going back to that one

125
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,860
second real quick when you're talking

126
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:40,040
about being able to

127
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:42,840
eliminate or reduce that impact and that

128
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:45,360
likelihood keep in mind the whole goal

129
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,940
here is what those are really combining

130
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:49,259
to help you reduce and that's the

131
00:04:49,259 --> 00:04:52,520
element of risk so what we want to do

132
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:55,440
anytime you're looking at ways to reduce

133
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,960
risk you want to be able to do that

134
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:01,259
again consistently and accurately so

135
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:03,120
that's one of those reasons why it's

136
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,820
important to consider how automation is

137
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:07,740
going to play a role in the way that you

138
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:10,740
do this because again you can put tons

139
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:13,320
of Manpower behind it but that does not

140
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,340
mean you're always going to get that

141
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:16,380
same result when you can take those

142
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:18,600
tasks that can be automated that's when

143
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,800
you're going to be able to see those

144
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,900
those consistent results every time and

145
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:24,000
ensure that it's happening

146
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,860
right so to really kind of drive this

147
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,840
home a little bit I like to use a simple

148
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,280
example

149
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,520
um and 1898 and Co we take a driver

150
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,740
safety seriously you know to the point

151
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:36,240
that I have to go through driver

152
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,419
training every single month

153
00:05:39,419 --> 00:05:41,160
um it's uh sometimes borderline

154
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:43,440
obnoxious but I get the point uh right

155
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,720
so for this example we're going to use

156
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,780
uh driving a vehicle right in our top

157
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:49,800
event

158
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,660
um while there could be any number of

159
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:52,860
ones that we could choose we're going to

160
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:54,660
just utilize lots of control of the

161
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:56,580
vehicle uh

162
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:59,100
Ryan so our threat that we're going to

163
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:02,880
utilize is also poor visibility and the

164
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,880
consequence is driver impacts uh the

165
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,560
inside of the vehicle

166
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:10,620
and I like that example because you're

167
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,479
really pointing out a lot of people when

168
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,400
they hear threat you know they

169
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,900
immediately think of things like the

170
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:17,759
attacker or something very visible very

171
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:19,680
tangible but threats can be a lot of

172
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,300
different things including forgetting to

173
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:23,520
do something or not having a backup so I

174
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,720
like the fact that we're using the

175
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,919
visibility as the threat here

176
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:33,720
yeah so again uh on the left hand side

177
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,880
we want to identify controls that reduce

178
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,500
the likelihood of our top event

179
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:40,380
happening uh so

180
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:42,360
um for poor visibility right we're going

181
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,759
to listen to the weather reports uh or

182
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:47,819
adjust our driving schedule uh as a

183
00:06:47,819 --> 00:06:50,580
potential factor to reduce the

184
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:52,319
likelihood of our top event from

185
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:53,400
happening

186
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,020
yep

187
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:57,060
um and then as our mitigating controls

188
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:00,000
uh right so assuming that our top event

189
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,300
does happen uh right things that we can

190
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:07,199
lessen the impact uh literally is going

191
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:09,720
to be wearing our safety belt uh making

192
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,699
sure that we have an airbag uh in the

193
00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:13,680
vehicle that is functioning and even

194
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,020
adjusting the head rest yeah and I mean

195
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:17,460
I I don't want to sound like the broken

196
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:19,380
record of oh you can automate yo you can

197
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:21,120
automate it obviously that is my goal

198
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,460
but you take something like listening to

199
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:25,500
the weather report how about instead of

200
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,479
having to actively go and get in that

201
00:07:27,479 --> 00:07:29,400
weather report if the weather report is

202
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,960
automatically there and ready for you

203
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,880
first thing that's the type of thing

204
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,039
that you can think about as a

205
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:36,479
preventative control we could even do

206
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:38,460
some mitigating controls as well but

207
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:40,620
again what you want to do is you want to

208
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:43,800
look at where are places that we can use

209
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,539
automation to guarantee that we're

210
00:07:45,539 --> 00:07:47,220
getting the consistent results for

211
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:51,080
security that we are looking to achieve

212
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:55,440
so given that context when we apply the

213
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,240
engineering bow tie model to cyber

214
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,580
security you end up with things like

215
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:01,860
governance awareness and training change

216
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:05,639
management Access Control patching and

217
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:08,220
asset management on the left hand side

218
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:10,860
and you have things like antivirus

219
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:13,500
logging backup recovery and incident

220
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:16,319
response and anomaly detection on your

221
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:19,819
right hand side yeah

222
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:23,940
so where does soar really fit into all

223
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:25,979
this and and honestly because of the

224
00:08:25,979 --> 00:08:28,500
different aspects that it brings in it

225
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,720
straddles both sides of the engineering

226
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,719
bow tie yeah definitely does uh and

227
00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:35,279
again I think that's one of the things a

228
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:37,860
lot of times people do not necessarily

229
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:40,140
recognize or it's not immediately

230
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:43,020
apparent to them how many different ways

231
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:45,839
you can Implement automation now some of

232
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:47,820
that is going to be due to the fact that

233
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:50,580
if you look at the overall Marketplace

234
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:52,920
for sure and let's say the the the the

235
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,899
products that are out there because they

236
00:08:54,899 --> 00:08:57,899
range from products that have

237
00:08:57,899 --> 00:09:00,480
um you know no code Solutions where you

238
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,980
are basically told this is what you're

239
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:03,779
going to do and this is how you're going

240
00:09:03,779 --> 00:09:04,920
to do it and you don't have the

241
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,660
opportunity to change it but as long as

242
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:08,100
that's the game plan you want to go with

243
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:10,200
that's fine it's easy to implement tends

244
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,420
to work in a smaller environment all the

245
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:14,580
way up to a full code solution where you

246
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:15,779
know again if you want to hire the

247
00:09:15,779 --> 00:09:17,519
developers if you want to do all of that

248
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:19,560
write your own automation you can do

249
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,779
that but that sweet spot and one of the

250
00:09:21,779 --> 00:09:24,540
places where I I think you get the most

251
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:26,940
out of the automation itself is in that

252
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:29,820
low code Arena where you can look at

253
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:32,519
again not just security automation

254
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:34,860
obviously that's the goal here but what

255
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:36,899
you really can do is look at what

256
00:09:36,899 --> 00:09:39,720
systems do I have what elements are a

257
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,399
part of my environment or my network

258
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:43,980
that actually can't you know they have a

259
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:46,080
way to see and read information from

260
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,820
them and if there's a way to do that

261
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,740
then there's probably a way to automate

262
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:51,839
something with it and one of the things

263
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:55,500
I know Josh your team has seen is the

264
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,839
the breadth of different types of

265
00:09:57,839 --> 00:09:59,760
solutions that can actually be built

266
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,200
when you start looking at everything

267
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,360
that can be contacted all right it's

268
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,279
really just a limitation of your

269
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:07,440
imagination yes that's a great way to

270
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,480
put it now before we move on is there

271
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,399
any questions about the engineering bow

272
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:12,540
tie

273
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:14,760
just making sure people have a chance to

274
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:18,080
understand yes especially over here

275
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:22,220
oh yeah there's yeah

276
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:24,959
that is they wanted us to repeat the

277
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:27,180
question so under mitigating controls

278
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:29,040
one more time

279
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,959
there's a laundry list of things that

280
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:32,760
that fit absolutely yeah that's great

281
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:35,899
Point yep it's a

282
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:41,940
it looks like what I'm sorry

283
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:44,279
oh okay

284
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:46,380
yeah I mean you you could definitely

285
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:48,420
again it was just some examples I only

286
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:49,920
have so much room on the slide and I'm

287
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:50,940
putting it together

288
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:52,800
um and then my marketing team takes my

289
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,839
really terrible drawings and makes them

290
00:10:54,839 --> 00:10:57,839
look a little better so

291
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:02,600
um yes any other questions before we

292
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:04,440
switch topics

293
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:07,560
all right okay so a real world example

294
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:10,260
um you know we we can't talk about soar

295
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:11,399
I think without touching on security

296
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:13,860
operations centers uh Source Solutions

297
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:15,660
are typically deployed inside a sock

298
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:19,560
right to help optimize operations So

299
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,600
based on what I've seen and again your

300
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,279
mileage is going to vary

301
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:25,860
um you know I've seen a lot of not well

302
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:27,240
optimized

303
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:31,079
um if you will uh socks um but uh based

304
00:11:31,079 --> 00:11:32,820
on experience and and some of the first

305
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:35,640
hand things that I've seen typically you

306
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,560
know they'll see 200 events a day on

307
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,640
average

308
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,880
that's that may not be that may be a a

309
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:42,620
um

310
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:45,480
a factor that they're just not

311
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:48,060
optimizing their tuning Loops uh they're

312
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:50,640
staffed with six to eight people uh

313
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,800
typically perform mostly manual

314
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,079
investigations

315
00:11:55,079 --> 00:11:56,820
um and believe it or not I've seen

316
00:11:56,820 --> 00:12:00,060
mostly ones that aren't operated 24x7 I

317
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:01,380
mean if they are it's like one or two

318
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:05,160
people uh working a skeleton shift right

319
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,200
um and when you're talking to them and

320
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,579
you're trying to figure out like some of

321
00:12:08,579 --> 00:12:10,560
their kpis that they're using right uh

322
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,320
we find that their mean time to detect

323
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:16,740
or their MTD is typically between 12 and

324
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:19,019
60 days and I say that because it really

325
00:12:19,019 --> 00:12:21,420
depends upon how long their sock has

326
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:24,120
been in operation right so those alerts

327
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,740
start to pile up you get alert fatigue

328
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:26,940
they can't get all the way through it so

329
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:29,040
the longer it's been in operation the

330
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,920
the higher that number tends to skew and

331
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,420
then I typically have a mean time to

332
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:37,019
respond mttr of around 30 to 90 minutes

333
00:12:37,019 --> 00:12:39,000
right so that's the actual time it takes

334
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,760
to remediate an alert once they actually

335
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,100
finally detect it yeah and you know

336
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:46,920
honestly I I'm again I'm sure you have

337
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:49,079
seen some several representative

338
00:12:49,079 --> 00:12:50,760
examples

339
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,500
um you know for the customer base that

340
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:56,220
we have it excuse widely uh so we we've

341
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:58,320
seen environments that you know not

342
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,820
necessarily let's say the the OT

343
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,320
environments but even in the I.T

344
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,839
environments that they're experiencing

345
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:05,700
well over over ten thousand dollars per

346
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:07,519
day well over a million alerts per day

347
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:10,200
uh you know it it's a compounding

348
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,600
problem right and honestly you know

349
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,220
again whether whether you're dealing

350
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:15,720
with 200 alerts per day or a million

351
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,160
alerts per day you're going to try and

352
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,079
staff accordingly but the bottom line

353
00:13:19,079 --> 00:13:21,779
becomes how am I going to actually be

354
00:13:21,779 --> 00:13:23,519
able to handle that amount of

355
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:25,260
information and handle it reliably

356
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:27,720
because you know again being a

357
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,980
compounding problem this works against

358
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:31,079
itself now you've got 200 events a day

359
00:13:31,079 --> 00:13:33,480
what if it's 210 tomorrow does that mean

360
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,160
you need an additional person well it

361
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:37,740
might but that also starts to mean that

362
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:40,560
you're mttd your mttr all of a sudden

363
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,240
might be skewing a little bit further

364
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,980
out because all of a sudden you've got

365
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:45,300
additional alerts you don't have people

366
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:46,980
to handle it if you do bring somebody on

367
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:48,839
to handle it are they trained are they

368
00:13:48,839 --> 00:13:50,459
ready to go how long does it take to get

369
00:13:50,459 --> 00:13:53,339
them trained we you know again it's a

370
00:13:53,339 --> 00:13:55,320
problem that continues to build on

371
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,480
itself but one of the things that you

372
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:00,839
can do is if you look at what are we

373
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:03,480
going to do in that environment where we

374
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:06,060
can take some some of those events those

375
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:08,459
alerts especially things that have a

376
00:14:08,459 --> 00:14:11,339
standardized process to be handled and

377
00:14:11,339 --> 00:14:13,620
then build out a workflow that will give

378
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:15,660
you a way to handle that now again I

379
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:17,700
want to stress that just because we're

380
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:19,500
up here talking about how you can handle

381
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,420
that with automation that does not

382
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:23,639
necessarily mean that you're trying to

383
00:14:23,639 --> 00:14:25,139
achieve full automation with every

384
00:14:25,139 --> 00:14:27,420
single workflow workflows can be

385
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:31,320
anywhere from fully manual meaning that

386
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,820
really all you're using the automation

387
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:35,519
platform for is to provide documentation

388
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:38,519
and give people the steps they're going

389
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:39,959
to go through the steps and check the

390
00:14:39,959 --> 00:14:42,720
boxes but it can go anywhere from that

391
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,459
fully manual to partially manual to

392
00:14:44,459 --> 00:14:45,779
fully automated

393
00:14:45,779 --> 00:14:49,220
Matt you had your hand up

394
00:14:56,339 --> 00:14:59,579
it's a it's an aggregation across

395
00:14:59,579 --> 00:15:02,579
um a couple of particular uh utilities

396
00:15:02,579 --> 00:15:04,620
that that we've seen

397
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:07,500
um and obviously I can't tell you who

398
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,959
um but uh but yeah I mean it's based off

399
00:15:09,959 --> 00:15:12,959
of off of one in particular

400
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:14,639
um and in the several of the others that

401
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:16,320
we've seen in aggregate

402
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,040
um

403
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,959
that helps answer your question yeah and

404
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:21,420
and again it's uh it's going to vary

405
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:24,060
obviously so this this might be a

406
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:27,839
representative example of a few it it

407
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:30,480
could vary widely but the but honestly

408
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,860
the result is going to be the same

409
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:34,019
because you're looking at here's what

410
00:15:34,019 --> 00:15:35,760
we're up against what can we do about it

411
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:38,300
right

412
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:41,160
so how many human resources do you need

413
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,839
in a sock

414
00:15:42,839 --> 00:15:44,699
um this really comes down to what your

415
00:15:44,699 --> 00:15:46,980
organization's service level Agreements

416
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:49,680
are for uh mean time to detection and

417
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:54,240
mean time to respond uh right so uh mttd

418
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,040
and mtdr should be based on an

419
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:58,079
organization's risk tolerance and

420
00:15:58,079 --> 00:15:59,420
because of this there's no really

421
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:01,920
one-size-fits-all approach

422
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:02,699
um

423
00:16:02,699 --> 00:16:05,459
uh so for our example we want to achieve

424
00:16:05,459 --> 00:16:09,060
an mttde of around eight hours right and

425
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:11,519
we want to drop our mttr to around 45

426
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:14,820
minutes on average across all of our

427
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:18,000
alert priority levels right uh so how do

428
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,699
we calculate the resources uh required

429
00:16:20,699 --> 00:16:24,000
to hit our targets uh so starting on the

430
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,260
left side

431
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:28,440
um I I typically find that it's it's a

432
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:32,040
lot easier to explain if you look at a

433
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:34,920
sock as a queuing system right so you

434
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:37,800
have events that come in they have an

435
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:40,199
arrival rate once those events come in

436
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:42,060
they hit a queue right and so that's

437
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:44,820
your average time in queue until a

438
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:47,339
resource a sock analyst and pulls that

439
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:50,100
out of the queue and begins to run their

440
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:52,019
investigation right so that's your

441
00:16:52,019 --> 00:16:53,699
average time to resolution right and

442
00:16:53,699 --> 00:16:55,259
then once it's done right it exits the

443
00:16:55,259 --> 00:16:57,620
queue system

444
00:16:57,899 --> 00:16:59,279
um

445
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:04,260
so for our example uh we're using uh 224

446
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:06,780
hours right it's typically best to take

447
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:08,400
your events

448
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,260
um arrival rates down to a per hour

449
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:12,179
because a lot of times in a real world

450
00:17:12,179 --> 00:17:15,059
situation right events arrive not

451
00:17:15,059 --> 00:17:17,160
uniformly right very periodically yeah

452
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,599
very sporadically

453
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:20,280
um it can be very much dependent on the

454
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:22,260
time of day but to make things simpler

455
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:24,179
we're just going to do you know it's a

456
00:17:24,179 --> 00:17:27,540
flat 200 divided out across 24 hours

457
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:28,559
um

458
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:32,460
and so when you do that uh you end up

459
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:36,000
needing around 30 people right to to

460
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,679
reach

461
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:40,260
um those targeted mean time to detection

462
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:42,600
and mean time to respond uh that's

463
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,820
obviously not very palatable

464
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:46,260
um and not very reasonable no one's

465
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:47,640
doing that

466
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:48,900
um

467
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,340
right because that ends up costing

468
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:53,160
around 7.2 million dollars in in just

469
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:56,460
human labor right uh that's just taking

470
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:58,919
um uh the number of resources that we we

471
00:17:58,919 --> 00:18:01,320
need uh to accounting for people taking

472
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:03,480
PTO and sick time

473
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,880
um and then dividing it out across the

474
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:08,940
the typical uh amount of uh money that

475
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:10,740
it costs to employ someone right so

476
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:12,360
their base salary plus what it actually

477
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:15,320
costs an employer

478
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:18,720
um so what what can we do right 7.2

479
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,299
million dollars is not a realistic

480
00:18:21,299 --> 00:18:22,679
number I can't go to clients and tell

481
00:18:22,679 --> 00:18:24,299
them you need to spend 7.2 million

482
00:18:24,299 --> 00:18:27,120
dollars uh on just human labor I'd get

483
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,620
laughed out of the room

484
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:30,480
um I think most of us would

485
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,200
um

486
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,940
so you can either increase your target

487
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:36,840
MTD or you can reduce your mttr right

488
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:39,419
that's that's it

489
00:18:39,419 --> 00:18:41,539
um

490
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:45,480
so that's where soar really starts to

491
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:48,360
shine right uh it as a as a Workforce

492
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:51,240
multiplier right you can drop your MTD

493
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:53,220
down to typically

494
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:55,080
um you know once once we've implemented

495
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,220
this and we've walked away and we've

496
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:58,500
come back and checked our kpis uh we're

497
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,419
typically seeing a mean time to

498
00:19:00,419 --> 00:19:01,860
detective around eight hours right

499
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:03,720
because you're automating at that tier

500
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,340
zero level

501
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:07,260
um right so things are coming in you're

502
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:09,660
Auto handling a lot of that stuff you're

503
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:11,520
eliminating the noise

504
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,840
um right it's important to note that

505
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:14,520
it's not it's not just about soar two

506
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,660
you've got to do other things you've got

507
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:18,120
to tune your sensors make sure that you

508
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:19,980
have effective Loops there and you're

509
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:21,419
implementing you know Lessons Learned

510
00:19:21,419 --> 00:19:22,799
and stuff like that

511
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:24,720
um but you can then get your mean time

512
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,940
to respond down to around 10 to 20

513
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:29,280
minutes right because you're assisting

514
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,799
your sock analyst by pulling that data

515
00:19:31,799 --> 00:19:33,780
into a central location they don't have

516
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:35,340
to go over the environment they're not

517
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,919
having to wait for long uh queries to

518
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:40,380
execute against their Sim platforms

519
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:43,440
right so this drops down to about 15

520
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,799
people at roughly 70 capacity and how we

521
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:48,539
got those numbers I don't know if how

522
00:19:48,539 --> 00:19:51,000
many of us are are familiar familiar

523
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,500
with it but you can use something like

524
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:55,320
erlang C it's a formula used to

525
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,940
calculate how many people you need in a

526
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:57,900
call center

527
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:59,340
um and that's where the Q system really

528
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:00,600
comes into play because it's very

529
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:03,600
similar what a call center does and what

530
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,000
a sock does from the perspective of

531
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,940
handling events right meaning if you

532
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:10,559
translate a call to an event it's very

533
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:14,220
similar so Josh with our mttr there at

534
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:17,220
being roughly 10 to 20 minutes now if I

535
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:19,440
remember correctly beforehand it was

536
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,299
around the 90 minute Mark is that right

537
00:20:21,299 --> 00:20:24,059
nine minute Mark so we're looking at a

538
00:20:24,059 --> 00:20:26,039
substantial savings there and mean time

539
00:20:26,039 --> 00:20:28,620
to respond and again like Josh pointed

540
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:30,179
out one of the reasons you can do that

541
00:20:30,179 --> 00:20:33,059
is because what you can do for those

542
00:20:33,059 --> 00:20:35,460
analysts I mean you still have your your

543
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:37,200
detection tools that are doing the

544
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,660
detection but once that information once

545
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:42,000
that alert is reported what the analyst

546
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,460
is going to have to do you they now can

547
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:47,340
do much faster because everything that

548
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:49,080
they need has already been presented to

549
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,760
them so that can already be brought into

550
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:53,580
the tool where all they are having to do

551
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:55,740
is evaluate what's on the screen in

552
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:57,840
front of them and very quickly answer a

553
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,000
question mark it is that you know is

554
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,559
this a true positive is this a false

555
00:21:01,559 --> 00:21:03,120
positive what do we want to do with it

556
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:06,179
and because you can automate those

557
00:21:06,179 --> 00:21:08,760
response actions as well and again make

558
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:11,100
them part of that same screen or you

559
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:13,140
know same interface that they're looking

560
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:15,360
at they can take that action very

561
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,919
quickly and that's what allows you to

562
00:21:16,919 --> 00:21:18,900
get those response times down so

563
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:21,780
significantly and I would say that you

564
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:24,780
know overall that that is a very fair

565
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:26,880
representation of what we see across the

566
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,520
board not just in the uh you know the OT

567
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,799
environment but in general I mean we do

568
00:21:31,799 --> 00:21:35,159
have some customers that as crazy as it

569
00:21:35,159 --> 00:21:36,840
may sound have seen reductions as high

570
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:39,059
as 95 percent obviously not everybody

571
00:21:39,059 --> 00:21:42,299
gets that others are going to be 50 but

572
00:21:42,299 --> 00:21:44,220
everyone buddy is seeing an improvement

573
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:46,740
in that mttr and that is not at all

574
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:49,679
unusual to see big thing is where's the

575
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:52,320
savings and like you pointed out you can

576
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:55,380
do so much more with less resources so

577
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:57,299
it is a big big advantage to being able

578
00:21:57,299 --> 00:21:58,380
to do that

579
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:00,780
right so that typically we see a

580
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:02,340
reduction in labor costs down to around

581
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:04,559
the 3.6 million Mark

582
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:05,400
um

583
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,740
what's the catch right right that sounds

584
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:08,780
like magic

585
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:12,240
and it does to a lot of people but the

586
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,520
truth of the matter is soar is not a

587
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:16,559
good fit for low maturity cyber Security

588
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:18,240
Programs

589
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,679
um yeah actually let me if you don't

590
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:20,760
mind I want to interrupt right there

591
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:23,640
because that is absolutely critical uh

592
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:24,720
in fact

593
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,820
um I was on a a panel a couple of days

594
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:28,200
ago where they were saying you know

595
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,840
what's the one thing that you would give

596
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:33,179
people as a piece of advice here and it

597
00:22:33,179 --> 00:22:35,400
really was along those exact same lines

598
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,380
if you do not already have

599
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:39,659
well-documented processes if you don't

600
00:22:39,659 --> 00:22:42,059
already have a somewhat mature cyber

601
00:22:42,059 --> 00:22:43,500
security program

602
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:46,200
you're not going to get the uh you know

603
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,059
the success that you're looking for

604
00:22:48,059 --> 00:22:52,980
because uh if if you have a series of

605
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:55,380
poorly defined processes and you

606
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:57,900
automate them you now have automated

607
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:00,179
poorly defined processes you haven't

608
00:23:00,179 --> 00:23:02,640
improved anything so it is very

609
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:05,700
important that you do have a decent

610
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:08,039
maturity level program and again that

611
00:23:08,039 --> 00:23:09,780
documentation and the processes are

612
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:11,520
really key because what you're going to

613
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,380
end up doing is building out workflows

614
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:15,120
that match that and that's where you're

615
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,340
going to see the most success and so if

616
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:19,500
they're mostly tribal knowledge which

617
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:22,500
has been my experience when implementing

618
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:23,700
um you know or at least trying to

619
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:27,620
implement soar programs with utilities

620
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:30,419
it doesn't you don't end up with the

621
00:23:30,419 --> 00:23:32,000
same

622
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,380
expected result

623
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:36,480
um you know at the end of the project

624
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,880
that you had going into it so it's very

625
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,760
important that you have those processes

626
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,460
documented that they're battle tested

627
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:46,380
um that we're not implementing first of

628
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:48,419
its kind processes right we've had that

629
00:23:48,419 --> 00:23:52,020
experience too uh where you know uh you

630
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:53,280
know and I'm not not trying to throw

631
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:55,980
shade right you end up uh talking to a

632
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:58,140
sales guy and they sell you on fishing I

633
00:23:58,140 --> 00:23:59,340
mean if you're not currently doing

634
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:00,780
fishing

635
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:02,220
sore's not going to help you with that

636
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:04,380
it's not you're we're gonna you're gonna

637
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:06,600
end up end up automating a first of its

638
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:07,980
kind process it and it's not going to

639
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:09,000
work the way that you thought it would

640
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,740
yeah you'll get poor results like that

641
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:12,299
there's no doubt I love the point that

642
00:24:12,299 --> 00:24:13,559
you brought up of tribal knowledge

643
00:24:13,559 --> 00:24:15,059
because that is one of the things that I

644
00:24:15,059 --> 00:24:17,760
think we see the most of is the ability

645
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,799
when you're going to implement something

646
00:24:19,799 --> 00:24:21,840
like this the ability to capture that

647
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,220
drivable knowledge and all of a sudden

648
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:25,620
if it isn't already part of the workflow

649
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:27,840
make it a part of the workflow but again

650
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,880
you have to capture it it has to be part

651
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,860
of the overall process or you're not

652
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:32,820
going to get the result you're looking

653
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:35,700
for another important thing

654
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:37,679
um and maybe it's obvious but soar

655
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:40,159
doesn't do anything on its own

656
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:43,200
uh if you just deploy sword you don't

657
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,659
have anything to actually integrate with

658
00:24:45,659 --> 00:24:48,000
it's just a case management system at

659
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:48,960
the end of the day that's a battle

660
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,940
another ticketing system

661
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:52,260
um although we have done that I have

662
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:54,000
implemented a sore in a way where it

663
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,980
manages a customer's ticketing system so

664
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:57,480
it's a ticket management management

665
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:58,919
system yeah I mean you can do something

666
00:24:58,919 --> 00:25:01,620
amazing things but to me it'd be a lot

667
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:03,900
like you know you have a tool that

668
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:05,520
automates everything about your vehicle

669
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,799
but you don't own a vehicle right a lot

670
00:25:07,799 --> 00:25:08,820
of good that's going to do you right

671
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:12,120
right uh you end up with Skynet syndrome

672
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:15,600
right so a lot of times uh in almost all

673
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:18,419
cases a sore has to

674
00:25:18,419 --> 00:25:20,700
um connect across uh lines of business

675
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:22,799
with inside of utility so you're working

676
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:25,320
with the cyber security teams or the

677
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:27,840
engineering teams the server teams the

678
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:30,120
network teams and when you start looking

679
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:32,900
at the access that a soar platform needs

680
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:35,760
in order to effectively do what it is

681
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,220
that you're wanting it to do

682
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:39,500
oftentimes you'll start hearing Skynet

683
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:41,580
you know from the customers and they're

684
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:44,100
not wrong uh you know it needs read

685
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:46,200
access usually into most of the things

686
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:49,140
that it's at least pulling data from and

687
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:51,240
then if you're having it take actions in

688
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:52,740
your environment it needs right access

689
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:54,360
at that point right because you're

690
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:56,940
making changes with it so that's another

691
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:59,299
common hurdle that you got to get across

692
00:25:59,299 --> 00:26:01,740
right making sure you have the right

693
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:03,120
stakeholders in the room when you're

694
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,559
coming up with the use cases that you're

695
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:06,120
going to go automate and then make sure

696
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:08,100
that they fully understand what it means

697
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:09,779
that you're doing when you're

698
00:26:09,779 --> 00:26:11,940
implementing uh you know your chosen

699
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:13,799
Source solution and I think it's

700
00:26:13,799 --> 00:26:16,559
important again to reiterate the fact

701
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:18,600
that whether it's the read access the

702
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:19,740
right access you're talking about

703
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:21,740
something that now becomes another

704
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:24,480
Central connection tool in the

705
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,640
environment which also translates to

706
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,380
central point of failure if you're not

707
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:30,480
careful so anytime you're implementing

708
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,220
an automation solution you want to make

709
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:33,419
sure that you've thought that through

710
00:26:33,419 --> 00:26:35,760
and decided okay how are we going to

711
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,740
handle that potential for a central

712
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:39,299
point of failure so it needs to be very

713
00:26:39,299 --> 00:26:41,520
redundant very high availability type

714
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:42,659
system

715
00:26:42,659 --> 00:26:45,360
uh Source Solutions can be costly right

716
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:48,059
typically you're looking at between 350k

717
00:26:48,059 --> 00:26:49,919
to over two and a half million dollars

718
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:52,520
uh now a lot of that depends on how much

719
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:55,320
you decide that you're going to take on

720
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:58,020
as far as the automation uh versus just

721
00:26:58,020 --> 00:26:59,820
buying the platform

722
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:01,200
right

723
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:01,860
um

724
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:04,200
it's also important to know that soar is

725
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:09,480
low code not no code a lot of times

726
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:11,760
um when we're Consulting

727
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,679
um you know they they get sold on the

728
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:15,539
fact that soar is low code and I'm just

729
00:27:15,539 --> 00:27:16,980
dropping some boxes in and doing some

730
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:20,340
stuff that no that's never been the case

731
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:24,299
uh ever it's a it's a custom solution uh

732
00:27:24,299 --> 00:27:25,919
which means that we're gonna have to

733
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:28,679
write custom code whether that's a

734
00:27:28,679 --> 00:27:31,440
plug-in that that's needed because

735
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,600
you're you have a piece of software that

736
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:36,179
we haven't come across before or your

737
00:27:36,179 --> 00:27:38,760
process requires me to write

738
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,380
um you know in in the solution I'm

739
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:42,480
typically use we write python right

740
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,100
we're having the rights and python to

741
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:46,500
take and mingle the data uh into either

742
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,179
calculate a risk or or do something

743
00:27:48,179 --> 00:27:50,520
that's in alignment with your process

744
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:54,000
it's never no code yeah I mean honestly

745
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,559
anybody that goes into it thinking that

746
00:27:55,559 --> 00:27:57,360
it's no code they're they're not

747
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,100
thinking broadly enough to incorporate

748
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:00,600
the use cases that they really want to

749
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:03,240
handle I mean can you do no code use

750
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:05,039
cases sure but you're not accomplishing

751
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:07,200
much when you really want to be able to

752
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,760
accomplish what's in your environment

753
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:10,020
you're going to want to be able to

754
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:11,880
customize it and so the ability to do

755
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:14,340
that without having to engineer the

756
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:16,980
entire platform that's exactly again

757
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:18,480
that's The Sweet Spot that I was talking

758
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:21,240
about right well I mean it's a it's to

759
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:23,159
kind of pivot off of what you said it's

760
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:25,440
soar provides that application

761
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,120
development environment it's kind of

762
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,679
what I call it

763
00:28:28,679 --> 00:28:31,500
um right they extrapolate away a lot of

764
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:33,900
the things that that you now no longer

765
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:35,520
have to worry about like a UI right I

766
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:38,760
don't have to go and drop down into a

767
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:41,840
whole lot of JavaScript or HTML you can

768
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,860
and a lot of them depending on what

769
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:45,840
you're wanting to do but that's that's

770
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:48,360
extrapolated Away by the system right so

771
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:51,600
I'm just utilizing its uh you know

772
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:54,120
database banking calling its functions

773
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:55,980
of move and shift data around and into

774
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:57,720
go and make my API calls across the

775
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:59,760
other systems yeah great Point great

776
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:00,779
point

777
00:29:00,779 --> 00:29:03,840
uh soar takes six months to two years to

778
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:06,240
deploy

779
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,880
um it sounds like a long time it is

780
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:11,340
um when you have really well thought out

781
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:13,260
uh use cases

782
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:15,539
um and you're actually trying to do a

783
00:29:15,539 --> 00:29:17,700
lot of the automation I mean and really

784
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:19,679
take that maybe to an 80 automation

785
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:21,860
solution it takes a long time to do that

786
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:24,179
there's a lot of meanings a lot of

787
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:26,520
talking about uh the processes in a lot

788
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:28,980
of cases you're filling in some of the

789
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:31,020
blank spots in their processes that they

790
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:32,820
didn't actually think about you're

791
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:34,679
running into Roblox with some of the

792
00:29:34,679 --> 00:29:36,240
systems that you're having to integrate

793
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,460
with uh right because it's important to

794
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:40,980
know soar can typically do all the

795
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:42,720
things depending on what platform that

796
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:46,140
you choose but it is fully dependent on

797
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:47,460
the things that you're integrating with

798
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:50,039
right so sometimes you're having to go

799
00:29:50,039 --> 00:29:52,200
and call up vendors across all these the

800
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,279
different platforms that you're trying

801
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:55,860
to integrate with and help fix things

802
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:58,559
that they may not have done before or

803
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:00,659
help them Implement

804
00:30:00,659 --> 00:30:03,600
um you know new API calls in order to

805
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,159
achieve the goal that you're wanting and

806
00:30:05,159 --> 00:30:06,659
some sometimes you're having to come up

807
00:30:06,659 --> 00:30:07,860
with a totally different way of doing it

808
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:09,600
because they don't want to play ball

809
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,220
yeah and I like the way that you're

810
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:13,679
pointing out again what what tends to

811
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:15,840
happen is when people do start to look

812
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,880
at how can I automate how can I put this

813
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,380
in my environment and they start to

814
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:21,240
understand the power of the automation

815
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:23,220
just exactly what the automation can do

816
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:25,440
that's when they start to get creative

817
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,539
about hey maybe there's another way to

818
00:30:27,539 --> 00:30:29,279
do this or maybe there's a better way to

819
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:31,140
do this or like you said maybe what we

820
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:32,580
need to do is see if we can modify the

821
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:34,200
API calls so that we can get a little

822
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:36,419
bit different information and maybe want

823
00:30:36,419 --> 00:30:37,679
to represent it a little bit differently

824
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:40,860
but you do have that flexibility and to

825
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:43,020
truly get it working the way you want it

826
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:45,000
to and optimize it it's not something

827
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,919
that happens overnight it does take some

828
00:30:46,919 --> 00:30:48,600
time and it doesn't mean you won't see

829
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:51,419
Roi on it while you're implementing it

830
00:30:51,419 --> 00:30:53,159
but a lot of that depends on how you

831
00:30:53,159 --> 00:30:55,620
manage the project you know I work with

832
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:57,299
a lot of customers that follow you know

833
00:30:57,299 --> 00:31:00,059
waterfall approaches you won't see Roi

834
00:31:00,059 --> 00:31:01,980
anytime soon if you're managing your

835
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:04,860
project that way on a sore deployment

836
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:06,659
you want to do something a little more

837
00:31:06,659 --> 00:31:09,299
agile break apart your use cases in the

838
00:31:09,299 --> 00:31:10,500
waves

839
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:12,360
um and then Implement those one at a

840
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:14,279
time and then move them across you know

841
00:31:14,279 --> 00:31:16,559
their test Dev and production uh

842
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:18,899
whatever they're following

843
00:31:18,899 --> 00:31:21,960
yeah I completely agree with that

844
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:22,620
um

845
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:25,320
you know again it some of that you could

846
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:27,120
probably help some of that with good

847
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,919
documentation because it's going to help

848
00:31:28,919 --> 00:31:31,140
speed up that initial implementation but

849
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:32,520
you're right it's it is going to take

850
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:34,559
some time uh sort of element is

851
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:37,200
continuous it's not one and done

852
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,179
um you know that that may be obvious to

853
00:31:39,179 --> 00:31:41,340
some of us in the room but uh you're not

854
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:42,179
just

855
00:31:42,179 --> 00:31:44,159
deploying it and then walking away from

856
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:46,919
it uh again I hate to keep harping on it

857
00:31:46,919 --> 00:31:48,360
it's dependent on the things that it's

858
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:49,740
integrating with so as those things

859
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:51,720
upgrade those those calls that you're

860
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,100
making get changed or they get

861
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:54,779
deprecated you've got to then reflect

862
00:31:54,779 --> 00:31:56,940
those changes inside your sword platform

863
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:59,520
as well so it's an extra thing that you

864
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:02,159
have to account for uh as you're you

865
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:03,779
know rolling upgrades through your

866
00:32:03,779 --> 00:32:06,299
environment yeah and and again the the

867
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:10,140
other thing that I see a lot of is as

868
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:12,000
you get it implemented and as you start

869
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,220
fine-tuning it and again people start to

870
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:16,260
realize the power of what they can do

871
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:17,399
with automation things they haven't

872
00:32:17,399 --> 00:32:19,020
thought about before they start to get

873
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:21,600
other ideas of well maybe we want to

874
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:22,919
change the way we're doing it maybe

875
00:32:22,919 --> 00:32:26,159
maybe we have a better way to to execute

876
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:28,559
this process and so what you what you

877
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:29,940
end up doing like Josh was pointing out

878
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:32,399
is you're continually improving it and

879
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:34,260
making it better which hopefully we're

880
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:36,120
all doing already anyway

881
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:39,240
we have any questions any other

882
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:42,740
thoughts before we move on

883
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:50,059
so a sore right for OT

884
00:32:50,059 --> 00:32:52,200
uh you know so let's say you're bought

885
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,539
in you see the benefits of a sore

886
00:32:54,539 --> 00:32:57,179
platform uh but is it right for an OT

887
00:32:57,179 --> 00:33:00,360
environment a common theme we have you

888
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:02,640
know in this industry is OT versus it

889
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:05,460
right we're out of we're at a an OT

890
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:07,799
conference so I think that's probably

891
00:33:07,799 --> 00:33:10,440
well and good but what typically follows

892
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:13,019
sore conversations when I have them

893
00:33:13,019 --> 00:33:14,760
um you know especially in the OT realm

894
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:16,320
is that swords and I T product it's not

895
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,480
it's not an OT product

896
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,640
um you're not necessarily wrong but that

897
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,980
doesn't mean that it's not right for an

898
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:24,840
OT environment

899
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:25,500
um

900
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:26,820
you know I'm in the business of

901
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:28,860
protecting networks from a holistic

902
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:31,140
perspective uh and one of the common

903
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:33,299
things that are missed in the OT versus

904
00:33:33,299 --> 00:33:36,120
it uh conversations is what I call the

905
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:38,539
enterprise OT right it's those

906
00:33:38,539 --> 00:33:41,640
Enterprise I.T components that exist in

907
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:45,000
the OT Enterprise right right so I can't

908
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,260
tell you how many times I go into

909
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:47,760
environments and I'm sure we've all done

910
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,919
the same thing and we see complete

911
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:51,960
virtualization Stacks running in there

912
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:54,539
I've been to places where every time

913
00:33:54,539 --> 00:33:56,460
they build a plant that plant gets its

914
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:58,620
own ad uh and everything else and then

915
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:01,559
no one manages it which is kind of its

916
00:34:01,559 --> 00:34:03,000
own nightmare

917
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:03,720
um

918
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:06,539
but uh you know so it's it's important

919
00:34:06,539 --> 00:34:09,060
that we take that into account when we

920
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:11,460
have these conversations

921
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:12,179
um

922
00:34:12,179 --> 00:34:14,099
the it and OT convergence is already

923
00:34:14,099 --> 00:34:15,300
happening I don't think that's new to

924
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:16,980
anybody

925
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:19,139
um advances in digitalization are

926
00:34:19,139 --> 00:34:21,418
systemically allowing the digital world

927
00:34:21,418 --> 00:34:23,040
to see and understand and influence the

928
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:25,679
physical operational world

929
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:27,839
uh this means that it and OT networks

930
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:31,379
share similar attack surfaces uh and the

931
00:34:31,379 --> 00:34:33,060
Divide is only shrinking

932
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:36,000
so in other words OT networks face many

933
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,918
of the same security challenges that an

934
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:39,899
Enterprise I.T environment does

935
00:34:39,899 --> 00:34:43,080
but with much greater Stakes

936
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:46,980
yeah and and again if you call if you

937
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:49,139
call sort of an I.T product okay let's

938
00:34:49,139 --> 00:34:50,940
say it originated there that's right but

939
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:52,679
again we're looking at the convergence

940
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:54,418
there's no reason that we do not want to

941
00:34:54,418 --> 00:34:55,800
converge that automation right along

942
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:58,280
with it

943
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:02,700
so some obvious use cases

944
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:03,300
um

945
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:04,920
automated phishing investigation

946
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:07,080
remediation

947
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:08,099
um

948
00:35:08,099 --> 00:35:11,040
right so the platform can automate with

949
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,540
a Playbook

950
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:13,940
um

951
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:16,920
parsing out indicators as they come in

952
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:18,960
looking at your inboxes

953
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,940
um checking to see if those URLs that

954
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:23,400
come in are

955
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,920
um you know linked to malicious

956
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,599
um you know threat Actors Access

957
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:32,160
management you can do things uh like uh

958
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:35,220
automating access to protected resources

959
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:37,859
uh in a uniformed way similar

960
00:35:37,859 --> 00:35:39,900
investigations right some obvious ones

961
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:41,640
we're taking in alerts from your sim

962
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:44,400
we're infusing them uh threat hunting

963
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,700
this is an important one

964
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:49,020
you can automate

965
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:51,180
parts of a threat hunt right you can

966
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:55,440
automate ioc threat hunting it's

967
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,420
I haven't come across a good way to

968
00:35:57,420 --> 00:35:59,579
automate unstructured threat hunts right

969
00:35:59,579 --> 00:36:01,200
it's important to understand it because

970
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,420
that's a common misconception too uh

971
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:04,740
because threat hunting means I think a

972
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:05,760
lot of things to a lot of different

973
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,400
people but in this particular case it's

974
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,619
structured threat hunts right so we're

975
00:36:10,619 --> 00:36:11,660
taking

976
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:14,280
iocs we're running them through whatever

977
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:16,920
our automated processes are to make sure

978
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:19,200
that they're valid and then we're taking

979
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,820
those and then seeing if they've popped

980
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:23,160
up on any of our other endpoints yeah I

981
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:24,540
mean these you know you've got some

982
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:27,540
great again obvious use cases and I

983
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:29,579
think one of the things that that we see

984
00:36:29,579 --> 00:36:31,380
a lot of whether it's an I.T environment

985
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:33,420
or OT environment is phishing

986
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:35,640
investigation remediation is a is a

987
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:38,220
common one to implement Implement very

988
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:39,960
quickly and a lot of that has to do with

989
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,339
the fact going back to what we were just

990
00:36:41,339 --> 00:36:43,380
talking about the fact that if you're

991
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:45,359
going to implement something with

992
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:46,680
automation you want to take something

993
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:48,599
that is a very well documented well

994
00:36:48,599 --> 00:36:50,640
understood process phishing is something

995
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,380
that everybody is dealing with and it is

996
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:54,540
one of the easiest ways into any

997
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:56,400
environment I mean there's a reason that

998
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,380
we see so many phishing emails and it

999
00:36:58,380 --> 00:36:59,760
gets done over and over and over again

1000
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,680
it's just it's too easy to do it's a

1001
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:04,320
simple social engineering attack but

1002
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:07,260
when you look at what can be done with

1003
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:09,119
automation like Josh pointed out you can

1004
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:11,579
look at the fact that as those emails

1005
00:37:11,579 --> 00:37:13,680
come in you can have an automation

1006
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:15,780
system that is reading the information

1007
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:17,820
out of the mail parsing that data out so

1008
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:19,320
taking out the ioc is the body the

1009
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:21,060
header the text putting it in various

1010
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:23,760
Fields you can have all of the

1011
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,619
indicators whether they're the IPS the

1012
00:37:25,619 --> 00:37:27,900
URLs the domains whatever they are you

1013
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:29,339
can have all of those immediately

1014
00:37:29,339 --> 00:37:31,859
investigated automatically using

1015
00:37:31,859 --> 00:37:34,260
whatever your threat tools are so maybe

1016
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:35,880
it's a free tool like virus total maybe

1017
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,320
it's a paid tool like record a future

1018
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:38,760
whatever it happens to be

1019
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:41,220
and have those results brought back into

1020
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:43,320
the platform and then you've got some

1021
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:45,960
choices you're now either going to have

1022
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:47,940
an automated scoring result that can go

1023
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:49,619
ahead and handle the entire process for

1024
00:37:49,619 --> 00:37:51,180
you go ahead and Mark that as a true

1025
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:53,339
positive delete it from the man from

1026
00:37:53,339 --> 00:37:55,560
everybody's mailbox if it's a known bad

1027
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:58,020
or you can make it partially manual have

1028
00:37:58,020 --> 00:37:59,460
somebody look at the results make a

1029
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:01,619
decision click a box and then everything

1030
00:38:01,619 --> 00:38:03,540
else is handled automatically

1031
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:05,700
or maybe maybe you only want to

1032
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:07,320
automatically handle the false positive

1033
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:09,420
so everything's benign we'll go ahead

1034
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:11,280
and close that out send the user who

1035
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:13,320
submitted it an email and say hey thank

1036
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:14,880
you for submitting that it's all good no

1037
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,920
worries but that kind of gives you an

1038
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:19,200
example of just how much you can do and

1039
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,540
that's just one use case obviously again

1040
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:22,920
going through this whether it's access

1041
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:25,740
management or Sim triage or whatever it

1042
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:29,160
is you you can do those types of things

1043
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:32,160
with the Automation and uh and again I

1044
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:34,500
think it goes back to your point of what

1045
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:36,540
are we going to connect it to and and

1046
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:38,700
how again what are your current

1047
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:40,260
processes what is it that you want to

1048
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:43,079
automate what will help you create those

1049
00:38:43,079 --> 00:38:44,460
savings that you were talking about in

1050
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:45,780
the first couple of slides where we

1051
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:48,660
reduce that time to respond and we

1052
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:50,940
create that cost savings

1053
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:53,940
right so uh so you have Insider threat

1054
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:56,760
response uh right you if your risk

1055
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:58,560
appetite is so willing you can tie it

1056
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:02,280
into your HR uh and your your it systems

1057
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:04,260
as well as any sort of compliant systems

1058
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:05,520
and you can aggregate that data together

1059
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:07,920
a lot of times this is more around the

1060
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:11,099
response side of things uh so once some

1061
00:39:11,099 --> 00:39:13,140
other system has triggered

1062
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:14,940
um you know an alert you then automate

1063
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:17,220
the responses uh with a human in the

1064
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:19,260
middle right yep uh collecting and

1065
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:21,119
centralizing you know relevant forensic

1066
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:23,099
data this is kind of a fancy way of

1067
00:39:23,099 --> 00:39:25,200
saying case management

1068
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:26,820
um threat intelligence life cycle

1069
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:29,040
automation right that's taken your

1070
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:31,320
threat Intel feeds you know whether

1071
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:33,780
that's um RSS feeds that you're

1072
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:35,339
monitoring or something you know as

1073
00:39:35,339 --> 00:39:38,099
fancy as recorded future uh or even you

1074
00:39:38,099 --> 00:39:40,320
know whatever favorite blog uh that you

1075
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,540
like to you know monitor you can pull

1076
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:44,339
that information in usually in a

1077
00:39:44,339 --> 00:39:46,619
structured way and then leverage that

1078
00:39:46,619 --> 00:39:48,960
threat intelligence uh you know across

1079
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,460
your automated processes and of course

1080
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:52,740
incident response bonds automation right

1081
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:54,660
so we're actually making you know

1082
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:56,220
response actions in your environment

1083
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:58,200
yeah and I mean I don't want to jump

1084
00:39:58,200 --> 00:39:59,820
ahead of of you know some other

1085
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:02,160
potential use cases here but going back

1086
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:03,839
to like the example of forensic data

1087
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:05,280
let's say you're using virtualized

1088
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:07,380
systems you know one of your forensic

1089
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:09,720
processes might be instant grab of that

1090
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:12,119
forensic data by taking a snapshot of

1091
00:40:12,119 --> 00:40:13,680
that virtualized system that you can

1092
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:16,320
automate that or I love your example of

1093
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:18,480
you know connecting into the HR System

1094
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,280
if that's something you want to do well

1095
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:21,720
now you've got the ability to not only

1096
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:23,820
see who is an active user of the system

1097
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:25,500
but you can see their other properties

1098
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:27,420
and when you're starting to connect to

1099
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:29,579
tools like recorded future if you're

1100
00:40:29,579 --> 00:40:31,740
using let's say their identity module

1101
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:33,900
which has the ability to tell you any

1102
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:35,339
credentials or things that have been

1103
00:40:35,339 --> 00:40:37,380
found on the dark web now all of a

1104
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:38,640
sudden you can correlate that with your

1105
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:40,859
HR database and immediately take actions

1106
00:40:40,859 --> 00:40:42,839
like suspend the user's account or

1107
00:40:42,839 --> 00:40:44,760
whatever it is you want to do based on

1108
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:47,780
credentials that have been found right

1109
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:50,280
when you're tying in HR systems you have

1110
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:52,140
access to privilege data right so a lot

1111
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:53,660
of things have to be thought around that

1112
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:55,980
and a lot of customers get squeamish

1113
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:58,560
right for good reason you're aggregating

1114
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:01,140
a lot of data together and the people

1115
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:03,060
who have access to that data has to be

1116
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:05,400
controlled so that's why you typically

1117
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:07,680
see more of the response side in that

1118
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:09,900
particular use case but there is a lot

1119
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:12,839
of interesting things you could do you

1120
00:41:12,839 --> 00:41:14,940
know if you had access to all those

1121
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:17,640
systems and the proper controls in place

1122
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:19,859
to ensure you could do that safely yeah

1123
00:41:19,859 --> 00:41:22,380
and again I think that goes back to the

1124
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:25,020
point of be careful what you want to do

1125
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:26,579
so it goes back to the documentation of

1126
00:41:26,579 --> 00:41:28,079
the process and how you want to

1127
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:29,460
implement it so if I'm going to use an

1128
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:31,380
API call to connect to the HR System

1129
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:33,540
yeah maybe I have the ability to pull

1130
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:35,280
back all of that HR data but if I've

1131
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,660
written it correctly into the platform

1132
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:38,700
the only thing I'm pulling back is is

1133
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:41,700
this an active user yes or no so a

1134
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:43,380
little bit of difference there as long

1135
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:45,359
as you've documented that process and

1136
00:41:45,359 --> 00:41:48,200
built it accordingly

1137
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:52,680
so our use cases are great

1138
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:54,660
um and that's typically the level you'll

1139
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:56,579
get when you're talking to you know some

1140
00:41:56,579 --> 00:41:57,839
of your sales reps depending on the

1141
00:41:57,839 --> 00:41:59,760
solution that you're going with

1142
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:02,400
um but what are we really automating

1143
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,800
uh you're much better off not rushing in

1144
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,480
and blindly automating a bunch of things

1145
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:07,980
right it's a common theme Here I want to

1146
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:09,599
make sure that when we're

1147
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:11,460
when we're looking at solar platforms

1148
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:14,820
that we're moving slow and purposeful

1149
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:17,280
um and we're not jumping ahead and

1150
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:19,079
automating things that we don't

1151
00:42:19,079 --> 00:42:23,460
currently do or haven't done in that

1152
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:24,300
they're the first of those kind

1153
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:26,220
processes because you won't end with the

1154
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:28,320
result that you actually like

1155
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:31,800
um so you know uh again think about your

1156
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:34,260
processes first uh as I mentioned

1157
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:35,940
document you got to start from

1158
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:38,339
documented processes I know I'm harping

1159
00:42:38,339 --> 00:42:39,599
on it

1160
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:42,000
um and uh you need to have a good

1161
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,160
understanding and map out the different

1162
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:46,079
processes that your security operations

1163
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:49,980
teams uh utilize and after you've mapped

1164
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:51,300
out that we can look at what you can

1165
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:52,980
automate with confidence

1166
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:54,900
all right that's an important thing you

1167
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:56,160
just because you can automate it doesn't

1168
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:57,660
necessarily mean you should or at least

1169
00:42:57,660 --> 00:42:59,940
should yet you should really start with

1170
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:01,380
the things that you feel you have

1171
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:05,480
confidence in being able to automate

1172
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:07,260
um so if you're just starting with a

1173
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:09,420
soar platform uh I recommend starting

1174
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:12,599
with the basic processes that are found

1175
00:43:12,599 --> 00:43:14,819
in almost all you know socks right so

1176
00:43:14,819 --> 00:43:16,740
that's triage your decision making

1177
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:19,200
investigation response

1178
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:20,940
right so triage

1179
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:23,099
um isn't is an easy one right enrichment

1180
00:43:23,099 --> 00:43:25,740
is typically the first thing that we see

1181
00:43:25,740 --> 00:43:27,420
um right we've got a large volume of

1182
00:43:27,420 --> 00:43:30,359
data coming in what else do we know you

1183
00:43:30,359 --> 00:43:32,520
know about the assets that are that are

1184
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:35,300
in those alerts

1185
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:37,079
um right typically the next stage after

1186
00:43:37,079 --> 00:43:38,880
that is threat intelligence gathering

1187
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:42,300
right so is it a known bad uh is it

1188
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:44,099
benign

1189
00:43:44,099 --> 00:43:46,260
user interaction is another common one

1190
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:48,300
right so those are all the times that we

1191
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:50,520
have to interact with the user to get

1192
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:53,040
some additional data right so those can

1193
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:55,859
easily be automated uh where you send

1194
00:43:55,859 --> 00:43:57,839
either an email or some sort of text

1195
00:43:57,839 --> 00:43:59,520
notification

1196
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:01,260
um and you wait for that user to respond

1197
00:44:01,260 --> 00:44:02,940
right so

1198
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:04,740
um did they fail to log into their

1199
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:06,839
system 40 times

1200
00:44:06,839 --> 00:44:09,660
uh you know if you get a response back

1201
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:11,819
then cool we can maybe close the case uh

1202
00:44:11,819 --> 00:44:14,099
if not maybe we should investigate this

1203
00:44:14,099 --> 00:44:16,440
a little further

1204
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:19,079
um you can do validation across your

1205
00:44:19,079 --> 00:44:21,300
detection tools right so I've got an

1206
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:23,400
alert coming in you know across one

1207
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:25,560
platform that I'm integrating with that

1208
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:29,280
I see it across the others uh so

1209
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:32,400
uh for instance Ryan you can uh taking

1210
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:34,920
your your similar and maybe bounce it

1211
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:37,200
off of some other you know IDs sensor

1212
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:39,839
you have in your network to see is this

1213
00:44:39,839 --> 00:44:43,500
real in my environment uh another one uh

1214
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:45,240
malware analysis

1215
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:47,460
it sounds Advanced

1216
00:44:47,460 --> 00:44:49,859
um but it doesn't have to be right so we

1217
00:44:49,859 --> 00:44:52,319
can take for instance an attachment

1218
00:44:52,319 --> 00:44:54,359
that's coming you know via a phishing

1219
00:44:54,359 --> 00:44:56,880
attempt send it off to some sort of

1220
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:58,740
platform maybe a cuckoo VM or something

1221
00:44:58,740 --> 00:45:00,000
like that

1222
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,040
um detonate it and then pull the results

1223
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:03,480
back

1224
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:05,400
I'm going to include that in with your

1225
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:06,240
case

1226
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:08,760
yeah I mean there's a lot of and you

1227
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:11,400
covered a lot of possibilities there but

1228
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:13,319
you know just to kind of again give

1229
00:45:13,319 --> 00:45:14,520
everybody a little bit of a frame of

1230
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:16,319
reference think about the actual triage

1231
00:45:16,319 --> 00:45:17,819
process that occurs here and we'll just

1232
00:45:17,819 --> 00:45:19,920
go back and take the enrichment example

1233
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:22,200
as one of them if you were to if you're

1234
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:24,300
let's say you're the analyst that's in

1235
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:26,339
the sock and it's your job to do the

1236
00:45:26,339 --> 00:45:27,720
enrichment process and you're having to

1237
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:29,819
do it manually think about the time that

1238
00:45:29,819 --> 00:45:32,339
it takes to look at whether that's the

1239
00:45:32,339 --> 00:45:33,960
alert or if it's a phishing email

1240
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:36,720
whatever it is find the indicators say

1241
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:38,400
all right I've got this IP address I've

1242
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:40,020
got this domain I've got this URL or

1243
00:45:40,020 --> 00:45:41,339
I've got this attachment whatever it

1244
00:45:41,339 --> 00:45:44,640
might be and then take those and go

1245
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:46,680
manually to the threat intelligence

1246
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:48,900
tools so you've got to open up a new tab

1247
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:51,660
or a new window go to the website log in

1248
00:45:51,660 --> 00:45:53,040
sometimes if you don't already have that

1249
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:55,200
window open now you've got to paste that

1250
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:56,700
information in there whether it's the

1251
00:45:56,700 --> 00:45:58,680
URL or you know upload the attachment

1252
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:00,780
whatever you have to do wait for the

1253
00:46:00,780 --> 00:46:03,359
results copy the result record that back

1254
00:46:03,359 --> 00:46:05,940
in the ticket all of those are processes

1255
00:46:05,940 --> 00:46:08,460
and and in less time than it took me to

1256
00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:09,900
just describe it

1257
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:11,579
you can automate it

1258
00:46:11,579 --> 00:46:13,800
so the time savings is immense and

1259
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:15,540
that's just one example obviously as you

1260
00:46:15,540 --> 00:46:17,339
go through each one of these you could

1261
00:46:17,339 --> 00:46:19,319
see similar examples but that kind of

1262
00:46:19,319 --> 00:46:20,940
gives you an idea of just the importance

1263
00:46:20,940 --> 00:46:23,940
of doing that yep uh trivial decision

1264
00:46:23,940 --> 00:46:25,140
making

1265
00:46:25,140 --> 00:46:28,260
um right so most trivial decisions if

1266
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:30,780
you can properly decompose them you can

1267
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:33,599
automate so we're going to use an easy

1268
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:36,000
one write a phishing email we're

1269
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,020
probably going to harp on that a little

1270
00:46:37,020 --> 00:46:38,640
bit because it's just really an easy one

1271
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:41,880
to decompose but so a phishing attempt

1272
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:45,720
comes in you can automate the decision

1273
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:48,079
process on whether or not that's benign

1274
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:51,720
or an actual true positive by taking

1275
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:54,000
that email parsing out the URLs that it

1276
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,819
contains taking a look at the cindering

1277
00:46:56,819 --> 00:46:58,079
and bouncing that off of your threat

1278
00:46:58,079 --> 00:47:00,140
intelligence tools and then

1279
00:47:00,140 --> 00:47:02,400
automatically make that decision right

1280
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:04,500
that way you are eliminating the noise

1281
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:06,780
from your sock analysts you reduce

1282
00:47:06,780 --> 00:47:10,200
burnout you reduce churn right churn is

1283
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:11,940
a common thing when you're operating a

1284
00:47:11,940 --> 00:47:13,880
sock and it's one of the biggest

1285
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:16,980
costs in a sock to some degree because

1286
00:47:16,980 --> 00:47:19,440
you're burning out your analysts you've

1287
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:20,940
then got to hire new people you got to

1288
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:22,520
pay for the head hunting the training

1289
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:24,780
getting them integrated back into your

1290
00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:25,859
process and then you're probably going

1291
00:47:25,859 --> 00:47:28,440
to start all over again right so having

1292
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:30,260
tools that reduce

1293
00:47:30,260 --> 00:47:32,760
the amount of noise that your sock

1294
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:35,280
analysts have to deal with and parse

1295
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:37,500
through really helps with that alert

1296
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:40,619
fatigue and analyst burnout and honestly

1297
00:47:40,619 --> 00:47:43,800
that's one of our biggest biggest goals

1298
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:46,079
across the board is really trying to

1299
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:48,119
help eliminate that problem because we

1300
00:47:48,119 --> 00:47:50,460
do see that as an issue it you know you

1301
00:47:50,460 --> 00:47:52,140
can go look at the industry stats and

1302
00:47:52,140 --> 00:47:54,180
see just how much of a job shortage

1303
00:47:54,180 --> 00:47:55,500
there is in terms of trained available

1304
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:57,240
people to handle these security

1305
00:47:57,240 --> 00:47:59,040
processes we don't want to burn out the

1306
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:01,260
ones that we do have

1307
00:48:01,260 --> 00:48:03,420
right so the next phase is typically

1308
00:48:03,420 --> 00:48:05,400
some form of Investigation has to happen

1309
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:09,900
uh right so utilizing a soar platform

1310
00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:12,060
you can eliminate a lot of the grunt

1311
00:48:12,060 --> 00:48:14,280
work uh that's involved during an

1312
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:17,099
investigation uh you know for instance

1313
00:48:17,099 --> 00:48:19,920
usually there's uh several Sim queries

1314
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:22,680
that have to be ran sometimes depending

1315
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:25,980
on how your sim is configured those can

1316
00:48:25,980 --> 00:48:27,380
take a long time

1317
00:48:27,380 --> 00:48:29,520
especially if certain Fields aren't

1318
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:32,160
indexed as we discover all the time as

1319
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:34,140
we're putting these together

1320
00:48:34,140 --> 00:48:36,720
um right we're talking hours to run a

1321
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:38,700
query uh now obviously that doesn't

1322
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:40,260
that's not very sustainable for

1323
00:48:40,260 --> 00:48:42,540
automation you still have to fix that

1324
00:48:42,540 --> 00:48:44,640
um but that's a that's a separate uh

1325
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:46,740
issue but you can automate those queries

1326
00:48:46,740 --> 00:48:49,020
firing um and sometimes based off of the

1327
00:48:49,020 --> 00:48:50,819
decisions that are made in the decision

1328
00:48:50,819 --> 00:48:52,560
making step you fire off additional

1329
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:54,480
queries and so by the time it actually

1330
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:57,119
hits your analyst all that works already

1331
00:48:57,119 --> 00:48:59,579
been done they all they have to do is

1332
00:48:59,579 --> 00:49:01,740
read and ingest the data

1333
00:49:01,740 --> 00:49:03,540
they don't have to spend time in way

1334
00:49:03,540 --> 00:49:05,940
Cycles going out I mean and Gathering

1335
00:49:05,940 --> 00:49:07,800
evidence which sometimes is the longest

1336
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:11,339
partial part of a sock analyst's job is

1337
00:49:11,339 --> 00:49:12,599
actually going out there and finding

1338
00:49:12,599 --> 00:49:14,339
where all the data is gathering all the

1339
00:49:14,339 --> 00:49:16,260
logs putting it all into the case

1340
00:49:16,260 --> 00:49:18,720
management system and then finally they

1341
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:20,099
get to make their decision

1342
00:49:20,099 --> 00:49:22,800
yep and again you know pivoting off of

1343
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:24,420
what you said there for a moment with

1344
00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:26,400
let's say you have an indicator you want

1345
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:28,440
to do some investigation that can be a

1346
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:30,000
fully automated process as soon as you

1347
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,859
flag an indicator in your environment

1348
00:49:31,859 --> 00:49:34,980
that is a known positive hit why not

1349
00:49:34,980 --> 00:49:37,020
have that automatically trigger the Sim

1350
00:49:37,020 --> 00:49:38,579
search or whatever it is that you're

1351
00:49:38,579 --> 00:49:41,160
using to do your search to see is that

1352
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:42,359
found anywhere else in the environment

1353
00:49:42,359 --> 00:49:43,859
do I have any other risks associated

1354
00:49:43,859 --> 00:49:45,420
with it

1355
00:49:45,420 --> 00:49:47,940
so next phase is response

1356
00:49:47,940 --> 00:49:51,180
um most utilities are not okay with

1357
00:49:51,180 --> 00:49:52,980
automated responses

1358
00:49:52,980 --> 00:49:56,160
but none other uh and to be honest I

1359
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:57,720
wouldn't necessarily recommend it yet

1360
00:49:57,720 --> 00:49:59,460
either unless you know a hundred percent

1361
00:49:59,460 --> 00:50:04,560
with certainty uh that this type of

1362
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:07,140
investigation or the this string of

1363
00:50:07,140 --> 00:50:08,700
alerts

1364
00:50:08,700 --> 00:50:10,740
um warrants this type of response every

1365
00:50:10,740 --> 00:50:13,260
single time right it's it's uh you can

1366
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:14,700
end up doing a lot of bad things and

1367
00:50:14,700 --> 00:50:16,560
causing a lot of harm

1368
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:18,780
um like uh for instance sometimes you

1369
00:50:18,780 --> 00:50:20,220
you get a false positive that makes it

1370
00:50:20,220 --> 00:50:22,079
all the way through if you're an

1371
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:24,980
organization that relies on Office 365

1372
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:28,260
the amount of times that I see an o365

1373
00:50:28,260 --> 00:50:30,119
URL make it through to the investigation

1374
00:50:30,119 --> 00:50:32,579
if you were to automatically block that

1375
00:50:32,579 --> 00:50:34,859
URL you would make a lot of people not

1376
00:50:34,859 --> 00:50:36,180
very happy

1377
00:50:36,180 --> 00:50:38,160
uh in some cases there might be a resume

1378
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:40,260
generating event

1379
00:50:40,260 --> 00:50:42,960
um but uh but those are things that the

1380
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:44,940
you know that soar can help you with by

1381
00:50:44,940 --> 00:50:48,059
at least automating the action even if

1382
00:50:48,059 --> 00:50:50,460
we're not automating it through its

1383
00:50:50,460 --> 00:50:52,500
entire process from from the

1384
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:54,480
investigation to actually automatically

1385
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:56,400
triggering the response you can at least

1386
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:58,140
extrapolate that up to a button press

1387
00:50:58,140 --> 00:51:00,480
right those actions are what we can

1388
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:02,819
automate so we can automate putting an

1389
00:51:02,819 --> 00:51:05,160
IP address or a URL

1390
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:07,040
um you know at the firewall to block it

1391
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:12,000
we can take in a known piece of malware

1392
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,059
and potentially block its executable

1393
00:51:14,059 --> 00:51:16,260
across the rest of our hosts if we start

1394
00:51:16,260 --> 00:51:18,540
getting you know triggers like for

1395
00:51:18,540 --> 00:51:20,819
instance a phishing email comes in

1396
00:51:20,819 --> 00:51:23,700
um and there's some Excel file that's uh

1397
00:51:23,700 --> 00:51:25,740
you know that's got a dropper in there

1398
00:51:25,740 --> 00:51:27,599
that's that's firing off an executable

1399
00:51:27,599 --> 00:51:29,700
we can then add that to a block list if

1400
00:51:29,700 --> 00:51:31,079
we're implementing white listing in the

1401
00:51:31,079 --> 00:51:34,440
environment you can isolate hosts right

1402
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:36,780
so uh you can either fully block them

1403
00:51:36,780 --> 00:51:38,520
depending on your solution not

1404
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:41,280
necessarily something I would do in a

1405
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:43,200
OT environment but you can then a lot of

1406
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:46,140
times move those uh into a isolated

1407
00:51:46,140 --> 00:51:49,260
subnet where maybe they're disconnected

1408
00:51:49,260 --> 00:51:51,900
from the corporate infrastructure while

1409
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:53,460
we conduct an investigation but that way

1410
00:51:53,460 --> 00:51:55,740
we're not hampering you know processes

1411
00:51:55,740 --> 00:51:56,940
that are happening

1412
00:51:56,940 --> 00:51:59,220
uh honestly if you if you think about it

1413
00:51:59,220 --> 00:52:01,559
let's say somebody has a uh a malicious

1414
00:52:01,559 --> 00:52:03,300
indicator that shows up maybe maybe it's

1415
00:52:03,300 --> 00:52:05,819
a URL maybe maybe it's a file hash all

1416
00:52:05,819 --> 00:52:08,819
right and in the alert that we see one

1417
00:52:08,819 --> 00:52:10,619
of the IP addresses that's associated

1418
00:52:10,619 --> 00:52:12,960
with it happens to be a proxy and we've

1419
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:14,760
set up an automated result that says oh

1420
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:16,440
block any IP address where that's known

1421
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:17,640
all of a sudden you just blocked

1422
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:20,339
everybody from using the proxy like you

1423
00:52:20,339 --> 00:52:21,900
said that could be a totally different

1424
00:52:21,900 --> 00:52:24,540
event yeah it's a yeah it's a different

1425
00:52:24,540 --> 00:52:25,500
type of thing you're going to be

1426
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:27,839
handling uh opening tickets with other

1427
00:52:27,839 --> 00:52:29,760
departments um you know I made a joke

1428
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:33,300
about uh uh you know implementing soar

1429
00:52:33,300 --> 00:52:35,880
is a ticket management system

1430
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:37,800
um but you know it it's it's not really

1431
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:39,660
a joke at the end of the day because a

1432
00:52:39,660 --> 00:52:40,619
lot of times there's a lot of tickets

1433
00:52:40,619 --> 00:52:42,480
that have to be created

1434
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:44,579
um like for instance a lot of utilities

1435
00:52:44,579 --> 00:52:46,680
utilize you know something called Sigma

1436
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:48,540
flow and they have servicenow tickets

1437
00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:49,920
and they've got to implement you know

1438
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:52,920
Open tickets in both areas and sometimes

1439
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:55,079
that can be complicated and sometimes

1440
00:52:55,079 --> 00:52:56,700
really redundant

1441
00:52:56,700 --> 00:52:59,520
um you know so that's another area where

1442
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:01,740
you can Implement uh you know that stuff

1443
00:53:01,740 --> 00:53:04,260
inside of source so that way you're not

1444
00:53:04,260 --> 00:53:06,960
wasting analyst Time by duplicating

1445
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:08,760
effort right those tickets can just be

1446
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:10,800
created uh they just hit a button or

1447
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:12,420
it's created as part of the case

1448
00:53:12,420 --> 00:53:14,099
management process that those tickets

1449
00:53:14,099 --> 00:53:16,440
get opened in the correct uh locations

1450
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:18,839
yep great example and again you can

1451
00:53:18,839 --> 00:53:20,520
automate as much or as little of that as

1452
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:21,599
you want

1453
00:53:21,599 --> 00:53:24,599
so finally we have Lessons Learned uh

1454
00:53:24,599 --> 00:53:27,059
this tends to be an often overlooked

1455
00:53:27,059 --> 00:53:27,800
area

1456
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:30,660
but you can automate a lot of that

1457
00:53:30,660 --> 00:53:33,660
feedback loop especially when if you

1458
00:53:33,660 --> 00:53:36,000
define your sock kpis right so we talked

1459
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,880
about MTD and mttr so whatever those

1460
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:41,040
kpis that are important to your sock

1461
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:42,240
that you're measuring that you're

1462
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:44,099
utilizing to get funding typically right

1463
00:53:44,099 --> 00:53:46,460
from your scissors and stuff

1464
00:53:46,460 --> 00:53:49,280
you can automate some of that process

1465
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:52,980
initiation so when you're developing new

1466
00:53:52,980 --> 00:53:55,680
processes it's important to think about

1467
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:58,980
how can we implement this in in an

1468
00:53:58,980 --> 00:54:01,800
automated fashion as part as far as a

1469
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:03,839
feedback loop is concerned right so what

1470
00:54:03,839 --> 00:54:05,460
things can we do to drive continuous

1471
00:54:05,460 --> 00:54:08,099
Improvement and in how can we uh

1472
00:54:08,099 --> 00:54:10,700
automate those

1473
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:13,920
are there any questions before we move

1474
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:18,319
into some of the more fun scenarios

1475
00:54:19,260 --> 00:54:20,760
all right

1476
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:22,440
so this is more of the fun stuff the

1477
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:24,660
non-obvious use cases

1478
00:54:24,660 --> 00:54:27,300
uh we've I've had the the privilege of

1479
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:28,920
working at a lot of different utilities

1480
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:31,760
and coming across a lot of different

1481
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:35,280
configurations so these really come from

1482
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:37,319
those that we've done and some of the

1483
00:54:37,319 --> 00:54:40,260
use cases that they've had so multi data

1484
00:54:40,260 --> 00:54:41,880
center Sim and case management syncing

1485
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:43,559
and mapping

1486
00:54:43,559 --> 00:54:46,559
intelligent panting or what I've started

1487
00:54:46,559 --> 00:54:49,440
to call is ipathing uh firewall requests

1488
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:53,460
uh soft isolation in ICS environment and

1489
00:54:53,460 --> 00:54:56,119
in Asset Management

1490
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:58,440
and are you seeing those pretty

1491
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:01,680
frequently as as non-obvious use cases

1492
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:05,099
or is that kind of sporadic uh it's kind

1493
00:55:05,099 --> 00:55:07,800
of sporadic I think and I guess maybe I

1494
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:09,359
should Define maybe more non-obvious

1495
00:55:09,359 --> 00:55:10,680
it's not the things people think about

1496
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:13,020
when they think about soar right uh

1497
00:55:13,020 --> 00:55:15,480
right at the end of the day for me and I

1498
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:17,940
kind of hinted at it earlier uh soar is

1499
00:55:17,940 --> 00:55:21,540
only limited by your risk appetite and

1500
00:55:21,540 --> 00:55:25,559
uh and your creativity it can do all the

1501
00:55:25,559 --> 00:55:28,020
things I make jokes commonly uh that I

1502
00:55:28,020 --> 00:55:29,760
can have sore do my taxes doesn't mean

1503
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:31,140
we should

1504
00:55:31,140 --> 00:55:33,059
um but you could right if you if you

1505
00:55:33,059 --> 00:55:34,140
really wanted to because at the end of

1506
00:55:34,140 --> 00:55:35,760
the day it's an application development

1507
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:39,420
platform that that extrapolates it a lot

1508
00:55:39,420 --> 00:55:41,040
of the headaches of running your own

1509
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:43,319
environment away I mean it makes it easy

1510
00:55:43,319 --> 00:55:45,540
for those who maybe don't have a coding

1511
00:55:45,540 --> 00:55:48,000
background to come in and start you know

1512
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,280
helping out and automating different

1513
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:51,900
pieces in your environment and another

1514
00:55:51,900 --> 00:55:53,280
one that comes to mind here just because

1515
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:54,720
we're talking about non-obvious use

1516
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:57,420
cases but definitely apply lies in this

1517
00:55:57,420 --> 00:55:59,339
environment would be doing compliance

1518
00:55:59,339 --> 00:56:01,500
reporting so

1519
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:04,319
one example that that we have and I

1520
00:56:04,319 --> 00:56:05,819
believe we even have like a video on it

1521
00:56:05,819 --> 00:56:08,339
on our website but is uh handling nerk

1522
00:56:08,339 --> 00:56:10,920
zip compliance and uh you know the idea

1523
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:14,220
that this is typically a very manual

1524
00:56:14,220 --> 00:56:15,720
process with a lot of things that have

1525
00:56:15,720 --> 00:56:17,640
to be checked off and evaluated and so

1526
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:19,920
on but there are steps in there that can

1527
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:23,460
be automated and make that process a lot

1528
00:56:23,460 --> 00:56:27,859
more reliable and a lot less taxing

1529
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:31,319
so in our multi uh data center Sim

1530
00:56:31,319 --> 00:56:34,619
scenario we had three data centers and

1531
00:56:34,619 --> 00:56:37,020
we had three types of Sims

1532
00:56:37,020 --> 00:56:39,180
right it goes back to where I've seen

1533
00:56:39,180 --> 00:56:41,400
cases where we say where when a plant

1534
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:42,900
gets stood up they they get their own

1535
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:44,520
instantiation of a tech stack right this

1536
00:56:44,520 --> 00:56:46,260
is something similar

1537
00:56:46,260 --> 00:56:47,339
um

1538
00:56:47,339 --> 00:56:49,980
so for the multi-data center use case uh

1539
00:56:49,980 --> 00:56:51,540
we again like I said we had multiple

1540
00:56:51,540 --> 00:56:53,760
data centers where events were created

1541
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:55,980
independently from each other uh and the

1542
00:56:55,980 --> 00:56:58,200
sites had a level of uh synchronous

1543
00:56:58,200 --> 00:56:59,819
between them

1544
00:56:59,819 --> 00:57:00,839
um

1545
00:57:00,839 --> 00:57:03,420
in our example uh the three different

1546
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:05,880
sites each ran a slight variation of our

1547
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:08,099
security Stacks so side a used something

1548
00:57:08,099 --> 00:57:10,619
like elk site B was Splunk and insight C

1549
00:57:10,619 --> 00:57:14,040
utilized Q radar uh and in what was

1550
00:57:14,040 --> 00:57:17,339
requested was a centralized dashboard uh

1551
00:57:17,339 --> 00:57:19,680
where they could uh manage their

1552
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:22,920
different data centers holistically

1553
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:25,200
right this is a very simplified version

1554
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:27,180
of the workflow don't look at this and

1555
00:57:27,180 --> 00:57:28,500
think that this is all that it takes to

1556
00:57:28,500 --> 00:57:29,819
do this

1557
00:57:29,819 --> 00:57:32,880
um at all but essentially what we ended

1558
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:34,200
up building

1559
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:37,140
uh was a polling process that would

1560
00:57:37,140 --> 00:57:39,780
periodically pull the three different uh

1561
00:57:39,780 --> 00:57:42,180
Sims that we had at the time they did

1562
00:57:42,180 --> 00:57:44,880
not have Push capabilities uh Q radar

1563
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:46,920
does now have a push capability where

1564
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:49,079
it'll push it depending on what sort

1565
00:57:49,079 --> 00:57:50,520
platform you're using it can just push

1566
00:57:50,520 --> 00:57:52,460
the alerts over

1567
00:57:52,460 --> 00:57:56,780
those events all got fed into uh Bert

1568
00:57:56,780 --> 00:57:59,460
which is a natural language processing

1569
00:57:59,460 --> 00:58:02,160
Library so that stands for

1570
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:03,000
um

1571
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:06,000
bi-directional

1572
00:58:06,839 --> 00:58:09,500
I apologize

1573
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:12,599
but Bert it's a basically a

1574
00:58:12,599 --> 00:58:15,000
um a uh a machine learning model that

1575
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:16,920
Google put together uh that's open

1576
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:18,839
source that comes pre-trained that you

1577
00:58:18,839 --> 00:58:20,880
can leverage to basically do uh

1578
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:23,400
similarity uh matches across different

1579
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:25,800
types of texts so in this case what we

1580
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:28,800
did is we set a threshold for the level

1581
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:30,839
of similarity that we wanted and as

1582
00:58:30,839 --> 00:58:33,900
those alerts right the body and the text

1583
00:58:33,900 --> 00:58:37,079
uh the title came in we did a similarity

1584
00:58:37,079 --> 00:58:39,119
comparison and based on whether or not

1585
00:58:39,119 --> 00:58:41,720
it met the threshold we would aggregate

1586
00:58:41,720 --> 00:58:44,640
the alerts together

1587
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:47,220
uh right so bird is open source uh you

1588
00:58:47,220 --> 00:58:49,500
can go pull it down as long as your sim

1589
00:58:49,500 --> 00:58:51,660
solution utilizes some sort of python

1590
00:58:51,660 --> 00:58:53,760
environment you can easily install that

1591
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:56,579
Library so once that happened right we

1592
00:58:56,579 --> 00:58:57,960
checked for their uh whether or not

1593
00:58:57,960 --> 00:59:00,000
there was an existing case for it we

1594
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,339
either added it to the case uh or we

1595
00:59:02,339 --> 00:59:04,319
created a new one

1596
00:59:04,319 --> 00:59:05,880
cool

1597
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:07,619
any questions on that workflow before we

1598
00:59:07,619 --> 00:59:09,839
go to the next one

1599
00:59:09,839 --> 00:59:11,819
pretty cool way to combine all of those

1600
00:59:11,819 --> 00:59:14,880
different tools and make it one solution

1601
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:16,500
a lot of times people would look at that

1602
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:17,880
and say Ah that's not going to be easy

1603
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:22,940
to do but with automation absolutely yep

1604
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:27,000
so I passing firewall requests modern

1605
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:28,740
networks are large I think we all know

1606
00:59:28,740 --> 00:59:32,160
that they're very complex and a lot of

1607
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:33,839
times especially when you're dealing

1608
00:59:33,839 --> 00:59:36,720
with multiple plants you end up with

1609
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:39,599
scenarios where you might be act where

1610
00:59:39,599 --> 00:59:41,220
that traffic is all going through some

1611
00:59:41,220 --> 00:59:43,200
sort of centralized choke points but you

1612
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:46,619
have to open up multiple areas within

1613
00:59:46,619 --> 00:59:48,839
your network in order for you know maybe

1614
00:59:48,839 --> 00:59:50,460
your systems to talk to your security

1615
00:59:50,460 --> 00:59:52,619
stack or it needs to talk to this other

1616
00:59:52,619 --> 00:59:54,839
service so on and so forth and those

1617
00:59:54,839 --> 00:59:57,780
might be located in different zones uh

1618
00:59:57,780 --> 00:59:59,940
inside of of your network so this is

1619
00:59:59,940 --> 01:00:02,099
this is a very high level architecture

1620
01:00:02,099 --> 01:00:05,099
of a Zone and conduit model that's

1621
01:00:05,099 --> 01:00:07,500
supposed to represent just a standard

1622
01:00:07,500 --> 01:00:10,799
plan operations uh where you know this

1623
01:00:10,799 --> 01:00:12,000
particular place might have more than

1624
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,099
one plant

1625
01:00:14,099 --> 01:00:15,359
um but the only thing you really need to

1626
01:00:15,359 --> 01:00:16,980
get from this is again that modern

1627
01:00:16,980 --> 01:00:19,680
networks can be pretty complex

1628
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:23,099
uh so what we did here uh the request

1629
01:00:23,099 --> 01:00:24,900
was to

1630
01:00:24,900 --> 01:00:28,020
um have a centralized place where users

1631
01:00:28,020 --> 01:00:30,660
across their environment could either

1632
01:00:30,660 --> 01:00:32,819
request new devices or they could

1633
01:00:32,819 --> 01:00:35,220
request ports to be open

1634
01:00:35,220 --> 01:00:37,440
um and so what we ended up doing was we

1635
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:39,720
built them a SharePoint uh portal where

1636
01:00:39,720 --> 01:00:41,480
they could go fill out a form

1637
01:00:41,480 --> 01:00:45,299
that form would then be pushed over into

1638
01:00:45,299 --> 01:00:48,480
our solar platform and then for each one

1639
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:50,220
of the identified services that were in

1640
01:00:50,220 --> 01:00:53,400
there we identified the path to the

1641
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:55,440
device right so there is a prerequisite

1642
01:00:55,440 --> 01:00:58,380
for this you have to understand what you

1643
01:00:58,380 --> 01:00:59,900
have which I know is a common problem

1644
01:00:59,900 --> 01:01:02,099
but you then have to go and you have to

1645
01:01:02,099 --> 01:01:05,160
document that uh in a graph form right

1646
01:01:05,160 --> 01:01:08,460
so that way you can use standard python

1647
01:01:08,460 --> 01:01:11,460
pathing libraries to identify the path

1648
01:01:11,460 --> 01:01:13,859
to that device so for instance you'd

1649
01:01:13,859 --> 01:01:15,599
want to identify all your choke points

1650
01:01:15,599 --> 01:01:17,579
so that would be your firewalls your

1651
01:01:17,579 --> 01:01:20,400
switches and then map those back to a

1652
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:21,839
given Zone

1653
01:01:21,839 --> 01:01:23,579
uh in your network assuming you're

1654
01:01:23,579 --> 01:01:25,740
following a Zone and conduit model and

1655
01:01:25,740 --> 01:01:28,200
once you've done that it's a simple API

1656
01:01:28,200 --> 01:01:30,599
call to you know choose your python

1657
01:01:30,599 --> 01:01:32,700
library that does it to then go and

1658
01:01:32,700 --> 01:01:34,920
identify the shortest path to that

1659
01:01:34,920 --> 01:01:36,359
device and then

1660
01:01:36,359 --> 01:01:39,180
from there you understand cool I need to

1661
01:01:39,180 --> 01:01:40,920
fire off these additional commands then

1662
01:01:40,920 --> 01:01:44,160
go open the ports correctly to the

1663
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:46,440
service for that device very very

1664
01:01:46,440 --> 01:01:48,599
creative way to do that like it well it

1665
01:01:48,599 --> 01:01:51,420
beats half in the you either

1666
01:01:51,420 --> 01:01:52,260
um

1667
01:01:52,260 --> 01:01:55,380
uh do that or or you you end up coming

1668
01:01:55,380 --> 01:01:57,059
up with some other sort of monstrosity

1669
01:01:57,059 --> 01:01:59,160
and this was uh just an easier way to to

1670
01:01:59,160 --> 01:02:00,960
identify that without actually having to

1671
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:03,119
manually map out all of the different

1672
01:02:03,119 --> 01:02:04,680
paths and it allowed it to be a little

1673
01:02:04,680 --> 01:02:06,720
bit more Dynamic

1674
01:02:06,720 --> 01:02:09,599
um and so again so for each uh device

1675
01:02:09,599 --> 01:02:12,059
that we had for each Access Control

1676
01:02:12,059 --> 01:02:14,880
point you then create the command

1677
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:17,400
um compile that into what I call the

1678
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:20,280
command queue which is just squashing

1679
01:02:20,280 --> 01:02:21,540
all those different commands that have

1680
01:02:21,540 --> 01:02:24,540
to be fired off either API calls or

1681
01:02:24,540 --> 01:02:26,700
sometimes it's just raw SSH commands to

1682
01:02:26,700 --> 01:02:28,380
the device to make the change okay right

1683
01:02:28,380 --> 01:02:30,720
it doesn't have to be super complex

1684
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:33,480
uh and of course we don't do a whole lot

1685
01:02:33,480 --> 01:02:35,940
of stuff manually uh sorry automatically

1686
01:02:35,940 --> 01:02:38,280
uh so we have an analyst review and

1687
01:02:38,280 --> 01:02:39,960
approve to make sure that we're not

1688
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:42,540
requesting weird stuff

1689
01:02:42,540 --> 01:02:44,520
um and then we go ahead and approve it

1690
01:02:44,520 --> 01:02:46,740
and we execute the command

1691
01:02:46,740 --> 01:02:48,780
nice

1692
01:02:48,780 --> 01:02:51,540
any any questions on how you do that or

1693
01:02:51,540 --> 01:02:53,099
comments or wanting to know more about

1694
01:02:53,099 --> 01:02:55,760
how we did that

1695
01:03:09,480 --> 01:03:11,640
uh and and

1696
01:03:11,640 --> 01:03:15,000
oh thank you so uh

1697
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,520
I'm calling from a a ethical hacking

1698
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:19,140
background and I can tell you I mean

1699
01:03:19,140 --> 01:03:20,520
back doors are created when you're

1700
01:03:20,520 --> 01:03:22,260
creating a code you can uh you know

1701
01:03:22,260 --> 01:03:24,780
leave hooks in the code because you were

1702
01:03:24,780 --> 01:03:27,180
trying to just debug the the code you

1703
01:03:27,180 --> 01:03:28,680
were creating but at the at the end of

1704
01:03:28,680 --> 01:03:30,780
the day they go to production with that

1705
01:03:30,780 --> 01:03:32,880
error isn't that a concern you you might

1706
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:34,680
have and how could you address that

1707
01:03:34,680 --> 01:03:37,040
always I have concerns with everything

1708
01:03:37,040 --> 01:03:40,619
that that we do sometimes uh especially

1709
01:03:40,619 --> 01:03:42,839
when it when it comes to automation uh

1710
01:03:42,839 --> 01:03:45,299
it really comes down to your to the

1711
01:03:45,299 --> 01:03:47,040
organization's risk appetite right like

1712
01:03:47,040 --> 01:03:49,440
this isn't necessarily us going and

1713
01:03:49,440 --> 01:03:51,000
saying hey you should do it this way

1714
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,220
this was the organization going we want

1715
01:03:53,220 --> 01:03:55,319
the process to function like this and I

1716
01:03:55,319 --> 01:03:56,339
go well

1717
01:03:56,339 --> 01:03:58,380
okay as long as you understand the risk

1718
01:03:58,380 --> 01:04:00,660
this is how I would do that

1719
01:04:00,660 --> 01:04:03,299
um you know now to combat like some of

1720
01:04:03,299 --> 01:04:04,559
the things that you're saying like again

1721
01:04:04,559 --> 01:04:06,900
it depends on how that organization's

1722
01:04:06,900 --> 01:04:09,059
risk is like sometimes it's no we don't

1723
01:04:09,059 --> 01:04:10,260
want to stop the work we just want to

1724
01:04:10,260 --> 01:04:12,960
get it done right like I I work at an

1725
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:14,940
organization that operates like that uh

1726
01:04:14,940 --> 01:04:17,400
it's at times right it the we just need

1727
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:18,660
to make sure we get it done it's an

1728
01:04:18,660 --> 01:04:20,280
engineering mindset

1729
01:04:20,280 --> 01:04:22,079
um right and that's where cyber security

1730
01:04:22,079 --> 01:04:23,819
people like ourselves have to then go

1731
01:04:23,819 --> 01:04:27,359
awesome okay cool maybe we'll do it that

1732
01:04:27,359 --> 01:04:29,339
way but if we do do it that way then we

1733
01:04:29,339 --> 01:04:31,140
have to have some sort of process after

1734
01:04:31,140 --> 01:04:33,480
the fact that we go through uh and we

1735
01:04:33,480 --> 01:04:35,760
you know audit all of the changes that

1736
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:36,960
have happened to make sure that they're

1737
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:37,980
legit

1738
01:04:37,980 --> 01:04:39,299
right

1739
01:04:39,299 --> 01:04:40,740
um especially if you can't necessarily

1740
01:04:40,740 --> 01:04:43,559
fit all of that audit into you know I I

1741
01:04:43,559 --> 01:04:45,540
say analysts right that one little blue

1742
01:04:45,540 --> 01:04:48,059
box might be 15 people

1743
01:04:48,059 --> 01:04:49,680
um right that that are all looking at

1744
01:04:49,680 --> 01:04:51,660
this that say yes you know you can go

1745
01:04:51,660 --> 01:04:52,859
push the button

1746
01:04:52,859 --> 01:04:54,900
um or it could just be one individual it

1747
01:04:54,900 --> 01:04:56,700
depends on the org

1748
01:04:56,700 --> 01:04:58,680
um but uh but yeah I mean that's how I

1749
01:04:58,680 --> 01:05:00,119
would I would combat that either you're

1750
01:05:00,119 --> 01:05:02,099
trying to fit it in into that that Loop

1751
01:05:02,099 --> 01:05:04,559
there or you're catching it during an

1752
01:05:04,559 --> 01:05:05,460
audit

1753
01:05:05,460 --> 01:05:06,780
and so hopefully you have all those

1754
01:05:06,780 --> 01:05:09,420
things that's why this types of

1755
01:05:09,420 --> 01:05:12,119
of platform is really not for low

1756
01:05:12,119 --> 01:05:14,400
maturity organizations they'll quickly

1757
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:16,260
find themselves in trouble

1758
01:05:16,260 --> 01:05:18,420
um because you know a lot of times

1759
01:05:18,420 --> 01:05:20,400
there's a drive right

1760
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:21,839
um you know I think probably everywhere

1761
01:05:21,839 --> 01:05:24,119
but you definitely see it with utilities

1762
01:05:24,119 --> 01:05:25,619
where they're they're trying to remove

1763
01:05:25,619 --> 01:05:29,220
that that human you know Capital part uh

1764
01:05:29,220 --> 01:05:30,720
right because it lowers costs they don't

1765
01:05:30,720 --> 01:05:32,640
have to pay as much it's that whole

1766
01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:33,299
um

1767
01:05:33,299 --> 01:05:35,880
uh you know budgetary stuff that uh

1768
01:05:35,880 --> 01:05:38,220
that's not necessarily my realm but

1769
01:05:38,220 --> 01:05:39,720
um but that's that's what we want to see

1770
01:05:39,720 --> 01:05:42,180
and at low maturity places like it's

1771
01:05:42,180 --> 01:05:44,899
common to see

1772
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:46,859
I hate to say it this way but I've come

1773
01:05:46,859 --> 01:05:48,180
across places where the guy that was

1774
01:05:48,180 --> 01:05:51,240
managing EIT Was the janitor too

1775
01:05:51,240 --> 01:05:54,180
um like it uh and no we don't we haven't

1776
01:05:54,180 --> 01:05:55,859
we haven't rebooted that machine in 17

1777
01:05:55,859 --> 01:05:57,299
years because we don't we don't know if

1778
01:05:57,299 --> 01:05:59,040
it'll come back uh well that's not good

1779
01:05:59,040 --> 01:06:00,299
that's a whole other problem that we

1780
01:06:00,299 --> 01:06:02,339
should probably look at at some point

1781
01:06:02,339 --> 01:06:04,559
um because expect that it's never going

1782
01:06:04,559 --> 01:06:07,980
to go off is is yeah it's a fallacy

1783
01:06:07,980 --> 01:06:09,359
um at some point it's going to go bump

1784
01:06:09,359 --> 01:06:10,799
into nine and you're going to be you

1785
01:06:10,799 --> 01:06:12,720
know up up a creek

1786
01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:14,460
um but uh but that that's common right

1787
01:06:14,460 --> 01:06:17,940
and so this type of solution is not for

1788
01:06:17,940 --> 01:06:20,220
them not yet right

1789
01:06:20,220 --> 01:06:21,660
um there's just a lot of things to think

1790
01:06:21,660 --> 01:06:23,040
about just like the things that you've

1791
01:06:23,040 --> 01:06:25,020
brought up that exists throughout all of

1792
01:06:25,020 --> 01:06:26,579
it right how do we audit the the

1793
01:06:26,579 --> 01:06:28,440
automation that's happening how do we

1794
01:06:28,440 --> 01:06:30,180
make sure that

1795
01:06:30,180 --> 01:06:32,099
the tool we put in to help us hasn't

1796
01:06:32,099 --> 01:06:34,819
been compromised

1797
01:06:38,460 --> 01:06:40,619
do you have like connectors or you know

1798
01:06:40,619 --> 01:06:42,420
any kind of implementation to go to the

1799
01:06:42,420 --> 01:06:44,160
Security Solutions you we might have in

1800
01:06:44,160 --> 01:06:46,740
OT like I don't know nosomi or or you

1801
01:06:46,740 --> 01:06:48,480
know channel that are creating a

1802
01:06:48,480 --> 01:06:50,880
baseline or of what's already happening

1803
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:52,619
or what passes of communications do we

1804
01:06:52,619 --> 01:06:54,000
have I mean do you have like an

1805
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:57,000
orchestrator or orchestrated response or

1806
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:58,920
connectors to those Solutions so to let

1807
01:06:58,920 --> 01:07:00,539
them know that you know what traffic

1808
01:07:00,539 --> 01:07:01,920
might be coming this way or traffic

1809
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:04,319
might be traveling from this point to

1810
01:07:04,319 --> 01:07:05,819
that to that point and that's a normal

1811
01:07:05,819 --> 01:07:07,619
thing right now for us

1812
01:07:07,619 --> 01:07:11,579
yeah no I mean so one your connectors

1813
01:07:11,579 --> 01:07:13,920
depends on the platform that you use uh

1814
01:07:13,920 --> 01:07:16,559
right this is a platform agnostic we do

1815
01:07:16,559 --> 01:07:18,240
do a lot of swim Lane deployments just

1816
01:07:18,240 --> 01:07:20,039
to put the plug out there

1817
01:07:20,039 --> 01:07:21,359
um but

1818
01:07:21,359 --> 01:07:24,180
really it depends on your requirements

1819
01:07:24,180 --> 01:07:25,740
right and a lot of times that comes down

1820
01:07:25,740 --> 01:07:28,500
to what pre-existing plugins exist right

1821
01:07:28,500 --> 01:07:29,940
so when you're going you're looking at a

1822
01:07:29,940 --> 01:07:32,700
solution now I also say a lot of vendors

1823
01:07:32,700 --> 01:07:34,559
especially like swim Lane themselves

1824
01:07:34,559 --> 01:07:36,780
they'll help you write your own plugins

1825
01:07:36,780 --> 01:07:38,940
um if they if one doesn't exist but

1826
01:07:38,940 --> 01:07:40,799
again it comes down to what am I

1827
01:07:40,799 --> 01:07:42,480
integrating with and what platform has

1828
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:44,880
the Integrations that I I need right and

1829
01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:46,559
what are my timetables do I have time to

1830
01:07:46,559 --> 01:07:48,839
wait for a plug-in to be created uh or

1831
01:07:48,839 --> 01:07:51,660
do I need it tomorrow right and that

1832
01:07:51,660 --> 01:07:52,859
comes down sometimes to your project

1833
01:07:52,859 --> 01:07:54,119
managers and how they're running the

1834
01:07:54,119 --> 01:07:55,980
projects but

1835
01:07:55,980 --> 01:07:57,359
um again that that would be part of your

1836
01:07:57,359 --> 01:07:58,859
Source selection process on what

1837
01:07:58,859 --> 01:08:00,900
Integrations are there at the end of the

1838
01:08:00,900 --> 01:08:02,819
day it's a coding platform so if you've

1839
01:08:02,819 --> 01:08:05,579
got coding a coding background you don't

1840
01:08:05,579 --> 01:08:06,960
necessarily need a plug-in you can just

1841
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:08,819
make it work yourself true the plugins

1842
01:08:08,819 --> 01:08:10,440
just make it easier that's part of the

1843
01:08:10,440 --> 01:08:13,500
low code aspect of it right but just

1844
01:08:13,500 --> 01:08:14,880
because it's low code doesn't mean it

1845
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:18,000
can't be high code uh it can be you you

1846
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:19,439
can say screw that I don't want any of

1847
01:08:19,439 --> 01:08:20,580
the plugins I'm going to write them all

1848
01:08:20,580 --> 01:08:22,439
myself and then you could do that I

1849
01:08:22,439 --> 01:08:23,880
wouldn't recommend it

1850
01:08:23,880 --> 01:08:25,140
um but you could definitely do something

1851
01:08:25,140 --> 01:08:27,120
like that so in that event you can make

1852
01:08:27,120 --> 01:08:28,859
it work however you want so you could go

1853
01:08:28,859 --> 01:08:31,198
and notify those tools yep I mean say

1854
01:08:31,198 --> 01:08:32,460
hey look this is this is new traffic

1855
01:08:32,460 --> 01:08:34,920
that's being brought in maybe we want to

1856
01:08:34,920 --> 01:08:36,540
monitor this a little more so maybe

1857
01:08:36,540 --> 01:08:39,120
we'll go and turn on our Taps you know

1858
01:08:39,120 --> 01:08:40,920
at our at our firewalls or switch and

1859
01:08:40,920 --> 01:08:42,299
start dumping the traffic so we can have

1860
01:08:42,299 --> 01:08:43,920
a better audit of what's happening I

1861
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:45,479
mean there's just the the possibilities

1862
01:08:45,479 --> 01:08:47,698
are kind of endless

1863
01:08:47,698 --> 01:08:51,439
yeah great question by the way

1864
01:08:53,160 --> 01:08:56,819
So Soft isolation in in ICS

1865
01:08:56,819 --> 01:08:59,339
right I would never advocate for full

1866
01:08:59,339 --> 01:09:01,979
isolation inside an ICS environment you

1867
01:09:01,979 --> 01:09:03,719
will break stuff

1868
01:09:03,719 --> 01:09:06,140
um you will probably lose your job

1869
01:09:06,140 --> 01:09:08,819
uh other things right so

1870
01:09:08,819 --> 01:09:10,859
um but a lot of times what's what what

1871
01:09:10,859 --> 01:09:13,259
can be uh overlooked is what would be

1872
01:09:13,259 --> 01:09:16,920
called a soft isolation uh right uh this

1873
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:19,020
uh wasn't invented by us this was a

1874
01:09:19,020 --> 01:09:20,640
customer request

1875
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:22,620
um and so we really worked with them on

1876
01:09:22,620 --> 01:09:25,080
how they wanted this to be implemented

1877
01:09:25,080 --> 01:09:27,000
and how they felt comfortable doing it

1878
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,219
so again it's it's the same map it's

1879
01:09:29,219 --> 01:09:31,259
just a again

1880
01:09:31,259 --> 01:09:34,738
show that networks can be complex but in

1881
01:09:34,738 --> 01:09:37,500
a soft isolation scenario right we're

1882
01:09:37,500 --> 01:09:40,500
doing our Sim pulling an alert comes in

1883
01:09:40,500 --> 01:09:41,839
we parse that

1884
01:09:41,839 --> 01:09:45,299
we checked we built a safe list

1885
01:09:45,299 --> 01:09:47,580
right so these are devices that were

1886
01:09:47,580 --> 01:09:48,738
comfortable

1887
01:09:48,738 --> 01:09:51,960
soft isolating right so that that was a

1888
01:09:51,960 --> 01:09:53,640
double check we're not just blanket

1889
01:09:53,640 --> 01:09:55,860
isolating everything on the device sorry

1890
01:09:55,860 --> 01:09:57,900
on the network these are the devices

1891
01:09:57,900 --> 01:10:01,440
that we've okayed for this process

1892
01:10:01,440 --> 01:10:03,179
does it add a lot of work yes you've got

1893
01:10:03,179 --> 01:10:04,320
to go and you've got to create that list

1894
01:10:04,320 --> 01:10:06,420
you've got to maintain it but in an

1895
01:10:06,420 --> 01:10:07,800
environment

1896
01:10:07,800 --> 01:10:10,739
um in in especially in OT environments

1897
01:10:10,739 --> 01:10:12,360
it's it's critical right you we want to

1898
01:10:12,360 --> 01:10:14,100
operate from an approved list not

1899
01:10:14,100 --> 01:10:17,699
necessarily from uh from a you know

1900
01:10:17,699 --> 01:10:20,219
um a blacklist type of thing right so uh

1901
01:10:20,219 --> 01:10:22,560
we would rather approve that this can be

1902
01:10:22,560 --> 01:10:24,360
isolated than

1903
01:10:24,360 --> 01:10:26,219
um say that uh you know these are the

1904
01:10:26,219 --> 01:10:27,659
only devices that you can isolate

1905
01:10:27,659 --> 01:10:28,560
because then you're going to miss that

1906
01:10:28,560 --> 01:10:30,239
right you're going to miss those right

1907
01:10:30,239 --> 01:10:32,280
so there's a better approval process

1908
01:10:32,280 --> 01:10:33,900
typically when you put a white list in

1909
01:10:33,900 --> 01:10:36,780
place so again in this scenario we're

1910
01:10:36,780 --> 01:10:39,600
checking to see if the device is on the

1911
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:41,640
safe list and then we're checking for

1912
01:10:41,640 --> 01:10:45,420
our isolate criteria right so cool this

1913
01:10:45,420 --> 01:10:48,300
is a a Sim alert we've parsed it it's on

1914
01:10:48,300 --> 01:10:49,560
the white list

1915
01:10:49,560 --> 01:10:51,900
doesn't match our criteria

1916
01:10:51,900 --> 01:10:54,480
right for isolating right so

1917
01:10:54,480 --> 01:10:57,140
um that's really organization defined

1918
01:10:57,140 --> 01:11:00,480
in this case it had to do uh with

1919
01:11:00,480 --> 01:11:01,920
certain URLs that they were clicking on

1920
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:04,020
but again it can be anything that's

1921
01:11:04,020 --> 01:11:06,540
really to your process and how you want

1922
01:11:06,540 --> 01:11:07,800
to automate that

1923
01:11:07,800 --> 01:11:10,199
um and then from there uh what we did is

1924
01:11:10,199 --> 01:11:13,560
we would check to see okay is this

1925
01:11:13,560 --> 01:11:16,080
something that we block at the firewall

1926
01:11:16,080 --> 01:11:19,560
cool it is we go and we we maybe isolate

1927
01:11:19,560 --> 01:11:21,960
that device from the internet right if

1928
01:11:21,960 --> 01:11:24,900
it has connectivity to the internet

1929
01:11:24,900 --> 01:11:27,480
um you know does it have maybe remote

1930
01:11:27,480 --> 01:11:28,620
access

1931
01:11:28,620 --> 01:11:30,719
um that's not mandatory for it to stay

1932
01:11:30,719 --> 01:11:32,159
operational right it's important that

1933
01:11:32,159 --> 01:11:34,199
what we're doing is we're keeping device

1934
01:11:34,199 --> 01:11:36,120
in an operational State as best as we

1935
01:11:36,120 --> 01:11:37,860
can but then isolating it from anything

1936
01:11:37,860 --> 01:11:41,699
else that it doesn't have to have

1937
01:11:41,699 --> 01:11:43,679
right so like a lot of times you'll find

1938
01:11:43,679 --> 01:11:46,080
environments like maybe a historian

1939
01:11:46,080 --> 01:11:48,360
maybe has connectivity into the

1940
01:11:48,360 --> 01:11:49,980
corporate Network you know for whatever

1941
01:11:49,980 --> 01:11:51,659
accounting purposes for ordering

1942
01:11:51,659 --> 01:11:52,920
equipment whatever whatever have you

1943
01:11:52,920 --> 01:11:54,659
maybe there's a process that ties over

1944
01:11:54,659 --> 01:11:57,000
there that connection doesn't have to be

1945
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:58,679
there in order for the historian to do

1946
01:11:58,679 --> 01:12:01,380
its job right you can you can tie back

1947
01:12:01,380 --> 01:12:02,760
into that right so we're talking about

1948
01:12:02,760 --> 01:12:05,219
keeping the process alive I mean

1949
01:12:05,219 --> 01:12:07,380
blocking off anything that's just a nice

1950
01:12:07,380 --> 01:12:08,520
to have

1951
01:12:08,520 --> 01:12:10,260
right so a lot of those things might be

1952
01:12:10,260 --> 01:12:12,960
remote access for maintenance right if

1953
01:12:12,960 --> 01:12:14,340
we're not currently doing maintenance

1954
01:12:14,340 --> 01:12:17,280
right now we probably don't need that on

1955
01:12:17,280 --> 01:12:18,900
right we can go ahead and block it you

1956
01:12:18,900 --> 01:12:21,179
should be probably blocking that anyway

1957
01:12:21,179 --> 01:12:23,100
um but uh there's there's how it should

1958
01:12:23,100 --> 01:12:26,100
be done and in reality uh and so right

1959
01:12:26,100 --> 01:12:28,260
we can go and we can block remote access

1960
01:12:28,260 --> 01:12:31,199
uh if there's uh you know some sort of a

1961
01:12:31,199 --> 01:12:33,060
host based firewall on the device we can

1962
01:12:33,060 --> 01:12:35,040
go and maybe enable that as well

1963
01:12:35,040 --> 01:12:37,020
um and block additional things

1964
01:12:37,020 --> 01:12:38,640
um again it's important that you're

1965
01:12:38,640 --> 01:12:40,739
taking a hard look at what's needed for

1966
01:12:40,739 --> 01:12:43,440
the process to stay alive uh that that

1967
01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:45,239
physical process that you're automating

1968
01:12:45,239 --> 01:12:48,360
and in only eliminating the things that

1969
01:12:48,360 --> 01:12:50,040
are nice to haves that you find in a lot

1970
01:12:50,040 --> 01:12:51,360
of environments

1971
01:12:51,360 --> 01:12:53,340
is there questions around

1972
01:12:53,340 --> 01:12:55,080
soft isolation we're kind of running out

1973
01:12:55,080 --> 01:12:57,559
of time but

1974
01:13:00,120 --> 01:13:01,320
cool

1975
01:13:01,320 --> 01:13:03,120
Asset Management

1976
01:13:03,120 --> 01:13:05,300
right it's not a commonly talked about

1977
01:13:05,300 --> 01:13:07,500
scenario but it is one that definitely

1978
01:13:07,500 --> 01:13:09,060
fits

1979
01:13:09,060 --> 01:13:12,600
um inside of an OT uh use case of really

1980
01:13:12,600 --> 01:13:16,980
any uh even in a pure I.T scenario right

1981
01:13:16,980 --> 01:13:19,140
so here this is a a little bit of a

1982
01:13:19,140 --> 01:13:20,699
longer one

1983
01:13:20,699 --> 01:13:21,540
um

1984
01:13:21,540 --> 01:13:25,020
right so again we we went and uh created

1985
01:13:25,020 --> 01:13:27,239
a portal for

1986
01:13:27,239 --> 01:13:30,420
um Engineers or really any sort of the

1987
01:13:30,420 --> 01:13:31,860
defined user base that within this

1988
01:13:31,860 --> 01:13:33,960
organization could go and and request

1989
01:13:33,960 --> 01:13:36,300
new equipment uh it's so happened that

1990
01:13:36,300 --> 01:13:38,460
we use SharePoint sharepoint's pretty uh

1991
01:13:38,460 --> 01:13:40,980
prevalent in most organizations so

1992
01:13:40,980 --> 01:13:43,199
there's a form that was built user goes

1993
01:13:43,199 --> 01:13:44,699
out and requests a new piece of

1994
01:13:44,699 --> 01:13:47,159
equipment uh so sometimes that can be as

1995
01:13:47,159 --> 01:13:49,020
complicated as a new substation

1996
01:13:49,020 --> 01:13:51,480
deployment this is actually modeled off

1997
01:13:51,480 --> 01:13:52,800
after that

1998
01:13:52,800 --> 01:13:55,440
uh where that SharePoint request would

1999
01:13:55,440 --> 01:13:57,300
then go out and create the servicenow

2000
01:13:57,300 --> 01:13:59,940
procurement uh tickets uh for

2001
01:13:59,940 --> 01:14:01,260
procurement to go out and actually

2002
01:14:01,260 --> 01:14:03,239
acquire all the hardware

2003
01:14:03,239 --> 01:14:04,679
um we didn't I'm not going to talk about

2004
01:14:04,679 --> 01:14:06,600
the procurement process itself because

2005
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:07,980
that's not really what asset management

2006
01:14:07,980 --> 01:14:10,020
is necessarily about at least from the

2007
01:14:10,020 --> 01:14:13,080
the context that we've taken it

2008
01:14:13,080 --> 01:14:14,940
um all we were doing was creating a

2009
01:14:14,940 --> 01:14:17,100
ticket for procurement to go and order

2010
01:14:17,100 --> 01:14:19,380
their equipment and then we waited until

2011
01:14:19,380 --> 01:14:21,719
you know we got a status that the

2012
01:14:21,719 --> 01:14:23,940
equipment has actually been received

2013
01:14:23,940 --> 01:14:27,060
and then from there once that uh status

2014
01:14:27,060 --> 01:14:28,920
was set we went out and had to create

2015
01:14:28,920 --> 01:14:31,199
multiple tickets and this is where I

2016
01:14:31,199 --> 01:14:32,100
kind of joke about that ticket

2017
01:14:32,100 --> 01:14:34,140
management system where we're managing

2018
01:14:34,140 --> 01:14:36,300
clients ticket systems but we're

2019
01:14:36,300 --> 01:14:38,340
creating those

2020
01:14:38,340 --> 01:14:40,320
um required servicenow tickets for the

2021
01:14:40,320 --> 01:14:42,300
different groups right so there was ones

2022
01:14:42,300 --> 01:14:44,460
for the server team uh one's for the

2023
01:14:44,460 --> 01:14:45,900
engineering teams and then we had to

2024
01:14:45,900 --> 01:14:48,060
always create one uh for the network

2025
01:14:48,060 --> 01:14:49,199
team

2026
01:14:49,199 --> 01:14:51,420
right so depending on whether or not it

2027
01:14:51,420 --> 01:14:54,420
was an I.T device or uh or an ICS device

2028
01:14:54,420 --> 01:14:55,739
would depend on whether it would go to

2029
01:14:55,739 --> 01:14:57,840
engineering or their server team but

2030
01:14:57,840 --> 01:14:59,900
again that can be modeled after whatever

2031
01:14:59,900 --> 01:15:02,580
you guys have implemented

2032
01:15:02,580 --> 01:15:04,980
within the organization but after that

2033
01:15:04,980 --> 01:15:07,860
writer goes to the approval processes

2034
01:15:07,860 --> 01:15:08,940
um

2035
01:15:08,940 --> 01:15:11,219
and once the responsible parties have

2036
01:15:11,219 --> 01:15:13,980
finished provisioning swimling monitors

2037
01:15:13,980 --> 01:15:16,620
for that provisional status and so once

2038
01:15:16,620 --> 01:15:18,719
that's completed we then ran through

2039
01:15:18,719 --> 01:15:21,360
several Baseline checks so right we went

2040
01:15:21,360 --> 01:15:22,980
out and we pulled

2041
01:15:22,980 --> 01:15:25,380
um the baseline from tripwire if it was

2042
01:15:25,380 --> 01:15:28,140
baselineable by tripwire we made sure

2043
01:15:28,140 --> 01:15:29,940
that it was registered in the correct

2044
01:15:29,940 --> 01:15:32,880
groups in the Sim we then checked to see

2045
01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:35,280
if Cloud strike agents were deployed if

2046
01:15:35,280 --> 01:15:37,280
it was appropriate for the device

2047
01:15:37,280 --> 01:15:39,239
and then we did some functional

2048
01:15:39,239 --> 01:15:42,780
checkings across the Sim as well you

2049
01:15:42,780 --> 01:15:44,460
know a lot of times they would trigger

2050
01:15:44,460 --> 01:15:47,159
40 field log-ons on purpose and then

2051
01:15:47,159 --> 01:15:48,360
they would wait and see if that

2052
01:15:48,360 --> 01:15:50,520
triggered inside of their Sim and then

2053
01:15:50,520 --> 01:15:52,020
if it did that's how they validated that

2054
01:15:52,020 --> 01:15:53,239
it was working

2055
01:15:53,239 --> 01:15:55,440
that's kind of it in a nutshell we ran

2056
01:15:55,440 --> 01:15:58,020
out of time I do apologize for that but

2057
01:15:58,020 --> 01:15:59,580
is there any final questions

2058
01:15:59,580 --> 01:16:02,520
before we wrap up

2059
01:16:02,520 --> 01:16:06,440
all right and oh question over here yes

2060
01:16:07,080 --> 01:16:08,340
I think they're going to bring you the

2061
01:16:08,340 --> 01:16:10,380
mic real quick hold on

2062
01:16:10,380 --> 01:16:12,300
make it easier to hear

2063
01:16:12,300 --> 01:16:14,100
a quick question for you it's like

2064
01:16:14,100 --> 01:16:15,780
fishing right is there anything that you

2065
01:16:15,780 --> 01:16:18,120
that really differs it versus OT or it's

2066
01:16:18,120 --> 01:16:19,860
it's just generic

2067
01:16:19,860 --> 01:16:21,659
you need to keep in mind is there

2068
01:16:21,659 --> 01:16:23,100
anything the difference between a

2069
01:16:23,100 --> 01:16:26,820
phishing use case for ICS versus it I do

2070
01:16:26,820 --> 01:16:29,420
with OT versus versus not

2071
01:16:29,420 --> 01:16:31,040
[Applause]

2072
01:16:31,040 --> 01:16:33,780
particularly right like

2073
01:16:33,780 --> 01:16:35,580
um a lot of times if you're doing it

2074
01:16:35,580 --> 01:16:36,900
right like you're not you shouldn't be

2075
01:16:36,900 --> 01:16:38,640
checking email inside of a OT

2076
01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:40,739
environment right I know it happens yeah

2077
01:16:40,739 --> 01:16:43,260
uh we do it all the time or not not we I

2078
01:16:43,260 --> 01:16:45,179
just gotta say I don't smack him I don't

2079
01:16:45,179 --> 01:16:48,060
ever do that no I don't ever do that but

2080
01:16:48,060 --> 01:16:50,159
like like a lot of times like

2081
01:16:50,159 --> 01:16:52,500
you know the engineers will check their

2082
01:16:52,500 --> 01:16:54,179
their Gmail accounts or follow up to

2083
01:16:54,179 --> 01:16:55,500
Corporate email

2084
01:16:55,500 --> 01:16:57,060
um it's really all the same system right

2085
01:16:57,060 --> 01:16:58,020
because at the end of the day we're

2086
01:16:58,020 --> 01:17:00,179
interfacing with the systems that are

2087
01:17:00,179 --> 01:17:02,640
providing that uh service

2088
01:17:02,640 --> 01:17:04,800
um that that email service and so

2089
01:17:04,800 --> 01:17:06,480
um assuming that you've orchestrated it

2090
01:17:06,480 --> 01:17:08,340
correctly like it doesn't there they

2091
01:17:08,340 --> 01:17:10,080
shouldn't matter too much yeah right

2092
01:17:10,080 --> 01:17:11,580
because the nuances are whether or not

2093
01:17:11,580 --> 01:17:13,620
in my mind you should be checking email

2094
01:17:13,620 --> 01:17:15,780
from an OT environment

2095
01:17:15,780 --> 01:17:17,159
um yeah but

2096
01:17:17,159 --> 01:17:18,360
yep

2097
01:17:18,360 --> 01:17:21,420
yeah bottom line there is I mean there

2098
01:17:21,420 --> 01:17:24,120
should not be any difference but as

2099
01:17:24,120 --> 01:17:25,920
we've kind of Illustrated here you can

2100
01:17:25,920 --> 01:17:27,540
build it however you need to

2101
01:17:27,540 --> 01:17:29,400
personally on the cyber security side of

2102
01:17:29,400 --> 01:17:30,600
things I'm going to default back to what

2103
01:17:30,600 --> 01:17:32,040
Josh has said it would just don't be

2104
01:17:32,040 --> 01:17:33,780
doing that in the first place but it

2105
01:17:33,780 --> 01:17:35,760
does happen yeah great question

2106
01:17:35,760 --> 01:17:37,679
all right if we have other I know we're

2107
01:17:37,679 --> 01:17:39,420
running behind on time here so if we

2108
01:17:39,420 --> 01:17:40,800
have any other questions don't hesitate

2109
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:43,080
to grab uh myself or Josh we'll be glad

2110
01:17:43,080 --> 01:17:45,060
to answer those thank you for uh being

2111
01:17:45,060 --> 01:17:48,620
here for our talk appreciate it

2112
01:17:48,960 --> 01:17:51,960
foreign
