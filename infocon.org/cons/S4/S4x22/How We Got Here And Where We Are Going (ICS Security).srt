1
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:06,480
thanks and good afternoon

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:07,520
um

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:09,760
i talked a little bit if you saw my

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,360
morning talk i talked a little bit about

5
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,840
this i use this very often

6
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:15,679
when i talk to customers and i'm going

7
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:16,960
to repeat a few things i said this

8
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,680
morning so apologies but

9
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,439
you know the the biggest challenge i

10
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:23,840
think most of us face is if you're an

11
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,599
asset owner is

12
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:28,080
you know securing budget for cyber

13
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,160
security activities right and and i look

14
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,238
at this i've used this for a long time

15
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:34,000
this upside down pyramid right is

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,399
there's there's this uh this idea

17
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:38,239
depending on upon the size of your

18
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:40,000
organization of you know hundreds of

19
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,320
millions of dollars that are the revenue

20
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,879
is generated by you know perhaps tens of

21
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:46,800
millions of dollars of assets of various

22
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,920
kinds uh run by employees that are you

23
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,840
know absorbed ones of millions of

24
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,399
dollars of payroll uh

25
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:57,199
and and you know but we can't find tens

26
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:00,000
of thousands of dollars you know to to

27
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,800
invest in proper networks or proper

28
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,199
cyber security and

29
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:08,000
you know we can't find like the one guy

30
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,439
to do this

31
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:11,520
and so sort of by

32
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,960
default

33
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,159
you know and i just talk about this a

34
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:16,400
lot right you you end up as a

35
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,159
automation controls guy or gal um

36
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:22,320
you know wearing a lot of hats

37
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,520
and so

38
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,799
you know some of the things i'll talk

39
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:26,960
about today hopefully might help you you

40
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,280
know in this quest and and

41
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,240
we'll discuss some other things um now

42
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,759
this beginning is we're going to kind of

43
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:35,920
walk through this quickly uh been

44
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,439
covering a lot of different ways a lot

45
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:39,119
of different places

46
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:41,520
almost assuredly all of them better than

47
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,600
me right but

48
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,910
the net net of the problem

49
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:46,079
[Music]

50
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:48,560
back at oldsmere was

51
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,560
you know this thing i talk about a lot

52
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,600
which is shared passwords or really bad

53
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,000
password hygiene and

54
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,520
you know marty talked this morning a bit

55
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,759
about hygiene and and it's a somewhat of

56
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:01,520
a discussion especially when you get

57
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,079
around patching and so forth but i think

58
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:06,719
or i hope we could all agree that

59
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,399
that's not as much of an issue when it

60
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:11,920
comes to identity and

61
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,840
again the problem here

62
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,080
not a hundred percent clear but

63
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,040
passwords were leaked right the

64
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,520
dark web sort of found some passwords

65
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,840
that might have been oldsmurs

66
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,160
they used an old vulnerable version of

67
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,760
teamviewer which seems to be the bane of

68
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,080
a lot of people's existence uh of course

69
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,840
they use an old version of windows right

70
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,080
i mean this is a this is a very common

71
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,280
story

72
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,800
that quite frankly can be fixed pretty

73
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,519
easily just by the very simple

74
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:41,519
capability to say everybody should have

75
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:43,040
a username everybody should have a

76
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,519
password you know things we've done sort

77
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:47,599
of on the other side in infosec or for a

78
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:49,840
long time

79
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,319
you know sort of very similar for the

80
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:54,800
colonial pipeline which has got so much

81
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,720
attention right and

82
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,760
by the way

83
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,840
if this happens again don't use plastic

84
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,840
bags to carry gasoline please

85
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,760
um common sense ain't sound common as

86
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,159
they say but yeah the root sort of the

87
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:10,239
root cause there very much was similar

88
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:12,800
idea there was a vpn the password is

89
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,480
compromised

90
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:17,599
probably due to manual synchronization

91
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:20,159
i hate to say i'm occasionally in my

92
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:22,080
personal life you know

93
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,239
do that because it's easier

94
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:26,640
but you know i don't do it at work

95
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,720
and and the account really wasn't even

96
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,959
any longer in use but you know remained

97
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:33,120
active so again sort of the same

98
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,440
thing that we see over and over a pretty

99
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,360
simple policy

100
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,480
change

101
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,760
that

102
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,840
you know quite frankly is has been

103
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,040
something that by and large on by t side

104
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,799
for a long time

105
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:48,879
we need to we need to take the best of

106
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:51,040
these policies and procedures and and

107
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,680
use them right i'm not saying we need to

108
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,599
intake all of them

109
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:58,159
but we need to be better at you know

110
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:00,640
taking on the activities that our

111
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,879
brethren on the carpeted space have used

112
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:04,799
for years and

113
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:06,560
you know use them to good effect right

114
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,280
so and and again you probably know this

115
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,280
right it wasn't even necessarily the

116
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,680
operations were compromised but it

117
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,040
appears that

118
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,720
they couldn't bill people for the stuff

119
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,160
they shipped down the pipeline so they

120
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,000
had to shut it down

121
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
i mean they're in business to make money

122
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,560
you can't fault them for that so

123
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,040
lots of talk really then about how

124
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,440
we continue to to have the convergence

125
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,040
and again depending on your maturity

126
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,080
model

127
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,520
those are different places for different

128
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,840
people but we do need to be a little

129
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,080
more selective and

130
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,320
jbs uh you know another big one that

131
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,639
we've all talked about uh

132
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:44,880
fewer details on sort of root cause that

133
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,040
i've been able to see

134
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,720
it is possible that they got again

135
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,880
passwords off the dark web

136
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:54,240
team viewer again maybe a

137
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,720
issue um

138
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,800
so yeah

139
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,520
very common threats right and and even

140
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,280
you know and we work at tenable right so

141
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,639
vulnerability takes on a lot of

142
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,880
different kinds of meanings and so many

143
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,320
of us classically think of a very

144
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,160
technical vulnerability that has to do

145
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,919
with maybe poorly written code and

146
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:14,880
you know

147
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,479
if we look at it from the broader

148
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:18,479
perspective and the broader

149
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:20,880
definition it's really about

150
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,560
vulnerabilities that we create by

151
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,919
you know poor

152
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:27,600
process for

153
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,880
you know poor execution right so a bit

154
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,560
of the rest of the talk really is kind

155
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:36,080
of based on this cesa document um it is

156
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,880
more around you know what can we do

157
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,680
i've talked kind of for a long time

158
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,320
about various things that might stick if

159
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,600
you will is

160
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,440
what can you do for free or what can you

161
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,320
do for

162
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,400
relatively inexpensive and so hopefully

163
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,960
i can give you some advice today

164
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:53,840
uh

165
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:54,960
i

166
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,800
refer to this every once in a while a

167
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,639
friend of mine said this not too long

168
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:00,880
ago he says look a lot of a lot of

169
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,120
people look upon networking and various

170
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,720
technologies as voodoo magic so

171
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,639
you know it isn't

172
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,639
and uh i'm probably preaching a little

173
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:12,880
bit more of the choir today than usual

174
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,000
but

175
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,560
a part of what cesa says and again some

176
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,400
of this is very much taken right from

177
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,199
their

178
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:21,440
notes but i hope to

179
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,759
make it readable or make it more useful

180
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:25,440
but

181
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,600
you know first part of what they say is

182
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,360
you know determine your reliance on i.t

183
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,919
infrastructure right so

184
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:34,639
and i look at that in two ways or maybe

185
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:36,639
a lot of ways and the first and foremost

186
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:38,560
and again because of some of my my

187
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,800
background is

188
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,120
look at your network

189
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,560
please

190
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,080
look at the network that you've built in

191
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,919
ot environments and tell me that it's a

192
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:52,639
you know resilient structure

193
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:54,720
and you know quite frankly i would

194
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,160
challenge you to do that because i've

195
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,880
been in so many places that it isn't

196
00:06:58,880 --> 00:06:59,840
and

197
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,400
a lot of that really is based on

198
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,840
and don't get me wrong when i say the

199
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,479
next thing the

200
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:08,720
the ignorance of sort of the people that

201
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,800
are building those networks to good

202
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,360
network architecture and i use that in

203
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,199
its dictionary term not in its

204
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:17,520
pejorative

205
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,440
you need to you need to sort of educate

206
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,919
and help people that build networks for

207
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:23,919
a living

208
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:25,919
to the requirements right because what i

209
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:28,240
see all the time is

210
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,840
something that was a bluehost network

211
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,240
years ago is now a ethernet network but

212
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,400
they didn't change the topology the

213
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,560
architecture or anything else so

214
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,479
you know that's one of the parts that is

215
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:40,880
reliant and i'm taking this again very

216
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,520
broadly in terms of the way it's defined

217
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,479
but

218
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:47,199
i see people not using capabilities

219
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,199
putting in unmanaged switches right and

220
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:51,599
that was that's always a fun topic to

221
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:53,680
talk about but

222
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,800
because there is this voracious appetite

223
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,199
from sort of the business owners for

224
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:00,960
data and telemetry that comes off the

225
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,160
shop floor

226
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,080
we have to build sort of parallel

227
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,639
networks there right there's this very

228
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:08,960
low latency very mission critical part

229
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,039
of a network where controllers

230
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:13,039
talk to things

231
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:14,800
and then there's this sort of other

232
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,440
network where we have to

233
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:21,520
transfer security telemetry right that's

234
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,000
you know from the tenable ot side

235
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,039
of the

236
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:27,759
coin the biggest challenge i have is how

237
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:31,039
can we you know ingest span traffic and

238
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:32,958
get it to where it needs to go

239
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:35,519
and you know not disrupt

240
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:37,679
the control traffic right so we need to

241
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:39,519
understand that sometimes there's some

242
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,360
investment there and and again more

243
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,958
importantly and from my mind there's an

244
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:45,680
investment in making the network run

245
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,640
um

246
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,560
and and so you know i digress just a

247
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,240
little bit there but a part of what

248
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,600
they're saying there and you guys

249
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,839
probably read most of this already but

250
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:56,480
we really do need to work on creating an

251
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,800
as they call as operated i've always

252
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,360
said as built same thing

253
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,800
but we really need to understand the

254
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,399
physical

255
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:05,920
address right and there's things that we

256
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,680
can do to help that in terms of mapping

257
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,360
out the

258
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,680
conversations that happen between

259
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,760
you know controllers and hmis and all

260
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,600
the various things out there which are

261
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,760
increasingly connected via ethernet

262
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,760
as as well as kind of

263
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,440
at least spitting out enough information

264
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,880
that you can make a physical map which

265
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,959
is probably at least if not more

266
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:28,640
important

267
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,720
and and then how do you operate it and

268
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,800
and so again you know look at your own

269
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,120
operations and see how you do things but

270
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,800
i've certainly walked into many

271
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,640
customers that sort of don't understand

272
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,640
any longer

273
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,440
you know what talks to what

274
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,240
right so if we look at it to say i

275
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,240
have this conversation between these

276
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,959
five devices and then you know not to

277
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:52,800
get too much of a sales hat on

278
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,040
understanding that

279
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,800
is the core principle of then securing

280
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,080
it because if i don't understand the

281
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,839
networking conversation i can't segment

282
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:02,000
the network i can't build in firewalls i

283
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,959
can't build in anything else so again

284
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:07,279
probably maybe

285
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:09,680
over discuss that so you know what's the

286
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:13,040
next what is the real

287
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,760
outcome of those rules it's do an asset

288
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,040
inventory

289
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,959
automate it so that it is kept up to

290
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:20,880
date constantly and understand

291
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,800
dependencies so those are

292
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,839
my sort of real world words around

293
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:27,440
actually a relatively brief cease the

294
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,000
document

295
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,839
i have a couple customers here that

296
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:34,079
actually call

297
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:36,800
the capability to disconnect it and ot

298
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,120
networks their drawbridge strategy and

299
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,120
so i like that right it's

300
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,760
they actually have a sort of a big red

301
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,640
button that they can push they spend a

302
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,399
lot of time and a lot of effort

303
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:50,480
understanding those dependencies but

304
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,320
they've got all the services one way

305
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,680
shape or form mirrored between it and ot

306
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,839
so you know things like dns and active

307
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:00,480
directory and whatever it is they use

308
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,200
so that they can they can flip a switch

309
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,600
and you know literally disconnect those

310
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,760
two things and

311
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,399
uh you know the sisa thing again says

312
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:14,240
manual controls i don't know how

313
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,240
realistic that is you'd have to apply

314
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,519
that to your own

315
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:19,760
environments um i'm not sure that it's

316
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,160
realistic but uh

317
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,839
again that's that's what it says in

318
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:26,640
their document i'm not smart enough to

319
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,560
contend differently than cesa but your

320
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,399
own mileage may vary

321
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:31,440
um

322
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,519
and i chat about this a lot too right

323
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:35,600
and

324
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,560
tabletop exercises are extremely

325
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,480
important and extremely valuable and if

326
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,320
you haven't done one i would i would

327
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,160
challenge you to do so

328
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:44,959
um

329
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:46,560
i always think of them as sort of like

330
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,399
this adult version of dungeon and

331
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:51,120
dragons right but there are

332
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,200
there are actually a couple card decks

333
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,680
out there that you can use and they are

334
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,760
infosec related but i've

335
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,240
i've taken a few and modified them like

336
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,320
to sort of match our requirements before

337
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,800
but it you know it says things like hey

338
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,720
you have a ransomware attack and these

339
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,480
very specific things happened and what

340
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,279
are you going to do and you know what

341
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:13,760
results in that is more than a technical

342
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,440
side it helps you understand your

343
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,800
organization

344
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,880
and you know how are you mapping your

345
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:22,000
incident response plan

346
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,720
into you know the ot side of the

347
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,560
equation now

348
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:29,040
again you may have incident response you

349
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,440
may have tabletop exercises quite often

350
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,639
they are

351
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:36,160
very sort of data center and i.t focused

352
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,120
but

353
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,839
um what you learn or what most of the

354
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:42,399
ones i've been involved learned is

355
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:44,959
um the people don't really understand

356
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:47,279
chain of command or who is capable of

357
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:50,000
making decisions during these you know

358
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,800
chaotic times and so

359
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,320
you know a lot of time is spent over

360
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,079
communicating and there's nothing wrong

361
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:57,760
with that but a lot of times what i've

362
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,720
seen is a lot of arguments arise about

363
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,040
who's in charge right so

364
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,440
um again they say regularly test manual

365
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,120
controls so that critical functions that

366
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,040
can be kept running

367
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,120
i don't see that as being realistic

368
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,800
again i mean

369
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,880
you're basically saying shut off the

370
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,680
plant aren't you

371
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,279
i don't know anybody that thinks that's

372
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:20,480
a great idea

373
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,959
maybe if you've got a maintenance window

374
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:25,120
that would be a cool time to do it but

375
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,560
hey again you know my very simple-minded

376
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,959
response or thought process around this

377
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:33,680
is you know can you build a drawbridge

378
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,920
can you raise the drawbridge

379
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,600
when and how do you sort of raise the

380
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,920
white flag right and again by that i

381
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,880
mean how would you actually react

382
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,560
um

383
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,240
so you know the next part of this again

384
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,160
is you know exercise your incidence

385
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,639
response plan so very closely aligned

386
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:52,560
with what i just said

387
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,600
um i would say again of the things that

388
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:59,440
i can sort of discern and use

389
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,040
and i hate to say i don't see it as much

390
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,360
as i would love is you know where's your

391
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,120
backup

392
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,360
test your backup

393
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,880
i'm almost positive i'm going to get

394
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,880
ahead of the slides now but the thing

395
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,560
i've told many of my customers in so

396
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,320
many different places ways and shapes

397
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:18,959
and forms over the years is build a lab

398
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:21,120
yeah i understand there's an expense

399
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,199
related with building lab i understand

400
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:25,440
that you know from a you know global

401
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,399
perspective or a multi-plan perspective

402
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:30,800
you're not going to build a lab that

403
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,160
simulates

404
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,760
you know millions of dollars worth of

405
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,000
equipment again but i think building a

406
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,560
simple lab and understanding processes

407
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,880
and procedures and what happens when i

408
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,480
do this thing

409
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,320
is extremely valuable when you're

410
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:47,040
talking about you know typical

411
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,800
you know what i've seen is

412
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:52,560
a 20 30 000 worth of equipment sometimes

413
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,199
even a lot less

414
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:57,279
i know the hardware vendors i worked

415
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,720
with it was certainly a thing i

416
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,040
encouraged i worked hard with my

417
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,959
customers to give them

418
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:04,480
a very different kind of discount if

419
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,839
they were willing and able to build a

420
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:07,040
lab

421
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,399
i think that's something that's very

422
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:10,399
doable if you have a good relationship

423
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:12,399
with your your hardware vendors and

424
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:14,399
that's where things like this i can i

425
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:17,839
can exercise those stuff so again um

426
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:20,320
virtualize virtualizes i say this all

427
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,399
the time i say it as often as i can in

428
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:24,959
many different ways as i can and that

429
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:27,279
comes back to yes we need to protect we

430
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:29,680
need to defend but we also have to have

431
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,079
a very clear understanding of when

432
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:34,720
things go very wrong how do i how do i

433
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,040
come back up and

434
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,120
you know if you're like most people i

435
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,759
know you might have windows machines

436
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:43,839
that are out of support

437
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:46,160
they might be very fragile it may have

438
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,240
not gone down in a long time so the

439
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,759
battery for

440
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,120
you know the things that hold the

441
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,040
configuration for the computer may be

442
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,519
gone the more you can virtualize this

443
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:58,480
the more you can back up full images

444
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,880
of the software right of the operating

445
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:01,920
system

446
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,680
build gold images

447
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,040
and that goes right back to being able

448
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,680
to build a lab you know i'm a huge fan

449
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,680
of virtualization i know for some of you

450
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,720
i'm again preaching to the choir um but

451
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,880
i also know for some of you that's not

452
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,120
the case and so

453
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,199
highly encouraged again highly

454
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:21,519
encouraged to build a lab

455
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:23,120
so how do we mitigate

456
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:26,000
right and you know from the standpoint

457
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,839
of risk management from the standpoint

458
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:30,959
of again this whole problem around

459
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:33,199
patching and everything that we have to

460
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:34,800
deal with from a

461
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,440
you know a device level thing or from a

462
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,040
old windows machine that i can't

463
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,600
necessarily patch i mean i i need to

464
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,000
understand how to mitigate and

465
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,120
you know again going back to my

466
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,519
background mitigation is so often a

467
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:49,600
networking thing mitigation is the thing

468
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,839
that if you don't understand networking

469
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:54,800
and you're relying on other people um i

470
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,480
i would certainly make sure that they

471
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,120
understand your world right so again a

472
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,959
lot of times it's infosec it's a guy

473
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:02,639
running a firewall

474
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:04,400
if they don't understand the protocols

475
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,599
that are involved i still every day you

476
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:09,839
know the week that i deal with

477
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:12,160
guys and gals around this it's

478
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,839
protocols are different

479
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:16,319
bandwidth is not the key latency is the

480
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:18,959
key bandwidth is limited understand the

481
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:21,359
effects right it's this is just still

482
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:23,760
education from that standpoint

483
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:24,799
and

484
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:26,959
you know again we kind of always go back

485
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:28,559
and forth to this i'm not going to read

486
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:32,559
this to you except to say look um of

487
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:33,360
these

488
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,360
of this list and this list again is

489
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,919
lifted right from the cesa

490
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:39,200
document

491
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,440
i've tried to kind of hey if i think

492
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,520
it's a good idea it's green up there

493
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,200
right and it should be the kind of thing

494
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:49,039
that yeah i can and will and should and

495
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:51,200
ought to do white listing

496
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,400
right there's

497
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,799
an extreme example right is yeah you

498
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:56,799
probably shouldn't be surfing youtube

499
00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:58,960
from a machine that's hooked up to your

500
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,559
printing press or

501
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:02,880
whatever right again kind of mastered

502
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,799
the obvious stuff but stuff i see every

503
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:06,400
day right so

504
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,240
it's it's we've got to get into that

505
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:11,679
single use right one use on one os

506
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:14,000
i can't say it enough virtualization

507
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,640
helps you in all this

508
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,720
again a little bit repetitive in my

509
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,799
apologies but i don't see it very often

510
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:24,400
which is you know users

511
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:28,640
you know doing whitelisting doing

512
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,120
some level of you know i mean zero trust

513
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,720
is way over here on one end of the

514
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,720
continuum but certainly that's a that's

515
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,840
a thing that a lot of people are

516
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,080
exploring these days that's again very

517
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,840
much around

518
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,200
you're not trusted just because you're

519
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,799
on the network right you're trusted

520
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:44,480
based on your identity and so you have

521
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,880
to deal with the identity of these folks

522
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,679
and uh and my infosec friend right here

523
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:51,760
is nodding his head vigorously because

524
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,360
he's been through this for a long time

525
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,400
right so

526
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,880
you know we we kind of need to say catch

527
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,799
up right and and if it's important

528
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:00,480
enough you know multi-factor is

529
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,360
important do it um

530
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,280
and and look if you look at the things

531
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,720
that happened last year that i talked

532
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,039
about first and and you look at so many

533
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:10,799
of the compromises and

534
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:12,799
you know the the title of the talk even

535
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:14,240
is a little bit

536
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,160
a little a little bit of a play on on

537
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,919
words right because it's

538
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:20,880
it's it's rarely a big long lateral

539
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,280
movement through the network it's a

540
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,720
you know it's a fishing or a spear

541
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,120
fishing campaign i get some credentials

542
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:27,840
and

543
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,080
i don't have to do a lot of really techy

544
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,240
stuff at that point so

545
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,240
do do that right

546
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:37,520
um i've said this enough

547
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,919
but network segmentation is key right

548
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:42,160
and

549
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,760
you know the thing i would tell you

550
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,080
again is the hardest part of that is not

551
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:50,320
writing a firewall rule or understanding

552
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:53,120
the technology around

553
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:56,480
those kinds of mitigation factors the

554
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,960
the heavy lift there is what talks to

555
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,000
what

556
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,559
right what are my critical and vital

557
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:05,679
capabilities right and and so i tell a

558
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:08,640
story very often when i um

559
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,280
my previous employer we had a customer

560
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,240
that had a they had kilns right and so

561
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:17,200
kilns get very hot they baked things

562
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,640
they weren't cookies

563
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:22,080
um they didn't have a great network they

564
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,840
didn't have

565
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,159
their controllers were single threaded

566
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:28,320
right so you can build controllers that

567
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:31,919
have redundancy they didn't have that

568
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:33,919
they had a controller fail during a bake

569
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:36,159
process and they had a

570
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:38,880
pretty serious kinetic reaction in other

571
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,039
words a kiln blew up blew up

572
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:43,120
and the good news was nobody got hurt

573
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,919
right um the bad news was a lot of money

574
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:47,760
was lost so

575
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,240
how do we not only segment the network

576
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,840
perhaps from our traditional thought

577
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:56,080
processes around you know enterprise and

578
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,159
production but also even

579
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:01,360
a a more searching and thoughtful look

580
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:04,480
at hey here's a few processes and a few

581
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,640
devices that absolutely

582
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,559
run my production but there's a whole

583
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:10,799
slew of other things over here that you

584
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:13,520
know might count boxes as they run down

585
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:16,559
a conveyor belt or you know maybe aren't

586
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:19,679
as vital to human health and safety as

587
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:21,840
some other parts but you know starting

588
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,520
to actually really separate beyond the

589
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,840
purdue model and more in terms of

590
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:28,000
what the stuff actually does and how it

591
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,240
interacts with each other

592
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,240
i mean is is a very

593
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,799
valuable thing that we can take away

594
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:37,360
from this and and again right over years

595
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:40,799
and changes and acquisitions

596
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,840
sometimes that's lost

597
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,559
right

598
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:46,640
part of my job at one time my life was

599
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,159
helping to build this if you don't know

600
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:52,240
what this is it's called cpwe it is a

601
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,880
joint effort between cisco and rockwell

602
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,760
automation extremely

603
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:00,960
large complex i used it for years as a

604
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,760
sales tool um i would certainly contend

605
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,600
that it's still a great document kept up

606
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,080
by pretty smart people i would tell you

607
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,039
to

608
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:13,200
ingest it in in small bites

609
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,520
otherwise a it's confusing and b it

610
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,200
makes it look like you have to spend 10

611
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,799
million dollars tomorrow to build your

612
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:19,919
network

613
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:23,039
but having said that extremely valuable

614
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:25,200
information about the topology and

615
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,919
choices you make and dependencies

616
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:30,320
and you know firewalls and all kinds of

617
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:34,000
good stuff and uh you know they try to

618
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,679
keep it up it's it's somewhat hard

619
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:37,760
sometimes in terms of

620
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,919
the pace of technological change but

621
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:41,200
everything in there is still very

622
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:44,320
valuable um again that

623
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,840
i don't have skin in that game but i

624
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,919
absolutely recommend it

625
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:49,280
um

626
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,360
you know and then the next right from

627
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,600
from the sisa again is implement a

628
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,039
continuous and vigilant system

629
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:57,200
monitoring program i don't have anything

630
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,039
better or different to say about that

631
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:00,400
other than i

632
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,720
wholeheartedly agree um

633
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,520
i do have skin in this game so yeah i

634
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:08,640
mean we do that here at tennille and

635
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,000
yeah i don't have anything else to say

636
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,600
about that but but yeah you really

637
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,280
should do so

638
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,440
uh respond i already had this already

639
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,679
talked about this but i'm trying to go

640
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:20,880
right down the list of caesar so yeah

641
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,200
i wouldn't necessarily say again that we

642
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:26,480
need to manually flip switches to test

643
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,000
our things but

644
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,919
please tabletop

645
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:31,039
and

646
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:32,480
that's everything i have to say about

647
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,720
that certainly welcome questions from

648
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:37,840
anybody and everybody

649
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:46,120
yes sir

650
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:53,200
one of the key uh

651
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,120
components of the tsa directive was an

652
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,159
order

653
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:57,200
to

654
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,880
keep the

655
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,799
and they in their words keep the ot

656
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:03,039
system running at full capacity which i

657
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:04,720
assume that keep the pipeline running at

658
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:07,840
full capacity yeah even if

659
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:10,640
the it network is compromised

660
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,720
so to me that's a great order that's

661
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:15,120
that's the goal here yeah and then they

662
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:18,480
gave one two three five six seven

663
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,720
steps saying and to do that here's how

664
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:23,919
you do that do x y and z yeah does x y

665
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:26,159
and z add up

666
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:29,520
to a system that is strong enough to

667
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,880
keep running

668
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:34,640
even if the i.t network is compromised

669
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,190
and if not why not

670
00:24:36,190 --> 00:24:38,640
[Laughter]

671
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,840
so

672
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,520
yeah i'll give you the disclaimer right

673
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,840
i mean i think the people cease are some

674
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,679
ways smarter than me and maybe some ways

675
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:47,840
not

676
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:51,440
i think if you follow those guidelines

677
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,880
and take them in the spirit in which

678
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,919
they meant they're absolutely going to

679
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:57,679
raise your security posture but at the

680
00:24:57,679 --> 00:24:58,960
same time

681
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,799
you know i've also worked in infosec for

682
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:02,400
years and we've had a long time to

683
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,799
figure it out and we still don't have a

684
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:07,760
absolutely secure system so

685
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,520
i know that's a vague answer but that's

686
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:12,320
about as good as i can give you

687
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:15,039
it's helpful right yeah

688
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:16,880
and it's again to me

689
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,960
it's it's a tool to use

690
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,960
for building budget right it's these are

691
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,640
the things that we're being told to do

692
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:25,039
and we don't do any of these things so

693
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:26,720
at least if we follow four we'll be

694
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:30,159
better off than we were last week

695
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:32,559
thank you

696
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:34,400
yes ma'am hey

697
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:37,200
uh two questions um

698
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,000
mfa we love that supposed to be there

699
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,440
challenges are

700
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,200
service level identities and shared

701
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,440
identities on the factory floor

702
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,559
question number one how are you

703
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:48,159
suggesting to address that question

704
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:50,480
number two um i saw your segmentation

705
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,880
from i t to ot that's great um

706
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,640
however we have third parties still

707
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,960
connecting in on a regular basis so

708
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,799
suggestions on that outside of the

709
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:00,640
dreaded team viewer because we do not

710
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,480
like teamviewer

711
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,480
yeah so

712
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,640
i mean the the sort of simple answers

713
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,960
are and you always get different

714
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,240
reactions when i say what i'm going to

715
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,000
say next right

716
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,279
put your

717
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:14,799
put your eggs in one basket and watch

718
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:17,039
the basket better right so in other

719
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:19,279
words if you have windows machines which

720
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:20,559
are the vast majority of the things

721
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:22,080
we're kind of talking about put them

722
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,000
into active directory put them into your

723
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,760
own active directory put them into the

724
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:29,039
corporate one but do that and i'm

725
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:30,240
going to admit the next thing i'm going

726
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,960
to say is very salesy then use things

727
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,039
like tenable ad

728
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:37,120
to make sure your ad is right and even

729
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,120
if you don't use our stuff use some

730
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,880
methodology to make sure that ada is

731
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,360
right but this is where we come into you

732
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:45,039
know back to my

733
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:47,919
what i said before right which is around

734
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:50,159
automation controls engineers are not

735
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:53,120
sort of

736
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,720
used to doing it this way right i'm

737
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,400
trying to say stuff that's not

738
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,279
um

739
00:26:57,279 --> 00:26:58,880
bad right but it's just that's not their

740
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,720
bailiwick right they're very smart guys

741
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,400
that are doing things in other ways so

742
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:05,600
don't put a 15th hat on that guy

743
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,039
connect them to a d

744
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:09,120
get the people who are already a.d

745
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,440
experts to spend five extra minutes a

746
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,760
week making sure that a.d is good inside

747
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,520
your ot environment

748
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,840
um the other one around sorry repeat

749
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:20,720
your other one segmentation what

750
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,960
third party yeah so again you know the

751
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,960
examples you see here teamviewer and i

752
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,760
spent years trying to sell solution into

753
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:30,559
this environment is um

754
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:31,600
i

755
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,200
you know it's it's more of a cultural

756
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,360
question right it's it's oem's putting

757
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,399
in this

758
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:39,840
20 thing that allows them in and and

759
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:42,320
what you have to do in the long run is

760
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:45,279
get a pretty strict policy

761
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:47,120
and look again this kind of comes from

762
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:49,360
the i.t side of the world but it's like

763
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:52,799
put in a one solution for vpn access and

764
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:55,039
force everybody to use it and have an

765
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:56,640
administrator that knows how to

766
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,399
administer it do it every day of the

767
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:00,559
week put it on his shoulder then that's

768
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:03,279
a cost you don't have to have at every m

769
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:05,679
at every plant right where you have two

770
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:07,600
three four five hundred plants

771
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,760
and yeah that's a coordination thing

772
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,600
beside between sort of both sides of the

773
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,840
fence but it's it's absolutely shown to

774
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:15,840
be a bad vulnerability you know in the

775
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:18,240
broader sense and

776
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,919
we know how to do this

777
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:21,600
you know so

778
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:24,320
cut it out

779
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:26,320
i know it's not an easy thing to always

780
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:30,600
do it's easy thing to say

781
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:33,200
yes sir uh

782
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:37,520
we gotta one last maybe if we can mike

783
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,520
thank you

784
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,520
um so it does feel like

785
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,960
you know there's at least a continuation

786
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,880
of a trend or maybe it's an inflection

787
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,000
point

788
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:46,880
where

789
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,880
i-t-o-t lateral movement is especially

790
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,399
concerning

791
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:52,080
how do you see that is are we at a

792
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,919
moment in time

793
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:56,000
or is this kind of like more of what

794
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,080
we've been hearing about it's just

795
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,559
gotten to a

796
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:02,399
point where we can't ignore it anymore

797
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:04,159
well i mean you know

798
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:05,840
events always

799
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,840
i sold security for years and events

800
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:10,880
were you know they're always sad right

801
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,799
but at the same time they're if you're

802
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:15,120
in sales they're an opportunity so yeah

803
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,360
i mean we've talked about in control or

804
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:18,480
pipe dream or whatever you want to call

805
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:21,039
it today um those things happen all the

806
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:22,960
time but sometimes it takes events to

807
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:23,840
draw

808
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,679
our attention and

809
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:27,360
and more relevantly to your question

810
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:30,640
it's it's a continuum it's a maturity

811
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:31,919
right it's a

812
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:33,360
again i talk to lots of different kind

813
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,360
of customers every day of the week and

814
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,039
so the very first thing i'm trying to

815
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:39,039
figure out is

816
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:40,799
where are you

817
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:42,480
right are you are you sort of really

818
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,000
advanced and really care and really

819
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,080
doing all the right things or are you

820
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,080
just now at a place where you're saying

821
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:48,960
i

822
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,799
don't know what the first step is

823
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:51,679
so

824
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:52,720
yeah

825
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:55,360
i it's unfortunately the answer is

826
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,760
it depends which is all of our favorite

827
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:00,559
answers right

828
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,919
well great i seem to have cleared out

829
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:07,360
the room so i don't know if that's good

830
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,039
or bad but i appreciate your time this

831
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:12,039
afternoon
