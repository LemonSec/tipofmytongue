1
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:07,759
please welcome dave and dale to the s4

2
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:11,080
main stage

3
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:18,700
[Applause]

4
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,240
we had originally scheduled to have uh

5
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,880
phil venables up here at this time but

6
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:27,760
uh

7
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,840
as some of you who actually read the

8
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:32,960
emails probably learned he had actually

9
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,719
he wrote me back he wanted me to say an

10
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:37,360
emergency family situation and

11
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,680
everything is fine now but uh it kind of

12
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,280
cropped up yesterday so he couldn't make

13
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,719
it so we'll get him down here some other

14
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:44,160
year get them on the unsolicited

15
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,840
response show so what we're doing is

16
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,920
we're moving dave up to this spot he was

17
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,520
going to be in the afternoon and then at

18
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,039
3 30

19
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:54,079
uh keith london and nathan brew brew

20
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:56,000
baker are going to talk about in

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,559
controller here in the main stage so

22
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,640
it's all in the agenda but dave welcome

23
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,719
to s4 thank you very much for having me

24
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:03,600
here

25
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,920
you have kind of a unique background i

26
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,600
thought it would be great to be able to

27
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,760
talk to you in front of the s4 audience

28
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,040
here

29
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,920
you now as part of cisco you're on the

30
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,080
cisco advisory

31
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,920
yeah so yeah we're called the advisory

32
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,680
cisos which is part of the strategy team

33
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,520
for cisco so every week you're talking

34
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,439
to csos uh yeah actually for the last

35
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:25,600
two years specifically we've been having

36
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,360
myself been doing security roundtables

37
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,600
with csos and it's been really

38
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,040
enlightening to see all the different

39
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,159
css from the different industry

40
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,320
verticals sharing what they are

41
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,600
they're up against

42
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:36,960
and so there's a few of those but what

43
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,280
makes you a little unique is that 10 12

44
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,439
years ago you worked with

45
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:43,200
do they pronounce it ieso or how do they

46
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,840
pronounce that ieso ieso so the

47
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,399
ontario's power system and you work for

48
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:51,360
hydro one which was toronto's and amd

49
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,320
which manufactures chips so you have

50
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:57,200
some experience in ics yes i still wake

51
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,600
up screaming

52
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,079
so i guess what maybe to start

53
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:04,960
you were there 10 12 years ago yes

54
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,799
and now you're talking to csos probably

55
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:09,038
some of them have icss now that are very

56
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:10,560
important to them

57
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,879
how are csos different now

58
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:14,560
with regard to how they think about and

59
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,879
deal with ics than they were 10 12 years

60
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:17,680
ago

61
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,760
so 10 12 years ago a lot of the times

62
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,480
what it was was the cso was seen as you

63
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,239
know something off to the side that was

64
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:26,800
there because it needed to check a box

65
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,319
and a lot of times especially

66
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:30,720
environments that i worked in um it was

67
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,720
ot versus i.t the you know the

68
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,319
never-ending battle

69
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:36,080
when it didn't make a whole lot of sense

70
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,440
to me because you know a lot of the same

71
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,840
shared resources so the csos didn't

72
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,519
really get a seat at the table in a lot

73
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:44,319
of ways and nowadays we're finding that

74
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:46,400
that has fundamentally shifted where you

75
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,920
know the board has realized that you

76
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,760
know security is an absolute essential

77
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,519
issue that has to be discussed

78
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:53,280
and now they have you know they've

79
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,560
essentially become the dog that caught

80
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,480
the bumper and now we just got to figure

81
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,000
out what to do with that car

82
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,080
that sounds more like

83
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,480
kind of a generic difference in csos yes

84
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,720
10 to 12 years ago from now is there

85
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,360
anything specific in ics like i'm

86
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,680
thinking 10 12 years ago a lot of times

87
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,760
if there was a cso they just didn't even

88
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,159
have their hands on the ics but are you

89
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:16,319
seeing that now that is completely true

90
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:17,840
yes there was an absolute separation

91
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,280
between the two and now i'm seeing you

92
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,800
know that i'm going to say the horrible

93
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,040
word convergence um

94
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,400
because i know there's the two camps

95
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,560
that narrow the twain shall meet but the

96
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,560
practical reality is it's not something

97
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,519
that should be seen as a detractor

98
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:32,959
it is definitely something that is going

99
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:34,799
to get to you know a better place of

100
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:37,680
harmonizing the the environments and

101
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,879
making sure that you're reducing the

102
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:40,640
risk overall you know it's not a case of

103
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,239
just you know slap in a box with blinky

104
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:44,000
lights and hope for the best there has

105
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,319
to be a real concerted effort to look at

106
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:48,239
the risks that are involved and how that

107
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:49,840
will impact so for example if your

108
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,200
systems go down you can't make teddy

109
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,040
bears anymore that's one thing if your

110
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,879
system go down and it's a blackout in

111
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:56,000
the middle of february that's an

112
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,120
entirely different kettle of fish

113
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,319
you mentioned you mentioned this

114
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:02,480
convergence yes bless you

115
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,920
you mentioned this

116
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,319
uh convergence issue and i think that

117
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:09,040
one of the questions i get asked a lot

118
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,560
is

119
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,200
what should be the structure

120
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,920
of our organization to deal with ics

121
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,320
security should we have you know

122
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,519
an i.t division or an ot division an ics

123
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,600
should operations handle it should we

124
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,800
you know there's all these different

125
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,720
structural sorts of things i guess

126
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,479
there's a two-part question

127
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:31,440
what do you see cesos liking the most

128
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,040
and what do you think would be the most

129
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,560
effective if it's different than what

130
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,199
ciso's like the most well csos are about

131
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:38,639
reducing risk and protecting the

132
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:40,960
environment and the ot environment ot

133
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:41,919
folks are about protecting the

134
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:43,600
environment as well so i see a logical

135
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,280
progression where the two will converge

136
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,639
in some manner

137
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:48,560
and it's going to take quite a long time

138
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,840
before it gets to the point where

139
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,199
security is no longer part of the

140
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:53,680
equation and what i mean by that is

141
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,440
fundamentally security in my way of

142
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,040
thinking should be woven into every

143
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,720
aspect of the business

144
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,039
and i believe wholeheartedly that at

145
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:02,479
some point in the future i shouldn't

146
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:04,080
exist you know at one point in the

147
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,440
history there was something called a

148
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,280
chief electricity officer

149
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,800
that was in charge of when light bulbs

150
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,880
were a brand new thing that does the

151
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,639
role doesn't exist anymore and i think

152
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:14,160
that security fundamentally at some

153
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,840
point down the line should be part of

154
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,840
everything i don't think that we're

155
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,680
going to hit that level of maturity for

156
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,840
quite a few years but i think that is

157
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,600
achievable and my apologies the second

158
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,360
part of the question

159
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,199
well no let's stay there that's that's

160
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:28,960
really interesting

161
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:32,000
so you would think that you know 5 10 20

162
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,840
years down the road

163
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,240
the cio would

164
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,960
take would be include part of the cso

165
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,680
job i think it's fundamentally possible

166
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,440
that we can get to that point but there

167
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,880
is a great deal of heavy lifting that

168
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,440
has to happen uh it has to be a firm

169
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,199
understanding about what risk is in an

170
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:51,440
environment uh not just financial but

171
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,759
you know i.t related as well because

172
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:55,120
all of this is about making sure that

173
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,479
we're protecting the workplace the

174
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:58,160
workload and the workforce and we want

175
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,479
to make sure that when we're doing that

176
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:02,240
we're doing it in a way that makes sense

177
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,680
you know we're we're trying to

178
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,000
democratize security for the end users

179
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,080
and when you're in an uh ot environment

180
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,440
i.t environment whatever happens to be

181
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,720
if you're giving folks that are tools

182
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,240
written by engineers for engineers

183
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,280
you're going to have a very limited

184
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,479
subset of people that are able to

185
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:16,400
actually make use of them so you want to

186
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,840
make sure that we're doing things in a

187
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,919
way that is going to be easier to use

188
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:20,639
and

189
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,160
you know ultimately you're then going to

190
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,600
be able to converge all these systems

191
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,000
together in a way that makes sense you

192
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,759
know you don't want to rush into it by

193
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:30,000
any such an imagination

194
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,360
because there is a culture shift that

195
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,680
has to happen right there are the two

196
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,639
camps

197
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:37,039
we all know it and we have to figure out

198
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:38,960
some way to get together i mean we are

199
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,520
able to teach a rock to think

200
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,520
and like think about that for a second

201
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,440
if we can figure out that i'm sure we

202
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,199
can figure out how to get along

203
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:50,319
a rock to think computers oh

204
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:52,479
sorry i miss that one

205
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:53,440
but

206
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,199
you know it's funny because that sort of

207
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:56,880
flies in the face you know there's a lot

208
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,039
of people really pushing that they be

209
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:00,560
separate and they have their separate

210
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,000
line of reporting but i guess i think

211
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,400
back to we had some people on stage a

212
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,080
couple years ago talking about devops

213
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,400
and i remember up in the green room

214
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,520
she said

215
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,759
i really hate devops sec

216
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:15,440
because she said

217
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,080
security is part of devops it's not some

218
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,160
extra buzzword so it's almost that same

219
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,520
kind of thinking

220
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,360
that it's just this should be part of

221
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,199
every other thing you do for information

222
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:27,440
systems i agree with that completely i

223
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,039
honestly think it should all be part and

224
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:30,639
parcel of the same thing

225
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:32,880
and because you know security aspect of

226
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,240
things has only been around for a couple

227
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,800
of decades this is a relatively immature

228
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,960
um market segment as opposed to like you

229
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,960
know medical profession or what or

230
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,360
jurisprudence and things like that so i

231
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,879
think that it will be quite a while

232
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:46,720
before we get there but i believe fully

233
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,319
that we can get to that point because i

234
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:49,759
would much rather own a bookstore or

235
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,680
coffee shop that is really interesting

236
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,879
and then i think you could have your

237
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:55,120
chief risk officer handle that part that

238
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,160
wouldn't fall under the cio yes okay

239
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,440
well

240
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:02,479
there's a few people that want to keep

241
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:04,479
it completely out of operations

242
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:06,160
completely out of ot

243
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,240
if you were

244
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,319
talking to one of these people

245
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:12,000
what would be the most compelling way

246
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,240
for them to talk to their ciso to make

247
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,440
the case

248
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,479
that

249
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:18,560
operations should handle all of this and

250
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,319
i.t should stay out

251
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:21,919
well if they can make the business case

252
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:24,240
that they are able to reduce risk and

253
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,759
fundamentally improve the security of

254
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:27,280
their organization

255
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,560
and you know

256
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,000
their customer base whoever it happens

257
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
to be if it's electricity water whatever

258
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,919
it happens to be you want to be able to

259
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:35,839
make a coherent business case that is

260
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:38,320
going to resonate with the board because

261
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,839
they're all about you know how much is

262
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:41,519
this going to cost what is the risk

263
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:43,120
involved to the organization that is

264
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,120
fundamentally what it boils down to for

265
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,240
them

266
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,680
so if you're able to speak their lingua

267
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,200
franca that's a really huge piece of the

268
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,080
puzzle

269
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,760
if you're able to provide them with the

270
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,440
visibility for them to understand what's

271
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,120
happening on their network

272
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,360
that would be absolutely key i had a

273
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,800
couple of conversations yesterday when i

274
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,399
was picking up my badge and these

275
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:02,880
conversations centered around

276
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,480
all these wonderful technical things

277
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,680
that they were able to do in their

278
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,080
environments but the common thread that

279
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,399
i found throughout was the lack of

280
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:12,160
visibility as to what was happening on

281
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,920
their network so if they're able to find

282
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,399
some way to you know get to a point

283
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:17,920
where they can have that visibility and

284
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,000
they can demonstrate that to the board

285
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,480
that would resonate heavily so whether

286
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,399
it's ot or it

287
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:27,200
i'm really indifferent as to who wins

288
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,959
that battle it just it should be

289
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:30,640
something that is

290
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,240
not two different camps going to war

291
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,920
with each other

292
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,320
well and and i think what i heard there

293
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,120
is that if you are whatever you want to

294
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,640
propose

295
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,800
be the solution whether it's right or

296
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,480
wrong you're going to have to make the

297
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,720
business case yeah it's easy to be a

298
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,160
critic it's hard to get in there and get

299
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,000
your face dirty so if you're able to get

300
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,760
in there and get it done all the power

301
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,399
to you and you have to convince the cso

302
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:56,560
and then the cso goes up and convinces

303
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,600
the executives or do the security people

304
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,519
typically get up in front of those

305
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:03,519
executives you see that's the problem

306
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:05,040
there's no one-size-fits-all for

307
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,959
organizations so you're going to have

308
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:09,040
different types of setups where you know

309
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,959
the cso will report to the cio which is

310
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:12,240
like you know fox guarding the head

311
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,079
house sort of thing or you have them

312
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:16,720
reporting the risk officer or to the cfo

313
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,800
so it really does depend on the

314
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,959
organization and i mean i'm not a fan of

315
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:23,040
the just depends answer but in that

316
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,959
particular case it will vary from one

317
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:27,760
organization to the next

318
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,760
what's one or two of the biggest

319
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,399
mistakes

320
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:35,200
operations secure operations technology

321
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,560
security people whether they're assigned

322
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:40,240
to it or ot make when they're trying to

323
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,920
propose a solution

324
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:45,440
to the cso or to the executives so in my

325
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,760
experience what i ran into was the

326
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,640
bypassing of security so if ot folks

327
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,360
were you know pitching a solution

328
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,959
it was great for what it was good at

329
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:56,160
right they are

330
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,200
absolutely solid on their core

331
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,640
competencies but in some cases they

332
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,560
would try to bypass security thinking at

333
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,640
as a limiter you know that flaming sort

334
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,160
of justice that only says no to

335
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,040
everything

336
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,600
and we want to make sure that we are not

337
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,279
that limiter as a security practitioner

338
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:10,560
we want to make sure that we're enabling

339
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,760
the business whatever that business

340
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,800
happens to be so if they're able to work

341
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,640
together with the security folks to get

342
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,240
to that common ground

343
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,760
that's a great thing and security folks

344
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,360
can't just be security for the sake of

345
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,360
security you know it's like oh well we

346
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,560
have to lock it down to the point where

347
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,399
it's completely unusable it is really

348
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:28,399
not going to serve anybody's interest

349
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:30,880
long term

350
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:35,440
here in in 2022

351
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,760
are there any sort of categories of

352
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:41,360
solutions whether they be equipment or

353
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,600
you know product categories or even

354
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,680
services categories that you see as

355
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,640
being

356
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,079
easy sales

357
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:50,160
like where the c you bring this up and

358
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,890
the csos tend to say yes yes yes

359
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:54,160
[Music]

360
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,480
or the flip side are there any that are

361
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,240
are proving to be really hard to

362
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,920
convince to see so it's worth to spend

363
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:00,880
that money

364
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,959
so i i'm a little bit

365
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:05,040
different on this one uh yes i work for

366
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,800
a vendor but one of the things i find is

367
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,279
the biggest uh easy sell-in is a

368
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:11,040
two-part one to find repeatable

369
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,959
processes that helps reduce risk in the

370
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:14,959
organization the other part of that is

371
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:17,040
looking at a strategy and i'm going to

372
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,480
say the words that half the room will

373
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,800
get upset about zero trust

374
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,040
and this is not about product this is

375
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,600
about reducing risk in the environment

376
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,639
there are some vendors out there that

377
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:28,720
say oh if you buy this blinky box with

378
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,000
blinky lights you're going to have zero

379
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,680
trust it's like no no it is about

380
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,040
fundamentally reducing risk in the

381
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,560
organization making sure that you have

382
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,560
clear asset inventories you understand

383
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,920
the people that are in your environment

384
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,839
you the systems that you're protecting

385
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:41,360
and making sure the applications that

386
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,040
you need in order to keep the lights on

387
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:46,560
are available when you need them

388
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,000
do any of those

389
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,680
or other ones

390
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,839
jump up in terms of what you think

391
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,360
people are going to be spending money on

392
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,760
in three years or five years or if we

393
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,519
look out a little bit

394
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:00,000
the world today is a little bit

395
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:00,880
um

396
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,519
messed up let's put it that way um we

397
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:05,680
have you know the war in ukraine is an

398
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,000
example and the spillover effect from

399
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,639
that i think is rather significant uh

400
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:12,480
and i worry about the longer this draws

401
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,800
out the more this will affect things

402
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,800
from you know a cyber security aspect as

403
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:20,720
well as in in addition to kinetic um i

404
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,480
think that we are going to get to a

405
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,600
place where we're going to be much

406
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,760
better at harmonizing uh systems and

407
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,279
being able to

408
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:29,279
have systems talk to each other in a way

409
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:31,200
that makes sense so that we can get to

410
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,800
you know platform type technologies

411
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,880
where you can just plug in things like

412
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,399
you know a service bus architecture for

413
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,639
one of a better term so that you don't

414
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:40,079
have to have you know 10 different

415
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:42,480
vendors and nobody talks to each other

416
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,720
if you're able to have solutions that

417
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,880
are going to help you with your outcomes

418
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,320
that's the key piece of the puzzle if

419
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,760
you're having solutions that just don't

420
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,760
talk to anybody and it's a nice little

421
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,040
shiny box that's going to cost you

422
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,959
millions of dollars you've got to really

423
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,720
take a step back and say is this going

424
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,279
to make sense for me long term

425
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:01,199
when you said that

426
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:03,360
the events in ukraine the war that's

427
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,279
going on there is is having an impact is

428
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:07,360
it having an impact because

429
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,519
people are seeing potential threat

430
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:11,040
increase or what's

431
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,360
what aspect of that is

432
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,519
is affecting there there is definitely a

433
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:17,920
spillover effect of you know attacks on

434
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,720
various systems you have you know the

435
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,560
hacker armies that we've heard about

436
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,120
which while good intentions

437
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,800
i totally support that they have to be

438
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,560
cognizant of the fact that the laws of

439
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,040
their respective countries still apply

440
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,040
so if you are participating in one of

441
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,639
those events where you're attacking uh

442
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:37,279
targets in russia um

443
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:38,720
you know the idealist to me says you

444
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,440
know jolyon carry on uh but the real the

445
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,600
realist in me realizes that there are

446
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,440
laws are still in effect so you may be

447
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,199
putting yourself in undue harm as well

448
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:49,040
in addition to helping so you have to be

449
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,560
able to strike a balance where that

450
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,240
makes sense for you

451
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,040
um

452
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,160
and

453
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,680
we look at all these different attacks

454
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,440
and the more that

455
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,279
you know russia as an example the more

456
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:01,040
they get backed into a corner the more

457
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,199
likely they are to do things that are

458
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:05,120
going to have unfortunate knock-on

459
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,600
effect and what that manifest says i

460
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,600
don't know at this point and i i want to

461
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,360
be wrong but i

462
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,720
see a long road ahead

463
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,120
you know we've had some news in the ics

464
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,560
world come out in the last week with

465
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:21,440
this in controller and the pipe dream

466
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,760
malware that's out there now

467
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:27,040
and even in industry in destroyer 2. i

468
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,959
always have trouble with that so we have

469
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:32,240
these new malware families out there

470
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,519
what does

471
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:37,040
if any impact that have on the cso or

472
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,120
the executives when they see you know

473
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,759
these things new malware that can do all

474
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:44,399
these nasty things to icsa

475
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:46,480
you know we don't get a lot of those

476
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,560
but you know this was a big one so does

477
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:51,759
this have an impact on them and if so

478
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:53,759
how do you think it impacts that oh i

479
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:55,680
definitely see it as having an impact

480
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,440
like

481
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,720
how do i put it

482
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,320
i like to use the term security debt is

483
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,759
one of the things that i like to discuss

484
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:03,680
a fair amount it for me that means a

485
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,120
technical debt that's manifested as a

486
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,639
security issue

487
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:09,279
and i see that this is common in any

488
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:11,120
industry vertical any company longer

489
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,399
that's been around longer than two weeks

490
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:13,759
has something in their environment

491
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:15,680
that's going to cause them a headache

492
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:18,560
so being able to you know get your arms

493
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,120
around that is absolutely key like one

494
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,639
organization i used to work at i ran an

495
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:25,759
netmap scan in the scada environment and

496
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:29,040
i hit a open lock d port on an hmi

497
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,279
it panicked and caused the cascade

498
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:33,600
failure and almost took out the entire

499
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,519
system

500
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:37,519
and it's one of those things where we're

501
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:38,800
looking at these

502
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,639
systems that we're relying on in order

503
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:42,240
to keep the lights on keep water flowing

504
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,600
all the rest of it

505
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,600
but we have to be able to take a shot at

506
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,440
them and say okay is this going to be

507
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,279
resilient under attack

508
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:50,800
because unfortunately you see more and

509
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,800
more systems are being you know remotely

510
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,240
enabled which

511
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,639
if it's done correctly is fine but i've

512
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:58,320
seen instances where there was one

513
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,240
particular scada system in southeast

514
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,240
asia that was connected to twitter this

515
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,720
was years ago but it would literally

516
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,480
tweet out status messages throughout the

517
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,839
course of the day

518
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,439
um you know the road to hell is paved

519
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:12,240
with good intentions

520
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:14,480
you're talking about technical debt and

521
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,559
i think brian owen was the first one in

522
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:18,240
the community i saw talking about it in

523
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,319
the ics world and he's always hitting

524
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:22,720
hitting me up with ideas about it and

525
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,599
thoughts

526
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:24,720
and

527
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,199
the idea is very appealing i just

528
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:29,360
almost wonder in the ics world if we

529
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,840
have so much debt technical debt that

530
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,760
you know it's almost like the u.s

531
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,440
government debt you know it's just so

532
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,360
large that

533
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,600
i guess you can stop it from increasing

534
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,520
but can you actually make a dent in it

535
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:44,400
when you look at all these systems

536
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,160
you know the level one insecure by

537
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,039
design issues the legacy systems all

538
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:49,840
these

539
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:52,240
poor code bases and lack of security

540
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,679
issues

541
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:56,000
how do we deal with a technical debt

542
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,960
that is such a high mountain what what's

543
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,640
the best approach to that well you go

544
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,919
back to the analogy of eating the

545
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:03,280
elephant you got to start somewhere

546
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,200
right and

547
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,480
by just throwing your hands up in the

548
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,919
air and walking away from it it's not

549
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:10,320
going to remedy anything is it tough yes

550
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,160
is it going to take a long time to get

551
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:15,200
your arms around it oh yes um you know

552
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,799
we've all seen you know the beige

553
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:18,160
desktop which i always love to make fun

554
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,160
of that is running mission critical code

555
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,679
written by a summer student that nobody

556
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:23,440
knows how to port it off there

557
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,440
and i've seen that on the raised floor

558
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,880
in more organizations than i care to

559
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:30,480
admit um but just because there is a

560
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,720
huge amount of it doesn't mean we

561
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,480
shouldn't tackle it

562
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,400
having a risk register to

563
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,160
monitor these things and track them to

564
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,360
end of job

565
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,919
is absolutely essential

566
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:43,679
and don't have a risk register as a

567
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:46,320
dumping zone for put all i had one cso

568
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,600
said that they had a risk register and

569
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,000
literally everybody put anything on it

570
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,520
and that's just that's malicious

571
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,880
compliance at that point you want to

572
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,320
make sure that you're having something

573
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,000
that's effective it also helps when the

574
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,760
auditors come calling and while they

575
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:58,960
come calling

576
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,640
one organization i worked at we had six

577
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,799
audits running simultaneously which to

578
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:04,320
this day i still don't know why they did

579
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,400
that

580
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,600
but

581
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,600
as a result of having a risk register we

582
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,200
were able to handle that with the

583
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,039
auditors and they will show them that

584
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:15,039
yes these have been identified there is

585
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:16,640
the plan in place to track at the end of

586
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,799
job will it take years in some cases yes

587
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:20,799
of course but the otters were happy in

588
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:22,640
that it was identified and being worked

589
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,160
on

590
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,760
you know i wonder though with you know

591
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,520
if you talk about this elephant that is

592
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,919
technical debt

593
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:31,120
and yes

594
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,200
probably all that all that debt is not

595
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,880
going to have the same impact on you

596
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,440
from a risk perspective so in the ics

597
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,640
world which again you have some

598
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,480
familiarity with

599
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,559
where would you start eating what what

600
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:44,240
debt would you be looking to retire

601
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,280
soonest

602
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,360
i i honestly i would look at whatever

603
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,039
the most high risk is for your

604
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:50,799
particular organization you know what is

605
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:52,640
going to have the material impact if it

606
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,480
goes down if you walk over there pull

607
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,640
the plug out of system x y or z

608
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,320
is it going to knock out you know the

609
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,880
grid is it going to you know those rank

610
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,320
those as the highest ones that are being

611
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,840
addressed yes there's low hanging fruit

612
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,520
that you can knock off but you really

613
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,120
want to concentrate on the really high

614
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,440
risk items and that will obviously vary

615
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,039
from one place to the next

616
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:13,600
so if i had let's see a bunch of windows

617
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,159
xp computers

618
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:18,480
out there

619
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,400
they still might not be my

620
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,840
the right thing to deal with right even

621
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,039
though they probably have the more

622
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:24,880
vulnerabilities bigger issues than a lot

623
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:27,039
of other things

624
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:30,240
if they're not critical computers then

625
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,200
should i

626
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,280
retire that debt early on or just say

627
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,039
yeah i've got some xp out there well if

628
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:37,280
you have the capacity to do so yes right

629
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,799
and it's it's really about you know the

630
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:40,400
bench strength of the organization what

631
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,880
can you do in a certain amount of time

632
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,240
do you have compensating controls in

633
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,919
place you have network zone segmentation

634
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:47,520
are you able to make sure that these

635
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,679
systems are not facing the internet

636
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:51,440
unfortunately far too often they are but

637
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,880
um you want to make sure that those

638
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,720
things are not still around there i mean

639
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,240
i know of one power company that still

640
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,240
has their hvac systems being run by os 2

641
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,200
warp

642
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,799
and the last i heard that system had not

643
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:02,720
been rebooted in 10 years well 12 years

644
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:03,520
sorry

645
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,919
very reliable very reliable but if that

646
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:07,360
was even remotely hanging off the

647
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,880
internet well most people wouldn't know

648
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,880
what to do with it but you know

649
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,880
there's still the possibility i still

650
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:16,720
remember um but yeah it's a problem

651
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,240
so yeah sorry going back to your

652
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,080
question about you know addressing these

653
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,520
yes if you have compensating controls

654
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,880
where you can you know have a zone

655
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,960
segment those off until you can address

656
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,240
them that's one thing

657
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,280
you want to make sure that you have

658
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,880
trusted partners that you can deal with

659
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,720
within the industry because nobody has

660
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,039
enough staff nobody has enough budget

661
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:34,880
but if you're able to bring in folks to

662
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,960
augment your systems uh augment your

663
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,120
teams if you're able to bring in you

664
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,640
know automation into your environment

665
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,080
that'll help alleviate that so you can

666
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,600
concentrate on what's most important for

667
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:46,000
your organization that'll help as well

668
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,400
i guess the tough part is and we'll get

669
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,000
off to see so i want one other thing i

670
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,240
want to talk to you about but

671
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,919
a lot of times if you do an assessment

672
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:55,280
and i know many people here do

673
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,679
assessments if you were to for example

674
00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:00,320
document every vulnerability and print

675
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,919
out the pages you know would be a thick

676
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:04,000
report right you'd show all these

677
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,760
misconfigurations all these missing

678
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,120
patches you know if something hasn't

679
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,799
been patched for three years you can say

680
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:10,159
you haven't been patched for three years

681
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:12,960
or you can print them all out and or

682
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,760
list them all in your report

683
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,600
how does it see so deal with the big

684
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,600
report like that can they just say

685
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:20,720
[Music]

686
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,720
can they just say yeah we're gonna cut

687
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,640
out 10 pages of the report and work on

688
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:27,440
that or when you hand that to a cso what

689
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,039
are they supposed to do with it

690
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:31,520
well that is one of the limiting factors

691
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,880
that security people have put on

692
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,480
themselves when they're dealing with

693
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,799
senior management is providing those

694
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:38,960
reports i had an external pen test team

695
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,799
do that to me years ago where they

696
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:42,240
literally printed it off it was about

697
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,600
that thick and pushed across the table

698
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:44,799
at me i'm like what am i supposed to do

699
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:45,760
with this

700
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,679
because there was no ranking as the

701
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:49,600
severity of issues there was no it was

702
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,600
just basically printing out nessa scans

703
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:52,640
and all the rest of it it was just

704
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,240
absolutely nonsensical gibberish at that

705
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,559
point so if you're not able to clearly

706
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:58,799
articulate what the issues are that are

707
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:01,200
affecting the environment then

708
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,280
you're it's going to be lost

709
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,320
and if you're running around with your

710
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,840
hair on fire saying oh there's a zero

711
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,360
day for this that and the other thing if

712
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,880
you're not speaking in terms that they

713
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,480
understand if you're not identifying it

714
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,799
as risk and adding you know what the

715
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:15,200
impact is financially or otherwise to

716
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,360
the organization then they're not going

717
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:20,159
to hear you so making sure that you are

718
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:21,840
communicating in a way that is clear and

719
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:22,960
concise

720
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,000
and

721
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:24,720
you know when you're doing your

722
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,400
presentations don't make it that great

723
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:30,400
big tome you know this isn't um

724
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,600
this isn't lord of the rings you don't

725
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,120
want to push that huge book across at

726
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,440
them well and i think and i used to do

727
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,799
those assessments i don't do them

728
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:40,000
anymore i think it's really important

729
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,320
for the asset owners to understand when

730
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,360
they're getting one when they're

731
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,799
contracting for one of these what

732
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:47,440
they're going to get back yes because if

733
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,120
it's the worst cases you get one of

734
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,400
these things back

735
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,159
and of course you paid for it so it gets

736
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:53,840
sent up the chain and then you have to

737
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,279
live with the results so you really have

738
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:56,799
to understand

739
00:23:56,799 --> 00:23:58,400
what you're going to present to your

740
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,960
senior management i think yeah and the

741
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,720
other side of that too is when you have

742
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,400
one of these engagements

743
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,760
you don't want to say oh you can test

744
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,080
this system between 5 and 5 15 on every

745
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,080
second tuesday yeah you're not going to

746
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,080
get a clear understanding of what's your

747
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,840
environment you need to understand those

748
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:16,400
risks and i remember i did a pen test

749
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,640
where i said anything was fair game

750
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,480
and that started at 9 00 am my phone was

751
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,799
ringing at 9 14. they had already

752
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:24,320
breached the network they had already

753
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,720
taken over the active directory and they

754
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,480
had we were in the process of cracking

755
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,799
all the passwords and

756
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:32,320
they never would have been able to do

757
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,960
any of that had i limited the scope

758
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,720
um and it was all because somebody had

759
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,320
attached a polycom device to the

760
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,000
internet so that they could work on at

761
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,159
home they had a web interface they were

762
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:44,960
able to go in there configure it at ssh

763
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,279
done

764
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:50,480
okay let's take a little shift here sure

765
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,559
and this this is a little bit cisco

766
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:54,000
related but i know you're not in this

767
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,400
group of cisco but cisco acquired

768
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:59,120
centrio yes well ago asset inventory

769
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:01,840
detection vendor and and sort of turned

770
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:04,080
that offering into cyber

771
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,159
uh cyber vision you have so many product

772
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:07,760
names oh look to make sure i got it

773
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,919
right i have to look too what i found

774
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:11,679
most interesting in the way that cisco

775
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:14,080
did this is that they're making this now

776
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,640
available in the switches as a container

777
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:19,200
so not all switches but a certain family

778
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,640
and line of switches the more modern

779
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,159
switches basically they can run a

780
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:23,440
container

781
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,640
and then they're

782
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:28,320
charging by ip address not by how many

783
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,919
containers you put out there so you

784
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:31,520
could in theory

785
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:34,400
deploy if you have a new cisco switched

786
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,080
architecture

787
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,799
you could deploy it on every switch if

788
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:41,520
you wanted or a few

789
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,919
it's a long intro to a question but the

790
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:45,520
question i have is

791
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,360
once we see this whether it's cisco or

792
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,840
something else once we see this ot

793
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,120
security

794
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,360
capability integrated into the network

795
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:56,000
infrastructure

796
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,880
you see the ot security companies going

797
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:01,679
away or do you see that there's always

798
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:04,080
going to be this idea that this network

799
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,000
infrastructure is

800
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,320
is i.t and then we have to put a

801
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:11,600
separate ot product layer on top of that

802
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,120
i think for the foreseeable future you

803
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,039
will see multiple vendors out there i

804
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:16,720
mean it would be

805
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,320
disingenuous of me to say you know this

806
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,000
is magical dust we just sprinkle it on

807
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,480
the network and you're good to go um it

808
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,159
it definitely is going to take a while

809
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:26,000
before we shift to that convergence of

810
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,320
having you know everything harmonized i

811
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,240
honestly see them you know surviving for

812
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,919
quite a few years to come yes and it

813
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:34,159
because it really does boil down to

814
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:36,320
what is the you know requirement of the

815
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,320
customer you know the customer is the

816
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,080
one that has to dictate what they need

817
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,600
in their environment they don't want to

818
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,960
just go with a vendor because they took

819
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,320
and play golf

820
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,480
there was when i used to be at hydro one

821
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,799
back in the day i had so many vendors

822
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:50,080
offering to take me to golf that i

823
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,840
actually sat down and figured it out if

824
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,200
i had taken them up on it i would have

825
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,559
been playing golf for four months

826
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:56,000
straight and never stepped foot in the

827
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,120
office

828
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,480
it was nuts

829
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,080
but you know

830
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,919
a bit of a tangent sorry i lost myself

831
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:03,120
there but

832
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,799
you know the reality is yes there will

833
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:06,720
be multiple vendors it it's not a case

834
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,400
of they're going to go away overnight

835
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,159
they may change into something else over

836
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:12,080
time i don't know i can't quite see that

837
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,440
particularly if we take it away from

838
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,120
cisco i mean you could look at like a q

839
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,440
radar or a splunk or something like that

840
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:20,240
and and we have a large number of

841
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,399
detection vendors in the ot space that

842
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:24,320
feed those

843
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,880
but in theory that same capability could

844
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,240
be integrated

845
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,159
into those solutions

846
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:32,559
are you still i do you see that

847
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:34,799
do you see eventually those coming

848
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:36,480
together and being one or do you think

849
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,480
that they're gonna still be enough

850
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:41,360
specialized nature of the ot one that it

851
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:44,080
will remain separate uh no i i see them

852
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,520
coming together like going back to the

853
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,440
you know the the c word of convergence i

854
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,279
i believe that we will get there at some

855
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:51,120
point down the road it's going to take

856
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,679
some time uh absolutely but i do believe

857
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:55,440
uh wholeheartedly that we can get to

858
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,480
that point

859
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,600
um

860
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,919
yes you know there is there are mission

861
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:01,520
critical assets bad things happen when

862
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,440
those systems go down but we have the

863
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,880
capacity to train folks we have the

864
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,399
capacity to build that software in such

865
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:08,240
a way that it can work together with

866
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,159
other systems so that you have that

867
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:11,600
visibility and that's the key piece of

868
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:12,799
the puzzle it's like i've had so many

869
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:14,720
conversations where it's like all these

870
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,720
great technical solutions

871
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,960
but visibility was lacking

872
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,960
so having that visibility having all

873
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,240
those systems come together in such a

874
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,240
way that provides folks with that and

875
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,760
you know even layering in something like

876
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:28,080
dnn and being able to have that present

877
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,360
to you in the morning when you log in

878
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:31,120
saying there are 27 problems these are

879
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:32,880
the two you should really look at would

880
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,480
really you know shorten the mean time to

881
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:35,600
response

882
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:38,159
are you hearing that visibility

883
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:40,399
requirement from a lot of your

884
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:42,559
csos and customers

885
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:44,320
or are you encouraging them in that

886
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,640
direction um both

887
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,480
um i am absolutely i've been hearing

888
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,320
that now for two years where it's

889
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:51,520
amazing it doesn't matter what industry

890
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,440
vertical it is they are all saying the

891
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,200
same thing the visibility is the problem

892
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,880
that they're having i remember one

893
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,399
vendor that would remain nameless

894
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:00,159
actually they're gone now uh promised me

895
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:02,640
a single pane of glass back in 2003

896
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,799
they never delivered it yeah

897
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:07,279
and now they're gone um but these are

898
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:08,880
the kind of things where you know we

899
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,799
have to make sure that as vendors that

900
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:12,080
we are able to deliver products that are

901
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,120
going to satisfy the outcomes of the

902
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:15,440
users uh and because if we're just

903
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,720
buying them and saying you have to buy

904
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,399
this because we said so is absolutely

905
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:20,480
nonsensical right we have to be able to

906
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,240
build that relationship because the the

907
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,159
way we used to be of you know somebody

908
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:25,840
sold you a box dropped on a landing dock

909
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,520
and you never saw them again i

910
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,600
experienced that too many times

911
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,120
is gone you know we're building

912
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,880
relationships we're moving more to

913
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,799
sas-based offerings and things like that

914
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:36,720
so we have to look at it as relationship

915
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,320
building so you have to build that

916
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,520
long-term

917
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,679
interaction with the customers

918
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:43,840
maybe as a closing thought i'm just

919
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,440
curious

920
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:48,240
what are you passionate about in the you

921
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,159
know in the technology area whether it

922
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:53,440
be a product a service a problem

923
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,360
what is it that really gets you kind of

924
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,679
jazzed and you you're enjoying studying

925
00:29:57,679 --> 00:29:59,760
and learning and figuring it out

926
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,760
okay well so the one that i'm allowed

927
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:04,640
about is security debt because it is

928
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,559
everywhere and i've experienced it

929
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:08,720
myself i've seen systems that

930
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,320
were older than me in some cases and

931
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,880
that's saying something

932
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,799
what i really get jazzed about to go off

933
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:15,919
on a complete tangent that i've been

934
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:18,399
doing a lot of research on is a dna data

935
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:19,600
storage

936
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,200
which is completely unrelated to this

937
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,600
but being able to like in your own dna

938
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,039
you can write up about four petabytes

939
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:26,320
worth of data

940
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:27,840
so i've been doing a lot of yeah i've

941
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,679
been doing that as a research project

942
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:32,240
for my grad studies wow okay very

943
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,679
interesting well dave i really

944
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:35,760
appreciate you coming down and shifting

945
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,200
your schedule here to move up to the

946
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,640
morning and are you gonna be around at

947
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,240
the cabana sessions for people to talk

948
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,240
to i will be around until thursday and

949
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,520
thank you very much for having me this

950
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,120
is a bucket list item for me so i'm

951
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:47,039
really uh do appreciate the opportunity

952
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:48,480
to be here and

953
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,919
chat with you all okay thank you very

954
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:52,919
much
