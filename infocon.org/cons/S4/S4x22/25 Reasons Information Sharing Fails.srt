1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,240
foreign

2
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:08,339
2001.

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,519
I was a chemical engineering student

4
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:14,240
leaving an early morning class

5
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,859
going to the engineering building and I

6
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:19,800
saw clusters of other students

7
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,779
around the TVs

8
00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:24,600
they were watching the Twin Towers

9
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,820
a flame

10
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:30,660
and on fire my reaction connects class

11
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:31,980
was canceled

12
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:35,820
and there was a lot of uh concern

13
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:38,460
and this really penetrated a lot of our

14
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:39,780
memories

15
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:41,579
over the course of

16
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:44,700
over the course of time

17
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:48,500
let me see if I can advance this once

18
00:00:50,539 --> 00:00:54,480
over the course of time reports came out

19
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,399
about what happened during 9 11.

20
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:00,960
there was ultimately this final report

21
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,899
by the 911 Commission

22
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:07,380
and surprisingly it reflected a lot of

23
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:09,420
the same information that was in the

24
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:11,939
Pearl Harbor report almost 60 years

25
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:13,799
earlier

26
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:16,200
a couple years later Hurricane Katrina

27
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,960
came it pummeled New Orleans

28
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,080
and surprisingly this bipartisan report

29
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,420
that came and analyzed what had happened

30
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:26,540
leading to Katrina

31
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:29,580
reported some of the same findings that

32
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:32,159
had been in the 911 report in the Pearl

33
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:33,960
Harbor report

34
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:37,560
what we started to notice is a pattern a

35
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:41,840
pattern of information sharing failures

36
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:44,460
that repeated themselves across

37
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:46,020
disasters

38
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:48,299
we are now able to see the same

39
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:51,060
information tearing failures happen in

40
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:53,220
major disasters like the Virginia Tech

41
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:57,720
shooting or the deep water Horizon oil

42
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,040
spill

43
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,500
we're starting to see a repetition of

44
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:02,700
the same things

45
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,560
let me give you a couple examples and

46
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,840
then let me give you an idea of why and

47
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,818
what I'd like to do is talk about how we

48
00:02:08,818 --> 00:02:11,280
can Safeguard against these in our

49
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,260
modern era with our modern industrial

50
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:15,420
control systems

51
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:18,360
so let me give you a first example

52
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:21,239
uh conflation of Authority or ambiguity

53
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:22,920
of responsibility

54
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:26,940
so during Pearl Harbor one of the

55
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:28,860
the liaison between the Army and the

56
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:31,200
Navy was a second lieutenant

57
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,940
and you don't have to know much about

58
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:36,959
military organization or ranks to know

59
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,020
that a general and an admiral are

60
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:42,540
probably not going to listen to a second

61
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:45,000
lieutenant they are given a lot of

62
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,860
responsibility to liaise between these

63
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:47,940
organizations

64
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:50,280
but they didn't have the authority

65
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:53,220
during 9 11 we saw overlapping

66
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:56,640
responsibilities between FAA and FBI and

67
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,360
other intelligence organizations

68
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,800
each of them had enough responsibility

69
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,360
and Authority that they thought they had

70
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,040
enough information that resulted in

71
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,959
Hidden profiles of information across

72
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:09,060
the federal government which ultimately

73
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:11,879
could have potentially prevented these

74
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:14,099
terrorist attacks from happening

75
00:03:14,099 --> 00:03:16,980
in Hurricane Katrina we saw overlapping

76
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:18,720
responsibilities between the local

77
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,840
government the state government and the

78
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,040
federal government

79
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,620
and what happened was there wasn't

80
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:28,080
enough this was before by the way ICS

81
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,980
was prevalent at uh the state and local

82
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:33,900
the Indus the incident command system

83
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,280
was prevalent down at the state and

84
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:40,140
local uh uh and Municipal Municipal

85
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:41,220
governments

86
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:42,900
but but we saw this overlapping

87
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,519
responsibility result in lack of

88
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:46,739
coordinated coordination uh or

89
00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:48,239
coordinated outcomes

90
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:51,180
and even I'm in the water sector xylem

91
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:53,400
provides water Technologies

92
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,879
um so even in Oldsmar you know a a

93
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:58,500
attack on

94
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:01,080
a water utility just outside of Tampa

95
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,980
around the time of the Super Bowl

96
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:06,780
some valid credentials were used to log

97
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:09,299
into a team viewer we see the same kind

98
00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:11,879
of conflation of authority right I.T

99
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:13,620
security is responsible for the stack

100
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:16,440
which included TeamViewer OT security is

101
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,358
responsible for operations which include

102
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:21,600
a team viewer and now we see this the

103
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,639
same kind of repetition

104
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:26,639
happening again another example

105
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:28,320
failed verification of important

106
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,900
features

107
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:31,800
in um

108
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,180
in Pearl Harbor

109
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:35,100
there was a war warning sent from the

110
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:37,919
Admiral the in Washington DC to the

111
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:39,479
Admiral in Hawaii

112
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:41,940
the intent of the war warning was to

113
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:43,680
deploy the fleet

114
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,600
the actual results of the war warning

115
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,660
was a misinterpretation of what that war

116
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:51,180
warning implied

117
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:52,860
and a different set of decisions

118
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:55,080
resulting in failed collaboration

119
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,780
between Washington and Hawaii

120
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:01,139
in 911

121
00:05:01,139 --> 00:05:04,259
um attorney general Ashcroft had sent a

122
00:05:04,259 --> 00:05:06,360
brief to the immigration services

123
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:09,600
expecting them to understand this uh

124
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,440
potential for terrorist attacks

125
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:16,199
using the Takeover of airplanes and

126
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:20,040
ramming them into important targets

127
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,020
the immigration services had detained

128
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:23,820
some of these terrorists but they were

129
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:26,580
released not understanding that this

130
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:29,639
potentially could result in some kind of

131
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:31,440
disaster and the disaster happened

132
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,060
something that potentially could have

133
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:36,000
been averted and Hurricane Katrina

134
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,699
we saw personal requests that were made

135
00:05:38,699 --> 00:05:41,940
to individuals in FEMA those individuals

136
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:43,699
in FEMA

137
00:05:43,699 --> 00:05:46,139
promised the grant of these requests but

138
00:05:46,139 --> 00:05:49,199
there was no tracking system to track it

139
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:51,000
through the system and verify that these

140
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,340
kinds of decisions and actions actually

141
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:54,900
happened as a result of this information

142
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:58,320
sharing and finally even in Oldsmar

143
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:01,020
there was an operator sitting when these

144
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:02,520
valid credentials were used to log into

145
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,780
TeamViewer

146
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:06,600
and there was an assumption made that

147
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,539
this was a valid operation until they

148
00:06:09,539 --> 00:06:11,580
changed the sodium hydroxide level by

149
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:13,860
two orders of magnitude and the operator

150
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:15,720
realized something was going on and

151
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,940
changed them back

152
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:19,860
what we need the lesson that we need to

153
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:21,660
take away from this

154
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:25,560
is that this wasn't a failure in all of

155
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,699
these cases

156
00:06:26,699 --> 00:06:30,120
these weren't failures of Technology

157
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,699
the technology was adequate we had radar

158
00:06:32,699 --> 00:06:33,960
systems that were working in Hawaii

159
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,819
before Pearl Harbor

160
00:06:35,819 --> 00:06:39,720
we had intelligence processing systems

161
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:42,960
um that were working before 9 11. we had

162
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,900
the technology for information sharing

163
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:48,240
and information movement right we had

164
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,280
even

165
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:53,160
link analysis and early assessment

166
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,479
procedures that were already in

167
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:56,340
operations that had been beyond a proof

168
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:58,380
of concept

169
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:01,319
um in Hurricane Katrina we had massive

170
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:03,120
sensor operations and we were projecting

171
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,880
the the pathway and the power and the

172
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:09,300
wind speed of this hurricane

173
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:11,580
but in the end the failure was the

174
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:13,020
failure of people

175
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:14,880
and information

176
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,240
these 25 information

177
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,680
sharing failures could be valuable to us

178
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,440
because our systems are beginning to

179
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,360
become more complex

180
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:27,000
our systems are beginning to to require

181
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,340
shared responsibility

182
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:31,979
just just begin to think about how many

183
00:07:31,979 --> 00:07:33,960
of your systems are connected now how

184
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,460
many of your systems are sending

185
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:37,620
information to

186
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:40,680
remote monitoring Cloud analytics uh

187
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:44,099
third-party uh resources

188
00:07:44,099 --> 00:07:46,560
this is starting to happen more and more

189
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,259
what we're seeing is a shift

190
00:07:49,259 --> 00:07:52,020
from this kind of historical model on

191
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:53,099
the left

192
00:07:53,099 --> 00:07:56,880
where the the operator

193
00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:01,139
procures owns and operates all of their

194
00:08:01,139 --> 00:08:02,419
technology

195
00:08:02,419 --> 00:08:05,400
in organized potentially historically

196
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:08,099
according to maybe a naive Purdue model

197
00:08:08,099 --> 00:08:09,660
we should say

198
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:12,419
that was mostly hierarchical and we're

199
00:08:12,419 --> 00:08:14,460
seeing a shift towards things that look

200
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:16,560
more like what's on the right

201
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,940
complex integrated connected requiring

202
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:23,390
Partnerships I mean how many times

203
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:24,539
[Music]

204
00:08:24,539 --> 00:08:27,120
even during this conference just during

205
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,099
this conference perhaps have we heard

206
00:08:29,099 --> 00:08:32,458
things like manage security services or

207
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:35,099
cloud services or virtualization or

208
00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:36,919
containerization

209
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:40,440
software as a service and the reason why

210
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,059
this is happening is because it provides

211
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:43,500
a lot of value

212
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,600
when I first came to work for xylem one

213
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,399
of the first case studies that I started

214
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:48,480
reading

215
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,380
was a case of South Bend Indiana

216
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:56,580
this uh they were dumping about a dozen

217
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:58,200
Olympic-sized swimming pools worth of

218
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,880
Wastewater into the St Joseph River

219
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:02,279
every day because of their aging

220
00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:04,260
Wastewater system

221
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:05,880
they had an engineering consulting firm

222
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:09,600
come in estimated that to rework their

223
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,120
entire Wastewater system was going to

224
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,279
cost on the order of something like 850

225
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:15,660
million dollars

226
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:18,000
which for a small town would have

227
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,940
resulted in a cost of about eleven

228
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:23,760
thousand dollars per household

229
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,580
that is unaffordable

230
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:29,220
what we did is we installed about 200

231
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:30,959
flow and level sensors throughout their

232
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:32,040
system

233
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,779
these were connected to gateways which

234
00:09:33,779 --> 00:09:35,480
brought the traffic back to a cloud

235
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,620
analytics where we could update the

236
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:39,120
algorithm that we needed as we were

237
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,640
collecting and seeing the data

238
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,320
and in the end there was a lot of

239
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:46,200
Downstream of capacity that was

240
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,940
underutilized

241
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:51,060
and so with about a 200 million dollar

242
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:54,120
investment saving them half a billion

243
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,399
dollars in capital expenses

244
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:58,440
they were able to resolve

245
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,540
about 85 percent of all of their

246
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:02,279
overflow problems

247
00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:04,320
it also allowed us to introduce a new

248
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,040
control algorithm so instead of uh

249
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,260
having to

250
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:13,200
develop all the logic in IEC 61131

251
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,480
compliant logic and put it onto a

252
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,800
traditional controller

253
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,779
we can now pull all of this and we

254
00:10:18,779 --> 00:10:21,420
actually created kind of a little mini

255
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:23,399
stock market where these flow and level

256
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:25,019
sensors would basically bid on

257
00:10:25,019 --> 00:10:27,420
Downstream capacity based on how the

258
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:29,880
Wastewater conditions were changing

259
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,680
in the end

260
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,620
this is still saving them about one and

261
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:36,779
a half million dollars per year during

262
00:10:36,779 --> 00:10:38,100
operations

263
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,779
equal eye concentrations in the St

264
00:10:39,779 --> 00:10:41,779
Joseph's River have

265
00:10:41,779 --> 00:10:43,980
been cut in half

266
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:46,140
the

267
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:48,180
um the Overflow has been completely

268
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:51,420
eradicated during dry seasons and has

269
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:54,839
been stopped by over 70 percent uh

270
00:10:54,839 --> 00:10:56,160
overall

271
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,440
and this is because of connected digital

272
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,600
Technologies when I was at GE before I

273
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,820
came to xylem we had tons of case

274
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:05,339
studies like this where we would

275
00:11:05,339 --> 00:11:08,279
connect through an edge controller back

276
00:11:08,279 --> 00:11:11,339
to some kind of a data warehouse where

277
00:11:11,339 --> 00:11:14,279
the analysis of of the life cycle of the

278
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:16,380
turbines with the operations and the

279
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:18,600
operational conditions and the market

280
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:21,959
prices of gas per cubic square foot and

281
00:11:21,959 --> 00:11:23,760
wholesale prices of electricity were all

282
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,820
included into how to optimize an

283
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,980
operation some of these cases were

284
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:31,500
saving companies over 100 million

285
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,760
dollars a year

286
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:36,180
in oil and gas we were paying third

287
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:38,279
parties to come in and access this

288
00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:42,300
operations data and we were able to do

289
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:45,120
predictive maintenance in a way that

290
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,600
it would save them 20 30 40 million

291
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,820
dollars a year because they're able to

292
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:52,560
now predict when their systems need

293
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,820
maintenance and when they're going to

294
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:54,839
fail

295
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:58,459
this highly complex and integrated

296
00:11:58,459 --> 00:12:02,160
architectures are not going to go away

297
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,959
and not only that but it's going to

298
00:12:03,959 --> 00:12:06,120
require an increasing amount of

299
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,800
information sharing it's going to

300
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,420
require an increasing amount of

301
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:10,860
collaboration

302
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:13,860
in order to accomplish the collaborative

303
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:17,040
outcomes that we desire from these next

304
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:20,459
generation of industrial control systems

305
00:12:20,459 --> 00:12:22,320
and so the question is

306
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,180
how do we Safeguard against these

307
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:26,100
information sharing failures

308
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:28,980
in securing of our industrial control

309
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:32,040
systems and their supply chains

310
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:34,620
so the first lesson of History that's

311
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:35,880
really important that I want to

312
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,560
emphasize

313
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,060
is that when the goal of information

314
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:42,600
sharing is to share information

315
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,940
then typically all of these 25

316
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:48,600
information sharing failures occur

317
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,360
and information sharing doesn't succeed

318
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,820
we have to flip the goal first

319
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:56,459
the goal of information sharing must be

320
00:12:56,459 --> 00:12:58,740
collaborative outcomes

321
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:00,420
when the goal of information sharing is

322
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:02,639
collaborative outcomes then we start to

323
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:03,779
see some structure of information

324
00:13:03,779 --> 00:13:06,120
sharing take place that can actually

325
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:09,000
evoke the kind of actions decisions and

326
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,399
actions that are necessary to accomplish

327
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:13,560
these end objectives

328
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:16,620
and so what happens is we start to

329
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:20,639
obtain what I'm calling in this slide a

330
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:23,639
common stewardship of information this

331
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:26,100
isn't to say open sharing or publicly

332
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:29,339
available right this isn't this is uh

333
00:13:29,339 --> 00:13:32,160
still implying protection of information

334
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,779
but we're protecting each other's

335
00:13:33,779 --> 00:13:35,160
information

336
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:37,500
and we're starting to create this

337
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,620
atmosphere of a shared responsibility

338
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:43,139
between the component supplier the

339
00:13:43,139 --> 00:13:45,300
supplier and the end user

340
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:47,459
so there are three major pieces of

341
00:13:47,459 --> 00:13:49,079
successful information sharing when we

342
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:51,300
start to flip this Paradigm for

343
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,279
collaborative outcomes so on the very

344
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,420
right

345
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:56,360
uh right hand side of this diagram

346
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:59,639
collaborative outcomes Drive what kind

347
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:01,560
of information we need to fuse

348
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:04,139
and how we need to fuse it because it

349
00:14:04,139 --> 00:14:05,940
determines what kind of decisions and

350
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:08,459
actions need to be coordinated

351
00:14:08,459 --> 00:14:11,220
that then results in us helping us to

352
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:12,720
Define these communication channels

353
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,940
which by the way is the easiest part

354
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:17,940
having the common communication

355
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,500
for being able to push and pull

356
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:22,260
information that's the easy part

357
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:24,839
and then those channels help to Define

358
00:14:24,839 --> 00:14:27,120
these partnership models that we need in

359
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,120
order to collect

360
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,700
derive share that information through

361
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:34,500
these communication channels so let me

362
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:37,860
give you examples of how this has worked

363
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:42,360
so the first example is food Shield

364
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,279
so I don't know if you guys remember but

365
00:14:44,279 --> 00:14:46,920
uh about a decade or so ago there was

366
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:49,560
some contaminated salsa

367
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:52,320
um a government organization basically

368
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,860
blamed it on tomatoes from

369
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:56,420
Florida

370
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:58,820
destroyed the Tomato

371
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:01,860
destroyed an entire tomato crop from

372
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:03,320
Florida ravaged their Community

373
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:06,000
companies went out of business

374
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,459
about nine months or so later after all

375
00:15:08,459 --> 00:15:10,620
the testing and supply chain tracking

376
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:12,240
was done they learned that it was

377
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,779
peppers from Mexico

378
00:15:15,779 --> 00:15:19,440
and so this was a problem and so the

379
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,959
question was how does this food

380
00:15:21,959 --> 00:15:24,360
Emergency Response Team

381
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:28,620
enable this ability to get those who

382
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:31,199
have the information right the the

383
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:34,199
product uh manufacturers

384
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:36,899
access to the testing facilities

385
00:15:36,899 --> 00:15:38,779
and how do they push the information

386
00:15:38,779 --> 00:15:42,899
from the testing facilities into a a an

387
00:15:42,899 --> 00:15:44,699
analytic environment where they can go

388
00:15:44,699 --> 00:15:47,100
through and Trace back what is necessary

389
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:49,139
in order to actually determine these

390
00:15:49,139 --> 00:15:50,040
things

391
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,139
so they created this thing called food

392
00:15:52,139 --> 00:15:53,279
Shield

393
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:55,920
which has a set a predefined set of

394
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,899
collaborative outcomes that are desired

395
00:15:57,899 --> 00:16:00,480
the testing the audits the supply chain

396
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,740
tracing

397
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:03,899
they derived a set of document

398
00:16:03,899 --> 00:16:06,839
repositories and communication channels

399
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:08,040
where that information could be

400
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:10,320
available and even communication about

401
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,360
who's going to pay for the testing and

402
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:14,220
which facility is going to pay what

403
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:16,260
facility and how that money transfer is

404
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:17,519
going to happen

405
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:19,800
and then on the partnership side they

406
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,420
established something called a common

407
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:24,240
organizational registry environment so

408
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,399
they defined all of the roles that were

409
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:28,620
necessary in order to accomplish these

410
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:29,820
collaborative outcomes in this

411
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:30,959
environment

412
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:35,040
and then companies suppliers

413
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:38,639
food vendors transport testing they

414
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:39,899
could come in and they could register

415
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:42,540
their employees according to the roles

416
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:44,519
that they would need to be able to

417
00:16:44,519 --> 00:16:46,920
participate in the result

418
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:50,399
is a food emergency nowadays typically

419
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:53,220
is resolved within 72 hours

420
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:56,339
it went from months to days

421
00:16:56,339 --> 00:16:58,019
because they focused on collaborative

422
00:16:58,019 --> 00:17:00,420
outcomes not just on a document sharing

423
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:04,319
repository or creating some kind of a

424
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:06,179
joint

425
00:17:06,179 --> 00:17:06,900
um

426
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:09,660
uh analytic product

427
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:11,459
it was driven by these collaborative

428
00:17:11,459 --> 00:17:13,619
outcomes that were defined

429
00:17:13,619 --> 00:17:15,419
another example

430
00:17:15,419 --> 00:17:17,280
we don't yet have the verdict of history

431
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,660
on this

432
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:21,119
but this example

433
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:24,000
demonstrates a lot of these types of

434
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,819
behaviors that we want in good strong

435
00:17:26,819 --> 00:17:28,980
information sharing systems

436
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:31,860
so the article went something like this

437
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:35,460
um this is from New York Times as Russia

438
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:38,360
is rolling their tanks into Ukraine

439
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:41,940
Microsoft is discovering doing the final

440
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:44,220
analysis of some new malware

441
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:47,039
and uh they have the authority to

442
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:48,900
collect this kind of information they

443
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:51,059
have the organization that incentivizes

444
00:17:51,059 --> 00:17:53,160
them to collect this information and to

445
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:55,080
share it with their customers

446
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:57,600
they have uh communication channels

447
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,940
particularly with their customers in

448
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:01,860
order to get this information out

449
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:03,480
and they know that they want to

450
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:06,120
influence the

451
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:08,460
decisions and actions of those who are

452
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:11,480
using their systems

453
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:14,160
so what happens in the story is the

454
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,660
director of this Microsoft threat

455
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:18,179
Intelligence Center calls up miss Ann

456
00:18:18,179 --> 00:18:20,760
nurenberger who's the uh

457
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:23,280
uh Deputy National Security advisor for

458
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,620
cyber security in the white house and he

459
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:26,820
says hey we have this new information

460
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:28,799
about this new malware

461
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:30,780
we believe that it's relevant to what

462
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:31,860
you're doing

463
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:34,740
do you need more information about it

464
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:37,140
she then connects them with uh according

465
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:39,539
to the New York Times article uh all the

466
00:18:39,539 --> 00:18:40,799
people that they need and eventually

467
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:43,919
Microsoft threat Intel Center is sending

468
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:45,600
this information to the baltics the

469
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,919
Baltic states and to Poland in order to

470
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:52,320
enhance their ability to be protected

471
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,640
now

472
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,860
what I started learning about is that

473
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:57,960
this is part of these this joint cyber

474
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:00,179
defense collaborative that's emerging

475
00:19:00,179 --> 00:19:03,120
now in this particular case

476
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:03,720
um

477
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,220
there are some things that weren't clear

478
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:07,080
in the public facing information right

479
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:09,960
one of these common information sharing

480
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:12,480
failures is the conflation of formal

481
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,780
versus personal relationships

482
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:17,039
so

483
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:18,799
it's still

484
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:21,360
the verdict of History has not yet been

485
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:24,059
unfolded in this case and even with

486
00:19:24,059 --> 00:19:26,220
these collaborative outcomes

487
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:28,559
there is this uh one of these common

488
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:30,179
information sharing failures where

489
00:19:30,179 --> 00:19:32,880
things are so rigid and so structured

490
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,100
that they fail to be able to account for

491
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:37,260
these exigent circumstances

492
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:39,299
these unusual circumstances that emerge

493
00:19:39,299 --> 00:19:40,559
whenever you have a complex system

494
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:42,360
that's operating

495
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:46,799
so I was I am really excited about this

496
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:48,660
announcement of this joint cyber defense

497
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:50,400
collaborative for industrial control

498
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,440
systems

499
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:55,740
um as I've been looking into what it is

500
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:58,440
and learning about how it's structured

501
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,919
it is structured around accomplishing

502
00:20:00,919 --> 00:20:03,600
collaborative outcomes

503
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,960
they want to change the Paradigm from

504
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,059
information sharing

505
00:20:09,059 --> 00:20:12,480
for sharing of information's sake to

506
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,179
operational collaboration

507
00:20:15,179 --> 00:20:18,419
where they're able to Leverage The the

508
00:20:18,419 --> 00:20:21,780
value of not just information but

509
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:24,059
organizational structure collection

510
00:20:24,059 --> 00:20:27,799
activities incentives where

511
00:20:27,799 --> 00:20:31,860
organizations that were listed by

512
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:34,020
uh director easterly earlier earlier

513
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:36,360
this morning are already collecting

514
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,280
these kinds of information so the

515
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:41,160
question is what will the verdict of

516
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:45,059
History be and so up on this slide

517
00:20:45,059 --> 00:20:47,100
it's clear from public resources that

518
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:48,600
they've already put safeguards in place

519
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:51,059
against probably a majority of these

520
00:20:51,059 --> 00:20:52,559
information sharing failures and the

521
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:53,820
question will be

522
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:55,799
can they put them in place for

523
00:20:55,799 --> 00:20:57,780
everything else

524
00:20:57,780 --> 00:21:00,539
so what are these collaborative outcomes

525
00:21:00,539 --> 00:21:03,600
in in for industrial control systems

526
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,400
so I'm thinking they fit probably into

527
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,960
four categories and I think it's

528
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,700
important that these four categories

529
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:11,340
cover the entire supply chain

530
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:13,919
on the left hand side we need to secure

531
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:17,220
products right we need secure boot root

532
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:19,799
of trust chain of trust we need to have

533
00:21:19,799 --> 00:21:22,260
the ability to look into these products

534
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:23,340
and see whether there are

535
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:25,440
vulnerabilities before commercialization

536
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,780
we need to have chain of trust go all

537
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:29,400
the way up to update mechanisms and

538
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,380
Communications drivers and these

539
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:32,940
communications drivers need to start

540
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:34,620
being able to

541
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:37,380
uniquely identify endpoints

542
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:39,780
sign message signed the messages for

543
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:41,880
integrity verification encrypt and

544
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:44,880
obfuscates author authorize right so we

545
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,280
need to start building secure products

546
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,679
on the right hand side it's not enough

547
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:51,900
to build secure products because

548
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:53,940
Microsoft might build a secure Excel

549
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:55,799
spreadsheet but if you put your social

550
00:21:55,799 --> 00:21:57,480
security numbers in it and post it onto

551
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,580
the internet it can't be Microsoft's

552
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:00,360
fault

553
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,880
and so we need to have these secure

554
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,640
deployment mechanisms where we are able

555
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:08,220
to architect these products together in

556
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:10,260
a way that they become the solution that

557
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:12,360
we need that's that the solution that is

558
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:13,980
secure by Design

559
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:16,440
now on the bottom now we're starting to

560
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:18,780
get into the operator's domain

561
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:20,880
we need continuous health and monitoring

562
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,440
of these systems and then finally we

563
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:25,020
need incident response so these are

564
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:26,100
going to be these four collaborative

565
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:28,020
outcomes but if we look

566
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:30,780
there's kind of a problem in terms of

567
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:32,880
who is able to do what along the

568
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:33,840
Spectrum

569
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,299
and for illustration purposes on the

570
00:22:36,299 --> 00:22:38,460
left is the product supplier

571
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:41,039
right the product supplier we should be

572
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:43,380
paying attention to products and we are

573
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:45,059
we should be building security into

574
00:22:45,059 --> 00:22:47,520
products we are providing security

575
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,860
context into secure deployment guides

576
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:52,260
we're trying to help integrators to do

577
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:54,299
this kind of secure architecture

578
00:22:54,299 --> 00:22:56,580
as we move over to the integrators

579
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:58,200
they're paying attention to which

580
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,760
products they're selecting they're

581
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,740
paying attention to the architecture and

582
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:03,419
they might even be setting the stage for

583
00:23:03,419 --> 00:23:05,820
a collection management framework for

584
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:08,880
enabling sorry continuous monitoring as

585
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,740
the system is deployed

586
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:13,200
and then over on the right hand side the

587
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,100
operator

588
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:17,039
is doing this this type of continuous

589
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:19,380
monitoring and then instant response but

590
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:21,240
you'll notice that there's not a single

591
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,620
player here

592
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:24,480
that does it all

593
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,820
and so the question is how do we move

594
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:29,880
push and pull information in a way that

595
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,799
it will actually promote coordinated

596
00:23:31,799 --> 00:23:34,320
actions and decisions that will drive

597
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,059
this kind of security

598
00:23:36,059 --> 00:23:39,960
so I wanted to give maybe an example

599
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:43,440
from my recent experience

600
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,360
we wanted to develop a Gateway in order

601
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:48,360
to meet market prices we had to use we

602
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:51,360
needed to use a third-party platform

603
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:54,600
we decided on what security outcomes we

604
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,940
wanted to and we negotiated into the

605
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:58,980
statement of work that they would work

606
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:00,780
with us to accomplish these security

607
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:04,440
outcomes so one of them was a secure by

608
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:07,020
Design architecture on this Gateway

609
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:10,700
and uh so we we sat with

610
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:13,799
our component supplier and we did a

611
00:24:13,799 --> 00:24:15,539
threat model together

612
00:24:15,539 --> 00:24:17,100
right a threat model is this process

613
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:20,159
where you lay out all the data flows you

614
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:21,600
then go through each of the data flows

615
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,120
and talk about how you could spoof it

616
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:26,340
tamper it repudiate deny service

617
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:29,340
disclose information right on each of

618
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:31,020
these data flows and then you decide on

619
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:32,600
a control

620
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:35,220
a control design

621
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:37,740
when we first began this process

622
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:39,900
the supplier really thought that we were

623
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:42,059
calling their baby ugly

624
00:24:42,059 --> 00:24:44,340
but as we worked together towards this

625
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:46,679
outcome and as we shared information

626
00:24:46,679 --> 00:24:50,039
about our overall design of how we were

627
00:24:50,039 --> 00:24:52,080
going to use this Gateway there and they

628
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,880
shared information about their design of

629
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,320
their component itself

630
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:58,200
we were able to find new sources of

631
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,840
entropy on the hardware that they were

632
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:03,600
already using which enabled us to do

633
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,640
different kinds of things in in the way

634
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,740
that we chain trust we were able to

635
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:09,020
enforce

636
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:12,020
authentication on every single

637
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:14,580
port and wire that's sticking out of

638
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:16,760
this device that could be connected to

639
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:19,980
and then finally when we were doing the

640
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:22,020
manufacturing process we worked with

641
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:24,720
them to figure out a way that we could

642
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,820
chain trust up to

643
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:29,159
a certificate signing request that would

644
00:25:29,159 --> 00:25:31,200
be generated on the firmware we could

645
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,600
then give the third party uh

646
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,840
manufacturer a special API key that we

647
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:37,799
could track

648
00:25:37,799 --> 00:25:39,779
they could then call an API at our

649
00:25:39,779 --> 00:25:41,159
certificate Authority which would then

650
00:25:41,159 --> 00:25:43,200
go and get that certificate signing

651
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,600
request sign it from the chain of trust

652
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,700
we then on our site could take that

653
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:50,760
chain of trust put it in our iot shadow

654
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:52,620
configuration for how it connects to the

655
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:54,840
cloud and these devices can now

656
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:56,640
self-provision

657
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,440
we don't have to trust the third party

658
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:00,419
supplier because we've worked out an

659
00:26:00,419 --> 00:26:01,620
architecture

660
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:05,580
that was Innovative in the context and

661
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:07,440
it was Innovative because it resulted

662
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,460
from

663
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:10,320
two-way information sharing that was

664
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,880
geared towards these collaborative

665
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,980
outcomes

666
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:16,260
so the bottom line that I hope that you

667
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:19,679
take away from this is that there are

668
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:21,779
these 25 common information sharing

669
00:26:21,779 --> 00:26:24,299
failures we are going to be subject to

670
00:26:24,299 --> 00:26:28,140
them if we focus on sharing information

671
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:30,960
one example that I would like us to

672
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,799
reconsider is security questionnaires

673
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:36,900
security questionnaires are designed for

674
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:39,000
the purpose of sharing information not

675
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,679
for collaborative outcomes they're

676
00:26:40,679 --> 00:26:41,880
expensive

677
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:43,799
and they're easily defeated

678
00:26:43,799 --> 00:26:46,440
by anyone who attempts to to overcome

679
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:47,520
them

680
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,500
this isn't information sharing that's

681
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:51,360
going to drive collaborative outcomes

682
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,460
that we desire the ones that will

683
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:58,380
actually help to protect our systems

684
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:00,960
and as we Embrace this idea of

685
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,520
collaborative outcomes what we will

686
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,140
start to realize

687
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:08,220
is that there emerges this need for a

688
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:10,020
shared responsibility

689
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:12,659
the owner's operators the utilities

690
00:27:12,659 --> 00:27:15,720
are going to have to start sharing this

691
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:18,720
responsibility with the suppliers and

692
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,340
the suppliers are going to have to step

693
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:23,640
up and start providing increased amounts

694
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:26,520
of visibility understanding and control

695
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:29,340
to those customers for whom they're

696
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:30,480
providing

697
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:33,419
these connected Digital Services

698
00:27:33,419 --> 00:27:35,220
this is what will result in

699
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:36,900
collaborative outcomes and this is what

700
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:39,000
will help us to accomplish industrial

701
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,580
Control Systems cyber security across a

702
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:43,679
complex supply chain with the next

703
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:45,720
generation of digital and connected

704
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:47,400
Technologies

705
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,020
so

706
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:51,120
if you replay this and want to pause you

707
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,279
can prove it to yourself here's all the

708
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:55,080
sources that go through everything that

709
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,220
I talked about

710
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:57,720
and I hope that this starts a

711
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:59,340
conversation about

712
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:00,779
collaborative outcomes and shared

713
00:28:00,779 --> 00:28:04,640
responsibilities thank you
