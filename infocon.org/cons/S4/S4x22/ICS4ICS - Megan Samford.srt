1
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:08,240
hi everyone it's great to be here

2
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:09,200
so

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:10,960
there are two types of people in the

4
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,599
world and uh when i just said that if

5
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:15,360
you're 30 something or 40 something

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,840
female you probably in your mind want it

7
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:18,880
to say

8
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,560
the ones that entertain and the ones

9
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:21,760
that observe

10
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,320
no so what i'm really talking about is

11
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,240
emergency management so in emergency

12
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,800
management we say there are people that

13
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,880
naturally run away from emergencies and

14
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,238
then there are people that counter

15
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:34,559
phobically run towards them

16
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:36,960
so i have always been one of the latter

17
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,600
in my family my grandfather was a fire

18
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,000
chief my mom was a paramedic before i

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,800
was born my cousin still is a volunteer

20
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,039
firefighter at the same station that

21
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:49,120
that our grandfather was chief at so

22
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,840
this has naturally been

23
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,160
a stream kind of a current that has run

24
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,520
throughout my life

25
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,600
and when people ask me how did you get

26
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,600
into ics security like tell me your

27
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,600
story how did you get to where you are

28
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,080
the truth is that um i started in

29
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,840
government i worked for the commonwealth

30
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,600
of virginia doing traditional critical

31
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,200
infrastructure protection we're talking

32
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:14,080
like 2007 2008 time frame and i learned

33
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,640
incident command system i learned nymphs

34
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,360
i learned the foundations of emergency

35
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,000
management and from that i met a

36
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,400
gentleman that was working at ge named

37
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,119
corey jackson and he changed my life

38
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:29,200
because he said you know megan i've

39
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,640
known your work through the commonwealth

40
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,079
of virginia i know that you know

41
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:34,240
emergency response i know that you know

42
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,720
how to run incidents and so i want to

43
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,640
recruit you into ge

44
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,960
and so um for years i i i basically was

45
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,560
like i don't know i kind of feel like an

46
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,759
imposter i'm an emergency manager

47
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:49,759
trying to get into cyber security trying

48
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:51,840
to understand it but he he gave me a

49
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,320
chance and so i just want to say that's

50
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:58,240
how i got here and the other night um we

51
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,600
were talking with some folks of course

52
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,000
at beer isaac and they said yeah like

53
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,759
what what what are what are nicknames

54
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:05,600
that people have well everyone you know

55
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,720
commonly knows me as megan tron but my

56
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,280
real first nickname that i loved the

57
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,080
most also happened at ge

58
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,120
my real nickname was pcert pcert stands

59
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,120
for product security incident response

60
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,160
team true story you can ask folks at ge

61
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,680
that were working there maybe six or

62
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,040
seven years ago

63
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,160
i um i had given birth to my son so he's

64
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,239
six now he turned seven in august so

65
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:32,160
that's roughly the time frame and

66
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,840
something had happened and the sock

67
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,280
director said

68
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,959
when's peace or getting back from

69
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:38,879
maternity leave so

70
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:39,920
um

71
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,000
it was cool and that that made me feel

72
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,080
good because it made me feel needed but

73
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,080
through that though the more i thought

74
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,800
about it i said there are a lot of good

75
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,120
principles from emergency management

76
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,360
that we should be importing and and

77
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,080
dropping into cyber cyber does not need

78
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,000
to be unique we don't need to reinvent

79
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,599
the wheel and so that's what i'm going

80
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:01,440
to talk to you about today is i'm going

81
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,840
to update you on three things the first

82
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,920
is what has happened in the past two

83
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,720
years with the ics for ics program

84
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,560
incident command system for industrial

85
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,120
control systems what happened secondly

86
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,680
we did a huge exercise on monday it was

87
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,360
awesome if you couldn't be there it was

88
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,120
recorded definitely go back and check it

89
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,040
out and then lastly i'm going to talk a

90
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,640
little bit about what are the next steps

91
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,120
and how can each of you be involved

92
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,959
i would just have a quick show of hands

93
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:28,959
how many of you all have participated in

94
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:31,200
responding to a cyber incident as part

95
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:35,040
of your role now or or in the past even

96
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,120
yeah so i mean most of us here right so

97
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,280
i think i hope that you find the content

98
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,760
relevant and my ask of you all is that

99
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,000
after this talk go back and do some

100
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,680
research and see what you want to copy

101
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,599
and steal i'm a big fan of the case

102
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:48,959
methodology

103
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:51,280
it means copy and steal everything it's

104
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,040
okay we need to be sharing the

105
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,560
information

106
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,360
so

107
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,760
bringing it back present

108
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,920
two years ago what did we discuss we

109
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,920
discussed we didn't have a common

110
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,239
response framework which makes scaling

111
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:06,400
incidents nearly impossible outside of a

112
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,200
singular company that's it you know dale

113
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,040
says in your prep like make your one

114
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,959
minute count it's kind of like a pete

115
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:14,959
davidson moment where i'm like we don't

116
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:17,600
have response scans at scale that's it

117
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,880
that's a statement right

118
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,120
the next was the cost that we were all

119
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,120
bearing due to poorly coordinated

120
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,400
responses

121
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,560
i saw the hands out there

122
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,360
and

123
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,080
you're not alone this stuff is hard uh

124
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,720
response fatigue is a very real thing

125
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,840
and so we know that these responses and

126
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,759
the lack of efficiency within the

127
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:42,000
responses it's costing us all it's

128
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,600
costing us people because they get

129
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,360
fatigued and they leave

130
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,320
it's costing us people money and stuff

131
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,400
okay and so that's really what we want

132
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,400
to save when we talk about resources and

133
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,599
responding appropriately

134
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:57,600
the next point was that

135
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,800
to this day

136
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,400
cyber was the only and is the only

137
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,720
designated federal disaster type not

138
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,800
currently using incident command system

139
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,720
for its response framework seriously

140
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,759
look it up don't take my word for it

141
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:14,080
there are two types of disasters

142
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,800
man-made and natural cyber obviously

143
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,560
falls under man-made

144
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,039
we're the only one not formally adopting

145
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:24,280
the system

146
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,320
the next is the incident command system

147
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,520
solves for many if not most of the 25

148
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,400
common failures of modern catastrophes

149
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,240
if you don't know him dr kenneth

150
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,479
crowther is one of my favorite people in

151
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:38,320
this industry he's one of the most

152
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,479
humble he's one of the most genuine and

153
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:41,919
i believe that he's presenting on this

154
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:43,759
topic here definitely

155
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:45,840
check out that talk as well but incident

156
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,000
command system does address the points

157
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,400
that he will bring up and basically for

158
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,440
the past 250 years when they examined

159
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,720
events like

160
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,880
pearl harbor 911

161
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,520
they all had roughly the same 25

162
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,520
failures that they saw in the response

163
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,240
every single time

164
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,720
the next was that we needed some

165
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,280
consistency in cyber incident response

166
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,319
roles

167
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:11,039
so

168
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:12,720
many of you all in the audience i saw

169
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,639
your hands you you have some degree of

170
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:15,759
experience

171
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:18,400
and so with that when you go job to job

172
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,240
or um even if you were supporting

173
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,400
another organization that you didn't

174
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,400
know that well wouldn't it be nice just

175
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,160
like first responders have today

176
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,960
paramedics firefighters to say this is

177
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,960
what i'm credentialed to this is what i

178
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,720
have trained to i've taken the fema

179
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,720
training i have the experience

180
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,319
you can depend on a reliable experience

181
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:40,400
and a reliable training experience with

182
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,720
me as a responder and that's really what

183
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,199
typing the assets is about

184
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:48,479
i i would i would uh i would make a bet

185
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:50,639
if you look at critical infrastructure

186
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:53,120
statistics if 85

187
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,880
of critical infrastructure is owned and

188
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,039
operated by the private sector

189
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:59,840
do we also believe under that same logic

190
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,120
that 85 of our response force is in the

191
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,599
private sector we do not have an

192
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:07,360
accurate way to count the number of

193
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,759
cyber responders we have how many

194
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:12,880
malware reverse engineers we have versus

195
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,440
network communications analysts we we

196
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,440
don't know we don't know we don't know

197
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,160
nationwide and in many cases i don't

198
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,160
even know if we know company by company

199
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,560
okay so this is really about better

200
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,240
management of the resources that we have

201
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,120
available to us

202
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:32,080
and of course yes we did we talked about

203
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,240
chainsaw strike teams and tree removal

204
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,199
task forces and i bring that up because

205
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:38,880
when i first got on this stage two years

206
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,199
ago it's a bit intimidating it's a bit

207
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:42,800
terrifying because you can't really see

208
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,240
into the audience and there's these

209
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,120
lights and i really heard no reaction to

210
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,960
what i was saying an incident command

211
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,720
system for industrial control systems

212
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,280
was a super new concept and so i was

213
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,199
like oh i don't know if this is going so

214
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:57,840
well but then i said i said something

215
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,919
about chainsaws and strike teams and

216
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:01,360
people were like yeah

217
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,280
yeah we we want to know more about this

218
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,280
so i had to bring that up i had to go

219
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,280
out on a limb there which you may want

220
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,800
to be careful with

221
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,800
if the chainsaw strike team is running

222
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,879
around

223
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:15,280
and through all of this it was enough to

224
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,120
give the effort the momentum the

225
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,039
volunteers and the sponsorship through

226
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:21,520
the isa global cyber security alliance

227
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,319
to get this off the ground and so

228
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,240
special thanks to two people right off

229
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,879
the gate dale peterson this talk would

230
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:30,720
be nothing it was a phone conversation

231
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,399
three years ago and he said megan i

232
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:33,919
think that this could actually be a

233
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:35,279
really good idea that could work this

234
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:37,440
could do a lot of good and secondly is

235
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,080
andre rostano he's the managing director

236
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,880
of the isa gca and he said i think that

237
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,720
there's a lot of weight behind this he

238
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,880
put the resources and the funding and

239
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,560
everything behind it so

240
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,040
if you see andre please thank him

241
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,440
because he's been kind of the heart and

242
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,880
the lungs behind this as well

243
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,600
so um i had this ridiculous picture of

244
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,560
me up here i i did have the opportunity

245
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,560
to testify before congress

246
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,480
it was the honor of my life being a

247
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,480
little girl from nowhereville in

248
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,000
southern virginia

249
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
this this was something that in my life

250
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,440
i never would have thought that i would

251
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,040
have had the chance to do something like

252
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,440
that but it was a huge

253
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,360
credit to department of homeland

254
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,680
security and others that said this needs

255
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,360
to get in front of congress they need to

256
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,440
be updated on what this is and see what

257
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,839
momentum we can we can further get

258
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:29,839
behind it but really in my talk to

259
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:31,839
congress i talked about a few points i

260
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:33,680
talked about the fact that a little bit

261
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,279
of what i just discussed with you all in

262
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:37,600
that we have non-standard terminology

263
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,839
against responding entities every

264
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:42,720
company has their own playbook and it's

265
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,640
written for that company and it's

266
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,800
normally pretty lengthy but it's not

267
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,560
interoperable we don't have common

268
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,080
language

269
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,519
again it goes back to the scaling

270
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:53,680
problem but there's a general lack of

271
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,600
capability to expand and contract

272
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,839
staffing and other resources

273
00:09:57,839 --> 00:09:59,600
non-standard and non-integrated

274
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,760
communications as well as a lack of

275
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,480
consolidated action plans and so again

276
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,000
i do want to thank congress for the

277
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,240
opportunity to present to them and the

278
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,240
key thing that i asked of congress at

279
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,480
that time was they said well from a

280
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,200
policy perspective how could congress

281
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,600
begin to take steps to

282
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,680
to get this into action how do we do

283
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,200
this from a policy perspective and i

284
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,320
said the easiest policy or where there's

285
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,079
precedent in the past at least is with

286
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:28,079
homeland security presidential directive

287
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:30,320
5 hspd5

288
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,279
which mandated the uh

289
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:35,680
the alignment and it mandated federal

290
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,839
agencies to follow incident command

291
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:40,399
system following 911 and since they've

292
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:41,600
done that

293
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,200
they've seen tremendous efficiencies

294
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,800
obviously in their response and so what

295
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:48,399
i suggested as i said i'm i'm not i'm

296
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:50,640
not supportive of uh the federal

297
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,800
government mandating the private sector

298
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,360
to adopt incident command system

299
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:59,040
but i i would be very favorable to hspd5

300
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,480
being updated

301
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,120
to highly encourage the adoption of

302
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,800
incident command system within the

303
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,720
private sector and so that's where that

304
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,040
landed

305
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,800
so where are we today

306
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:15,760
we have over 1 000 global volunteers

307
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,279
we completed our first round of

308
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:18,800
credentialing of cyber incident

309
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:22,079
commanders it was mark bristow neil gay

310
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:25,920
brian wisniewski and myself

311
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:28,800
and we're currently also now using

312
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,399
remember the credentialing and the

313
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:32,480
typing thing i just talked about we're

314
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,800
now using the fema one responder system

315
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,360
to hold our credentials so we're working

316
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,800
hand in hand with department of homeland

317
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,360
security and and thank you so much to

318
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,720
department of homeland security for

319
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,399
offering this capability to us it was

320
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:47,519
exactly what we needed

321
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,399
and oh by the way everything that i'm

322
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,880
talking about today is it's free really

323
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:56,959
i'm not i'm not selling you anything

324
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:57,839
so

325
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:00,399
over the past two years i i want to be

326
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:02,320
completely honest with you all i i have

327
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,000
a full-time job which keeps me busy

328
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,279
already

329
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:08,079
i have a family and so everything that

330
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:10,079
has been done over the past two years it

331
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:12,800
has been a volunteer army and so i i

332
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,440
wanted to take a moment and thank mark

333
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,440
bode and philip coach they they

334
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,600
developed the exercise materials

335
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,120
catherine hutton unfortunately couldn't

336
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,120
be here with us this week she wanted to

337
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,200
be but she's been leading the awareness

338
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,360
and outreach efforts michael chaney

339
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,040
thank you so much he's been leading the

340
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,399
training team

341
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:32,560
eric peterson thank you

342
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,880
ann marie vanderkirk as well as dirgesh

343
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,279
kayla for developing the ics for ics

344
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:39,680
certification process and

345
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,000
being kind of liaisons with fema on

346
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,760
getting used to the one responder system

347
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,079
and getting that stood up so thank you

348
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:48,720
all to all of the global volunteers that

349
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,720
have made this possible it hasn't been

350
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,360
me it has been everyone else and so

351
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,200
that's that's why we

352
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,519
we get the opportunity to be here today

353
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:00,000
my boss bruno he always says when we

354
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,320
when we solve hard problems

355
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,399
we earn the right to try to solve

356
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:06,399
tougher problems and so that's really

357
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:09,519
what this is about right now

358
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:11,440
so i'm going to give you just a really

359
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,760
quick kind of down and dirty ics for ics

360
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,839
on-ramp so you have context into what in

361
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:17,839
the world were we exercising again what

362
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:19,440
is the system for in case you weren't

363
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,600
here two years ago

364
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,680
so um this is

365
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,600
someone said the other day

366
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,279
i think they it was someone from mandia

367
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:29,760
they said it is incident command system

368
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,200
in a nutshell

369
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,920
is the most basic form of rocket science

370
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,760
you will ever use okay

371
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,240
so ics for ics for purposes of our

372
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,079
discussion today which by the way i

373
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:41,920
really could make the argument that ics

374
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,079
for ics certainly is applicable to

375
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:46,079
managing any type of cyber incident it

376
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:47,760
doesn't necessarily have to be one

377
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,920
involving control systems but three

378
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,040
components

379
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,440
industrial control systems uh cyber

380
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,199
security the traditional computer

381
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:57,600
incident response teams and industrial

382
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,920
control systems incident command system

383
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,519
and industrial control systems my

384
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:03,199
apologies

385
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:04,000
so

386
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,720
this is the methodology around fema

387
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,720
planning processes your local first

388
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,959
responders this planning cycle would

389
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:12,720
look super familiar to them they all

390
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,560
know it so it involves planning

391
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:18,000
organizing training equipping exercising

392
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,120
evaluating and taking corrective action

393
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,360
i want to make a brief comment on this

394
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,199
slide

395
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:28,480
i see exercises in many organizations

396
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,639
whether it's a facilitated discussion

397
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:32,880
which is kind of a very informal laid

398
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,399
back it's it's really a learning

399
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:37,199
opportunity people are using exercises

400
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:39,040
to train their staff they're not

401
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,800
actually training on their response

402
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,639
plans so they're skipping

403
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:44,560
they're skipping so much they're going

404
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,680
from planning to exercising and so i do

405
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,600
encourage you all follow the complete

406
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,600
cycle you're going to see productivity

407
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,079
from that

408
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:56,560
the next is why use incident command

409
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:59,120
system anyway it's a standard approach

410
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,279
it's proven to be effective i mean i

411
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:02,880
said the other day in the exercise you

412
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:03,600
know

413
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,199
why why

414
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:07,199
could i or should i

415
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:09,839
just being a person in cyber believe

416
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:12,000
that i could create a response framework

417
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,079
and structure that is somehow better

418
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:16,079
than what first responders globally have

419
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:18,560
been using since the 1970s

420
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,880
i don't think that we can and we want to

421
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:23,279
be integrating with them as well

422
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:26,079
ics for ics also gives you unity of

423
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:28,079
unity of command

424
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:30,880
it gives you clarity of responsibilities

425
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,800
it gives you span of control what span

426
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,399
of control means and this is very

427
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:35,600
significant when you're running

428
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,839
incidents is that

429
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:39,680
the best span of control is no one

430
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,680
person should have more than five people

431
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,079
they are managing during an incident

432
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:46,800
um i'm sorry i just misspoke they should

433
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,959
have no more than seven it's three

434
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:51,759
minimum seven is max with five being

435
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:53,040
optimal

436
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,120
you have common terminology you have

437
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,680
adaptability to size and complexity and

438
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,199
this can be used for planned and

439
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:00,639
unplanned events i think someone said

440
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:02,320
that they used it to plan a retirement

441
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,079
party the other day i was like it's

442
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:06,240
pretty cool i could see it working

443
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,240
the next is unity of effort and then

444
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:11,279
finally accountability so with every

445
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:12,399
role

446
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:14,000
especially the incident commander role

447
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,720
the buck stops with you so you're often

448
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,199
in charge of life safety decisions and

449
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:20,800
you are you are held accountable to that

450
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,399
and the weight of those decisions

451
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:23,519
um

452
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:25,279
you have them during the response and

453
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:26,560
that's okay

454
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:29,360
but the structure works to to support

455
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,720
all the responders throughout that

456
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,040
entire effort

457
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:36,240
so this is the planning p process so

458
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,720
again this is context into what do we do

459
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,279
with the exercise so the planning p

460
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:43,360
cycle basically it tells you when you

461
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,279
meet you can see at the bottom here it

462
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:47,040
starts from event notification and it

463
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,040
goes up it goes to incident briefing

464
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,440
forms you have regularly scheduled

465
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,519
meetings you don't kind of have to you

466
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:55,120
know be grabbing your phone all the time

467
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,120
saying when's the next you know crisis

468
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,880
management call or something like that

469
00:16:58,880 --> 00:16:59,839
do you know when it's going to be

470
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:02,320
planned so and so go schedule the call

471
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,799
so and so are you taking notes

472
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:07,439
no this is a process that runs much more

473
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:09,839
effectively than that and you know what

474
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:11,679
your operational period is whether

475
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:13,839
that's six hours eight hours 10 or 12

476
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:16,079
hours that's already defined so the

477
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:18,000
whole takeaway from the planning p

478
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,520
process is that it provides you

479
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:22,240
structure timing templates and it kind

480
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,160
of automates a lot of the things that

481
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:27,039
you don't want to be wasting time on

482
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:28,319
when you really want to be just

483
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:30,879
responding

484
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,200
so now we're getting into the exercise

485
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:37,120
so what happened during the exercise

486
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,600
so the purpose was really just to test

487
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,000
out the framework the other purpose was

488
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,559
that many of the volunteers within ics

489
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:47,440
for ics have taken the online fema

490
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,679
training courses so they've completed

491
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:51,520
their requirements for credentialing on

492
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,919
that end but another requirement that we

493
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:56,720
have is that you actually have to have

494
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,880
successfully done the role that you're

495
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,440
applying to credential for

496
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,320
or you you have to attend an exercise

497
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,080
and basically get the experience that

498
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,240
way and that's also allowed in the

499
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,960
traditional fema incident command system

500
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,880
and so the objectives of the exercise

501
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,559
were really to monitor events to

502
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:17,039
identify possible incidents perform

503
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:19,280
notification complete an initial

504
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,360
assessment and determine if an incident

505
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,799
should be declared that that's a

506
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:25,280
significant step in the process

507
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:28,480
stand up the ics for ics structure as

508
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,320
well as work on remediation and

509
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:34,240
resolution of the incident itself

510
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:37,520
so you see here mark bristow had already

511
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,039
been predefined as the incident

512
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:41,120
commander we were very lucky that this

513
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,520
company and the exercise that he was

514
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,200
there and he was willing to take on the

515
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,960
role

516
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,919
so this is the famous ics for ics org

517
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:51,280
chart i'm really surprised that we

518
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,200
haven't seen more revisions of this i

519
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,720
think that we'll probably be working on

520
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,559
them in the future but this is pretty

521
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:59,520
much the same one that we presented

522
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,440
two years ago and so you see the

523
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,679
positioned outline in red there those

524
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:05,520
were the ones that our incident

525
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,000
commander mark bristow said based on

526
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,480
what i'm seeing in my initial assessment

527
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:13,039
i need these folks lined up

528
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:15,280
so that's how we went in

529
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,280
and this was the incident briefing form

530
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,160
and

531
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,520
you know i'm not going to spend a lot of

532
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,440
time talking about what the scenario was

533
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,600
because the scenario is not important

534
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,039
and i always tell people during

535
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:27,760
exercises do not fight the scenario

536
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,240
that's not the point of the exercise

537
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,840
and so this was what's called an

538
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,520
incident briefing form and so the

539
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,679
incident commander when mark came in he

540
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:37,600
briefed his staff and he said this is

541
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,120
what's going on and it was an issue

542
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:42,320
where the hvac system was not acting

543
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,160
correctly and they needed to dive in and

544
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,000
figure out what was going on because

545
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,640
they couldn't rule out cyber

546
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,960
as a likely cause and the technicians

547
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,559
believed that it was not just a typical

548
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:55,440
fault with the equipment

549
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,360
so they went through the planning piece

550
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,280
cycle they did this twice within the

551
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,280
exercise and so if you were there you

552
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,679
saw like you see the forms you see the

553
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:05,760
process you see the agreement you see

554
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,240
the alignment that takes place and all

555
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:12,080
of this runs really smoothly

556
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:14,400
these were the forms that were

557
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,919
demonstrated and used within the

558
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:18,480
exercise and again these forms are free

559
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,400
you can go to the fema website right now

560
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,480
and download all of these forms

561
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:25,120
and so uh one that we'll kind of double

562
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,600
click on here that i find super helpful

563
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,679
is this is an org chart and again you

564
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:31,520
can download these forms but you see the

565
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,440
different roles that were in play and

566
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,440
this is a common form that's used within

567
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:38,640
the incident command system

568
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:41,760
so the after action review

569
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,120
how did it go

570
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,600
so these were the top three strengths as

571
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,919
identified by the audience we we did not

572
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:49,039
write these

573
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:51,280
so they said that the nems incident

574
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,600
command system is widely used for most

575
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,600
incidents and they really like the fact

576
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,760
that it had the all hazards component

577
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,480
because again this was an hvac issue and

578
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,320
in my experience when you're running

579
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:05,120
incidents um what an incident looks like

580
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,799
when it first comes in

581
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:10,400
is jdlr it's a very scientific term it

582
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,280
stands for just doesn't look right okay

583
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,200
and with that you can't determine if

584
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,039
it's a fault with the equipment or if it

585
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:19,679
was cyber and so you kind of have to run

586
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:22,000
both arms of the investigation at the

587
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,600
same time to really figure out what's

588
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:26,400
going on and so the all hazards

589
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,799
nexus to this the cyber and the physical

590
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:30,159
and the ability to have what's called

591
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:32,000
unified command

592
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
the audience really liked that

593
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,720
the next was that ics for ics was built

594
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:40,240
using nems and ics forms from fema

595
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,320
the forums help you make decisions they

596
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,320
help you have access to the data at your

597
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,159
fingertips and you're not

598
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:47,840
needing to create

599
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,640
um you know formalized and sophisticated

600
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,000
documents while you're in the heat of

601
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,520
running in an incident you you don't

602
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,919
want to bother with that and so people

603
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:58,480
like that aspect as well

604
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:01,120
they also liked the fact that ics for

605
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,039
ics enables consistent and quick

606
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:06,720
decision making and so it it prevents

607
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,000
sometimes the

608
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,080
paralysis that can come from things like

609
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:13,360
response fatigue and it helps ensure

610
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,840
that everyone is executing against the

611
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,799
same set of objectives and people are

612
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:20,640
trying to rally around the same set of

613
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,960
decisions and so one thing that ics for

614
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,640
ics gives you

615
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:27,120
that i try to tell any leadership that i

616
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,919
work for is that my job is to give you

617
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:32,240
data so that you can make decisions and

618
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,159
i'm hoping that i'm giving you data that

619
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:36,880
gives you maneuverability you need you

620
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,039
need maneuver room when you're running

621
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:41,039
an incident and

622
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:43,679
the less structured an incident is

623
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:45,120
the less maneuver room you're going to

624
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,360
have

625
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:48,880
so

626
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:51,600
three items that required improvement so

627
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:54,400
after action plans aars always have

628
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,320
what's called an improvement plan

629
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:59,120
and so this was that it took time for

630
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,880
folks to get familiar with the forms and

631
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,720
so it goes back to the training that's

632
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,120
needed to properly work and fully get

633
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,880
the benefits that you want to out of

634
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,919
using incident command system

635
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:11,280
they said hey if you could have kind of

636
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,120
given us a heads up about what each form

637
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,559
was for we could have had that kind of

638
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:16,480
in a briefing package ahead of time

639
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,000
that's definitely something we want to

640
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,200
incorporate into future exercises

641
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,440
we also needed to explain in the hot

642
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:27,440
wash that ics for ics is not a democracy

643
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,440
the incident commander is in charge

644
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:32,080
again i said that's where the buck stops

645
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,720
and and with that there is ways and

646
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,480
there's different meetings that occur

647
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,320
throughout that planning p cycle that

648
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,320
was a few slides back where you're

649
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,240
looking for alignment and one of the

650
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,799
most difficult jobs that any of us have

651
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:47,279
i don't care if you're in cyber or

652
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:49,919
if you're a makeup artist or whatever

653
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:51,360
your job is

654
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,520
alignment is a difficult exercise

655
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,679
getting consensus and alignment from

656
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:57,520
everyone that you're working with that's

657
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,200
what all of us really have to do on a

658
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,039
day-to-day basis and so

659
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:03,120
incident command system provides

660
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,200
formalized structure to have positive

661
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:08,559
conflict and work issues out in proper

662
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:11,440
vehicles and proper settings

663
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,120
they also said that we

664
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,720
we should describe the roles that would

665
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,559
be normally staffed in a real incident

666
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:18,720
as needed and so there was some you know

667
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,799
confusion over well you had a safety

668
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:24,000
officer but this person was checking on

669
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
physical safety they were looking at

670
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,240
different environmental aspects involved

671
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,400
in the response you know is that really

672
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,400
realistic to think that someone would

673
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,279
have all of that experience as a defined

674
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:38,240
safety officer and so we explained that

675
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,960
you have sub-teams of people that are

676
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,120
experts in those areas to advise the

677
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:45,039
chief safety officer

678
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:47,279
and the next was that a liaison officer

679
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:48,720
maybe needed to interface with

680
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:53,600
government dhs fbi isaac's also isos and

681
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:56,639
and all of those as well

682
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,559
um

683
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:01,039
so additional just comments and remarks

684
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:02,640
from the exercise that we wanted to

685
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,600
capture

686
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,919
was that uh small companies may need

687
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:08,960
help getting up to speed on ics for ics

688
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:11,360
the exercise itself was designed what's

689
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,760
called a type 3 incident where it's

690
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:16,880
single company single asset incident

691
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,720
type 2 you're moving up in scale and

692
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,799
then type 1 is the largest scale

693
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:23,279
incident possible and so they said we

694
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:24,720
may need to kind of

695
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:27,360
double down and think how to explain to

696
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,120
smaller companies how they would adopt

697
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,559
this structure and why it would benefit

698
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:35,120
them as well the ics for ics team

699
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:37,360
we are going to be assisting industry

700
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:40,559
sectors and hosting different exercises

701
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:41,919
which would address the smaller

702
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:43,840
companies like utility operators and

703
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:44,880
others

704
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,159
um

705
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:48,640
doa is critical to be able to

706
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,720
to be able to finance the um the

707
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,720
incident response efforts

708
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:55,120
the ic also provides delegation of

709
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,279
authority or obtains authority from

710
00:25:57,279 --> 00:25:58,720
executives

711
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,440
remember way back many slides ago i said

712
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,120
that the part about

713
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,600
investigating an initial notification to

714
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,600
determine if something was really an

715
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,440
incident determining if something

716
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,960
actually meets the threshold for being

717
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:13,279
an incident is a key part in all of our

718
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:15,679
roles now

719
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:18,720
the last item here ics for ics processes

720
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,559
forms and other resources can be used

721
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:23,440
for big or small incidents absolutely

722
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:26,000
and the size of the ics for ics team

723
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,640
will vary greatly based on the incident

724
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:31,600
we had five or six people responding

725
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,919
i have seen incident commands stood up

726
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:36,000
with just three people the incident

727
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
commander the planning section chief and

728
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,120
the op section chief

729
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,240
so

730
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,840
the future of all of this where do we

731
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,840
want to take it

732
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:48,159
we will be conducting exercises globally

733
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:50,159
i mentioned that we have 1 000

734
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:52,080
volunteers globally many of them are

735
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:54,480
from the five eye countries new zealand

736
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,400
and australia have been especially keen

737
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,000
to pick this up i believe that they're

738
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,080
standing up their own ics for ics

739
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:02,240
programs as well

740
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,960
we want to offer ics for ics credentials

741
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,400
and training globally

742
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,080
we want to grow the base of people with

743
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:11,200
expertise in ics for ics as well as

744
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,880
manage credentialing with the fema

745
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,880
national qualification system the one

746
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,039
responder system again let's that was

747
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:18,799
such a big deal to be able to use the

748
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:20,399
system and to be working hand in hand

749
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:23,440
with dhs on this it's it's an honor

750
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,360
i'm happy to say that we did it and i

751
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,880
want to credential more people i would

752
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,640
love for everyone in this audience if

753
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,960
you have a cyber response role i would

754
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,960
love you to go back and consider

755
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,200
getting into our process to become to

756
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,520
become credentialed yourself

757
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,520
and next is that we want to expand

758
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,520
processes and capabilities globally we

759
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,200
want to continue to grow this out we

760
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,240
want to

761
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,480
customize the forms we want to create a

762
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,640
lot of the content that we know will be

763
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,320
needed as folks are standing up their

764
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,960
own programs and eventually we'd like to

765
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,320
get to the point where we're even

766
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:56,240
offering templates where organizations

767
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,919
can support each other

768
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:01,520
through mutual aid we see that a lot the

769
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,679
the worst time to try to work out an nda

770
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:04,720
is when you're in the middle of a

771
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:07,120
response

772
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:10,320
so um what does this mean for you

773
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,399
how can you get involved register for

774
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:15,440
the ics for ics newsletter observe or

775
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:18,880
participate in an ics for ics exercise

776
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,840
host an ics for ics exercise at a public

777
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:24,159
