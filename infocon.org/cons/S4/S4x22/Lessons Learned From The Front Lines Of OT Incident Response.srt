1
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:07,359
good afternoon

2
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:10,080
man i can't really see all of you but it

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,840
is really good to be back at s4 and see

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:13,440
everybody out there so

5
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,599
so i thought anyway so um yes my name is

6
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:16,800
brian singer for those that don't know

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,359
me uh i represent our ot portion of our

8
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:20,880
global incident response team for

9
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,800
accenture and so i thought we'd have a

10
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,800
little bit of fun with uh cyber

11
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,800
family friendly stuff hits the fan

12
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,240
lessons learned from the front lines in

13
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,480
ot incident response but i thought what

14
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:31,920
we might do is we might start with a

15
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,360
couple of movie quotes to kind of get

16
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,719
things moving a bit a little older

17
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:36,640
movies we'll have a little fun here

18
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:39,680
so and this this is very early in keanu

19
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,360
reeves like you know evolution to

20
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:43,200
becoming the badass known as john wick

21
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,680
right very early in his career he played

22
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,280
a hostage crisis management in a movie

23
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,000
called speed in 1994. so his partner

24
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,920
jeff harry temple played by jeff daniels

25
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,719
says all right pop quiz airport gunman

26
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:56,320
with one hostage he's using her for

27
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,840
cover he's almost to the plane you're

28
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,840
100 feet away what do you do

29
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,920
jack played by keanu reeve goes shoot

30
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,159
the hostage right

31
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:05,600
so let's do another one and i'm going to

32
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,119
spare everybody if anybody watched the

33
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:09,520
hunt for red october sean connery had a

34
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,760
horrible scottish rendition of a russian

35
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,360
accent i'm going to spare you the

36
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,200
alabama interpretation of that same

37
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,400
thing but marco ramia says ryan he's

38
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,840
they're in a nuclear submarine and

39
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,360
they've got an actor in there they're

40
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,799
trying to they're trying to confront

41
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:25,360
says ryan be careful what you shoot at

42
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,960
most things in here don't react too well

43
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,200
to bullets jack ryan played by baldwin

44
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,720
says it right

45
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,280
so here we go guys pop quiz

46
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,960
overnight you are the you are the lead

47
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,960
crisis manager overnight 10 plants

48
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,960
rapidly decelerated okay in other words

49
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,960
uncontrolled shutdowns and does its war

50
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,400
were shut down out of an abundance of

51
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,320
caution a threat actor is persistent in

52
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,600
the environment and is deployed

53
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,880
ransomware

54
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,640
the investigation is mere hours underway

55
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,920
and the plants have already started

56
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,240
coming back up online the i.t incident

57
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,399
response team is shouting slow down the

58
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:56,000
plants are shouting speed up because

59
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,759
every moment we're down they're losing

60
00:01:57,759 --> 00:01:59,600
ground against their competitors what do

61
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,799
you do

62
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:02,240
what are you going to do we're going to

63
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,439
shoot the hostage quote-unquote

64
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:04,880
production

65
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,399
unfortunately

66
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:08,639
time and time again this is what we see

67
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:11,120
we see organizations that basically

68
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,560
because they don't understand their

69
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,800
environment well they end up basically

70
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,480
creating a self-inflicted wound that

71
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,480
never had to be that bad

72
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,319
so sorry to disappoint everybody today

73
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:21,599
i'm going to really try to avoid

74
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,920
shooting much of anything okay our

75
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,319
challenge from multiple live irs i've

76
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:28,080
done dozens and dozens and dozens of

77
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,280
investigations over the years we're

78
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,480
working with accenture for a few years

79
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,920
now and and had quite a bit of

80
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,840
experience there as well we really want

81
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,319
to try to prevent those self-inflicted

82
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:37,840
wounds self-inflicted damage to

83
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,840
operations right we want to continue to

84
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,360
restore plant operations we need to be

85
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,920
able to bring plants back up but as we

86
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,000
probably said many times over the years

87
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,879
our job is to maintain in security

88
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:51,120
maintain safe and efficient operations

89
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,440
as much as possible and if we can't

90
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,239
assure safe and efficient operations we

91
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:58,319
want to be able to bring plants down

92
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,480
safely controlled and then have a safe

93
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,959
return to service procedure all right

94
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:05,200
our ir challenges the incident response

95
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,200
challenges we need to be able to cleanly

96
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,400
extract an ot data set out of all the it

97
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,000
collections to be able to gather

98
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,680
meaningful data about what the threat

99
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,120
actor is doing and whether or not they

100
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,000
targeted it right hardening rot systems

101
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,280
a lot of times in an active

102
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,040
investigation we're trying to start

103
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,280
plants back up most ir investigations

104
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,440
i've seen take anywhere from weeks days

105
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,599
or weeks to months in some cases so

106
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:29,280
obviously we can't leave our plants down

107
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,560
that much we can't leave them down that

108
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,080
long there's just no way we'll ever

109
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,760
recover from that so a lot of times

110
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,360
we're trying to harden our plant

111
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,920
environments in flight while we're doing

112
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,000
all these other activities right

113
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,239
gain gaining you'll hear me say this a

114
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:44,000
few times one of my favorite phrases now

115
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
it's gain maintain and assure you want

116
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,799
to gain and maintain positive control

117
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:50,640
over the ot environment and if you'll

118
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,239
just bear with me i'll explain that more

119
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:54,159
a little bit later right

120
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:56,000
now so we have some competing priorities

121
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,519
that we often have to deal with here

122
00:03:57,519 --> 00:03:59,280
within ot and i know this is a bit of an

123
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,040
eye chart but these slides will be

124
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,319
provided i'm sure

125
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:04,879
but from from it and ot perspective a

126
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:06,319
lot of times we're dealing with very

127
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:08,239
competing priorities and let me give you

128
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:09,519
just a couple of examples in the

129
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:11,519
interest of time all right a really good

130
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:14,000
one is you know any any type of major ot

131
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,439
incident response that you're working on

132
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:17,600
any type of response in general

133
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,959
you're going to have plants down you're

134
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,238
going to have plants trying to come back

135
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:21,440
up you're going to be talking to

136
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,120
executives on a regular basis all the

137
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,040
way up to the ceo two or three times a

138
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,360
day there's a lot of activity and

139
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,440
there's multiple things happening so

140
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,040
within the ot environment obviously

141
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,639
we're talking about bringing our plants

142
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,560
up maintaining our plants continuing to

143
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,320
produce continuing to ship continuing to

144
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,040
do whatever we do right within the i.t

145
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,880
they have different sets of pressures

146
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,040
for example if there are data leaks

147
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,120
let's lose gdpr it's just one single

148
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,280
example there are going to be regulatory

149
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,280
clocks that start as soon as you become

150
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,440
aware of certain types of events

151
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,280
those obviously are going to end up

152
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,040
having very competing priorities in many

153
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,040
cases and a lot of times one thing i've

154
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,880
been noticing too is you know we've been

155
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,560
i mentioned being obviously the chairman

156
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,960
of 6443 for about 12 years you know

157
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,080
we've been rolling out standards for

158
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,759
many years policy governance programs

159
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:07,919
we've been talking about it it's all lip

160
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:10,080
service until you actually get to see

161
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,240
how things break down when there's this

162
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,240
much chaos in an environment that is

163
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,240
when you start to really see

164
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,000
when companies that have good governance

165
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,320
structures where the cio or the ciso has

166
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,080
direct access into maintaining

167
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,840
operations within the plants all the way

168
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,440
up you know from the they say the phrase

169
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,720
goes from the shop floor to the top

170
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,800
floor right versus ones where they're

171
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,240
hammering these relationships out for

172
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,160
the first time and it's the cio or the

173
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,639
cizzo being held accountable for what's

174
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:36,240
going on but it is the first time

175
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,520
they've even talked to the plant

176
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,160
environments in many cases all right

177
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,000
so ot a lot of times another one will

178
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,840
highlight regulatory obligations are

179
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,120
often going to be towards safety

180
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,880
environmental and i.t they're going to

181
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,320
be more legal they're going to be more

182
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,759
dealing with with

183
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:51,440
data privacy breaches and things of that

184
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,199
nature and not to mention if you're a

185
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:55,759
global company dealing with that in lots

186
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:57,039
of different time zones lots of

187
00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:58,160
different countries lots of different

188
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,440
regions so

189
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,960
so let's do this though let's take a

190
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,039
quick step back and let's talk about how

191
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:05,120
to prevent or limit your worst day ever

192
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,280
all right go-to responsive response my

193
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,960
my job is to show up with our team and

194
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,880
help you through that worst day

195
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,720
so what we often see

196
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,639
what we often see no separation between

197
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:16,400
it and ot and it's hard to believe that

198
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,319
we're having this conversation 20 years

199
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:20,160
we've come so far yet we still have such

200
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,479
a ways to go no separation between it

201
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:24,400
and ot totally flat networks right

202
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,800
limited identity management uh

203
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,240
converged active directory in other

204
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,199
words no separate it and ot engineering

205
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:34,080
domains right what we often hear well we

206
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,360
we've been we've been thinking about

207
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,880
doing this for a long time you know

208
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,160
we've been playing this for a long time

209
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,759
and we you know which hadn't really

210
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:41,600
gotten around to it or

211
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,360
the one i often hear as well is well

212
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,720
we've got really good teams and we've

213
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,160
maintained a really good control over

214
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,919
active directory so far we think we've

215
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:50,160
got this under control right

216
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,919
what we all too often find ourselves

217
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:53,520
saying and i've said this to many a

218
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,080
client now this is bad there was

219
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,600
absolutely no reason it had to be

220
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,840
anywhere near this bad right

221
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,599
so i've seen the architectures i've

222
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:02,960
heard all the stories i've looked at it

223
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,080
and you know what and i used to have a

224
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,000
lot of like some in this room probably

225
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,440
had plenty of arguments and heated

226
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,520
debates with our clients about look this

227
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,199
is why you need to do this stuff really

228
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:12,560
don't find a great need to do that

229
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,199
anymore because what i will tell you is

230
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,880
the people that have the worst days ever

231
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,960
in an instant response scenario those

232
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,560
things are the common themes that we see

233
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,479
repeated over and over and over again

234
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:24,479
right so obviously you saw the see no

235
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:26,240
evil hear no evil speak no evil and that

236
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,599
made me think of another movie quote the

237
00:07:28,599 --> 00:07:31,680
1998-1989 movie see no evil hear no evil

238
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,000
where uh richard pryor is a blind man

239
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,319
gene wilder uh plays a gentleman by the

240
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:37,680
name of dave who's a deaf man and

241
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,880
together they bumble their way through

242
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,479
solving a murder all right

243
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:42,160
so not really directly related but i

244
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,080
thought this quote was funny we're dave

245
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,919
we're in a warehouse you just hit a cow

246
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:48,240
i think we better back up

247
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,319
so let's back up a little bit take it

248
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:51,680
from your friendly neighborhood incident

249
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,319
responder again if you want to have a

250
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:55,599
recipe for assuring that you're going to

251
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:58,400
have a very bad day you know not having

252
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,080
separation between it and otm what do i

253
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,759
mean by that i'm not talking about vlans

254
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:02,879
i'm not talking about layer two

255
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:04,879
separation i'm talking about one or more

256
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:07,199
firewalls with the dmz idmz industrial

257
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:09,599
dmz whatever you wanna call it right

258
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:11,759
gaining and maintaining positive control

259
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:13,840
over i t and ot communications and what

260
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,240
do we mean by that all right this is

261
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,520
normally if you want to get technical

262
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,840
for a moment this is layer 3 and layer 4

263
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,400
at the osi in other words i want to be

264
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,720
able to control and know what data is

265
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,360
flowing between it and ot and understand

266
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,599
the data flows within the ot environment

267
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:31,120
and i want the ability to be able to

268
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,559
control that i want to be able to write

269
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:34,320
access control lists i want to be able

270
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,240
to implement firewall rules i want to be

271
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,519
able to have certain things that i can

272
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:39,679
either sever or maintain or i can i can

273
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,679
control how data flows into the

274
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:43,679
environment and that i have the right

275
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:46,000
tools to be able to do diagnosis and

276
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,560
inspection security monitoring and then

277
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,800
lastly that i have a good baseline of my

278
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,040
network health so that i know when i'm

279
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,720
when i'm when i've had when we've had a

280
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,480
shutdown of operations i know whether or

281
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,160
not it's safe to return to service all

282
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,920
right creating and maintaining ot

283
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,839
specific playbooks how many times i've

284
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:03,600
worked in an ir now where there's not

285
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,240
even any playbooks period or there's

286
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,680
nothing really worked out ahead of time

287
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,839
from an ot perspective right

288
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:11,360
we're going to get more into the details

289
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,959
of ot responses a little bit and why

290
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,640
they're a little bit different but

291
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,040
access control and remote support uh

292
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,640
this is a common theme seen over and

293
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,600
over and over again so we've seen

294
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,240
thankfully few times but we have seen

295
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,519
threat actors that see like weak

296
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:27,839
password policies on active directory

297
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:29,440
that then appear to go back and start

298
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,959
testing other things like oh i don't

299
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:32,560
know team viewer connections or other

300
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,560
remote connections that might bypass

301
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,920
that firewall and we've actually seen

302
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,080
this in thankfully fairly few but there

303
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,240
have been a few cases around this okay

304
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,839
so this is where i'm often asked about

305
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:44,320
the ot nms type tools network monitoring

306
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,720
tools and i hope uh you know drago's

307
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,800
like clarity forescout nozomi i hope

308
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:49,760
they can all forgive me i'm going to

309
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,399
lump everybody into one category here uh

310
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:54,480
however you know again one of the one of

311
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,080
the challenges to see with these tools

312
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:56,880
is

313
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,560
you know again they have a lot of

314
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,800
capability but a lot of times if there

315
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,399
are if they're already there and

316
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:03,920
deployed they can be very useful in

317
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,160
investigation if they are not there in

318
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,000
an investigation a lot of times it

319
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,600
represents too high of a bar it's a

320
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,040
barrier to entry to actually gaining

321
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,519
more data so we have to understand where

322
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:15,600
those tools can be effectively utilized

323
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,480
okay

324
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,000
one thing i will say on those types

325
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
tools there is a lot of value in them

326
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
but if they're not already in place when

327
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,399
an investigation starts normally what i

328
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:26,000
find is the value of those tools

329
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,560
actually is later on it's going to be a

330
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,399
number of days or weeks in into the

331
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:31,760
investigation we're really trying to

332
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,360
start about returning plants to normal

333
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,680
operations those tools can be deployed

334
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,279
configured maintained they can give us a

335
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:40,000
lot of useful information later in the

336
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,240
incident response but at the beginning

337
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,440
of it a lot of times if they're not

338
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,720
already there they're going to be a

339
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,320
limitation they're going to be a little

340
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,560
bit of a limitation to actually uh aid

341
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,720
in our investigation plus i also want to

342
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,160
bring something else up

343
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,320
we don't have enough incident responders

344
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,160
period if we don't have enough incident

345
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,320
responders period you can also imagine

346
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,320
within the ot arena we really don't have

347
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,399
enough incident response right

348
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:03,120
so

349
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,880
i do a lot of training for people we do

350
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,959
a lot with internally and externally

351
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:08,959
uh really trying to grow the next

352
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:10,959
generation of i.t and ot security

353
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:12,640
professionals especially in the area of

354
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,160
incident response it's one that's

355
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,880
becoming more and more important to me

356
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,480
and this is where i actually do find and

357
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,079
i will give some serious props to one

358
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:21,200
particular

359
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,720
open source tool that i've become a very

360
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,800
big fan of and that's actually the dhs

361
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,760
tool they produce called malcolm right

362
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,959
when i first looked at it about a year

363
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:31,120
or so ago i wasn't very impressed some

364
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,560
of the later versions i've actually

365
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,640
worked out some workflows with it and

366
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,079
you know while we have a significant

367
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:38,560
amount of tooling uh within our incident

368
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,320
response practice one of the big

369
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,920
challenges that i've come up with again

370
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:44,399
is actually getting that ot data set out

371
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:47,920
of an existing i.t data set and i i've

372
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,440
always been a big fan of a lot of open

373
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,040
source tools this is more of a personal

374
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,640
opinion not necessarily company

375
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,320
represented i've always been a big fan

376
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,000
of a lot of the open source tools and

377
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,839
when i was you know reminding

378
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:00,240
was doing some searching a while back i

379
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,680
was like oh yeah i forgot i really do

380
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,279
like the the open source database

381
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:05,360
internet network tool called moloch

382
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,360
which is now known as archimay and it

383
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,120
was like a lot of instant responders

384
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,279
really like bro and zeke well one of the

385
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:12,800
things that that tool did is they put

386
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,480
together bro and zeke integration into

387
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,720
the archimede tool very very cleanly

388
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:17,920
obviously i don't want to get into the

389
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,160
technical details of that but one thing

390
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,920
i have found that made that tool very

391
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,399
useful is i had a single pane of glass

392
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:26,160
that gave me a very quick snapshot of

393
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,519
all the ot

394
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,920
the ics and ot data sets within

395
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,760
everything we'd already collected and

396
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,160
then i was able to take all those other

397
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,320
tools that we use including things like

398
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,639
nozomi and forescout and those data then

399
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:40,800
when as we gathered those data sets all

400
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,720
they did was enrich the data set that i

401
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,399
was currently looking at it made it very

402
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:46,800
rapid for us to proof the environment

403
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,399
against you know and constantly checking

404
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:50,160
we got new indicators of compromise

405
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,920
constantly check that environment to see

406
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,519
whether or not it changed anything about

407
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:54,959
the analytic and how we were doing our

408
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:57,120
incident response so again the reason i

409
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,800
bring that up is is again there's a lot

410
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,959
of other tools that we use uh however i

411
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:02,560
do bring that up because if you're

412
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,560
incident interested in instant response

413
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,000
i highly recommend starting to get

414
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,760
familiar with tools like wireshark

415
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,680
security onion and like i said the one

416
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,040
i've been have been using quite a bit

417
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,040
lately has been the malcolm tool because

418
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,320
it does it gives you a great way to

419
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,760
start understanding how a lot of these

420
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,920
tools and technologies work and then if

421
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,200
you come into an environment you have

422
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,639
some of these other commercial tools

423
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:21,839
they're going to make a lot more sense

424
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:22,880
to you they're going to they're going to

425
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,839
be able to aid in what you're doing

426
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:27,120
so when all that spills that talks about

427
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,639
how to kind of prevent your worst day

428
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:30,399
when all else fails at the end of the

429
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:32,079
day we do know sometimes the threat

430
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:33,600
actor is going to get in

431
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,000
the single most important job that i

432
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,480
think that in any ir team right now for

433
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,399
an ot perspective is that crisis

434
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:42,800
management function okay it is

435
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,880
understanding the implications of what

436
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,079
you're doing we understand the

437
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:48,240
implications of what an ir team is doing

438
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,079
so i really do i try to highlight this

439
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,000
crisis management function is very very

440
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,600
critical so

441
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,600
crisis management writes otir and four

442
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,519
easy pieces this is a bit of a joke of

443
00:13:57,519 --> 00:13:59,440
course but crisis management for rot key

444
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,760
to success one part operator one part

445
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:04,079
play one part safety one part i.t one

446
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:06,160
part belgium malinois so anybody's

447
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,680
familiar with dogs i i have german

448
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,199
shepherds love them i love them to death

449
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:10,959
have you ever seen a belgian malinois

450
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:14,079
ever seen one actually in in in uh

451
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:16,160
you've seen one in action you know i've

452
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,920
heard it likened to a german shepherd

453
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,000
crosses the tyrannosaurus rex

454
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,560
t-rex on speed right these are very

455
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,120
active very very active very busy very

456
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,279
sharp dogs a little bit of a joke of

457
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:30,240
course however i highlight that crisis

458
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,839
management function you are going to be

459
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:34,399
doing a lot of things very very quickly

460
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:35,920
you're going to be proofing your ot data

461
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,199
sets to see whether or not you see

462
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:39,519
threat actor behavior targeted at ot

463
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:40,639
that's going to be a really key thing we

464
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,480
need we'll discuss here in just a moment

465
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,680
you're going to be working with the ir

466
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,040
teams that are probably rolling out

467
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,199
containment strategies like for example

468
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:49,279
turning on the windows firewall they're

469
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:50,959
going to be rolling out edr solutions

470
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:52,079
and they're going to be doing it very

471
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:54,959
very quickly and they're probably not

472
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:56,959
checking whether or not oh i don't know

473
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:58,560
whether or not that windows firewall is

474
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,560
going to interact with and cause harmful

475
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,560
interaction to uh control system

476
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,480
software for example all right so you're

477
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,920
going to see plants going back up you're

478
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,519
going to see them going back down and

479
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:08,880
really just trying to be in front of

480
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,639
that activity is a very important part

481
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:12,480
for that crisis management function

482
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,320
your job there as that crisis manager is

483
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,320
to categorize that ot incident and

484
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,160
constantly be aware of that so keep in

485
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,440
mind again what i was talking about a

486
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,600
moment ago getting that data set to work

487
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,000
with right and then analyzing your new

488
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
iocs your new indicators of compromise

489
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,440
and new threat intelligence to

490
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,279
constantly evaluate whether or not

491
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:30,720
you're going to need to escalate and

492
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,199
attest to additional resources

493
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:35,040
coordination with junior iq it and ot

494
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,199
data streams and then last but not least

495
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:39,199
it's either maintaining safe safe

496
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:42,000
operations or coordinating that safe

497
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
return to service procedure right

498
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,680
proofing the environment to make sure

499
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:48,079
that it's okay to return to service and

500
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:50,639
what do you watch for once you do return

501
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:52,480
so what do i mean by proofing this and

502
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,120
categorizing the attack let's get into

503
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,959
there's i try to always categorize an

504
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:59,360
incident into one of four categories

505
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,160
okay

506
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,639
by the way little known fact 76.8

507
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:04,240
percent of all statistics are made up on

508
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,160
the spot all right

509
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:06,959
so

510
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:10,320
i will tell you that about 90 to 95 of

511
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,079
the incidents stay in these first two

512
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:14,560
categories this is what we want okay

513
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:17,680
those first two categories it compromise

514
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,800
where no ot assets are impacted okay and

515
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,480
what what are we doing in that one we're

516
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,839
just making sure that there was never

517
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:25,519
any lateral movement into the ot

518
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:27,759
environment so if you go going again

519
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:29,279
with that scenario moment ago about

520
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:31,199
having your worst day ever the clients

521
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:32,480
that we've seen that have some of the

522
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,600
worst day ever that have those

523
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,279
completely converged no separation

524
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:37,680
between i.t and ot this is very very

525
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,920
difficult and it's a it's a huge ground

526
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,240
game to make sure that ot systems were

527
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,639
not impacted in any way right make sure

528
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:45,600
there's nothing else we need to worry

529
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,560
about so first category i t impacted ot

530
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:51,920
is not okay the second category where 95

531
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,759
percent of our statistics on the spot

532
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:54,639
land

533
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:57,680
is going to be ot systems are impacted

534
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:58,959
and then the job of the crisis

535
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:00,880
management the ir team is to prove that

536
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,680
they weren't targeted right so in this

537
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:04,880
case i'll give you i'll give you an

538
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,000
example of this in a moment but in this

539
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,919
case what we're doing is we know ot was

540
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:10,160
hit but we don't we we want to make sure

541
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,919
that it wasn't like okay the new end

542
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:13,359
controller or something else that moved

543
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:15,359
deeper into the system when we get down

544
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:17,679
into category three this is again we

545
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:18,880
wanted to stay in the first two

546
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,799
categories when you start trying to

547
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:22,640
mobilize your resources now getting into

548
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,400
level three and level four is a whole

549
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,559
different ball of wax right

550
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:28,000
in this case we need to figure out

551
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,840
whether or not we need to mobilize a lot

552
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,360
of additional resources these could be

553
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,840
anywhere from engineers ot specific

554
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,120
teams all kinds of other things

555
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:38,000
including federal response all right

556
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,520
and what we're doing on level three it

557
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,679
is this is what i call insider or

558
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:44,799
insider equivalent attacks okay insider

559
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:46,240
cracks i hate to be blunt about this but

560
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,160
insider attacks we often see in cases of

561
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,080
like layoffs terminations people that

562
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,240
come back into an environment or during

563
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,080
labor negotiations and strikes and

564
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,919
things like that sometimes we need to be

565
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:58,320
very wary of insider type attacks that

566
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,559
could be conducted in an environment

567
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:03,120
or insider equivalent these are threat

568
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,120
actors that have taken days weeks months

569
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,360
or years learning your environment as

570
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,600
well as you know it okay so they have

571
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,360
inside equivalent information whether

572
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,640
they got it through fraud and collusion

573
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,080
whether they got it through research

574
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,280
whether they got it through some other

575
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,280
means they have inside equivalent

576
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,559
information about your environment and

577
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:21,200
they represent a very significant threat

578
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,799
get into the last category and this is

579
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:24,799
what i will call just the deep insert ot

580
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:26,559
attacks and even the time since i put

581
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:28,080
these slides together and controllers

582
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,400
now come out so this is this is the stu

583
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,640
you know stuxnet son of stuxnet in

584
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,320
controller these are the types of things

585
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,320
that highly target an ot environment

586
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,960
right your job as an incident responder

587
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,280
is to do your best to understand whether

588
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,799
or not you're gonna even need to move

589
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:44,799
into level three or level four because

590
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:46,480
that mobilizes a whole bunch of

591
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,240
different resources if you stay in level

592
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,559
two if you're if you have good itot

593
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:52,480
separation the only thing that we're

594
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,320
ever gonna have to do really is just

595
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,080
watch for lateral movement between it

596
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,240
and ot i look for back door attacks and

597
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,240
it and ot as long as we don't see those

598
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,360
normally you're going to be safe to

599
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,960
continue to operate the way you were

600
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,360
right if you have no separation at all

601
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,480
you're going to have to spend a lot of

602
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,080
time really proofing to make sure that

603
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,840
you are in level three are those those

604
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,280
systems have not been impacted in some

605
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,440
other way level three or level four

606
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,360
all right so always a lot of times you

607
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,200
hear well just shut it off right let's

608
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,559
go ahead and contain this red actor by

609
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:20,320
just shutting everything off disconnect

610
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:23,600
well that may or may not be possible

611
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,440
organizations that have taken their time

612
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,640
to plan this and their business

613
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,480
continuity disaster recovery plans ahead

614
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,559
of time probably so

615
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:32,320
if you try to do this live in an i.t

616
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,919
environment live in an environment where

617
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:35,760
you've not done this work one of the

618
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:36,720
things you're going to run into right

619
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,160
away is if you don't have separation

620
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,360
with an active directory if you don't

621
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,120
have a separate engineering domain you

622
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,640
probably can't completely shut that

623
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,720
connection down right and even if you do

624
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,880
shut it down do you have control over

625
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,960
the several thousand remote access

626
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,000
connections that are going on in your

627
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,240
environment at the same time i've seen

628
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,400
companies shut down the itot or shut

629
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,320
down that access or that their that

630
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,400
access to the environment and ignore the

631
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,440
fact they've got vpns and remote access

632
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,039
and remote server all kinds of other

633
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:05,280
things that just bypass that itot

634
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,600
firewall entirely and if you do sever

635
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,720
that connection and those things are

636
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,559
still going on you've just cut yourself

637
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:11,840
off of the knees and the ability to

638
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,360
detect and respond to more attacks with

639
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,799
the threat actor

640
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:16,799
so is it safe to return to production

641
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:18,160
okay

642
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:20,240
ot responders they must evaluate the

643
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,840
health of the ics network so one of the

644
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,280
other things you really got to watch out

645
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,039
for a lot of times we're conducting kind

646
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:25,840
of a

647
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,360
of a baseline assessment while we're

648
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,520
doing the ir because if your network is

649
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,600
already unhealthy and there the

650
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,280
industrial protocols are already having

651
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:36,000
a hard time a hard day if you add then

652
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,360
all the remote support and all the

653
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,960
backup and recovery and restoration that

654
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,240
you're going to have to do to return to

655
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,840
service the next thing is going to

656
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,520
happen and we've watched it time it

657
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,960
again you're going to bring that plant

658
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:47,520
right back down so the question really

659
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,640
needs to come

660
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,400
is it safe to return to service we're

661
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,360
going to get into some tools to

662
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,440
hopefully help with that now i'm going

663
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:56,640
to get into just one small example here

664
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:59,360
of how like our it and ot teams need to

665
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,799
be able to interact with each other and

666
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:02,880
that attestation as to whether or not

667
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,799
you need to move from level two into

668
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:07,039
level three or level four right one of

669
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:08,080
the things that will happen for us let

670
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,360
me give you a quick example it's one of

671
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,600
my favorites all right i'll go give two

672
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,440
we're gonna move forward so number one

673
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,960
let's say the laboratory information

674
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,640
management system was part of the

675
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,080
compromise and we know the threat actor

676
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,320
moved to that okay all right does that

677
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,880
now kick off some additional procedures

678
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,400
that you need to do for lab or quality

679
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,760
checking to make sure that everything's

680
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,679
okay right did you think about that

681
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:28,960
ahead of time as part of your response

682
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,960
playbacks or my favorite is let's say

683
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,559
it's an engineering workstation that's

684
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:34,720
compromised well if it's an ews that's

685
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,320
compromised one of the things i'm going

686
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,760
to do is i'm going to request from our

687
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:40,159
incident response team a forensic image

688
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:42,400
of that that workstation so they then go

689
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,240
in and look at like where the programs

690
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,640
are stored for all our controllers and

691
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,080
we're going to look at a time the last

692
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,159
time a file was accessed m time last

693
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:52,240
time files are modified c time when the

694
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,679
files are created we're going to be

695
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:55,200
looking through all that to see whether

696
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,520
or not we think that somebody might have

697
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,799
either gathered data about or modified

698
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:01,919
the programs that are than any

699
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:03,360
controllers and then we're going to be

700
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,720
going out whether or not we need to

701
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,559
manually proof every controller out

702
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:08,159
there to make sure the ladder logic

703
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:09,919
hasn't been changed okay we don't want

704
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:11,039
to get into that scenario if we can

705
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:12,320
avoid it we really want to stay out of

706
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,080
that as much as possible but we need to

707
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,679
be prepared to move to that level all

708
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:17,200
right the other thing to really watch

709
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,200
for here too is watching if there is an

710
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,679
x-fil component where the threat actor

711
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:22,799
has brought you know

712
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:24,240
hundreds of megabytes or gigabytes or

713
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,760
terabytes of data and they've ex-filled

714
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,760
it off the network finding out what's in

715
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:30,159
that x-fill all right did they get cad

716
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:31,840
drawings they get pnids they get plant

717
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,679
safety manuals did they get any anything

718
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:35,760
else out there that could indicate that

719
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,679
hey this is you know just a you know an

720
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:39,840
attempt to exploit and gain money get

721
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:42,559
you know get a ransom for the bitcoin or

722
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:44,000
is there something else there that this

723
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,760
might be an early indicator of another

724
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,600
attack yet to come because they're doing

725
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,360
they're gaining that insider equivalent

726
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,960
information by gathering that data off

727
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:53,280
the system so i have seen

728
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,440
process information in x-fills a number

729
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,760
of times now and it does present some

730
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,320
kind of uncomfortable questions

731
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:01,600
so

732
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,039
try to get down to some quick tools here

733
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:04,799
for you as quick as possible

734
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:06,320
the thing i like to work with now is

735
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,559
three three basic concepts minimum

736
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:10,480
viable architecture minimum viable

737
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:13,039
process and minimum viable controls mba

738
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:16,080
mvp and mbc and uh the one we'll put on

739
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,600
the bottom there too because it is key

740
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,600
and important you do need to have this

741
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,200
aligned with your business continuity

742
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,760
program so minimum viable architecture

743
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,600
the network assets that you have out

744
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,000
there the server assets the backups now

745
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,280
a couple of key questions on your

746
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,720
minimum viable architecture and getting

747
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,480
in a minute of viable process things

748
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,400
like your p and ids your plant safety

749
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,919
manuals any of those type of

750
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:38,400
architecture diagrams do you have those

751
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,760
do you have them under control do you

752
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,360
have paper backups because if you've

753
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,039
lost all that especially like plant

754
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:45,280
safety manuals you may not be legal you

755
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:47,280
may not be legal to even operate so

756
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:48,640
these are questions you need to work out

757
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:49,679
as part of your minimum bible

758
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:51,600
architecture next piece is minimum

759
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,600
viable process what equipment needs to

760
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,880
be running what's the efficiency it

761
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,240
needs to be running at what raw

762
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,080
materials what type of storage you need

763
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,760
what type of quality test you need to be

764
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:00,480
able to

765
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,400
to execute in order to make sure that

766
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,400
you're still producing safe product

767
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,679
right or

768
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:07,120
insur whatever that product may be

769
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,200
whether it be chemicals or power or

770
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,720
razor blades or whatever it might be

771
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,520
right third one minimum viable controls

772
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,679
this means the control over the

773
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:17,840
environment whether or not you can let's

774
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,679
say for example want to cry want to cry

775
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:22,720
spread heavily over 139 and 445 the tcp

776
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:25,279
ports right can you can you positively

777
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:27,760
close that access down throughout the

778
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,760
environment and know the impact of doing

779
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,600
so right we don't want to just i looked

780
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,600
at log4j response and it was fascinating

781
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,080
to me the companies were intentionally

782
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:38,480
breaking their applications because the

783
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,240
risk of breaking the applications by

784
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,559
deleting the log4j stuff was actually

785
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:44,400
lower than it was to allow the

786
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,080
compromise to move forward these are

787
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,159
things we definitely want to avoid so

788
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:50,080
minimum viable architecture minimum

789
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:52,400
bible process minimum bible controls if

790
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,760
you can assure those three things and

791
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,200
align it with your business continuity

792
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,840
plan at that point i say you are safe to

793
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,679
return to service in one one fashion or

794
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:01,279
another we call that authorization to

795
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:02,240
operate

796
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,400
so let's tie it all together with all

797
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,159
the five minutes we have remaining

798
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:08,320
three pillars for success this is what i

799
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:11,440
really like to focus on preparedness do

800
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:14,000
you have response playbooks for your ot

801
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,919
environment right there's another

802
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:17,600
concept i like here is what we call i

803
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,000
use heavily now is called pre-approved

804
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,320
actions pre-approved actions what are

805
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,760
the things that you are allowed to do

806
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,840
without any other without any other

807
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,919
authorization give you an example it had

808
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:29,760
a uh

809
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,440
industrial materials client a few years

810
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,919
ago that had a large instant response

811
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:36,000
and they had one site go uncontrolled

812
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,039
shut down they were shutting down a

813
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:38,559
couple others and they all started

814
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:39,919
debating amongst each other about what

815
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:41,520
to do in that meantime it went to

816
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,120
several dozen sites and caused them a

817
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,559
lot bigger outage than they ever should

818
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:47,120
have had right pre-approved actions that

819
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:50,000
mva mvp mvc that's a really useful tool

820
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,440
i found and kind of coming up with what

821
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,440
those pre-approved actions need to be

822
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:56,159
preparedness right so playbooks tabletop

823
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:58,000
exercise resilience skill training skill

824
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,799
ups positive control gain maintain and

825
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:02,320
ensure positive control over the

826
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,799
environment do you know your data flows

827
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:06,400
do you know what systems and data you

828
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,559
need in order to operate can you control

829
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:10,640
those can you monitor them can you shut

830
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,000
them down can you survive with or

831
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,440
without them right

832
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:16,080
positive control is a really key aspect

833
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,240
of whether or not it is safe to return

834
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,640
to service and then risk management you

835
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,400
know again if you're doing this ir

836
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,679
they're going to be watching two things

837
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:24,880
they're gonna be watching a numerator

838
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,559
and a dominant denominator how many

839
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:28,159
systems are compromised how many systems

840
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:29,840
have been fixed right they're gonna be

841
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:30,960
watching that heavily they're gonna be

842
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,360
watching those regulatory clocks can you

843
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,840
effectively communicate what the risk is

844
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:38,000
of either maintaining or returning

845
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,159
systems operation i've had several times

846
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:41,840
now that we've had plants that have been

847
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,919
down they start getting excited and they

848
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:45,600
start you know returning plants back up

849
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,120
too quickly they turn around they go

850
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,159
right back down and then they're

851
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:50,640
wondering why or the ir teams internal

852
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,159
or external are actually causing them

853
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:53,840
more harm than good getting your hands

854
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,360
around that crisis management function

855
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:58,159
very key to limiting that type of impact

856
00:26:58,159 --> 00:26:59,039
okay

857
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:00,720
uh another concept and again i'm just

858
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,400
dropping a couple of tools on you now

859
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,400
because another concept i found very

860
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:07,200
useful is to con is to contrast

861
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,039
indicators of compromise which we're

862
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:10,159
usually doing you know hunting and

863
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:12,240
eradication in an i.t environment with

864
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,520
what we're calling indicators of

865
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,840
aberrant behavior or iab within a

866
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,240
process right these are all those weird

867
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,159
things and the way more colloquially i

868
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:22,240
like to say you know if it looks weird

869
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,000
it is weird until you prove otherwise in

870
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,320
an instant investigation right so what

871
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:27,919
are those things that are indicators of

872
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:29,440
physical behavior that we know are

873
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,720
problematic that we need to pay

874
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:31,919
attention to

875
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:33,200
okay

876
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,279
and this template is one i use now

877
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:36,559
normally if i'm doing this for like a

878
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:38,320
client there'd be several columns here

879
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:39,919
including like the observations and the

880
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:41,840
impact but i'm always these are these

881
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,039
are the way i communicate back to the

882
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:44,880
client what about your protocol control

883
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,880
can you control your data flows endpoint

884
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,400
control do you have visibility of your

885
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,159
endpoints do you have all do you know

886
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:52,080
what all your assets really even are

887
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:54,000
network control do you have positive

888
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,440
control over the environment data

889
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,279
control do you know your data flows

890
00:27:57,279 --> 00:27:59,120
malware prevention obviously you guys

891
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,799
can follow that one remote support

892
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:03,360
suspect communications because you know

893
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,200
quite often when we start an ir we see a

894
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,799
threat actor behavior in environment

895
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:08,720
it's not the only threat actor behavior

896
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,799
in the environment hopefully it's all

897
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:12,559
fairly minimal but

898
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:14,159
several times now it's not been the only

899
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:15,760
one and keeping those investigations

900
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,200
separate or kicking off a new one could

901
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,360
be really important right safety i

902
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,600
should move safety to the top but is it

903
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,760
safe to even operate right

904
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,840
and then asset management lastly here's

905
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,440
a little bit of an ot incident response

906
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,960
checklist really looking at

907
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,640
understanding you know and this is

908
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,559
something i'll leave behind really uh

909
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:33,919
but understanding do you know your

910
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:35,440
recovery point objectives do you know

911
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,120
your minimum viable architecture do you

912
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,640
know what it means to probably do you

913
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:42,000
have pre-arranged plans does your msp

914
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
support your program or not i've had

915
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,320
some irs where we found that the msp was

916
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,240
not the service level agreements were

917
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,000
not tuned to the threat model they were

918
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,679
worried about so we actually helped our

919
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:53,840
clients go out and bid for a new mssp

920
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:56,240
based upon the new criteria right

921
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,840
so that really where i will leave things

922
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,919
kind of wrapping up on that so uh i hope

923
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:00,799
everybody really enjoyed the

924
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:02,640
presentation obviously uh one thing i

925
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,880
will say i have seen a huge need and

926
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:05,919
this is something we're doing this is a

927
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:08,159
bit of a shameless plug uh but we've

928
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:10,000
seen a huge need that we we need more

929
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,600
instant responders but not only do we

930
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,039
need mortgage responders we just need

931
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:15,039
more people that understand the incident

932
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:17,679
response process for ot systems and

933
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:19,679
based out of our houston cfc the cyber

934
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:21,520
fusion center in houston where we have a

935
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,440
lot of industrial applications we have

936
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,600
we actually have simulated cyber events

937
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,200
that people can understand what would be

938
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,799
the impact of the process of an ot

939
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:30,159
attack one of the things we're running

940
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:31,440
is we actually have been working with an

941
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,799
alliance within our company called cloud

942
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:35,279
range to produce a virtual range to

943
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:37,279
complement that where we bring people in

944
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:39,840
and we just give them exposure to what

945
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,760
does an ot incident actually look like

946
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,880
how do you work through those four

947
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,640
categories how do you do the crisis

948
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,720
management because what i mainly need to

949
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,240
train people on is not how to be

950
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,720
incident responders right away but the

951
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,320
ins but how to work with an incident

952
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,960
response team right so if you're at a if

953
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,480
you're a refinery you're at a food

954
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,640
producer and you have an incident when

955
00:29:58,640 --> 00:29:59,840
somebody shows up whether it be

956
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,360
accenture whether it be dragos whether

957
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:04,159
it be mandiat whether it be pwc or dhs

958
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:06,080
when you have that team show up how do

959
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,200
you direct them on how they actually

960
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,960
need to operate so with that i will wrap

961
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,320
it up as i am that time and i really

962
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:11,760
appreciate it and again very good to see

963
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,200
everybody at s4 and i look forward to

964
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:16,380
seeing the rest of the show

965
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:19,719
[Music]

966
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,080
you
