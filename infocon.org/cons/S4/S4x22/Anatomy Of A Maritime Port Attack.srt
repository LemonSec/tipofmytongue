1
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:07,759
good morning and uh it's wonderful to be

2
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:10,480
back at uh at s4 last time i was here

3
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:13,440
was a few years ago was a little bummed

4
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,040
out to see that it was

5
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:17,119
put on the shelf last year but certainly

6
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:19,680
glad to be back glad to see all the

7
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,320
the faces so as was announced my name is

8
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,439
keith walsh i am the director of ot

9
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:28,080
security and operations at armis

10
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,480
i find myself at armist after

11
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,479
about 18 years in the critical

12
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:34,000
infrastructure space working with our

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
utilities working with

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,040
our

15
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:40,079
our dod our our war fighters things that

16
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:42,719
roll float and fly

17
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:45,280
and where i find myself at armis is

18
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,559
really you know in uh in a space where i

19
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:50,640
have an opportunity on a global scale to

20
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,399
work with all sorts of industry

21
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:54,480
verticals uh probably

22
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,399
maybe at up to this point

23
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:58,480
about 12 to 14 of the different sisa

24
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,079
verticals i've been directly involved

25
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:01,920
with understanding what their use cases

26
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,600
are understanding what they're trying to

27
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,040
solve for

28
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,880
understanding where they are today and

29
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,040
where they want to be tomorrow

30
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,680
in understanding what good looks like

31
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,400
so

32
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,240
for the balance of today's presentation

33
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,240
we're going to walk through

34
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,080
the framework of what the anatomy of a

35
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,280
maritime

36
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,920
port infrastructure attack looks like

37
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,680
and it was interesting because this this

38
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,439
presentation was built um probably about

39
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:30,240
six months ago it was updated over time

40
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,720
it was submitted it was accepted by s4

41
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,159
in dale

42
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:36,000
but the interesting thing as i was

43
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,400
walking through this deck

44
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,280
was that there is this port could

45
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,119
virtually be any piece of critical

46
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:45,280
infrastructure you know and as we look

47
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,880
to see what what occurred in the past

48
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,560
week or two

49
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,759
um

50
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:51,200
it it it

51
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,640
really plays well in today's

52
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,880
you know geopolitical environment and

53
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,799
what we're faced with

54
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:00,079
you know when we take a look at pipe

55
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:03,280
dream you could easily take a utility

56
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,719
and place it

57
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:07,520
inside this presentation as opposed to

58
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,520
the port you could take a pipeline you

59
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,878
could take a critical manufacturer you

60
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:13,040
could take an airport

61
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,680
and you could interchange it with this

62
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,520
so as we walk through this you'll see

63
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,440
that there are some really interesting

64
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,959
parallels

65
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:22,400
with pipedream there are some

66
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,920
interesting

67
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,040
concepts that really span well beyond

68
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:31,679
the confines of a simple port attack

69
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,480
so this is the target the target

70
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,800
is a very large port and you see the

71
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,920
impact

72
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,760
that taking down a piece of critical

73
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,800
infrastructure would have now this is a

74
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,959
south florida port

75
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:47,120
but again this could really be any piece

76
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,680
of critical infrastructure um you know

77
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,239
and as we look at the adversaries that

78
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:55,519
we're now faced with

79
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:58,720
the attack on this particular port this

80
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,360
particular instance um we'll very

81
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,599
quickly see that it's not bitcoin that

82
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:04,959
they're looking for

83
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:06,720
right they're looking

84
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,480
to create chaos

85
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,120
they're looking to instill fear

86
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,400
they're looking to instill uncertainty

87
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,239
and they're actually looking

88
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:19,599
to harm and to potentially kill american

89
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:22,720
citizens so this could be really as we

90
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,959
look at uh the geopolitical forces of

91
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:29,440
today any nato nation around the world

92
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:30,799
so we're going to walk through a

93
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:32,560
sequence of events

94
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,799
as they occurred we're going to walk

95
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:37,920
through as armis was invited

96
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,519
to

97
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:40,400
log

98
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,280
and to alert on this attack we're going

99
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,440
to be reporting on exactly what had

100
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,920
occurred within this particular instance

101
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,799
and it started with a simple drive by

102
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:54,879
back on october 13th of 2021 it's akin

103
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:55,840
to

104
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,560
a thief or a robber driving through a

105
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,120
neighborhood simply looking to do some

106
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,159
due diligence maybe jiggle some locks

107
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:06,959
and that's what occurred xps black

108
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:09,439
happens to be our adversary and that's

109
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:11,439
exactly what happened at 8 45 in the

110
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:12,799
morning

111
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:15,680
it was a wednesday morning on the 13th

112
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,798
so what did they do xbs black then came

113
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:21,120
back the following day

114
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,199
and they ran a de-auth attack because

115
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:25,280
they found some wireless networks that

116
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,520
were connected within the port and they

117
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,080
found one particular ssid

118
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,320
called port authority and they ran a

119
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,880
de-auth attack against port authority if

120
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,639
you're familiar with what a death attack

121
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:39,040
is it's very common you can google it

122
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,520
it's a it's a way to do a brute force

123
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,680
entry into a wireless network

124
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,120
and that's exactly what they did and

125
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,800
they grabbed

126
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,840
dot 116 as their ip address so we'll

127
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,680
reference and we'll follow through their

128
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,479
steps as they begin to navigate and

129
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:56,720
migrate through this network looking for

130
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,720
their end target

131
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,120
and as you see we're beginning to

132
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,680
understand what that movement looks like

133
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,000
and you'll also quite interesting you'll

134
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,960
see that

135
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,800
all this is being logged

136
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,600
so xps black

137
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,840
when they gain access to the network

138
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,639
they then then launch nmap which is a

139
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:19,600
common application that you can grab

140
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,400
that begins to do network reconnaissance

141
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,919
right they're looking for targets

142
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:25,600
they're looking to look to move north

143
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,560
south and laterally within the network

144
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,320
and what they're specifically looking to

145
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,199
do

146
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:33,440
is they're looking for devices that are

147
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,919
talking on porch 502

148
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:38,639
port 2222 44818 we all know what those

149
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,919
ports are modbus and sip ports so we

150
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:44,240
sort of get an understanding

151
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,919
of what they're looking for but we're

152
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:47,919
not quite sure yet so we're going to

153
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:50,639
watch as they make their next move

154
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:52,639
along the way

155
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:56,720
they also find raspberry pi's they find

156
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,800
uh what else do they find they find

157
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,199
windows machines ups devices

158
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:03,600
wireless infrastructure

159
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,199
badge swipes card readers

160
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:09,440
they eventually settled in on this

161
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:13,680
device called crane plc and crane plc

162
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,199
responds back

163
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:15,919
with

164
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:19,280
port 23 port 80 and there's our modbus

165
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,000
port right port 502. so this is a bit of

166
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,520
a interesting parallel

167
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:29,039
with pipedream right pipedream and the

168
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:32,400
framework of what pipedream is

169
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,720
looking at modbus devices schneider

170
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,120
devices omron devices talking on port

171
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,080
502 leveraging modbus so at this point

172
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:44,800
in time we understand that our adversary

173
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,759
has found a modbus device in this case

174
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:50,880
it's called crane plc but up until this

175
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,840
point we weren't really quite sure

176
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,599
what our adversary was looking to

177
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:58,319
accomplish at this point we don't know

178
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:02,400
if it was simply a college kid from

179
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,080
university tampa

180
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,720
if it was uh advanced persistent threat

181
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,039
if it was a nation-state attack

182
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:12,240
but when this device eventually connects

183
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,199
to crane plc on port 502 we start to get

184
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,400
a picture

185
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,720
of who this adversary is

186
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,639
and this adversary is somebody with

187
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:23,520
skills this adversary is probably

188
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,560
somebody with backing this adversary is

189
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,039
someone that knows why they're there and

190
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:30,720
what they're looking for and in this

191
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,280
particular case they are looking

192
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,720
for a modbus device talking on port 502

193
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,360
and it's exactly what they've done

194
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,880
so now we're not so at this point

195
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,639
not being sure if they were in it for

196
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,440
bitcoin not sure if they were in it to

197
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,440
create chaos

198
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,800
when we see

199
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,639
at 6 59

200
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,400
which is

201
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,639
six minutes after their first

202
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:58,479
introduction into the network

203
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:00,560
we find what they're really after right

204
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,800
because they start sending coil write

205
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,319
commands into that modbus plc

206
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,000
so now we know a couple of additional

207
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
things right we know they're not in it

208
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,840
for the bitcoin at least not initially

209
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,360
maybe they're going to double back with

210
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,919
the threat that it's coming again but we

211
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:17,680
know that they're looking to instill

212
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,560
fear they're looking to instill chaos it

213
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,160
sort of starts sounding like a

214
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:25,360
nation-state attack

215
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,440
we also know

216
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,240
that the crane plc

217
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,679
is hoisted a 40-foot container up in the

218
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:38,199
air over the port

219
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:43,360
a moment later two minutes later crane

220
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,880
plc then

221
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,680
releases that container into the port

222
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,240
right so now we know exactly

223
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,920
who we're dealing with

224
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,959
we know that they're looking for uh

225
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:56,800
looking to create chaos

226
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,839
right fear uncertainty and doubt

227
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:01,680
um bitcoin isn't something that they

228
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,839
were really after in this particular

229
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:04,800
instance

230
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,720
so we're probably we're starting to

231
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,279
build the profile of who this adversary

232
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:10,320
might be

233
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,000
and the interesting thing is up until

234
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,720
this point as you'll notice in red

235
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,399
everything has been logged

236
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:19,440
right every activity every action

237
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,120
that this adversary xps black has made

238
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:28,240
within the six minutes has been logged

239
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,720
hour later i guess they stuck around for

240
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,240
a little while to see what other damage

241
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,040
they could do maybe watching to see

242
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,720
what type of chaos they created they

243
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,399
disconnect from the network and they're

244
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:41,839
on their merry way

245
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:43,920
all of it's been logged

246
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,320
so not only has it been logged

247
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,160
but there was a sequence of alerts that

248
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,800
were triggered

249
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:54,160
the first alert that was triggered

250
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,440
was

251
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,399
the

252
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:57,680
understanding

253
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,000
that a new device

254
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,200
and an unauthorized device named xps

255
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,079
black had joined the ssid

256
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:08,640
of port authority that occurred the same

257
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,519
moment that that device hit that deoth

258
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:14,800
attack and gained access into the ssid

259
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,880
port authority

260
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,480
a minute later

261
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,360
we saw this device then launch

262
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,279
unauthorized software

263
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:25,680
nmap

264
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,279
we saw that device and alerted on that

265
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:30,399
device

266
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:32,800
now port scanning from

267
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,480
address.116.

268
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,279
so this is xps black's address and alert

269
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:39,279
was triggered because there's an

270
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:42,079
unauthorized device that has launched an

271
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:44,839
unauthorized application suite called

272
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:47,200
nmap that is now beginning an

273
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,519
unauthorized activity which is a port

274
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:51,279
scan so it's beginning its

275
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:53,920
reconnaissance it's looking laterally

276
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,839
it's looking north south it's looking

277
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:58,839
for devices that it can connect

278
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:01,920
to it begins its lateral movement a

279
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,399
couple of miter attack alerts were

280
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:05,760
triggered

281
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,320
due to that lateral movement and the

282
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,959
commanding control that was sent to that

283
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:12,800
modbus plc

284
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,800
both triggered alerts

285
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,720
and then a moment later

286
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,000
was boom

287
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,040
right so

288
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,519
this is when that coil write command hit

289
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:25,040
the plc the crane plc dropped

290
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,279
the container and it hit the hit the

291
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:30,160
floor so the question is

292
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,360
why did the container drop

293
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,760
if we logged all the activities if we

294
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,680
logged all the actions

295
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,320
if we even alerted had so much as five

296
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,760
different alerts

297
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,079
that were triggered due to just the

298
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:46,800
sheer presence of this device being on

299
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,800
the network and then launching

300
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,920
applications doing port scans moving

301
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,440
laterally through the network and then

302
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,200
command and control activities against

303
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,800
that plc

304
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,560
why did the container drop

305
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:04,800
and it's an easy answer back in october

306
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:05,600
of

307
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,279
2021

308
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:10,160
missy invited armis down to a hack the

309
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,360
port event

310
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,839
down in tampa florida and what they said

311
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:14,800
was

312
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,760
we want you to sit there passively and

313
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,839
we want you to audit

314
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,600
we want you to

315
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,959
basically play back to the audience

316
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:28,639
what exactly occurred during the event

317
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:30,639
and and this was live you can you can

318
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:31,680
stream it

319
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,639
if you do a search for missy

320
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:36,399
uh dream port

321
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:38,800
and tampa 2021

322
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,120
they invited armist down basically to

323
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,959
sit there passively now this is

324
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:44,079
interesting

325
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:45,279
because

326
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:46,639
you know i came from the solutions

327
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:49,200
architect side so i did you know a lot

328
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,079
of the

329
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:52,160
the port infrastructure

330
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,519
working with the port infrastructure

331
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:54,959
organizations

332
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:58,160
through armis and my first reaction was

333
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,440
what do you mean you want me to sit

334
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,880
there passively

335
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,240
we can kill this connection at the

336
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,639
wireless lane controller

337
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,000
we can kill this connection when it

338
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,360
launched nmap we could kill this

339
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,800
connection when it

340
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,480
you know started to uh you know launch

341
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,399
scans we killed this connection when it

342
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:13,760
moved lottery when those miter alerts

343
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,399
came up we could kill that connection

344
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:17,839
and the response we got was yeah well

345
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:19,760
that would make for a pretty boring

346
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,120
simulation

347
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,079
right

348
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:24,240
so we're like okay okay

349
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,680
we will

350
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,720
log we'll alert we'll audit we'll

351
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,519
basically triage the event that just

352
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,480
occurred and then we'll double back and

353
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,040
we'll talk about the best practices

354
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,519
on how an environment of critical

355
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:41,440
infrastructure like a port and again

356
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,279
this could be a utility this could be a

357
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:44,560
pipeline it could be critical

358
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,880
manufacturing we'll then double back at

359
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,360
the end and we'll talk about

360
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,920
the different ways the best practices to

361
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,120
actually

362
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,680
prohibit these types of actions

363
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,319
from occurring

364
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,160
so there were two lessons that we took

365
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:05,199
away from this conversation

366
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:08,639
in tampa back in 2021 um because after

367
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,800
the event well actually during the event

368
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,519
and after the event there were

369
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:16,560
dozens and dozens of conversations

370
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,160
around what did we learn because this

371
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:21,040
was a simulation and this simulation um

372
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,360
it unfortunately it's all too real

373
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,639
especially

374
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:27,199
now you know with um

375
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:29,920
with pipe dream which follows along a

376
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:32,000
lot of the same routine

377
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,519
a lot of the same

378
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:35,199
uh you know commands that were sent

379
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:37,120
against modbus devices

380
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,320
you know

381
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,360
it's it's it's very topical in today's

382
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,120
day and age

383
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,880
so who thought that we'd be where we

384
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,320
were today

385
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,639
six or eight months ago back in tampa so

386
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:50,959
we sat around and we talked about best

387
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:52,880
practices what does it look like what do

388
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,880
we want to take from this event what is

389
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,440
the messaging that we want to offer up

390
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,320
to the audience and there were two

391
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,279
unique

392
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:04,079
themes that came from that event

393
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:06,800
the first one is how do i stay left of

394
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,040
boom right boom is the container

395
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,279
dropping into the port how do i stay to

396
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:14,079
the left of that it's a cia term meaning

397
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:16,079
i want to insert into the kill chain

398
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:19,199
before something goes boom right so one

399
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:21,120
of the threads was how do i stay to the

400
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,360
left of that and what came out of that

401
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,440
conversation was

402
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,480
well

403
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,760
i've got all this existing

404
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,759
infrastructure i've got i.t

405
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:31,440
infrastructure i've got ot

406
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,279
infrastructure i've got wireless lan

407
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:35,040
controllers i've got firewalls and i've

408
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,279
got nacks and i've got

409
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:39,839
sims and sores i've got

410
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:42,560
you know managed detection and response

411
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:45,040
what if we could find a way to leverage

412
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,279
that infrastructure

413
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:50,160
to stay left of boom in this particular

414
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:53,279
example this is where then i dug my

415
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:55,680
teeth in and i said you know what there

416
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,600
are plenty of places within that kill

417
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,320
chain where we could and where we should

418
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:03,440
insert into that process that really

419
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,839
took no more than 10 minutes the moment

420
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:08,560
that device xps black connected uh

421
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:09,920
through that d auth attack into that

422
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,839
wireless lan controller that container

423
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:13,839
was on the floor 10 minutes later right

424
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:16,720
so what could have happened during that

425
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,360
10 minutes so you see a diagram here in

426
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,000
front of you there's multiple places

427
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,040
that most all entities all organizations

428
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,440
regardless of sisa vertical that you

429
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,240
particularly reside in there's multiple

430
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,040
tools that you already have in place

431
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,360
number one wireless lan controllers

432
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:38,639
number two firewalls knacks

433
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:40,079
switches

434
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:42,880
there's multiple places to insert into

435
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:46,720
that kill chain to stop xps black from

436
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,279
ever even getting to the point

437
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:51,040
where they can send command and control

438
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,680
against that plc and you see several of

439
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,160
them here and i've x them out

440
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,160
there's multiple places

441
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,199
where

442
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:01,600
an organization can leverage its

443
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,880
existing tool sets whether it be meraki

444
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,679
whether it be cisco whether it be

445
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:11,039
fortinet whether it be aruba whether it

446
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:13,359
be you know name your model here there's

447
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:16,240
multiple places where one can insert and

448
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,959
leverage that existing infrastructure

449
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:22,000
as long as it's triggered by something

450
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,839
so we'll come around back to that in a

451
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:26,559
moment but that's what i wanted to do

452
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:29,120
during this simulation was i wanted to

453
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:31,440
trigger the existing infrastructure so

454
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,440
that we could stay left of boom and

455
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,679
we'll get to how we do that in a moment

456
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:38,480
but this was lesson number one that we

457
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,640
came away with

458
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,080
which was

459
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,160
we really need to leverage the existing

460
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,240
platform and tools because we already

461
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,080
have the people in place that are

462
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,480
familiar with those platforms and those

463
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,600
tools

464
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,080
so let's integrate and bring a singular

465
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:57,360
solution to the to the the port in this

466
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,720
case that leverages that infrastructure

467
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,799
lesson number two

468
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:07,200
words of wisdom from sun tzu

469
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:09,679
if you know the enemy and you know

470
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:12,640
yourself you need not fear the result of

471
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:15,039
a hundred battles

472
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:17,520
if you know neither the enemy nor

473
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:20,160
yourself you will succumb in every

474
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,520
battle

475
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,679
so we can't necessarily know everything

476
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:27,520
about our adversaries but what we can do

477
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,200
is we can know everything about

478
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,600
ourselves

479
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:34,160
which then puts us back into the

480
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,720
first section of that compound statement

481
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,880
if you know yourself you need not fear

482
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,240
the result

483
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:44,480
and what you see here is a catalog of

484
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,960
devices that are oftentimes found in

485
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,480
ports

486
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,640
right so there's not just plc's there's

487
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,760
not just controllers there's not just

488
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,600
uh you know the scada servers the

489
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,400
engineering workstations the hmi panels

490
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,039
right loads of them in a port but think

491
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:02,240
about

492
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,640
all of the other now connected devices

493
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,880
that aren't just in ports they're in

494
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,960
utilities they're in pipelines they're

495
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,679
in airports they're in the utility grids

496
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:13,679
as you drive up and down the streets all

497
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:15,760
the traffic cameras right the motion

498
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:16,720
sensors

499
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,320
everything is now connected and

500
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:21,120
unfortunately it's unaginable as you

501
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,200
heard yev in the deer talk

502
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,799
right they were talking about this

503
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:27,520
explosion of connected devices that

504
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,120
cannot be managed

505
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,120
they're not just found in ot they're

506
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,280
found everywhere and now with converged

507
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:36,640
networks industry 4.0 we've got all of

508
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,960
these devices interconnected so as you

509
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,039
look at this

510
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:42,799
this diagram

511
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:45,200
i didn't even circle them all

512
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,600
i probably could have added another 15

513
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,640
devices that are encircled with red

514
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,280
squares and those are devices that are

515
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:56,320
unaginable so the words of wisdom here

516
00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:00,000
is understand that these devices exist

517
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,240
within your network

518
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,720
and also they're interconnected within

519
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:07,200
the network we typically don't scan

520
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,360
these devices because god forbid we tip

521
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:12,080
one over we typically don't place agents

522
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:15,840
on ip cameras on printers on ups devices

523
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,960
on plcs right they're unagentable

524
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:22,080
devices so these are

525
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,080
the shadow devices right that are

526
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,480
unmanageable there are ways and we'll

527
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:29,120
get to it in the next slide or so

528
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:32,000
how we can know ourselves so that

529
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,840
we need not fear the result of 100

530
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:34,720
battles

531
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:37,679
so that was the second lesson

532
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:40,559
and interestingly enough as xps black

533
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:42,080
made its way

534
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,640
looking for that plc remember what xps

535
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,880
black came across came across raspberry

536
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:50,080
pi's cameras printers ups devices right

537
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:54,320
so those devices were in this simulation

538
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,159
but they're obviously also

539
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:59,120
all around us today

540
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:02,320
so how do we stay left of boom

541
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,480
how do we know ourselves how do we know

542
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,600
our enemies

543
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,960
so we need not fear the result

544
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,240
so

545
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,000
this is conceptually

546
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,480
where we want to talk about what is

547
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:17,360
available right this is the art of what

548
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:20,880
is possible right um and the way armist

549
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,200
constructs this messaging and how we've

550
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,600
constructed our technology and our

551
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,840
solutions in the marketplace

552
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:30,320
is really akin to google maps now i use

553
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,840
google maps all the time when i'm

554
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:34,000
leaving my house and i'm going to

555
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,600
you know a vacation or if i'm leaving my

556
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,760
house i'm going to a new restaurant i'm

557
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,919
popping in that destination because i

558
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:42,080
want to know everything about that

559
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,919
destination location and we all use

560
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:46,720
google maps some use waze same concept

561
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,080
right we want to understand where the

562
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,400
traffic cameras are where the police are

563
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,400
we want to understand where the detours

564
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,760
are we might want to understand the

565
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:56,000
context of how long it's going to take

566
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,799
if i go this route versus that route

567
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:01,360
right that's contextually

568
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,520
what google maps does for us when we get

569
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,840
into the car but now if we think about

570
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:08,640
what this can do for us contextually

571
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,480
when we talk about our enterprise and in

572
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,720
particular this port

573
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,320
right so

574
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,559
as we plugged into the infrastructure

575
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:19,200
passively into this port just to provide

576
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,840
reconnaissance on what xps black was

577
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:22,960
going to do

578
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,640
as it was moving throughout the

579
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,480
infrastructure looking for its end

580
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,600
target

581
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,039
arm has picked up

582
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:31,840
all sorts of unique devices in and out

583
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:34,799
you know in and around the port

584
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:37,440
the make the model the manufacturer the

585
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,760
software the applications

586
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,360
the firmware that's on those devices the

587
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:44,000
vulnerability on those devices

588
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,080
and adding that context to what these

589
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,880
devices are is incredibly important

590
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:51,200
because we then want to enrich that

591
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,480
information

592
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,520
with

593
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:56,240
data about those devices

594
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,039
that

595
00:22:57,039 --> 00:22:59,600
we don't know anything about

596
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,039
but our customers certainly know

597
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:02,159
something about them and what i'm

598
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:04,480
talking about here is integrating with

599
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,640
platforms that already exist within the

600
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,559
infrastructure so

601
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:11,600
as you're all commonly aware cmdvs very

602
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,640
popular endpoint protection very popular

603
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:18,960
nessus scanners rapid 7 scanners

604
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,320
all of those

605
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:23,919
existing i.t centric platforms know an

606
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:26,720
absolute ton of information about these

607
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:30,000
devices that only goes to add value to

608
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,080
the whole discovery process of what

609
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,559
these devices are because it adds

610
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:36,720
context to it

611
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,480
a plc

612
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:41,200
a an engineering workstation

613
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:45,919
connecting to a plc in the same segment

614
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:48,559
not too interesting

615
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:50,960
a dell machine connecting to that same

616
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:54,159
plc outside of that segment yeah maybe a

617
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:56,159
little bit more interesting

618
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:58,799
a dell machine outside of that segment

619
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:02,480
connecting port 502 to that plc

620
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:05,120
that is accepting smbv1 from the

621
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,480
internet

622
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,880
while they're on facebook

623
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,279
really interesting right so that is the

624
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:14,159
contextual difference when when when you

625
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:16,320
bring all of these types of information

626
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,799
together that the organizations that we

627
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:21,120
work with already know about these

628
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,159
devices

629
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:23,919
does it have endpoint protection on it

630
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:25,520
right what is its lateral movement what

631
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,440
this north-south movement

632
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:28,720
you know what are the connections that

633
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,720
it's making into those plc's is it

634
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,080
sending command and control to those

635
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,799
plcs contextually we can make better

636
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:36,640
decisions the more we know about what

637
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,640
these devices are and who they're

638
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:41,360
communicating to

639
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,400
we then

640
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,400
obviously need to map the communications

641
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,320
and this kind of really you know starts

642
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,400
to look a little bit like zero trust so

643
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,080
if we understand the framework of xero

644
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,520
trust we understand that we need to

645
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,440
under we need to identify our protect

646
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,600
surface our protect surface may be a

647
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,520
segment our protect service may be a

648
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,760
process our protect surface maybe an

649
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,400
entire boundary right but identifying

650
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,640
that protect surface step one

651
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,960
and step two step three is mapping the

652
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:10,240
communications of what the devices or

653
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,799
the components within that system are

654
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:13,840
creating

655
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:16,880
right this is understanding well that

656
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,320
scada server that engineering

657
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:21,120
workstation sending those sip commands

658
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,600
down to that plc

659
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,679
its connections are now extending beyond

660
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:27,679
the ot network it's then extending

661
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:30,480
beyond the it network there's risk there

662
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,480
so it's mapping those connections and

663
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,159
communications so that we can then make

664
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:36,320
good decisions we can then double back

665
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,840
to the

666
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:40,720
the network guys and understand why

667
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,640
these devices are accepting connections

668
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:45,200
from outside of that boundary or even

669
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:48,799
potentially outside of the enterprise

670
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,720
detecting vulnerabilities risks and

671
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,559
threats right so this is now where we

672
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:57,600
need to understand based upon what we

673
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,520
understand the genetics of a device is

674
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,600
the genetics being its makes models

675
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:04,080
manufacturer it's hardware and software

676
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,679
all the vulnerabilities on it the

677
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:07,520
actions that it's engaging in the

678
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,679
activities the connections that it's

679
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:12,559
creating this is about understanding the

680
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:14,080
risk posture

681
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:16,080
of all the various

682
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,960
components within the broader system and

683
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,440
then assigning a risk posture to that

684
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:24,919
broader system

685
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,799
and then you know as we come full circle

686
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:31,039
this then starts to you know double back

687
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:32,640
to the conversation i was having with

688
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:35,039
the folks at missy dreamport that put on

689
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:36,720
the simulation

690
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:40,320
of hack the port back in tampa in 2021

691
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,799
where i wanted to lean in and say yeah

692
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:45,919
but yeah but we can insert in this kill

693
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:47,039
chain

694
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:49,760
all the way back to the deoth attempt

695
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:51,600
into the wireless land controller let me

696
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,200
just orchestrate

697
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,679
the denial of that connection

698
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:57,919
let me orchestrate

699
00:26:57,919 --> 00:26:59,760
quarantining the device once that

700
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:02,159
launched nmap now let me orchestrate

701
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:05,360
cutting that tcp connection as that xps

702
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,679
black tried to communicate across that

703
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:09,840
firewall when it was engaging in port

704
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:13,039
scans let me engage in that

705
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:15,679
orchestration and cut that tcp

706
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:18,320
connection to keep that device off of

707
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,880
that plc once that device connected to

708
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,360
the plc and started sending those right

709
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,919
commands to drop that container let me

710
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:27,200
engage

711
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,520
into that kill chain

712
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,760
obviously we were told not to which was

713
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:34,399
fine but that's what this orchestration

714
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:37,919
of security automation is talking about

715
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:39,520
it's talking about leveraging the

716
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,919
existing infrastructure that's already

717
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:44,480
there and to take advantage of it

718
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:47,360
because it's already there

719
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,360
so what this is also talking about is

720
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:52,240
taking advantage of the individuals

721
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,399
that are already there that understand

722
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:56,399
these platforms

723
00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:59,120
right it's one thing to suggest hey we

724
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:01,279
can do security automation and we can

725
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:03,840
leverage the existing infrastructure

726
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,559
to remediate any bad behaviors or just

727
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:08,480
to keep folks off the network to begin

728
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,720
with it's another thing to suggest and

729
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,799
you know what we can use the existing

730
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:14,559
infrastructure that you already have

731
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:17,200
deployed that you already have human

732
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:20,559
assets running

733
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,399
so that brings us

734
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:26,480
full circle

735
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,840
to

736
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,360
armis

737
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:31,760
armis is six years old we just

738
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:34,960
celebrated our sixth anniversary uh not

739
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,640
too long ago

740
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,320
we have uh

741
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:41,840
an incredible base of business 40 of the

742
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:44,799
fortune 100 customers leverage armis

743
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:49,200
within their ot it and iot networks

744
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,039
they all leverage us

745
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:53,919
for one common use case which is then

746
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:56,080
the platform for all the other use cases

747
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,399
they want to solve for they all leverage

748
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:01,039
us whether it's port infrastructure

749
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:03,200
whether it's utilities whether it's

750
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,600
critical manufacturing pipelines

751
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:08,559
midstreams upstreams downstreams they

752
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:09,600
all

753
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,760
are looking for the same thing and the

754
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,840
same thing is really

755
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:16,080
the springboard

756
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:18,480
to get to a zero trust right to get to

757
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:21,279
cis controls to get to six two four four

758
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:22,880
three right to get to the various

759
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,880
frameworks that they're looking to get

760
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:27,520
to and that springboard is discovery

761
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,919
it's the discovery of every single asset

762
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:31,919
on the network regardless of if it's

763
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:34,960
wired regardless of if it's wireless if

764
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:38,240
it's within ot if it's within io uh it

765
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,720
if it's the building management devices

766
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,480
that surround those facilities that

767
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:45,360
deliver gas water and electric it's the

768
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,440
badge readers the card swipes the

769
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:50,080
elevators and the escalators everything

770
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,399
is within scope because i will tell you

771
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:55,279
for the most part more often than not

772
00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:58,000
all of these devices are interconnected

773
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,600
and all of these devices that are

774
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:02,080
exploding onto our networks they're

775
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:05,120
unaginable and we can't scan them

776
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:07,440
so that is the one use case that

777
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,440
regardless of vertical all of our

778
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,960
customers need to solve for and i

779
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,880
suspect many of you in the audience are

780
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:15,279
thinking the exact same thing right my

781
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:18,720
cmdb maybe knows about 40 of my devices

782
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:21,200
that oftentimes we find is a high number

783
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:25,200
right i can't scan my my qualis my rapid

784
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:28,320
7 i'm scanning known ips or i'm giving

785
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,000
it a range and i'm scanning in that

786
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,240
range but i don't know what i'm not

787
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,000
scanning i know i don't want to scan on

788
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,360
the ot side of the house because i don't

789
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:36,720
want to tip over

790
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:39,039
uh you know a process that's critical to

791
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:40,960
me right so it's all these hidden

792
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,399
devices

793
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:46,880
that are found within ot it and iot

794
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:49,279
and then building in that contextual

795
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:50,720
information that contextual

796
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,640
understanding of what those devices are

797
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:55,200
because i will tell you one of the

798
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,720
really interesting things that our

799
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,399
customers tell us

800
00:30:58,399 --> 00:30:59,679
is

801
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:01,840
if you give me too much noise you're

802
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:04,480
going to end up on the shelf

803
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,559
if i come in on monday morning and

804
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:08,960
there's 400 alerts

805
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:11,039
i'm just going to tune it out i've got

806
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:12,559
too much to do

807
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:13,919
i need to

808
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:17,279
get down to the remediation

809
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:19,360
of actionable threats

810
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:21,679
that actually

811
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:23,440
can impact my business

812
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,120
right and that's where we bring in the

813
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:28,159
contextual intelligence where

814
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:30,640
by integrating with scanning platforms

815
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:33,440
by integrating with cmdbs and sims and

816
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:36,640
source active directory and vcenter

817
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:39,840
crowdstrike symantec sentinel one by

818
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,840
integrating with all of these existing

819
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:44,240
platforms that already exist within the

820
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:46,000
network we can then bring that

821
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,120
contextual information to understand

822
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:51,360
if a scada server is trying to

823
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,799
communicate or an engineering

824
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:54,640
workstation is trying to communicate to

825
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:57,760
a plc within a hardened segment and

826
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,200
there are no connections in and out of

827
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,720
that segment or they're tightly

828
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,480
monitored

829
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,880
why signal an alert

830
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,080
if that

831
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,039
same

832
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:09,200
activity is being called

833
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,720
by a dell machine

834
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,960
with no endpoint protection on it

835
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,480
that we don't scan

836
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,000
that's within a protected environment

837
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,440
with high risk

838
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,600
it's different context it's delivering

839
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:22,559
the context of what the device is

840
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:24,960
and what its actions look like so we can

841
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:27,120
have actionable steps so we're not

842
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:29,600
chasing noise

843
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:32,000
armist does this continuously

844
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,159
we do this passively we sit on span

845
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:36,559
ports if we need to sit on span ports we

846
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:39,200
can do this virtually with ovas we can

847
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,880
also do this

848
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:44,240
with no ovas and with no hardware

849
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,159
devices on the network in this

850
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:48,799
particular port example we placed a

851
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:50,880
hardware based appliance

852
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,480
on a switch

853
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,919
and that switch

854
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:56,000
pretty flat network saw everything

855
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,480
coming and going there was a couple

856
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,880
access layer switches um that we pulled

857
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:03,279
data from as well but in in an ot

858
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:04,399
environment

859
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:06,240
you're typically going to want to see

860
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:08,240
the activities right we're going to want

861
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,880
to see the actions and communications

862
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,480
and connections that these devices are

863
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:13,919
making so we typically default to a

864
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:15,679
piece of hardware

865
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:17,840
could be ova but there are certainly

866
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:18,960
instances

867
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:21,039
where we can pull

868
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:23,440
all this information about device

869
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:26,240
awareness about vulnerabilities

870
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,399
all the contextual understanding simply

871
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:30,960
by integrations into the cloud right so

872
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:33,200
imagine being able to

873
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:36,080
with about you know 20 to 30 minutes

874
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:39,039
spent per integration a week's work we

875
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:42,480
can pull up you know 30 40 integrations

876
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,080
into some of our larger customers

877
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:46,799
existing environment and parse all of

878
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:48,480
that data

879
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,880
from their existing environments

880
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:53,039
into a cloud-based infrastructure called

881
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:54,240
armis

882
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,760
and then provide that contextual

883
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:58,559
understanding to them continuously in

884
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:01,039
real time without ever having to deploy

885
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:03,600
a device which leads to the final bullet

886
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:04,559
here

887
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:06,640
which is a quick time to value

888
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,000
so you know we have a lot of

889
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,320
conversations uh and a lot of customers

890
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,800
have actually come to armis um after

891
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,119
they've already tried on something else

892
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:16,639
right they went to the tailor and they

893
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:18,639
tried on a jacket and they're like well

894
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:20,560
it looked good on the shelf but it's

895
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:22,399
kind of short in the arms

896
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:24,159
right so they come back to armist and

897
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:25,199
they're like yeah i'm looking for

898
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:27,040
something that's a bit more easy to

899
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:30,079
deploy i'm looking for something that

900
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:31,679
i can integrate with my existing

901
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:34,560
platform i can't hire anybody i'm having

902
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:35,760
a hard time

903
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:38,560
keeping the people that i've got

904
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:40,560
so i certainly don't want to start

905
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,480
deploying new tools that can't leverage

906
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:45,119
the people i've got and the tools i've

907
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:46,879
already deployed

908
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:48,320
so what we're talking about here is the

909
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,879
quick time to value it's the ability to

910
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:54,159
deploy and get to good

911
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:56,879
in the amount of time that's reasonable

912
00:34:56,879 --> 00:34:59,440
with our customers

913
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:01,359
and you know we refer to that as

914
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:04,400
maximizing roi um because

915
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:05,920
you know and many of you may have

916
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:08,000
experienced this as well within your own

917
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,079
organizations these discussions are

918
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:12,240
occurring more at the board level and

919
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:15,680
they're coming down right the cxo level

920
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:18,079
and these decisions are coming down it's

921
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:20,720
not often that we see these

922
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,240
conversations

923
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,520
begin

924
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,720
and stay

925
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:27,200
on the plant managers level on the floor

926
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,200
right there are certainly wonderful use

927
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,960
cases that need to be solved for and we

928
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:33,760
do solve for them on the plant floor the

929
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,280
activities against all the industrial

930
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:38,079
control system devices do that all day

931
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:39,839
but what we are seeing is these

932
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:42,560
decisions are now coming top down

933
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,960
right they're coming from the board

934
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:48,000
the cxos the vp levels are coming

935
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,359
together and we're starting to see a

936
00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:51,040
convergence

937
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:53,359
between ot and it right we're starting

938
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:56,160
to see some of those barriers break down

939
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:57,520
we're starting to see some of those

940
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:59,920
walls come down and when those walls

941
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,200
come down

942
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,760
what you then have are platform-wide

943
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:06,079
solutions that leverage existing

944
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:08,720
infrastructure and more importantly

945
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:10,480
leverage existing

946
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:14,560
folks that run that infrastructure

947
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:20,240
so that's what i've got um i hope you

948
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:24,000
enjoyed our simulation into uh missy's

949
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,079
hack the port

950
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:30,079
we learned a ton from that engagement

951
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,640
interestingly enough since that

952
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,960
engagement armist has probably acquired

953
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,880
the management the security management

954
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:40,320
of half a dozen ports since october

955
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,200
so

956
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:42,560
certainly i'll be sticking around if

957
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:44,640
there are any questions that anybody has

958
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:46,480
with regards to

959
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:48,079
the hack the port event that we are

960
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:49,359
invited

961
00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:50,880
to audit

962
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,800
or anything about armis so thank you

963
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:55,839
very much
