1
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,759
please welcome your s4 program chair

2
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:13,240
dale peterson to the s4 main stage

3
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:18,800
it has been

4
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,000
27 long months

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,519
that i'm sure we're difficult for each

6
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:25,439
of us at times

7
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:27,519
but i'm so happy to be able to say

8
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:30,910
welcome back to s4 in miami south beach

9
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:36,009
[Applause]

10
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,960
welcome to the

11
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:42,800
797 attendees from 30 countries

12
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,800
welcome to the record

13
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,840
164 women

14
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,800
here at s4

15
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:55,120
[Applause]

16
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,680
yes this is progress but it's still only

17
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,359
represents about 20 percent of the

18
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:00,480
attendees

19
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,359
we have work to do

20
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:06,479
back at s 420 we had to limit the number

21
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:08,880
of tickets that were sold with access to

22
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,680
stage 2 technical deep dives because

23
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,200
the theater only held 200 people

24
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,600
and let's be honest stage three was kind

25
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,920
of more of a you know a bowling alley

26
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,000
than a theater

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,479
i'm pleased to say that this year we

28
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:28,080
have a 400 seat stage 2 and a 200 seat

29
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,680
stage 3 across the street at the elv so

30
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,680
your ticket gets you into all three

31
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,000
stages

32
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,600
after we did that we said well we

33
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,520
removed that limitation

34
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,320
what other limitations are we putting

35
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,600
on the event

36
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,759
so liz and i we looked at everything now

37
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:47,520
of course we kept what worked and what

38
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,880
you loved

39
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,040
but we looked at everything with a fresh

40
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,799
set eyes

41
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:55,600
from the program to the parties

42
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,560
from the stages to the swag

43
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,079
what do you think of the swag bag this

44
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:02,320
year

45
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:05,439
you know i

46
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:07,520
i did notice though that last night the

47
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,878
black hats

48
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:10,639
flew off the table there's none left and

49
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:12,480
we have a lot of white hats left and i

50
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,680
don't know what that says about you but

51
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,840
and as we looked at everything from the

52
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,920
focus of how do we improve the attendee

53
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,200
experience

54
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,840
and how do we help our create the future

55
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,160
mission

56
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,080
once we we did this we said we're going

57
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,599
to get even bolder we're going to make

58
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:33,840
the theme for s421 no limits

59
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,680
and we did this planning in february

60
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,120
2020

61
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,120
and then the universe showed us some

62
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,480
limits

63
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,519
and

64
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:43,120
and it showed us some limits again in

65
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,760
december with omicron and quite frankly

66
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,760
we were tempted to go virtual and we

67
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,000
were even more tempted to just stop

68
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,760
doing s4

69
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,920
but i really believe that we need a

70
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,680
place where the leading edge of the ics

71
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,239
security community can get together to

72
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:03,879
accelerate progress

73
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:06,720
now i know most of you

74
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,200
and i have great faith and admiration in

75
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,239
you

76
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:12,400
i don't always agree with you

77
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,879
but i love the spirit and energy you

78
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:17,519
bring to the challenge

79
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:18,480
so our

80
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,360
s4 recipe to create the future is we try

81
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,760
to bring together a large group

82
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:24,560
of

83
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,480
the leaders in ics security the people

84
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,560
on the leading edge trying to drive

85
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,920
change

86
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,760
now all are welcome

87
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,680
but we really design the event for those

88
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,200
people

89
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,560
then we put you in a creative

90
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,000
environment something very different

91
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,760
than what you do day to day

92
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,280
and even different than you see at other

93
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,200
conferences

94
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,760
next we throw ideas at you new ideas

95
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,959
crazy ideas conflicting ideas

96
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:51,360
and then the last ingredient and i think

97
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,560
this one might be the most important

98
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,040
is we give you free time at social

99
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,799
events and other things for all these

100
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:02,480
ingredients to mix rise and bake

101
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,560
we have seen

102
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,000
at s4

103
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,080
some really great things happen

104
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,640
we saw for example at s420 there was a

105
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,599
session on ics for ics

106
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:16,079
and a session on plc secure coding

107
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,358
practices

108
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:19,759
those went from initial ideas over these

109
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,199
past two years

110
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:23,520
to actual projects that are in place and

111
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,240
making a difference today

112
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,080
companies themselves have been conceived

113
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,080
here at s4

114
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,040
and i would be remiss if i didn't note

115
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,199
that the beer isac

116
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,240
started very very late one night after

117
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:42,240
s4 around the surf comer pool

118
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,479
now the key to this

119
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:46,160
create the future thinking and

120
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,160
accelerated change

121
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,199
i believe is no limits thinking

122
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:53,199
yes the vast majority of people out

123
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:56,080
there still need ics security 101 they

124
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,080
need those knowledge and recommendations

125
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,080
and raised awareness

126
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,479
but that's only going to get us slow

127
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:04,560
linear progress

128
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,600
and quite frankly it's a slog

129
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,680
if you were one of those people in 2005

130
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,639
that said it's going to take decades

131
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:14,880
to secure ics

132
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,320
congratulations you were right

133
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:20,400
but you maybe should have said three or

134
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,198
four decades

135
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,280
now if you have to do that slog in your

136
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,280
day job that's understandable and i'm

137
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,800
sorry for you

138
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,000
but this is s4 damn it we have to do

139
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,520
different things here we're not going to

140
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,440
create the future by just working hard

141
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,440
the same way we've been working the last

142
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,600
two decades

143
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,280
it took us a long time to get back here

144
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,240
longer than i think any of us expected

145
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,720
we need to make this week worth it

146
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,280
so yes have fun

147
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,479
and yes

148
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:54,639
create and establish those personal

149
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:56,479
relationships that we've all missed so

150
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:58,000
much

151
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,800
but yes also come up with new ideas and

152
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,120
approaches to create the future

153
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,160
of ics security and ot

154
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,039
i have a few different ways for you to

155
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:10,479
do that

156
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:12,639
the first one and this is my favorite i

157
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:14,400
call the flip

158
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,759
basically you take

159
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:17,840
conventional wisdom some saying some

160
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,120
mantra

161
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,199
flip it over and look at the world as if

162
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:23,280
the opposite was true

163
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,960
so a great example of this is devops

164
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,199
we for decades people thought long

165
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:31,840
uptime long time between reboots was a

166
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:35,520
key metric for reliability

167
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,319
devops showed us that in fact

168
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:40,639
frequent tear down and rebuild actually

169
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:43,440
increased reliability

170
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,240
so here's one for you

171
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,240
all employees need to care and be

172
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,479
involved in security

173
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:52,800
we spend a lot of time and money and

174
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,039
handling how do i just get my employees

175
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:57,120
to care more

176
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,880
what if we flipped that

177
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,080
and said

178
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,080
employees should have little or no

179
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,319
security responsibility

180
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:06,479
now you don't need to believe that but

181
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:09,280
what would if the world were that way

182
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,520
what would you do

183
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,440
to make security effective in a world

184
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:16,560
where that were true

185
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,479
here's another one

186
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:22,400
you can't protect what you don't know

187
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,039
what if we flip that to say

188
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:27,120
don't even bother trying to create and

189
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,319
maintain an accurate asset inventory

190
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:32,080
now i know the acid inventory vendors

191
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,759
out there your blood pressure just went

192
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:34,560
up

193
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,440
take a deep breath

194
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:39,360
it's going to be okay

195
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,199
you don't again you don't have to

196
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:43,039
believe that but just imagine a world

197
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:44,879
where that were true

198
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:46,560
what would you do differently if that

199
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,000
were true

200
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,440
and the last one and this is quite

201
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,400
frankly my favorite

202
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:55,680
cyber assets need cyber hygiene

203
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,479
what if we flipped that and said we need

204
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:01,759
to live with dirty cyber assets

205
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:03,280
what would you do differently if that

206
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,479
were true

207
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:07,280
so technique one is the flip

208
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:10,319
technique two i call the literal

209
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:13,440
we have these mantras again

210
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,599
that we frequently say and mostly

211
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:16,879
believe

212
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:19,680
but we don't act as if they're true

213
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,520
now you guys probably all know the most

214
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,039
common one

215
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,319
ot

216
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:27,199
is different than i.t

217
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:29,199
have you heard that one before yeah

218
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:32,559
maybe said it once or twice yourselves

219
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:34,559
i find that what most people mean by

220
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:37,440
that is keep your i.t security good

221
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:41,120
practice crap out of my ot

222
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,839
but if we take that literally ot is

223
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:45,680
different than i.t

224
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,240
then shouldn't we be coming up with ot

225
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,320
security controls and other techniques

226
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,720
that are not used in i.t that are unique

227
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,480
to ot

228
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,720
and coming up with those so that we

229
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,600
reduce the chance of a cyber or a cyber

230
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,560
physical attack causing an unacceptable

231
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,560
consequence

232
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,720
so what are those if we take this

233
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,920
literally what are those ot techniques

234
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,160
so one the flip

235
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,160
two the literal

236
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,480
three

237
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,000
i don't have a third sorry

238
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,279
they always say in speeches you should

239
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:22,959
do things in threes and i only have two

240
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:24,800
but maybe i'll create it this week and

241
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,240
i'll tell you about it in the closing

242
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,560
panel

243
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,360
now

244
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,080
we are making progress in ics security

245
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,399
largely due to the hard work of a lot of

246
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:36,880
people in this audience

247
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,160
it's just

248
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,760
too slow

249
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,680
we're not going to get where we need to

250
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,959
go when you need radically new ideas and

251
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,640
approaches

252
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,519
now s4 is an environment where you can

253
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:51,440
create those new ideas

254
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,519
open your mind let yourself go take some

255
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:55,680
risks

256
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:59,920
i want to close with my second favorite

257
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,399
lord john maynard keynes quote

258
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:04,399
the difficulty lies not so much in

259
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:06,240
developing new ideas

260
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,040
as in escaping from old ones

261
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,360
so let's see if this week

262
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,240
we can use the the sun and the fun the

263
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,480
good sessions and great company to

264
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,839
escape those old ideas

265
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:22,480
now you might be wondering my favorite

266
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,000
keynes quote was what he said right

267
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,079
before he died i wish i would have drunk

268
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:28,399
more champagne

269
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:30,800
i look forward to seeing what you create

270
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,839
this week thanks
