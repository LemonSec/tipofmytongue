00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,199
security alliance i'm very happy to be

8
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:25,400
back here at s4 can we all say that

9
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:29,869
[Applause]

10
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,558
two years ago i presented the idea of

11
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:36,079
ics for ics at s4

12
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:39,360
isa gca has worked with over its 50

13
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,399
member companies and many volunteers

14
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:44,399
most of the people in this room they

15
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:47,120
have done the work it it wasn't me

16
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,079
um but we have developed this program uh

17
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:51,520
and a lot of preparation for the

18
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,199
exercise that you all are going to be a

19
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:55,600
part of today so thank you for that

20
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,920
this is the agenda for today i will

21
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,960
provide a brief ics for ics overview and

22
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,280
some key points from the ics for ics

23
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,438
training on the web we will then conduct

24
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:07,040
the exercise

25
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,880
we will take a break and then finish the

26
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,799
exercise your input

27
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:12,479
will be needed to help us improve the

28
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:14,960
ics for ics processes and future

29
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,960
exercises so please we appreciate the

30
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,720
feedback we appreciate the input

31
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,159
ics for ics combined

32
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:26,080
three mature processes to improve

33
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,080
management of cyber security incidents

34
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,560
that impact industrial control systems

35
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,479
the incident command system was created

36
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:34,799
in the 1970s and variations of the

37
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:37,439
process are used in numerous countries

38
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:39,920
cyber security teams leverage computer

39
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,079
incident response processes defined by

40
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:43,920
nist and other organizations to

41
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,320
investigate incidents minimize the

42
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,079
impact of incidents and provide

43
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:50,240
information needed by leadership that

44
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,240
enables them to quickly make decisions

45
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,920
that lead to quick resolution of

46
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,960
incidents

47
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,280
industrial control system experts

48
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,360
currently manage the technical aspects

49
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,520
of many types of incidents including

50
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,240
cyber security incidents their expertise

51
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,479
of their systems enabled them to

52
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:08,318
identify alternatives to recover

53
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:10,959
critical business functions they support

54
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:13,599
ics for ics combines these three

55
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:15,760
processes and leverages the unique

56
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,319
expertise of each group to expedite the

57
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:20,480
response and resolution of cybersecurity

58
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,480
incidents

59
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,680
industrial applications are used to

60
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,920
support various aspects of our everyday

61
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,640
lives electricity that powers our homes

62
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,720
offices and plants rely on industrial

63
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,239
control systems

64
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:36,640
water and water sewage also rely on

65
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,640
industrial control systems

66
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,040
we have seen how a single cyber security

67
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,280
incident impacted the regional supply of

68
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,000
gasoline that disrupted transportation

69
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,920
for numerous states in a single region

70
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,519
of the united states

71
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:52,160
various gases that power our lives also

72
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,239
rely on industrial control systems to

73
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:57,200
produce and deliver gases to consumers

74
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,360
building control systems are critical to

75
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,519
maintain offices and many apartments

76
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:02,800
throughout the world

77
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,040
manufacturing chemical and other plants

78
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,040
are completely dependent on industrial

79
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,560
control systems

80
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,560
incident command system for industrial

81
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,080
control systems ics for ics processes

82
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,680
are designed to help all these

83
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,080
industries manage incidents to minimize

84
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,920
the impact of critical infrastructure

85
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,680
services

86
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,599
nations around the world have developed

87
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:25,360
critical infrastructure protection

88
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,280
programs because of increasing threats

89
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,840
that can impact their citizens health

90
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,319
safety and economies we are seeing an

91
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:34,000
increased number of cybersecurity

92
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,599
incidents that disrupt critical

93
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:38,000
infrastructure this was demonstrated by

94
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,319
the colonial pipeline incident resulting

95
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:42,720
in supply disruption and price increases

96
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,720
of fuels for automobiles

97
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,480
there are numerous other

98
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,319
incidents that have disrupted critical

99
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:50,480
infrastructure throughout the world

100
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,280
ics for ics is designed to improve

101
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,280
response capabilities of companies

102
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,920
organizations and government agencies

103
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,840
that coordinate incident response of

104
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,000
cyber security incidents

105
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,560
cyber security capabilities are

106
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,879
are deployed to provide multiple layers

107
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:09,680
of protection there is no single cyber

108
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,760
defense measure there's no silver bullet

109
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,360
that can absolutely protect against

110
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,320
cyber attacks we rely on layers of cyber

111
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,399
security capabilities called defense in

112
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:20,880
depth the intent is to delay or

113
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,600
completely prevent an attack an attacker

114
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,680
must break through numerous layers to

115
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,080
successfully attack the environment

116
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,560
these layers include physical security

117
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,800
of assets and the components and systems

118
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,440
that are used to operate those assets

119
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,759
cyber security policies and procedures

120
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,680
including user training

121
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,000
zones and conduits separate network

122
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,639
segments with the protective device

123
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:46,960
anti-malware solutions prevent various

124
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,040
forms of malware from compromising the

125
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,479
environment

126
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:52,400
access controls are critical because

127
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,720
weak unauthorized access has caused

128
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,800
numerous cyber attacks

129
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,880
monitoring and detection helps quickly

130
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,840
identify potential attacks so immediate

131
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,600
action can be taken to limit their

132
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,440
consequence and prevent an event from

133
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,840
escalating into an incident

134
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,600
patching has remained an important

135
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,759
measure to prevent known vulnerabilities

136
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:13,280
in software

137
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,520
even if more than one of these layers of

138
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,840
protection fails the other layers are

139
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,479
designed to prevent or limit the impact

140
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:21,919
of attacks

141
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:23,919
most organizations have computer

142
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:26,400
incident response capabilities this

143
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,160
includes a plan and staff who are

144
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,080
trained and participate in regular

145
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,080
exercises to ensure they are ready to

146
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,240
respond to a cyber incident

147
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,080
detection of events is an important

148
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:39,280
aspect of any cyber security program

149
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,120
numerous events are identified by

150
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,520
detection tools and log messages from

151
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,400
application servers and network devices

152
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,720
a large company probably has millions of

153
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,639
events occurring daily

154
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:53,600
a security operations center analyzes

155
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,080
events to identify those that present a

156
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,840
potential risk and require further

157
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,080
investigation and possibly additional

158
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,120
action

159
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,199
the sock takes immediate actions to

160
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:05,120
contain events to prevent them from

161
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,919
causing additional negative consequences

162
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:09,840
they also eradicate the source of the

163
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,400
event and if necessary take actions to

164
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,720
restore data and systems

165
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,360
a post incident review is completed to

166
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,919
understand how these cert processes can

167
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:22,639
be improved and to retain evidence from

168
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:25,600
the event the security operations center

169
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,840
will escalate to a leader or executive

170
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,800
when an event meets documented criteria

171
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,800
the leadership team has a documented

172
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,880
procedure to determine when an event

173
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,120
should be declared an incident

174
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,520
along with the list of people authorized

175
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,440
to declare an incident that's a key

176
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,560
point

177
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,800
declaring an incident triggers several

178
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,880
processes and commits the company

179
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,039
financially and in many other ways

180
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:50,479
including triggering government

181
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:51,680
reporting

182
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,080
the security operations center continues

183
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,720
to perform the cert steps unless the

184
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,880
leadership team instructs them to take

185
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,479
other action

186
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:02,639
this high level representation of the

187
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,560
purdue model shows how industrial

188
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,720
control system components are organized

189
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,479
into layers that are isolated with

190
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:09,680
firewalls

191
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,080
the industrial control system is often

192
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,919
connected to the company enterprise

193
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:16,800
network by using a dmz to host

194
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,800
components shared by both the enterprise

195
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,639
network and the industrial control

196
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:21,759
system

197
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:23,919
the incident command system is very

198
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:26,560
mature and is used by numerous companies

199
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,800
to manage various events like fires

200
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,960
natural disasters and other industrial

201
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,000
incidents the process is often not used

202
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,240
for cyber incidents though

203
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,479
the incident command system is based on

204
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:40,560
pre-planning organizing and training

205
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,840
teams ensuring they have appropriately

206
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,599
they have appropriate equipment to

207
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:47,280
respond to incidents

208
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,680
exercises ensure that all staff are

209
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,840
prepared to fill their role and that the

210
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,840
incident command process and tools work

211
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,720
effectively and evaluation is completed

212
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,879
after each incident and exercise to

213
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:02,240
identify actions to improve ics for ics

214
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,680
processes

215
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,759
the incident command system is used

216
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:07,680
every day by first responders and is

217
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,599
part of the national incident management

218
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:12,240
system also known as nems nems was

219
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,240
mandated for the u.s government by

220
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,400
homeland security presidential directive

221
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,280
5

222
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,639
hspd5 issued in 2003.

223
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:22,560
the incident command system provides a

224
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,639
standard approach the coordination

225
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:26,639
process and management strategies are

226
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,800
the same for all responders regardless

227
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,280
of the incident of the type of incident

228
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,120
the system was born from decades of

229
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,120
emergency management activities which

230
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,200
makes it very effective

231
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,519
unity of command allows everyone to know

232
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,399
their role and who they report to

233
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:44,240
clarity of responsibilities is

234
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,680
accomplished because everyone is

235
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,560
assigned a role a title and a list of

236
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,760
tasks

237
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,920
span of control limits the number of

238
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,399
people and tasks a supervisor is

239
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:57,680
reasonable is reasonably able to manage

240
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,160
common terminology ensures that everyone

241
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,640
speaks the same language

242
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,440
adaptability means incident command is a

243
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,399
very flexible system it can be used for

244
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:11,040
in for an incident of any size and

245
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,399
complex and complexity it also can grow

246
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:16,320
or shrink based on the needs of the

247
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,760
incident

248
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,920
planned and unplanned events can be

249
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,640
managed by the incident command system

250
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,399
the system ensures there is no

251
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:26,880
duplication of efforts we don't want

252
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,120
multiple parties working on the same

253
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,480
task

254
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,200
accountability is easily achieved since

255
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,000
everyone is assigned a specific role

256
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,279
title task and duty therefore each

257
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:41,200
person is accountable for their own

258
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,480
actions

259
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,720
accountability during incident

260
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,680
operations is essential the ics

261
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,920
structural will need to abide by company

262
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,880
policies and guidelines as well as any

263
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,920
applicable laws and regulations

264
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,760
the incident command system has a

265
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,959
planning p process to manage all hazards

266
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:02,800
the planning cycle consists of the

267
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,959
detailed steps necessary to guide the

268
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:08,399
ics for ics team through the five phases

269
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,640
of the planning process to develop

270
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,440
disseminate implement and adjust an

271
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,360
incident action plan based on the

272
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,040
incident objectives

273
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,519
the all hazards planning cycle provides

274
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:22,079
a systematic standardized and effective

275
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,000
approach to organizing response to

276
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,120
incidents

277
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,440
after the initial response the planning

278
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,240
p defines the operational cycle which is

279
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,880
repeated the planning p operational

280
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,600
cycle likely will be repeated multiple

281
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,839
times even as a new shift of staff

282
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:40,000
arrives to man the effort

283
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,560
planning p provides structure by

284
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,720
prescribing the order in which meetings

285
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,399
or briefings occur

286
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:49,040
and identifying the person responsible

287
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,279
for collecting incident data and the

288
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:53,600
parties who will make decisions

289
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,240
and defining the actions and work

290
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,839
products that are assigned to each of

291
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:00,480
the ics for ics teams

292
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,320
we've developed a training video that

293
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:05,120
explains ics for ics and the incident

294
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,360
planning process if you have not seen

295
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,279
these videos you can view the training

296
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:12,480
by visiting the ics for ics website you

297
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,959
will receive a link to the website after

298
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:16,160
s4

299
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,240
i'm going to share information about the

300
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,440
ics for ics exercise and help everyone

301
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:25,360
understand the exercise scenario

302
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,680
the purpose of the exercise is to help

303
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,320
everyone understand the ics for ics

304
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,480
process that can be used to manage a

305
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,640
significant cyber incident

306
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,279
this exercise is designed to demonstrate

307
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:41,040
how ics for ics processes are initiated

308
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,880
when an event is identified as a

309
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,480
possible incident

310
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:47,680
engage ics for ics team members to

311
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,079
participate in response efforts

312
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:51,839
complete the initial assessment to

313
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:54,079
determine if the event will be declared

314
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:55,279
an incident

315
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:57,360
work to respond to the incident and

316
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,680
limit its impact to the business

317
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,760
demonstrate how key components of the

318
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,800
ics for ics program can manage incident

319
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,079
response

320
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:08,240
we hope that companies will incorporate

321
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,279
ics for ics program capabilities into

322
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:13,360
their company processes

323
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,160
ics for ics is focused on cyber

324
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,560
incidents that industrial control system

325
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,800
or other critical infrastructure

326
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,040
is or other critical infrastructure

327
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,279
operations we are performing the

328
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:28,160
exercise as a single company based on

329
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,720
assumptions of that company not the

330
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,880
individual companies of the people who

331
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:36,720
are playing the roles of the exercise

332
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,959
i want to briefly review the roles that

333
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:40,800
are part of the exercise

334
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,959
players are the people on the stage who

335
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:45,200
will fill the roles defined in the ics

336
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,600
for ics process

337
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,079
the facilitator is my role i will help

338
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:52,000
provide information and ensure the

339
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,160
exercise stays on track to achieve the

340
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,360
objectives

341
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,760
note takers will document the ics for

342
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,399
ics exercise activities and prepare for

343
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:02,560
feedback that can be used to improve the

344
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,200
ics for ics processes

345
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,440
observers you are in the audience you

346
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,440
will be asked to provide feedback during

347
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:13,519
the hot wash at the end of the exercise

348
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,120
we are conducting a facilitated exercise

349
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,560
there are many different types of

350
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,240
exercises but this is known as the

351
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,480
facilitated discussion it's laid back

352
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,720
it's informal and we're using this for

353
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:25,760
training

354
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,839
we are recording the exercise and we'll

355
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:30,639
publish the video in the next week

356
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:32,959
you will observe the players on stage as

357
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:35,040
they participate in threat briefing and

358
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,440
other meetings that are part of ics for

359
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,639
ics

360
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:41,760
the exercise is divided into two modules

361
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,680
with the first focus on the initial

362
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,240
activities that trigger the formation of

363
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,199
the ics for ics team and initial

364
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:51,120
response activities

365
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,600
the second will focus on how we manage

366
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,000
the response to a ransomware extortion

367
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,240
attempt and media inquiries

368
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,120
we will conclude this exercise by asking

369
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,760
you to participate in the hot wash that

370
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,240
will seek your input to improve the ics

371
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:10,959
for ics program and future exercises

372
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,279
this exercise is designed to help

373
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:16,320
everyone learn and to improve the ics

374
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,600
for ics program processes and future

375
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,480
exercises this exercise involved

376
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,560
multiple companies so we had to make

377
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,240
some assumptions about a fictional

378
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,399
company for this exercise

379
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:30,720
please accept the assumptions made in

380
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,639
the exercise scenario

381
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:34,160
this is often the first rule of

382
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:38,800
exercises do not fight the scenario

383
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,279
the purpose of the exercise is to learn

384
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:43,680
and not fix the scenario we have a

385
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:46,000
limited time for this exercise so we

386
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,399
must accept that not everything can be

387
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:51,120
achieved today

388
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,199
now we will discuss the specific

389
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:54,880
scenario that was defined for this

390
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,279
exercise

391
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:00,399
on day one dhs sisa alert is released

392
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,800
regarding phishing campaign compromising

393
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,680
networks and servers in the usa

394
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,880
on day five a local radio station has a

395
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,959
context and some of the company

396
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:13,600
employees reporting receiving an email

397
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,639
with the link to sign up

398
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:18,480
many employees report this as a

399
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,720
potential phishing attempt

400
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,800
one employee states

401
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,399
they click the link

402
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:27,360
on day 10 employees call facility

403
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,600
management to complain about it being

404
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,639
too hot in their offices facility staff

405
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:34,560
investigate and determine that the

406
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,160
sensors are reporting normal

407
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,360
temperatures

408
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:40,399
they contact the hvac vendor who agrees

409
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:42,880
to send a person on site

410
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:46,399
on day 11 at 9 35 a.m

activated but fire department determines

413
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,560
that there is no fire

414
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:58,560
on day 11 at 10 a.m hvac staff who are

415
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:01,120

416
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,279
compromised by malware

417
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:05,759
the vendor cannot contain or eradicate

418
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:07,759
the malware

419
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:10,880

assume the authorities if the primary ic

485
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:42,640
is not available or as the incident goes

486

during the team's incident response

496
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,559
after the incident commander identifies

497
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:06,400
who will be part of the ics for ics

498

to be able to contain or eradicate the

513
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:37,120
malware that's impacting the hvac system

514

i get information from eric so i can

515
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,120

and this is going to help the ics for

519
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:48,320
ics team understand the situation

520
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,160

521
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,760
do the work that they were doing with

522
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,600
the hvac vendor to investigate and look

523
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,039
for other alternatives to restore

524
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:57,520
operations and i contact the executive

525
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,919
leadership team in the company

526
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:01,280
to let them know that you know if

527
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,480
they're part of the crisis management

528
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,240

529
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,559
what's going on keep them informed and

530
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:08,799
any escalations that i might need uh

531
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:10,720
with the cmt

532
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,280
so only certain uh company executives uh

533
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,559
and people designated as instant

534
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:17,039
commanders are uh given the authority in

535
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:19,360
this construct uh to actually declare an

536
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,840
incident so as the incident commander i

537
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:24,480

positions they almost always do uh

543
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,360
activate the ics for ics positions

544
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,120

external parties like law enforcement

568
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,240
agencies

569
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,159
the general staff are section chiefs who

570
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:28,080
are who also report directly to the

571
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,159
incident commander each of them lead

572
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:31,280
staff in their sections and are

00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,520
accountable for specific work products

574
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,200
the section chiefs fill any roles that

575
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,280
have not been staffed below them

576
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,120
the finance administration section chief

577
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,559
is responsible for managing all

578
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:43,200
financial aspects of an incident

579
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,120
logistics provides all incident support

580
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,720
needs such as medical food

581
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,720
transportation housing ordering

582
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,320
resources etc

583
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,520
the planning section chief is

584
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,200
responsible for managing all information

585
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,360
relevant to the incident response they

586
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,760
collect evaluate process and disseminate

587
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,760
information for use by responders at the

588
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:00,720
incident

589
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,159
and the operations section chief is

590
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:04,159
responsible for managing all tactical

591
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:06,640
operations of the incident

592
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,559
so as is commander as i mentioned it's

593
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:10,320
my job to determine which roles we need

594
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,000
right so i'm going to need an operations

595
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,440
section chief to actually manage the

596
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,520
cyber security and response team efforts

597
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,120
right which are all thinking of instant

598
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,320
response but that's not the whole

599
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:21,360
picture that's why ics for ics exists

600
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,120
right i'm going to need to staff some

601
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,120
other positions right away

602
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,280
but i may choose as the incident evolves

603
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:30,080
to to staff more positions as we go

604
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,440
right and so i'm going to see based on

605
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,840
what's going on so but for right now um

606
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,440
you know i'm going to need an admin

607
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,799
finance second chief right we have to

608
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:39,039
pay for all of this and do accounting

609
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:40,720
and that needs to start from day one so

610
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,240
that's a that's a priority for me in

611
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,400
addition to operations uh i'm clearly

612
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,679
going to need a planning section chief

613
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:47,600
it's going to help actually manage this

614
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,799
incident and make sure that we're doing

615
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:49,760
everything

616
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:50,880
and that's going to get data to the

617
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,720
operation section chief and help them

618
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:55,600
get what they need for the ir activities

619
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,559
um

620
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:58,080
really important one i need a public

621
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,640
information officer or pio uh to manage

622
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,400
public relations if you think you can

623
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,200
keep it quiet you went you can't so

624
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,640
always be planning for that right and

625
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:09,200
then of course i need a safety officer

626
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,280
it's control systems people to ensure

627
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:14,400
the safety of the staff uh in any of the

628
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,559
impacted offices and really importantly

629
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:18,400
of the ics for ics team members

630
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,400
themselves right first rule of instant

631
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,480
response is don't become a victim right

632
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,000
so each section chief is going to

633
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,440
request some resources for their

634
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,200
sections and they might create a

635
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,200
structure below them for some unileaders

636
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,559
to manage sub-teams to accomplish

637
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:32,720
specific tasks or something like that

638
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,960
so um you know as i mentioned as the ic

639
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,480
i'm going to answer to the the crisis

640
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,080
management team of the cmt right and

641
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:40,240
typically in a company context that's

642
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,320
going to be the executive leaders of the

643
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,480
company right the command and general

644
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,080
staff that i've activated though they

645
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,960
report to me right and only me

646
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,240
they might come from different parts of

647
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,520
the organization that's why on the

648
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,200
graphic hopefully you're seeing some

649
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,120
dashed lines that show the relationship

650
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:57,120
of their positions and their day jobs

651
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,880
right but for the purpose of this

652
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,880
incident they report to me right buck

653
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,240
stops here

654
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,159
so for example here the admin finance

655
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:05,919
section chief's day job is that might be

656
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:07,520
the cfo but for this incident they

657
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,039

658
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:10,960
this incident

659

incoming team members so they can hit

679
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,480
the ground running if there is no time

680
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,960
or very limited resources the ics-201

681
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,559
will be hand-written in a sketch

682
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:57,760
free-handed

683
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,840
for this exercise we've created a formal

684
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:02,320
ics 201 form to make it easier for you

685
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:05,440
to read and follow along

686
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,880
you can also use your tablet or cell

687
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,960
phone camera to scan the qr code to

688
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:11,360
download the ics 201 incident briefing

689
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:14,678
and a copy

690
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:19,360
we had a long chat about this

691
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:24,000
in in real incidents we actually use

692
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,760
these to great effect

693
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:28,240
with those caveats so but you can do

694
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,640
this this goes to google drive mine

695
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,400
uh if you want to capture copy that

696
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,080
we'll have one for the incident action

697
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,360
plan later

698
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,600
so uh as insect commander if you've

699
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,679
chosen to click the qr code and you

700
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:43,840
should it's safe i promise

701
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,000
so i'm going to update the the 201

702
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,600
incident briefing form to create an

703
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,080
incident name put give it a number or

704
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,919
potentially use the number from the

705
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:55,200
ticketing system

706
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,960
if it came from the the computer

707
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,039
incident response team as this one did

708
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:01,039
um and you know put in the date and time

709
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:02,559
you know basic logistics that you might

710
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:04,400
overlook this is why forms are helpful

711
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,000
people yeah

712
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,840
good next slide

713
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:10,400
right so um i asked the uh industrial

714
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,400
control systems analyst to provide us a

715
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,320
visual that will help with the scope of

716
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:16,799
this incident right and so the visuals

717
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:18,640
is one thing that uh is an area where

718
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,720
there's a little bit of distinction from

719
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:23,360
uh traditional instant command system uh

720
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:26,400
in my view right so in this uh graphic

721
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,559
right it's gonna show the the different

722
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:30,159
things in the facility et cetera

723
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:32,559
normally in like a disaster management

724
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:34,240
you're gonna have like a physical map of

725
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,720
the area of the disaster right or or if

726
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,080
you're like a sector commander your

727
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:41,200
particular area right but uh for uh ics

728
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:44,159
for ics right the logical environment

729
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:46,080
may be just as important or more

730
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,600
important than the physical environment

731
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,440
it really kind of all depends uh what's

732
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,520
needed right so having some type of

733
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,880
picture though really helps everyone get

734
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,799
on the same page which is one of the key

735
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:57,760
elements of the ics 201 is to make sure

736
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:00,640
everyone has the same understanding so

737
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,799
yeah we might have a logical diagram if

738
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:04,400
it was impacting multiple buildings

739
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,240
perhaps we'd have a picture of the

740
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,000
different buildings it was impacting

741
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,080
multiple buildings over multiple just

742
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,840
geographic areas perhaps we'd have those

743
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,760
maps too right but you kind of have to

744
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,440
figure out what visual suits the

745
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,360
scenario and use that to help everyone

746
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:19,440
have that shared understanding so i'm

747
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,120
also going to update the situation

748
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,799
summary and health and safety briefing

749
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:25,120
section and this is to get the make sure

750
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,240
that we have any health and safety

751
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,360
hazards

752
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:30,080
that are documented and give the safety

753
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,039
officer

754
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:32,880
here a leg up on what they're going to

755
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,039
need to make sure that we're providing

756
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:38,159
ppe or whatever to our our personnel as

757
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:39,679
they they do the response right so

758
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:41,279
that's part of my job as we boot up the

759
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:42,559
incident

760
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:44,159
in a large incident it's possible that a

761
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:45,840
unified command will be necessary for

762
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,200
incident management

763
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,960
for example if a cyber security incident

764
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:51,200
causes a fire or spill representatives

765
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,360
from all agencies involved such as

766
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,600
company representatives responding fire

767
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,840
department epa or anybody else would

768
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:00,320
form a unified command making decisions

769
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,000
as a group and they would designate a

770
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,840
single public facing represented to be

771
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,320
the voice of the unified command in our

772
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,159
case a unified command is not needed

773
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:10,559
therefore this meeting will not occur

774
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:12,240
now that the initial response phase is

775
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,679
over we are entering the circular

776
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:15,840
planning cycle this phase is continuous

777
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,200
and ongoing for the duration of the

778
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,120
response the cycle of planning

779
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,720
activities will be repeated based on the

780
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:23,200
chosen operational period typically in a

781
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,279
very dynamic situation the planning p is

782
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:27,360
repeated every 12 hours so the teams can

783
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,360
get feedback from the operations folks

784
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,640
and still have time to do their work

785
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,640
before the next set of planning meetings

786
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,320
in a very low key incident an

787
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,799
operational period may be every 24 hours

788
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:38,480
a lap around the planning p is

789
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,960
considered one operational period

790
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,640
the current team staffing the ics for

791
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,399
ics team will have to be relieved after

792
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:45,840
some number of hours so they can get

793
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:48,000
some sleep the ic has determined the

794
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,360
operational period for this incident

795
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:52,640
will be 12 hours from 0 600 to 1800 and

796
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:56,000
1800 to 0-600 at 1800 the current team

797
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,360
will brief their replacements and be

798
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,200
backed by 0 600 in the morning to start

799
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,039
the next operational period

800
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:02,240
now we're into the racetrack of the

801
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,679
planning p and we start with the

802
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:05,679
incident command or unified command have

803
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:07,039
a meeting to develop or update

804
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:09,039
objectives this is also called a

805
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:11,120
strategy meeting the priorities and

806
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,640
objectives will first address life

807
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,240
safety needs based on the specific

808
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:16,399
incident we must ensure the safety of

809
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:18,000
our staff and the communities where we

810
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:18,960
operate

811
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,720
stabilizing the situation is the next

812
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:23,039
priority which enables the ics for ics

813
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:24,799
team to work the incident in a stable

814
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:26,640
environment and allows the business to

815
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,880
stabilize their operations while the ics

816
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,720
for ics team works to resolve the

817
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:31,679
incident

818
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:33,360
and the third priority is minimizing

819
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,279
adverse environmental impacts from the

820
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:38,000
incident the ics for ics team will work

821
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,520
together with a goal of managing the

822
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,120
immediate environmental impacts

823
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:43,919
potentially caused by the incident

824
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:45,200
at this meeting the objectives are

825
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,279
developed and are identified and the ic

826
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:48,960
determines the following what are the

827
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:51,520
response priorities is it life safety an

828
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,279
issue is it to get the industrial

829
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:55,520
control systems back online is it public

830
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:56,720
information

831
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,720
or is it something else or some things

832
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,399
else

833
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:01,760
limitations and constraints of the

834
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:04,080
response limitations might be will the

835
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:06,240
union object to longer hours

836
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,080
will the local community object to noise

837
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,520
after 11 pm

838
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,279
a limitation can be anything which can

839
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:13,360
limit response activities

840
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,120
constraints what is going to make the

841
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:17,440
response activities impossible a

842
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,840
hurricane is about to strike the city

843
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,520
heavy rain makes working on electrical

844
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,679
devices in the open dangerous

845
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:25,679
or severe cold working outside is out of

846
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:26,880
the question

847
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,799
the local mayor said no matter what no

848
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:30,559
response activities can take place until

849
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:32,240
the organization makes a fully disclosed

850
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:35,360
public statement about what is happening

851
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,760
critical incident requirements or cirs

852
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,760
are identified and delivered to the team

853
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,760
what type of information the incident

854
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:42,960
commander wants to know in the middle of

855
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,159
the night versus what type of

856
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:45,679
information can wait until the next

857
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:48,399
scheduled meeting

858
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,840
this is an example of a meeting or

859
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,840
briefing room layout visual aids are

860
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,760
placed on the front wall all meetings

861
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,440
will have a ground rules and agenda

862
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,279
visual the rest of the visuals are

863
00:30:57,279 --> 00:30:58,799
dependent on the meeting or the needs of

864
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:00,240
the presenters

865
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,840
presenters will be lined up in order of

866
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,760
their presentation along the sides so

867
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,840
they can quickly move up to the front

868
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:08,399
when it is time for their presentation

869
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:10,320
a flip chart on an easel with markers at

870
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,440
the front of the room is helpful for

871
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,760
notes and ad-hoc items attendees

872
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:15,120
positions will be clearly marked in

873
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,880
their seats desk cards or by wearing

874
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:20,720
specific position vests

875
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:22,080
ground rules are typically the same

876
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,840
incident to incident these are some

877
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,840
common ground rules silence phones

878
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,519
radios and pagers unless it involves

879
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:29,120
life safety at which point take it

880
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,480
outside

881
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:31,679
and come back into the meeting when the

882
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:34,000
situation has been resolved no text

883
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,159
messages or emails again unless it

884
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:38,640
involves eye safety take it outside deal

885
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,240
with it then come back in

886
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,399
no sidebar conversations

887
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:44,720
stick to the agenda

888
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,159
presenters will be lined up off to the

889
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:48,080
side and order their

890
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,679
in order of their presentation so they

891
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:51,919
can quickly get to the front as in this

892
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:52,880
visual

893
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,559
the planning section chief usually runs

894
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:56,000
meetings and will call the chiefs by

895
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,600
name or position

896
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,360
when presenting the presenter needs to

897
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,360
be up front with visual aids facing the

898
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:03,440
audience and must speak loud and clearly

899
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:06,880
so that everyone in the meeting can hear

900
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,559
six hold all questions comments and

901
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:10,640
concerns until after the meeting the

902
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,159
only exception to this is the command

903
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:14,159
and general staff meeting questions and

904
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:15,840
concerns must be addressed in this

905
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:16,960
meeting

906
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,640
so every member of the team is on the

907
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:21,039
same page and finally number seven

908
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:24,399
maintain covet protocol if applicable

909
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:26,480
hello my name is neil gay and i'm the

910
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,960
planning section chief i facilitate this

911
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,640
meeting and typically present draft

912
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,159
objectives for the incident commander's

913
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:34,080
consideration the incident commander

914
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:36,159
will identify and or review response

915
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:38,320
priorities constraints and incident

916
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,799
objectives

917
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,880
so it's my job as the innocent commander

918
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,480
to establish incident objectives that

919
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,159
drive our incident operations right

920
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:47,840
these objectives are used to ensure that

921
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:50,000
everyone in the ics for ics organization

922
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,679
has clear understanding of what we are

923
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:52,559
trying to do and what needs to be

924
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:55,120
accomplished so for me for right now the

925
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:56,880
top three priorities for this incident

926
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:59,120
are going to be again life safety

927
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:01,360
incident stabilization and property

928
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:04,640
environmental preservation

929
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,799
establishing incident objectives is done

930
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:08,480
using management by objectives which

931
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,960
includes establishing smart objectives

932
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:13,200
as for specific a detailed explanation

933
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,880
of what we want to accomplish

934
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:17,279
m measurable what metrics are we going

935
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:18,480
to use to confirm we've met the

936
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:19,519
objective

937
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:22,000
a achievable the task at hand must be

938
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,840
possible

939
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,760
relevant the objective must help solve

940
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:28,480
the problem and t time bound we must set

941
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,320
up a realistic time frame to accomplish

942
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,000
the tasks necessary to meet our

943
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,360
objectives

944
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:35,039
so i developed these objectives for the

945
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:36,720
incident with input from others and

946
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:39,039
documented into that ics 201 incident

947
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:40,640
briefing form we talked about earlier

948
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,159
right we're going to review these

949
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:44,159
objectives at the next meeting and i'll

950
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:46,320
update the objectives based on as the

951
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:47,840
incident changes right things change

952
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:50,559
objectives change

953
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,159
the command and general staff meeting

954
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:53,519
may be the only time during this

955
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:55,120
operational period when all members of

956
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:57,120
the team are in the same room

957
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:59,120
this is the time for the ic command

958
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,720
staff and the general staff who are the

959
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,720
section chiefs to ask questions this

960
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,080
meeting is an open environment where

961
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,600
staff can near dirty laundry and ask

962
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,440
questions to clear the air

963
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:08,800
the ic defines the length of the

964
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,159
operational period that will determine

965
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:11,839
when this meeting will reoccur which

966
00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:13,440
also determines the timing for the other

967
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,679
planning p meetings the planning section

968
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:17,679
chief will lead this meeting normally

969
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:19,119
this meeting will be repeated on the

970
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:21,040
established 12-hour cycle but the

971
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,719

972
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:24,480
meetings more frequently or schedule

973
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:27,679
ad-hoc meetings as requested by the ic

974
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:29,679
the ic establishes the organization to

975
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:31,040
remind section chiefs that they are

976
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,719
responsible for performing actions

977
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:34,879
within their section for positions that

978
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:37,839
have not been staffed

979
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,480
as the planning section chief i'm

980
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,239

982
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,159
have at least one command and general

1014
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:52,240
forms today all of them are not

1015
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:54,320
available by qr codes but if you go to

1016
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:56,880
the fema website and look up any ics

1017
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,079
form you're going to find it that's the

1018
00:35:58,079 --> 00:35:59,680
value of having all these forms already

1019
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:02,240
pre-done for you

1020
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:04,480
i've also posted multiple copies around

1021
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,240
the incident command post to ensure the

1022
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:09,680
command and general staff see it

1023
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,680
when setting the meeting schedule the

1024
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:13,280
timing between meetings must allow

1025
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,040
enough time for the staff to complete

1026
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,720
their work assignments and have their

1027
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,240
products ready for the next upcoming

1028
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:20,560
meeting

1029
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:23,839
i've also started an ics-233 incident

1030
00:36:23,839 --> 00:36:25,599
open action tracker you see an example

1031
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:26,480
on the board

1032
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:28,320
i'm responsible for maintaining this

1033
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,720
actions tracker and typically utilize a

1034
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:32,880
documentation unit leader to assist me

1035
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:35,119
in updating and or developing it i will

1036
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:37,119
ensure all command and general staff are

1037
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:39,119
prepared to discuss their assigned tasks

1038
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:40,960
or actions during the command and

1039
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,960
general staff and planning meetings when

1040
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:45,119
it's completed i'll duplicate the form

1041
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:46,640
and get copies to the command and

1042
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:48,400
general staff it's also going to be

1043
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,560
posted on the status board located at

1044
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,640
the incident command post

1045
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:55,119
so this is our initial ics for ics org

1046
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:56,720
chart i didn't activate several

1047
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:58,880
positions and we'll decide later if we

1048
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,800
actually need them as the incident uh

1049
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,000
progresses

1050
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,280
please be prepared to recommend

1051
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,640
positions you believe should uh should

1052
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,400
be added to this chart

1053
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,320
in the meantime the responsibility for

1054
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:10,320
unstaffed positions are going to fall to

1055
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,160
the section chief that those roll up to

1056
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:15,040
so ganda you're gonna have to represent

1057
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,400
all the positions in your operations

1058
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,720
section until we fill people uh to fill

1059
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:21,879
those positions

1060
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:23,920
these are the objectives that uh we set

1061
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,760
out to to drive our work right again

1062
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,599
it's critical that we have clear

1063
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:29,119
understanding of all these objectives so

1064
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:30,640
if you have questions please ask them

1065
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:31,920
right so number one is going to be the

1066
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,599
safety of our people uh in our

1067
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:34,720

00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:26,400
impact and ultimately resolve the

1188
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,520

of available and required resources

1196
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:43,280

could be dangerous and i have to come up

00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:01,920
planning section chief the logistics

1235
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:03,200

additional safety resources needed

1244

the resource unit leader if staffed

1245
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:21,680
represents a planning section at the

1246
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:23,760
tactics meeting if there is no resource

1247
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:25,200
unit leader the planning section chief

1248
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:26,560
joins the meeting to fill the resource

1249
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:28,480
unit leader role the meeting is

1250
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:30,480
deliberately kept small to ensure it is

1251
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:32,160
an effective tactics meeting because it

1252
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:33,839
helps prevent major revisions from

1253
00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:35,920
occurring later in the process

1254
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:38,160
a common understanding agreement and

1255
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:39,680
situational awareness can avoid

1256
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:41,520
disagreement during the later phases of

1257
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:43,599
the planning cycle this is very

1258
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:44,960
important

1259
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:46,480
the liaison officer and the public

1260
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:47,839
information officer may attend if

1261
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:49,680
they've identified an issue that may

1262
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:51,440
possibly affect the strategies and

1263
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:53,920
tactics for example a government

1264
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:55,359
representative communicates to the

1265
00:43:55,359 --> 00:43:56,720
logistics officer that they will no

1266
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:58,319
longer participate in this incident

1267
00:43:58,319 --> 00:43:59,839
because they no longer see value in

1268
00:43:59,839 --> 00:44:02,160
participation but this organization was

1269
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:05,599
part of operations draft tactical plan

1270
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:07,040
other factors that might require the

1271
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:08,240
public information officer to

1272
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:09,599
participate might be that we become

1273
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:11,680
aware of community concerns media

1274
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:14,079
sensitivity or other issues that require

1275
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:16,240
public relations efforts

1276
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:18,079
the incident commander is never invited

1277
00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:19,520
to this meeting and may be performing

1278
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:21,280
other work with the crisis management

1279
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:23,839

1281
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:27,839
take a minute to review the plan if you

1282
00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:30,000
can

1283
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:32,480
by the end of this meeting i will ask

1284

00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:44,720
additional approval by him i've informed

1344
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:48,160
the media person who inquired about our

1345

plan to have a press release shortly

1346
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:52,640
based on the current status of the

1347
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:54,160
incident i've identified the need for

1348
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:56,160
two additional teams also known as

1349
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:58,240
divisions one will be the hvac

1350

mitigation team where we have one person

1351
00:47:00,079 --> 00:47:01,680
on scene but need another person for the

1352
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:03,599
next operational period

1353
00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:04,960

1354
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:06,960
control system repair team there's

1355
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:08,880
currently one person working so two more

1356
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:10,400
are needed to provide relief for the

1357
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:12,640

00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:44,559
vision for handling the incident our

1465
00:50:44,559 --> 00:50:46,640
current situation is that the ics

1466
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:47,920
analysts and the cert are working

1467
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:49,839

i'll review the incident objectives so

1470
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:57,119
everyone's clear on what we're fighting

1471
00:50:57,119 --> 00:50:58,480
ensure the safety of the building

1472
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:00,640
occupants ensure the safety of response

1473
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:03,040
personnel maintain proper relationships

1474
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:05,040
with the press and media and provide any

1475
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:07,359
necessary updates that they request

1476
00:51:07,359 --> 00:51:08,880

1478
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:12,559
timely updates and proper addressing of

1479
00:51:12,559 --> 00:51:14,640
the stakeholders interests and finally

1480
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:15,920
determine incident mitigation

1481
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:19,920
eradication course of actions and status

1482
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:21,599
i confirm that those objectives are

1483
00:51:21,599 --> 00:51:24,079
still valid

1484
00:51:24,319 --> 00:51:26,559
so based on the ics-215 operational

1485
00:51:26,559 --> 00:51:28,000
planning worksheet we still actually

1486
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
need two additional divisions

1487
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,400
the division bravo will be the hvac

1488
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:34,480
mitigation and division

1489
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:36,720
charlie sorry the additional division

1490
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:38,559
the second additional division charlie

1491
00:51:38,559 --> 00:51:41,119
will be there for ics repair

1492
00:51:41,119 --> 00:51:42,640
and the division that we currently

1493
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:43,920
already have working on the malware is

1494
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:45,440
division alpha

1495
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:47,119
as a safety officer i reviewed the

1496
00:51:47,119 --> 00:51:49,200
hazards or risks and provided some

1497
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:52,559
mitigations on the ics-215 alpha form

1498
00:51:52,559 --> 00:51:54,319
we will require all staff to work in

1499
00:51:54,319 --> 00:51:56,559
pairs and have security staff visit

1500
00:51:56,559 --> 00:51:58,480
every 15 minutes we have brought a

1501
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:00,559
volunteer ems tractor location that is

1502
00:52:00,559 --> 00:52:02,880
on standby

1503
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:04,640
i prepared a budget for the upcoming

1504
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:06,160
operational period based on the

1505
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:09,680
submitted ics 213 resource requests and

1506
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:11,119
we are still well within our fiscal

1507
00:52:11,119 --> 00:52:12,400
constraints

1508

assignment sections as shown here

1607
00:55:36,079 --> 00:55:37,520
since we do not have a resource unit

1608
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:38,960
leader it falls on the planning section

1609

chief to prepare the assigned resources

1610

safety officer provides safety tips

1618
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,760
since we do not have a logistics section

1619
00:55:57,760 --> 00:55:59,599

1626
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:13,599

and to help plan the future operations

1779
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:35,520
needed to meet the incident objectives

1780
01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:37,040
resources begin their work assignments

1781
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:39,040
as outlined in the incident action plan

1782
01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:40,640
strike team and task force leaders or

1783
01:01:40,640 --> 01:01:42,319
single resource bosses give assignments

1784
01:01:42,319 --> 01:01:44,400
to the people working for them progress

1785
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:46,400
and recommended changes in actions or

1786
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:48,960
resources such as kind type and quantity

1787
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:50,240
are passed on to the next level of

1788
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:52,400
supervision these recommendations are

1789
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:53,920
then incorporated into the planning

1790
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:56,400
process for the next operational period

1791
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:58,079
so i want to assess how we're doing

1792
01:01:58,079 --> 01:01:59,680
during the last operational cycle so i

1793
01:01:59,680 --> 01:02:00,960
can make changes to improve our

1794
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:02,319
performance i'm going to meet with

1795
01:02:02,319 --> 01:02:04,000
various people asking these kind of key

1796
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,480
questions what's working or not working

1797
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:08,000
i'm going to ask the operations section

1798
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:09,599
chief to interview division and group

1799
01:02:09,599 --> 01:02:11,440
supervisors and get their feedback and

1800
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:13,119
i'm going to also ask the general staff

1801
01:02:13,119 --> 01:02:14,640
to meet with their staff to assess their

1802
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:15,920
operations

1803
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:17,520
with the feedback from the command and

1804
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:18,880
general staff i'm going to determine if

1805
01:02:18,880 --> 01:02:20,079
there's need to update or change our

1806
01:02:20,079 --> 01:02:22,079
incident objectives or strategies or

1807
01:02:22,079 --> 01:02:24,960
team compositions

1808
01:02:25,599 --> 01:02:27,599
so the incident hasn't been fixed so

1809
01:02:27,599 --> 01:02:28,880
we're going to start the planning p

1810
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:31,599
again yay all right

1811
01:02:31,599 --> 01:02:33,440
the assessment started previously it was

1812
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:34,720
carried over

1813
01:02:34,720 --> 01:02:36,160
and if there's any changes that we need

1814
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:37,359
to make we're going to have another

1815
01:02:37,359 --> 01:02:38,720
command and general staff meeting

1816

1817
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:42,319

annual profits

1843
01:03:42,319 --> 01:03:45,039
the email threatens additional loud and

1844
01:03:45,039 --> 01:03:47,760
disruptive events if the ransom is not

1845
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:50,000
paid

1846
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:53,520
on day 11 at 3 15 pm the sprinkler

system in the building lobby is

1848
01:03:55,119 --> 01:03:57,520
activated facility staff determined

1849
01:03:57,520 --> 01:04:00,720
significant damage water damage occurred

1850
01:04:00,720 --> 01:04:03,280
on day 11 at 5 pm

1851
01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:05,680
a local a local tv news reporter

1852
01:04:05,680 --> 01:04:07,599
contacts senior staff

1853
01:04:07,599 --> 01:04:10,079
they state they are investigating a rash

1854
01:04:10,079 --> 01:04:12,480
of these type of events in the community

1855
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:14,319
and say that the fire departments are

1856
01:04:14,319 --> 01:04:16,480
being heavily taxed

1857
01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:18,720
the reports say staff have already

1858
01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:21,759
confirmed the incident

1859
01:04:22,720 --> 01:04:25,440
and the exercise continues

1860
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:26,640
this is the start of the second

1861
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:28,640
operational period in a real incident

1862
01:04:28,640 --> 01:04:30,079
the responders working in the first

1863
01:04:30,079 --> 01:04:32,000
operational period of the ics for ics

1864
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:33,520
team have briefed their replacements

1865
01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:36,000
before leaving their post the first task

1866
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:37,200
is to review the priorities and

1867
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:38,799
objectives to determine if any updates

1868
01:04:38,799 --> 01:04:41,200
are needed some content will be repeated

1869
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:42,720
because a new group of responders has

1870
01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:44,319
just arrived to take over managing the

1871
01:04:44,319 --> 01:04:48,000
ics for ics activities for this exercise

1872
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:49,520
the players from the first operational

1873
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:51,280
period will continue to play their roles

1874
01:04:51,280 --> 01:04:55,400
for the second operational period

1875
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,079
i facilitate this meeting also known as

1876
01:04:58,079 --> 01:04:59,680
the strategy meeting and typically

1877
01:04:59,680 --> 01:05:01,599
present any proposed changes as draft

1878
01:05:01,599 --> 01:05:03,039
objectives for the incident commander's

1879
01:05:03,039 --> 01:05:05,039
consideration i didn't propose any

1880
01:05:05,039 --> 01:05:06,559
changes or additions to the initial

1881
01:05:06,559 --> 01:05:08,400
priorities and objectives the incident

1882
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:10,559
commander is going to identify any

1883
01:05:10,559 --> 01:05:13,119
uh and or review response priorities

1884
01:05:13,119 --> 01:05:14,799
constraints and other incident

1885
01:05:14,799 --> 01:05:16,240
objectives

1886
01:05:16,240 --> 01:05:17,839
so as incident commander once again it's

1887
01:05:17,839 --> 01:05:19,520
my job to ensure that the objectives the

1888
01:05:19,520 --> 01:05:21,440
drive-ins and response operations are

1889
01:05:21,440 --> 01:05:23,680
clear to everyone in the ics for ics

1890
01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:25,839
organization and they know what needs to

1891
01:05:25,839 --> 01:05:27,599
be accomplished i agree with mr gay

1892
01:05:27,599 --> 01:05:28,880
who's playing the incident planning

1893
01:05:28,880 --> 01:05:30,720
second chief version two that the

1894
01:05:30,720 --> 01:05:32,000
priorities for the incident haven't

1895
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,160
changed and the the emphasis is going to

1896
01:05:34,160 --> 01:05:36,079
be life safety incident stabilization

1897
01:05:36,079 --> 01:05:37,599
and property and environmental

1898
01:05:37,599 --> 01:05:41,119
preservation just like last time

1899
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:42,799
the current plan objectives for the

1900
01:05:42,799 --> 01:05:45,200
incident are noted in an ics 202

1901
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:46,799
incident briefing form from the first

1902
01:05:46,799 --> 01:05:48,400
operational period and they have not

1903
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:50,000
changed right the discovery of

1904
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:51,839
ransomware uh kind of falls under that

1905
01:05:51,839 --> 01:05:53,760
last objective that that's on the on the

1906
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:55,920
list right so we're gonna review these

1907
01:05:55,920 --> 01:05:57,200
objectives at the command and general

1908
01:05:57,200 --> 01:05:58,640
staff meeting and i'll update the

1909
01:05:58,640 --> 01:06:00,799
objectives as needed based on these

1910
01:06:00,799 --> 01:06:02,480
changes but we're gonna move forward

1911
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:04,480
with what we have so far on the thing

1912
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:07,760
for the last operational period

1913
01:06:08,079 --> 01:06:09,680
this is the command and general staff

1914
01:06:09,680 --> 01:06:12,079
meeting for operational period two some

1915
01:06:12,079 --> 01:06:14,160
reminders this may be the only time the

1916
01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:15,680
command and general staff are in the

1917
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:17,839
same room during this operational period

1918
01:06:17,839 --> 01:06:19,680
the goal is for everyone on the team to

1919
01:06:19,680 --> 01:06:21,920
work together and be on the same page

1920
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:23,920
there must be no unanswered questions or

1921
01:06:23,920 --> 01:06:26,160
ambiguity after this meeting

1922
01:06:26,160 --> 01:06:28,720
i'll start an ics 233 incident open

1923

entire team when they're completed

1954
01:07:38,559 --> 01:07:39,920
the meeting schedule from the first

1955
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:41,920
operational period works and does not

1956
01:07:41,920 --> 01:07:43,599
need to be changed it's prominently

1957
01:07:43,599 --> 01:07:45,520
posted around the incident command post

1958
01:07:45,520 --> 01:07:47,200
so make sure you familiarize yourself

1959
01:07:47,200 --> 01:07:49,039
with it

1960
01:07:49,039 --> 01:07:51,839
i'm updating the ics-233 incident open

1961
01:07:51,839 --> 01:07:53,200
action tracker from the first

1962
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:56,759
operational period

1963
01:07:56,960 --> 01:07:59,280
so in a real incident the ics for ics

1964
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:00,880
orchard would be updated with the names

1965
01:08:00,880 --> 01:08:02,240
of the people who just came in to

1966
01:08:02,240 --> 01:08:03,680
relieve the people from the first

1967
01:08:03,680 --> 01:08:05,520
incident operational period right so

1968
01:08:05,520 --> 01:08:06,640
we're not doing that for the purpose

1969
01:08:06,640 --> 01:08:07,680
that we don't want to switch everybody

1970
01:08:07,680 --> 01:08:09,680
out we should have gotten mustaches or

1971
01:08:09,680 --> 01:08:11,280
something i don't know

1972
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:13,200
um

1973
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:15,359
but for the purposes of this exercise

1974
01:08:15,359 --> 01:08:17,198
these same physical humans are going to

1975
01:08:17,198 --> 01:08:18,880
be playing these roles again just

1976
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:21,520
version two of

1977
01:08:22,839 --> 01:08:24,799
themselves team has been working

1978
01:08:24,799 --> 01:08:27,198
extremely hard last hours uh with the

1979
01:08:27,198 --> 01:08:28,719
vendor attempting to find alternatives

1980
01:08:28,719 --> 01:08:30,479
to contain the malware but unfortunately

1981
01:08:30,479 --> 01:08:33,679
not identified any viable alternatives

1982
01:08:33,679 --> 01:08:34,960
so we just received an email that

1983
01:08:34,960 --> 01:08:36,960
demands ransomware payment

1984
01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:39,520
in bitcoin totaling 10 of company annual

1985
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:41,439
profits by close of business

1986
01:08:41,439 --> 01:08:42,880
the email threatens that failure to

1987
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:45,679
comply will result in a loud and very

1988
01:08:45,679 --> 01:08:48,799
disruptive continuation of the day

1989
01:08:48,799 --> 01:08:50,799
finance admin section chief mike i'm

1990
01:08:50,799 --> 01:08:53,279
submitting an ics-213 resource request

1991
01:08:53,279 --> 01:08:54,880
to add a malware expert to our team

1992
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:57,120
based on on the recent malware payment

1993
01:08:57,120 --> 01:08:59,198
requests this external person will

1994
01:08:59,198 --> 01:09:01,600
require a fifty thousand dollar retainer

1995
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:03,520
do you think we can cover this

1996
01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:05,679
uh mr lambert we can afford the retainer

1997
01:09:05,679 --> 01:09:07,520
but may only be able to keep this

1998
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:10,158
resource for five days given our current

1999
01:09:10,158 --> 01:09:13,040
budget when you submit your ics-213

2000
01:09:13,040 --> 01:09:14,960
resource request please estimate the

2001
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:17,359
number of operational periods you'll

2002
01:09:17,359 --> 01:09:20,000
need the resource so i can review this

2003

2334
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:03,719
the malware expert was added to the

2335
01:21:03,719 --> 01:21:07,840
ics-203 organization assignment list

2336
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:09,880
the malware expert was added to the

2337
01:21:09,880 --> 01:21:14,320
ics-204 assignment list

2338
01:21:14,320 --> 01:21:16,000
contact information for the malware

2339
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,800
expert was added to the ics-205 alpha

2340
01:21:18,800 --> 01:21:21,920
communications list

2341
01:21:22,239 --> 01:21:24,400
the malware expert was added to the ics

2342
01:21:24,400 --> 01:21:26,719
for ics organizational chart under the

2343
01:21:26,719 --> 01:21:29,840
operations section

2344
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:31,440
and we're back to the operational period

2345
01:21:31,440 --> 01:21:32,560
briefing where the planning section

2346
01:21:32,560 --> 01:21:34,560
chief presents the incident action plan

2347
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:36,800
to the team and the responders the

2348
01:21:36,800 --> 01:21:38,320
operational period briefing communicates

2349
01:21:38,320 --> 01:21:39,840
the decisions planning and preparation

2350
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:41,520
to the tactical supervisors the briefing

2351
01:21:41,520 --> 01:21:43,120
must be complete and efficient so the

2352
01:21:43,120 --> 01:21:44,560
responders feel they are executing a

2353
01:21:44,560 --> 01:21:47,600
logical safe and well thought out plan

2354
01:21:47,600 --> 01:21:48,880
at the conclusion of the operational

2355
01:21:48,880 --> 01:21:50,320
period briefing and the breakout

2356
01:21:50,320 --> 01:21:51,840
sessions resources travel to their

2357
01:21:51,840 --> 01:21:53,760
assigned work locations an important

2358
01:21:53,760 --> 01:21:55,040
step once they arrive at their work

2359
01:21:55,040 --> 01:21:56,480
location is for each to meet face to

2360
01:21:56,480 --> 01:21:58,000
face with the individual being relieved

2361
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
to receive a clear current and detailed

2362
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:01,360
briefing of all conditions at their

2363
01:22:01,360 --> 01:22:03,280
assigned work location command and

2364
01:22:03,280 --> 01:22:04,639
general staff members check in with

2365
01:22:04,639 --> 01:22:06,960
their staff checking in on progress

2366
01:22:06,960 --> 01:22:08,400
addressing issues and concerns with an

2367
01:22:08,400 --> 01:22:10,320
emphasis on solving those that arise and

2368
01:22:10,320 --> 01:22:11,600
they also prepare for their upcoming

2369
01:22:11,600 --> 01:22:14,000
meetings

2370
01:22:14,320 --> 01:22:16,480
so once again in this part of the cycle

2371
01:22:16,480 --> 01:22:17,920
i want to assess how we're doing

2372
01:22:17,920 --> 01:22:19,520
compared to the last operational cycle

2373
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:20,719
so we can make changes improve

2374
01:22:20,719 --> 01:22:22,480
performance and try and close out the

2375
01:22:22,480 --> 01:22:23,440
incident

2376
01:22:23,440 --> 01:22:24,800
i'm going to meet with a variety of

2377
01:22:24,800 --> 01:22:26,560
different people i'm going to talk to

2378
01:22:26,560 --> 01:22:28,239
them ask them again what's working

2379
01:22:28,239 --> 01:22:30,239
what's not working i'm going to talk a

2380
01:22:30,239 --> 01:22:31,840
lot with the operations section chief

2381
01:22:31,840 --> 01:22:33,679
and ask them to interview their

2382
01:22:33,679 --> 01:22:35,360
divisions and group leaders make sure

2383
01:22:35,360 --> 01:22:37,040
that they're getting that feedback and

2384
01:22:37,040 --> 01:22:38,400
then ultimately talk to the general

2385
01:22:38,400 --> 01:22:39,840
staff to see if there's anything that

2386
01:22:39,840 --> 01:22:41,600
they any comments they have to the

2387
01:22:41,600 --> 01:22:42,800
situation

2388
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:44,480
so when we grab all that feedback

2389
01:22:44,480 --> 01:22:46,080
together determine if we need to update

2390
01:22:46,080 --> 01:22:47,920
the objectives like we did last cycle

2391
01:22:47,920 --> 01:22:50,800
strategies or uh add new resources team

2392
01:22:50,800 --> 01:22:54,480
compositions as we did in the last cycle

2393
01:22:55,040 --> 01:22:57,040
so once again the incident has not been

2394
01:22:57,040 --> 01:22:58,480
resolved so we start the planning cycle

2395
01:22:58,480 --> 01:22:59,760
again

2396
01:22:59,760 --> 01:23:02,239
the you know the assessment that we had

2397
01:23:02,239 --> 01:23:04,639
last time is carried over uh if there's

2398
01:23:04,639 --> 01:23:06,800
any changes in that from the the

2399
01:23:06,800 --> 01:23:08,800
feedback we get from from the staff we

2400
01:23:08,800 --> 01:23:10,560
can discuss those changes as a team and

2401
01:23:10,560 --> 01:23:12,639
then prepare to go into the the tactics

2402
01:23:12,639 --> 01:23:14,960
meeting

2403
01:23:15,120 --> 01:23:16,400
so the incident commander meets with the

2404
01:23:16,400 --> 01:23:18,000
crisis management team periodically to

2405
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
provide incident status updates and may

2406
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:21,360
ask the operations and finance

2407
01:23:21,360 --> 01:23:22,719
administration's section chiefs to

2408
01:23:22,719 --> 01:23:24,400
present the status and updates in their

2409
01:23:24,400 --> 01:23:26,159
sections

2410
01:23:26,159 --> 01:23:27,600
the incident commander may request the

2411
01:23:27,600 --> 01:23:29,040
operations section chief to present a

2412
01:23:29,040 --> 01:23:30,639
current status on containment and

2413
01:23:30,639 --> 01:23:32,960
restoration efforts

2414
01:23:32,960 --> 01:23:34,880
the finance administration section chief

2415
01:23:34,880 --> 01:23:36,320
may be asked to provide a financial

2416
01:23:36,320 --> 01:23:38,480
status or update on response finances

2417
01:23:38,480 --> 01:23:40,159
and budget

2418
01:23:40,159 --> 01:23:42,080
and after the presentations by the

2419
01:23:42,080 --> 01:23:43,679
operations and finance administration

2420
01:23:43,679 --> 01:23:45,040
section chiefs the incident commander

2421
01:23:45,040 --> 01:23:46,880
mentions the new legislation that may

2422
01:23:46,880 --> 01:23:48,239
have ramifications on the current

2423
01:23:48,239 --> 01:23:50,400
situation and seeks confirmation from

2424
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:51,920
the crisis management team about the

2425
01:23:51,920 --> 01:23:54,000
current plan and or additional direction

2426
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,960
from the cmt

2427
01:23:56,960 --> 01:23:58,880
this exercise has provided you a glimpse

2428
01:23:58,880 --> 01:24:00,719
into how a cyber response might be when

2429
01:24:00,719 --> 01:24:02,719
utilizing the incident command system

2430
01:24:02,719 --> 01:24:04,400
we've tried to condense about 18 hours

2431
01:24:04,400 --> 01:24:06,560
or more into the preceding 90 minutes

2432
01:24:06,560 --> 01:24:08,159
by doing so there are lots of little

2433
01:24:08,159 --> 01:24:10,239
things we've left out you've likely

2434
01:24:10,239 --> 01:24:11,679
noticed some redundancy and that was

2435
01:24:11,679 --> 01:24:13,199
intentional the planning cycle or

2436
01:24:13,199 --> 01:24:15,360
planning p is completed once for every

2437
01:24:15,360 --> 01:24:17,199
operational period so it's rinse and

2438
01:24:17,199 --> 01:24:19,280
repeat

2439
01:24:19,280 --> 01:24:20,880
implementing the incident command system

2440
01:24:20,880 --> 01:24:23,440
into a response requires practice don't

2441
01:24:23,440 --> 01:24:25,280
wait for the proverbial cyber hurricane

2442
01:24:25,280 --> 01:24:26,880
to hit before you try using the incident

2443
01:24:26,880 --> 01:24:29,520
command system for the first time

2444
01:24:29,520 --> 01:24:31,679
use it for the annual company picnic for

2445
01:24:31,679 --> 01:24:33,920
mary's retirement party and for a

2446
01:24:33,920 --> 01:24:35,920
tabletop exercise of a hypothetical

2447
01:24:35,920 --> 01:24:37,360
cyber incident

2448
01:24:37,360 --> 01:24:39,440
in real life an incident management team

2449
01:24:39,440 --> 01:24:41,120
who has spent some time training and

2450
01:24:41,120 --> 01:24:43,600
practicing will run an incident smoothly

2451
01:24:43,600 --> 01:24:45,199
just like clockwork

2452
01:24:45,199 --> 01:24:46,639
their meetings will be smooth and they

2453
01:24:46,639 --> 01:24:50,159
won't take as long as we have here

2454
01:24:50,159 --> 01:24:52,080
there are free fema courses online if

2455
01:24:52,080 --> 01:24:55,360
you do a search fema emi for emergency

2456
01:24:55,360 --> 01:24:57,199
management institute you'll see a list

2457
01:24:57,199 --> 01:24:58,719
of them there

2458
01:24:58,719 --> 01:25:02,880
the primary ones ics 100 200 700 800 are

2459
01:25:02,880 --> 01:25:04,719
all free they're all computer-based

2460
01:25:04,719 --> 01:25:07,280
self-paced a couple of other there are

2461
01:25:07,280 --> 01:25:09,199
other ones that are available that you

2462
01:25:09,199 --> 01:25:11,199
can access your city your county or your

2463
01:25:11,199 --> 01:25:13,840
state emergency management

2464
01:25:13,840 --> 01:25:14,800
group

2465
01:25:14,800 --> 01:25:16,400
and they will help you find classes and

2466
01:25:16,400 --> 01:25:18,159
partners

2467
01:25:18,159 --> 01:25:19,600
the first few times you implement the

2468
01:25:19,600 --> 01:25:20,960
incident command system things will be

2469
01:25:20,960 --> 01:25:25,120
bumpy which is why practice is essential

2470
01:25:25,360 --> 01:25:26,880
again contact your local emergency

2471
01:25:26,880 --> 01:25:28,480
management folks and ask to be invited

2472
01:25:28,480 --> 01:25:30,000
to an exercise

2473
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:31,840
or an event that an incident management

2474
01:25:31,840 --> 01:25:33,920
team is running usually the liaison

2475
01:25:33,920 --> 01:25:35,840
officer or pio will be your guide in and

2476
01:25:35,840 --> 01:25:37,679
around the incident command post take

2477
01:25:37,679 --> 01:25:39,360
note of the collaboration and teamwork

2478
01:25:39,360 --> 01:25:41,040
check out the forms and documents posted

2479
01:25:41,040 --> 01:25:42,159
on the walls

2480
01:25:42,159 --> 01:25:44,000
ask to be invited to meetings to see how

2481
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:45,920
they are run afterwards take what you've

2482
01:25:45,920 --> 01:25:47,679
learned and implement those into an

2483
01:25:47,679 --> 01:25:49,920
exercise with your team after the first

2484
01:25:49,920 --> 01:25:52,239
practice exerciser 2 you and your team

2485
01:25:52,239 --> 01:25:53,920
will see marked improvement and pretty

2486
01:25:53,920 --> 01:25:55,600
soon things will run like a well-oiled

2487
01:25:55,600 --> 01:25:57,920
machine

2488
01:25:58,080 --> 01:26:00,639
thank you all so much so at this point

2489

thank you and here here's the mic oh

2498
01:26:22,239 --> 01:26:24,638
i've got one

2499
01:26:25,280 --> 01:26:27,280
list the top three organizational

2500
01:26:27,280 --> 01:26:29,759
strengths

2501
01:26:31,360 --> 01:26:32,800
so this these are the

2502
01:26:32,800 --> 01:26:34,880
this is what we're asking you from

2503
01:26:34,880 --> 01:26:37,840
uh asking

2504
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,239
yes

2505
01:26:40,880 --> 01:26:42,560
can we go back

2506
01:26:42,560 --> 01:26:44,639
while they're working on that uh in real

2507
01:26:44,639 --> 01:26:46,560
life if you do get a chance please go

2508
01:26:46,560 --> 01:26:48,000
out contact your local emergency

2509
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,480
management fire department whoever and

2510
01:26:50,480 --> 01:26:52,800
asked to be invited to an incident uh as

2511
01:26:52,800 --> 01:26:54,159
part of a type three all hazards

2512
01:26:54,159 --> 01:26:55,600
incident management team we love to have

2513
01:26:55,600 --> 01:26:57,199
people come through we're always looking

2514
01:26:57,199 --> 01:26:59,520
for people to join our team it's very

2515
01:26:59,520 --> 01:27:01,920
enlightening it's very illuminating and

2516
01:27:01,920 --> 01:27:05,520
it helps us as well so please

2517
01:27:05,520 --> 01:27:07,040
um

2518
01:27:07,040 --> 01:27:08,560
okay so we'll start with this exercise

2519
01:27:08,560 --> 01:27:10,320
versus real world again we condensed at

2520
01:27:10,320 --> 01:27:12,080
least 18 hours we we said two

2521
01:27:12,080 --> 01:27:13,760
operational periods which 12 hours each

2522
01:27:13,760 --> 01:27:15,920
24 hours and we

2523
01:27:15,920 --> 01:27:18,239
butchered them into 90 minutes

2524
01:27:18,239 --> 01:27:20,400
we didn't scratch the surface

2525
01:27:20,400 --> 01:27:22,480
and it requires practice again don't

2526
01:27:22,480 --> 01:27:23,679
wait for that fire don't wait for that

2527
01:27:23,679 --> 01:27:25,280
cyber storm don't wait for the hurricane

2528
01:27:25,280 --> 01:27:27,920
the floods practice it now

2529
01:27:27,920 --> 01:27:29,280
when i learned it i learned it on the

2530
01:27:29,280 --> 01:27:30,719
tailgate of a pickup truck because we

2531
01:27:30,719 --> 01:27:32,159
filled out forms at two o'clock in the

2532
01:27:32,159 --> 01:27:34,560
morning after a rollover and we filled

2533
01:27:34,560 --> 01:27:38,560
out the entire ics-201 form and so it

2534
01:27:38,560 --> 01:27:40,480
does require practice

2535
01:27:40,480 --> 01:27:42,159
and it's easily done through tabletop it

2536
01:27:42,159 --> 01:27:43,440
doesn't have to be a real incident it

2537
01:27:43,440 --> 01:27:45,360
can be an event that's the beauty behind

2538
01:27:45,360 --> 01:27:46,880
the incident command system

2539
01:27:46,880 --> 01:27:49,040
it's used in marathons it's used at bike

2540
01:27:49,040 --> 01:27:50,560
races

2541
01:27:50,560 --> 01:27:52,960
county fairs state fairs all sorts of

2542
01:27:52,960 --> 01:27:55,679
different events

2543
01:27:57,520 --> 01:27:58,880
resources to learn the incident command

2544
01:27:58,880 --> 01:28:01,840
system fema emi online again that's free

2545
01:28:01,840 --> 01:28:03,600
and contacting your city county and

2546
01:28:03,600 --> 01:28:06,880
state emergency management group

2547
01:28:08,719 --> 01:28:10,719
the first few incidents would be bumpy

2548
01:28:10,719 --> 01:28:12,960
it's not going to go as planned we have

2549
01:28:12,960 --> 01:28:15,120
planned pre-planned incidents and

2550
01:28:15,120 --> 01:28:16,800
not a single one has ever fallen into

2551
01:28:16,800 --> 01:28:18,400
the plan that we wrote but we were able

2552
01:28:18,400 --> 01:28:21,120
to get through it because we practiced

2553
01:28:21,120 --> 01:28:22,400
talked to emergency management about

2554
01:28:22,400 --> 01:28:25,120
assisting youth exercises again ask a

2555
01:28:25,120 --> 01:28:26,960
tour in imt in action check out the

2556
01:28:26,960 --> 01:28:29,040
team's collaboration note the documents

2557
01:28:29,040 --> 01:28:30,400
on the wall normally we would have the

2558
01:28:30,400 --> 01:28:31,760
documents that you saw on the screens

2559
01:28:31,760 --> 01:28:33,360
that we had presented earlier those

2560
01:28:33,360 --> 01:28:35,120
would be up on a wall

2561
01:28:35,120 --> 01:28:36,639
and everybody would be presenting right

2562
01:28:36,639 --> 01:28:38,560
off of those wall charts once they got

2563
01:28:38,560 --> 01:28:40,080
those down after the meeting then they

2564
01:28:40,080 --> 01:28:41,440
would condense those into the forms that

2565
01:28:41,440 --> 01:28:44,400
you've got in the iap there

2566
01:28:44,400 --> 01:28:47,839
and sit in on any meetings

2567
01:28:49,679 --> 01:28:52,560
okay back to this ics for ics hot wash

2568
01:28:52,560 --> 01:28:54,320
form lists the top three organizational

2569
01:28:54,320 --> 01:28:56,400
strengths

2570
01:28:56,400 --> 01:28:58,239
list the top three items requiring

2571
01:28:58,239 --> 01:29:00,080
improvement

2572
01:29:00,080 --> 01:29:02,639
and any hot wash remarks comments so

2573
01:29:02,639 --> 01:29:04,800
what i would suggest is the file got

2574
01:29:04,800 --> 01:29:07,920
corrupted coming out of apple to windows

2575
01:29:07,920 --> 01:29:10,880
and so there's only about five comments

2576
01:29:10,880 --> 01:29:13,600
qr code

2577
01:29:16,080 --> 01:29:17,760
there's about six comments and maybe

2578
01:29:17,760 --> 01:29:19,040
what we should do is just ask the

2579
01:29:19,040 --> 01:29:20,719
audience to provide those comments again

2580
01:29:20,719 --> 01:29:22,560
i type about 100 words a minute i'll

2581
01:29:22,560 --> 01:29:24,560
capture all the notes and i'll combine

2582
01:29:24,560 --> 01:29:26,159
the emails that were sent to me but

2583
01:29:26,159 --> 01:29:28,000
there's only five or six comments if you

2584
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:29,920
could ask the audience to do that i'll

2585
01:29:29,920 --> 01:29:33,520
capture okay great about that no

2586
01:29:33,520 --> 01:29:36,520
anybody

2587
01:29:40,400 --> 01:29:43,760
so y'all were pretty agreeable tonight

2588
01:29:43,760 --> 01:29:45,920
everybody supported your plan

2589
01:29:45,920 --> 01:29:48,159
that's not that's not real life

2590
01:29:48,159 --> 01:29:50,400
how does the incident uh command system

2591
01:29:50,400 --> 01:29:52,080
work when

2592
01:29:52,080 --> 01:29:53,920
when you can't have agreement on those

2593
01:29:53,920 --> 01:29:56,639
situations

2594
01:29:56,960 --> 01:29:59,040
i'll take that um

2595
01:29:59,040 --> 01:30:00,800
honestly in real life on an incident

2596
01:30:00,800 --> 01:30:03,040
management team nine times out of ten it

2597
01:30:03,040 --> 01:30:04,480
does go that way

2598
01:30:04,480 --> 01:30:06,960
it has to go that way if you have worked

2599
01:30:06,960 --> 01:30:09,199
with these folks before it will go that

2600
01:30:09,199 --> 01:30:11,440
way if i'm on an incident management

2601
01:30:11,440 --> 01:30:12,880
management team as a planning section

2602
01:30:12,880 --> 01:30:14,880
chief and i don't agree with something i

2603
01:30:14,880 --> 01:30:17,040
will sit down i will let operations know

2604
01:30:17,040 --> 01:30:18,880
that i will talk to everybody in there

2605
01:30:18,880 --> 01:30:20,560
if the rest of the team is on board then

2606
01:30:20,560 --> 01:30:22,560
guess what i'm on board they have

2607
01:30:22,560 --> 01:30:24,320
listened to my concerns they may have

2608
01:30:24,320 --> 01:30:25,760
addressed them they may not have i'm

2609
01:30:25,760 --> 01:30:27,360
part of a team that's how it really

2610
01:30:27,360 --> 01:30:28,480
works

2611
01:30:28,480 --> 01:30:29,679
do you have

2612
01:30:29,679 --> 01:30:31,840
weird things happen absolutely you do

2613
01:30:31,840 --> 01:30:34,560
but when you present a unified front to

2614
01:30:34,560 --> 01:30:36,960
the public it is just as we presented it

2615
01:30:36,960 --> 01:30:38,960
is agreeable a unified command is the

2616
01:30:38,960 --> 01:30:40,480
same way when you're talking you've got

2617
01:30:40,480 --> 01:30:43,520
epa you've got fema you've got company

2618
01:30:43,520 --> 01:30:45,840
representatives in there guess what as

2619
01:30:45,840 --> 01:30:48,000
unified command they may not all agree

2620
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:48,880
but they're going to come out as a

2621
01:30:48,880 --> 01:30:50,800
united front and it has to be run that

2622
01:30:50,800 --> 01:30:53,199
way so all those involved do that yes

2623
01:30:53,199 --> 01:30:56,080
i'll grab that too yeah i'll

2624
01:30:56,080 --> 01:30:58,080
i i will kind of talk about the other

2625
01:30:58,080 --> 01:30:59,760
side of the coin which is when you just

2626
01:30:59,760 --> 01:31:01,520
can't get to the alignment and the

2627
01:31:01,520 --> 01:31:03,760
consensus that you need alignment is

2628
01:31:03,760 --> 01:31:05,760
probably the most difficult job that any

2629
01:31:05,760 --> 01:31:07,199
of us do in our day-to-day jobs

2630
01:31:07,199 --> 01:31:09,120
alignment is hard okay

2631
01:31:09,120 --> 01:31:11,120
and when alignment cannot be achieved in

2632
01:31:11,120 --> 01:31:13,600
an efficient manner that's exactly why

2633
01:31:13,600 --> 01:31:15,199
you have this person right here the

2634
01:31:15,199 --> 01:31:17,040
incident commander because it is their

2635
01:31:17,040 --> 01:31:20,000
job to call balls and strikes on the

2636
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:22,159
hard problems and i i have worked in

2637
01:31:22,159 --> 01:31:24,960
emergency management and i have seen you

2638
01:31:24,960 --> 01:31:25,840
know

2639
01:31:25,840 --> 01:31:27,600
productive conflict i would call it

2640
01:31:27,600 --> 01:31:29,679
between ops or planning or logistics or

2641
01:31:29,679 --> 01:31:31,920
whatever right when things go sideways

2642
01:31:31,920 --> 01:31:34,159
and ultimately having that incident

2643
01:31:34,159 --> 01:31:36,480
commander where they're they've got to

2644
01:31:36,480 --> 01:31:37,920
make a decision and they will make a

2645
01:31:37,920 --> 01:31:38,880
decision

2646
01:31:38,880 --> 01:31:40,320
incident command system is not a

2647
01:31:40,320 --> 01:31:41,600
democracy

2648
01:31:41,600 --> 01:31:44,600
yet

2649
01:31:45,440 --> 01:31:47,440
uh positive conflict or whatever i want

2650
01:31:47,440 --> 01:31:49,120
to steal that it is it's positive

2651
01:31:49,120 --> 01:31:51,679
complex i'm going back to the video um

2652
01:31:51,679 --> 01:31:53,280
no but just to underscore that right if

2653
01:31:53,280 --> 01:31:54,800
you look at the process right there's

2654
01:31:54,800 --> 01:31:57,440
number of opportunities i have my uh so

2655
01:31:57,440 --> 01:31:59,360
the number of opportunities for that

2656
01:31:59,360 --> 01:32:01,040
conflict to get resolved before it has

2657
01:32:01,040 --> 01:32:03,760
to come to a decision but the incident

2658
01:32:03,760 --> 01:32:05,679
command system is pretty clear the

2659
01:32:05,679 --> 01:32:07,920
incident commander is in command and so

2660
01:32:07,920 --> 01:32:09,280
if it can't get resolved that's why you

2661
01:32:09,280 --> 01:32:11,040
have the adjudication right but there's

2662
01:32:11,040 --> 01:32:12,880
several kind of sub

2663
01:32:12,880 --> 01:32:14,159
activities the different like the

2664
01:32:14,159 --> 01:32:16,239
tactics meeting and the planning meeting

2665
01:32:16,239 --> 01:32:18,560
where that that can be used in order to

2666
01:32:18,560 --> 01:32:20,719
to resolve as much of that as possible

2667
01:32:20,719 --> 01:32:23,360
but conflict will happen that's okay

2668
01:32:23,360 --> 01:32:25,520
just one one more last thing if you

2669
01:32:25,520 --> 01:32:28,719
remember the diagram of planning p the

2670
01:32:28,719 --> 01:32:30,639
cycle

2671
01:32:30,639 --> 01:32:32,800
there are blue periods

2672
01:32:32,800 --> 01:32:34,800
those are the periods for conflict

2673
01:32:34,800 --> 01:32:36,800
resolution

2674
01:32:36,800 --> 01:32:39,040
so before you

2675
01:32:39,040 --> 01:32:41,440
present the finalized plan

2676
01:32:41,440 --> 01:32:43,760
all of those conflicts will be spoken

2677
01:32:43,760 --> 01:32:46,000
about they will be resolved one way or

2678
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:47,040
another

2679
01:32:47,040 --> 01:32:49,120
maybe you'll change the tactic maybe

2680
01:32:49,120 --> 01:32:51,199
you'll change the entire plan but you

2681
01:32:51,199 --> 01:32:54,960
will solve that conflict however it fits

2682
01:32:54,960 --> 01:32:57,760
uh incident commander's agenda of uh

2683
01:32:57,760 --> 01:33:00,239
solving the incident and only after that

2684
01:33:00,239 --> 01:33:02,400
conflict is solved and you are out of

2685
01:33:02,400 --> 01:33:04,000
this blue

2686
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:04,880
sorry

2687
01:33:04,880 --> 01:33:07,520
of this blue field you you're ready to

2688
01:33:07,520 --> 01:33:09,600
proceed to the next meeting so when it

2689
01:33:09,600 --> 01:33:12,080
comes to the meeting time

2690
01:33:12,080 --> 01:33:13,920
you are on the same page one way or

2691
01:33:13,920 --> 01:33:15,840
another no matter how you arrive to it

2692
01:33:15,840 --> 01:33:18,159
but when you are at the meeting time you

2693
01:33:18,159 --> 01:33:21,199
are already on the same page

2694
01:33:21,199 --> 01:33:23,839
anybody else

2695
01:33:29,280 --> 01:33:30,560
thank you

2696
01:33:30,560 --> 01:33:32,560
i noticed that your safety officer

2697
01:33:32,560 --> 01:33:34,639
seemed to conflate a couple of different

2698
01:33:34,639 --> 01:33:36,960
organizational roles there were times

2699
01:33:36,960 --> 01:33:38,880
when the safety officer was analyzing

2700
01:33:38,880 --> 01:33:41,440
safety concerns real hazards and there

2701
01:33:41,440 --> 01:33:43,199
were times that the safety officer was

2702
01:33:43,199 --> 01:33:46,320
doing physical security analysis

2703
01:33:46,320 --> 01:33:48,239
and i could imagine there would be times

2704
01:33:48,239 --> 01:33:49,760
when that person would also be looking

2705
01:33:49,760 --> 01:33:53,600
at environmental hazards nepa exposures

2706
01:33:53,600 --> 01:33:55,360
it wasn't clear in the documentation

2707
01:33:55,360 --> 01:33:58,080
that that conflation of responsibilities

2708
01:33:58,080 --> 01:34:00,400
was aligned in that one person is that

2709
01:34:00,400 --> 01:34:02,800
how this normally plays out or could the

2710
01:34:02,800 --> 01:34:05,360
forms be updated to reflect that

2711
01:34:05,360 --> 01:34:06,719
so

2712
01:34:06,719 --> 01:34:08,800
first of all anything can be updated to

2713
01:34:08,800 --> 01:34:10,880
reflect anything that's why ics is a

2714
01:34:10,880 --> 01:34:13,600
living organism it changes and it adapts

2715
01:34:13,600 --> 01:34:16,239
to however you needed to be adapted to

2716
01:34:16,239 --> 01:34:18,800
your organization and to your response

2717
01:34:18,800 --> 01:34:22,080
second artificiality of the exercise

2718
01:34:22,080 --> 01:34:25,120
here yes i was i was jumping

2719
01:34:25,120 --> 01:34:26,639
and bouncing around

2720
01:34:26,639 --> 01:34:28,960
in reality safety officer will not be

2721
01:34:28,960 --> 01:34:32,080
alone in reality one safety officer will

2722
01:34:32,080 --> 01:34:32,880
have

2723
01:34:32,880 --> 01:34:35,040
what is called assistant safety officers

2724
01:34:35,040 --> 01:34:37,440
and each one of those will be a subject

2725
01:34:37,440 --> 01:34:41,119
matter expert on one or another field

2726
01:34:41,119 --> 01:34:43,920
so like you he here today i jumped out

2727
01:34:43,920 --> 01:34:46,239
of the script and i mentioned i heard

2728
01:34:46,239 --> 01:34:48,480
loud bang i want uh

2729
01:34:48,480 --> 01:34:50,239
law enforcement to sweep well the only

2730
01:34:50,239 --> 01:34:51,920
reason i said it is because i'm prior

2731
01:34:51,920 --> 01:34:54,159
service law enforcement so i actually do

2732
01:34:54,159 --> 01:34:56,159
know what i would do in this situation

2733
01:34:56,159 --> 01:34:58,000
in any other situation safety officer's

2734
01:34:58,000 --> 01:34:59,600
job is to

2735
01:34:59,600 --> 01:35:01,600
take feedback from assistant safety

2736
01:35:01,600 --> 01:35:04,639
officers and from everybody else

2737
01:35:04,639 --> 01:35:06,560
and then come up with mitigative

2738
01:35:06,560 --> 01:35:08,960
techniques to whichever aspects of

2739
01:35:08,960 --> 01:35:12,159
danger or hazards have been identified

2740
01:35:12,159 --> 01:35:15,119
to me

2741
01:35:15,119 --> 01:35:16,880
you also notice too that the safety

2742
01:35:16,880 --> 01:35:18,400
officer is constantly working with

2743
01:35:18,400 --> 01:35:20,800
operations as well so you know the

2744
01:35:20,800 --> 01:35:22,080
question come up what if you have a

2745
01:35:22,080 --> 01:35:24,560
safety system malware right you've got a

2746
01:35:24,560 --> 01:35:26,639
trichonix yeah a crisis type type event

2747
01:35:26,639 --> 01:35:30,080
happening right as that's coming up from

2748
01:35:30,080 --> 01:35:31,679
operations the safety officer is going

2749
01:35:31,679 --> 01:35:33,440
to hear that early right and so they can

2750
01:35:33,440 --> 01:35:35,840
kind of bring that color to the

2751
01:35:35,840 --> 01:35:38,639
you know the cyber piece of the response

2752
01:35:38,639 --> 01:35:40,560
but yeah you know they're not going to

2753
01:35:40,560 --> 01:35:41,920
work as a single person right and

2754
01:35:41,920 --> 01:35:42,800
they're not going to have domain

2755
01:35:42,800 --> 01:35:44,480
expertise in all things and that's where

2756
01:35:44,480 --> 01:35:46,239
you know typing and qualification which

2757
01:35:46,239 --> 01:35:48,080
is something we did not get into at all

2758
01:35:48,080 --> 01:35:49,840
in this exercise but it's something

2759
01:35:49,840 --> 01:35:53,040
we've already worked on in a robust way

2760
01:35:53,040 --> 01:35:55,840
is really important because it says you

2761
01:35:55,840 --> 01:35:58,320
know you have this level of training

2762
01:35:58,320 --> 01:36:00,400
this level of experience and expertise

2763
01:36:00,400 --> 01:36:02,000
that means that you can be the safety

2764
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:03,760
officer for this kind of incident right

2765
01:36:03,760 --> 01:36:05,600
and have that have that knowledge to

2766
01:36:05,600 --> 01:36:07,280
cover down in those areas and so that's

2767
01:36:07,280 --> 01:36:08,560
something we didn't get into in an

2768
01:36:08,560 --> 01:36:10,880
exercise but is an important component

2769
01:36:10,880 --> 01:36:12,960
of the overall incent command system if

2770
01:36:12,960 --> 01:36:14,960
you guys would like to stay for another

2771
01:36:14,960 --> 01:36:17,600
25 to 72 hours

2772
01:36:17,600 --> 01:36:20,080
i would be more than happy to walk you

2773
01:36:20,080 --> 01:36:23,199
through a full planning p workshop and

2774
01:36:23,199 --> 01:36:25,360
i promise you you will probably not

2775
01:36:25,360 --> 01:36:27,520
enjoy it

2776
01:36:27,520 --> 01:36:29,600
i i'll just add like for any of the

2777
01:36:29,600 --> 01:36:32,719
rules i guess more facets can be brought

2778
01:36:32,719 --> 01:36:35,280
to the table and in 12 hours or 24 hours

2779
01:36:35,280 --> 01:36:36,880
i was thinking to myself like after

2780
01:36:36,880 --> 01:36:39,040
having triaged malware

2781
01:36:39,040 --> 01:36:39,760
and

2782
01:36:39,760 --> 01:36:41,920
looking at the hvac system how is it

2783
01:36:41,920 --> 01:36:43,760
connecting to the network and you know

2784
01:36:43,760 --> 01:36:46,400
is is it in and of itself a c2 system or

2785
01:36:46,400 --> 01:36:47,840
is it

2786
01:36:47,840 --> 01:36:49,760
moving laterally through the network

2787
01:36:49,760 --> 01:36:51,199
what's happening in terms of control of

2788
01:36:51,199 --> 01:36:52,960
the system and other systems potentially

2789
01:36:52,960 --> 01:36:54,480
so probably you would have involved

2790
01:36:54,480 --> 01:36:55,840
whoever is in charge of network

2791
01:36:55,840 --> 01:36:57,840
segmentation quite

2792
01:36:57,840 --> 01:37:01,520
quickly as well just as another example

2793
01:37:01,520 --> 01:37:04,639
i i mean obviously it left the building

2794
01:37:04,639 --> 01:37:07,040
and went to the community so i mean that

2795
01:37:07,040 --> 01:37:08,159
was

2796
01:37:08,159 --> 01:37:10,320
you know something that would

2797
01:37:10,320 --> 01:37:14,239
involve a lot of i.t support not just in

2798
01:37:14,239 --> 01:37:16,800
uh our building or our organization but

2799
01:37:16,800 --> 01:37:18,719
we'd have to collaborate with anybody

2800
01:37:18,719 --> 01:37:20,159
else that might have been affected

2801
01:37:20,159 --> 01:37:21,920
because maybe you know

2802
01:37:21,920 --> 01:37:23,760
that collaboration

2803
01:37:23,760 --> 01:37:26,239
can help us resolve the incident because

2804
01:37:26,239 --> 01:37:28,159
they might have discovered something and

2805
01:37:28,159 --> 01:37:29,360
so

2806
01:37:29,360 --> 01:37:31,360
you know that would also be happening

2807
01:37:31,360 --> 01:37:32,560
with uh

2808
01:37:32,560 --> 01:37:34,400
in the operations group and that's where

2809
01:37:34,400 --> 01:37:36,719
i was i was just i'm the window dressing

2810
01:37:36,719 --> 01:37:39,040
so just so you guys know that's my whole

2811
01:37:39,040 --> 01:37:42,320
roll up here but uh did great job yeah i

2812
01:37:42,320 --> 01:37:44,560
think neil has a response too and i'm

2813
01:37:44,560 --> 01:37:46,400
i'm interested in what other feedback

2814
01:37:46,400 --> 01:37:48,800
you all have too so

2815
01:37:48,800 --> 01:37:50,000
mark you can

2816
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:51,840
shuffle the mic around or i can get up

2817
01:37:51,840 --> 01:37:54,400
and do it too whatever's easiest

2818
01:37:54,400 --> 01:37:55,280
um

2819
01:37:55,280 --> 01:37:56,719
so one thing to keep in mind about this

2820
01:37:56,719 --> 01:37:59,040
whole system is the fire and ems and

2821
01:37:59,040 --> 01:38:00,800
other crews in the community or people

2822
01:38:00,800 --> 01:38:02,560
that are actually responding to a big

2823
01:38:02,560 --> 01:38:04,800
bang as he mentioned right they are

2824
01:38:04,800 --> 01:38:06,320
going to use this system that's what

2825
01:38:06,320 --> 01:38:08,480
they use so one of the primary reasons

2826
01:38:08,480 --> 01:38:09,760
that we're going through and showing you

2827
01:38:09,760 --> 01:38:11,199
all the components is that when you

2828
01:38:11,199 --> 01:38:13,040
interact with these components in fire

2829
01:38:13,040 --> 01:38:14,960
and ems you know maybe you have to go

2830
01:38:14,960 --> 01:38:17,119
pull um some forensics off a work

2831
01:38:17,119 --> 01:38:19,119
station in a could be a hot area or a

2832
01:38:19,119 --> 01:38:21,280
dangerous area right uh knowing all

2833
01:38:21,280 --> 01:38:22,320
these components and how they fit

2834
01:38:22,320 --> 01:38:25,199
together is pretty useful

2835
01:38:26,880 --> 01:38:30,280
anybody else

2836
01:38:35,119 --> 01:38:36,800
so the communications officer did a

2837
01:38:36,800 --> 01:38:38,400
wonderful job in getting the message out

2838
01:38:38,400 --> 01:38:40,239
to the media but i was kind of bummed

2839
01:38:40,239 --> 01:38:41,920
that i had to read about it in the media

2840
01:38:41,920 --> 01:38:43,679
first especially when the malware was

2841
01:38:43,679 --> 01:38:46,000
identified so is there was there

2842
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:47,760
something you left out about information

2843
01:38:47,760 --> 01:38:49,600
about reporting or information sharing

2844
01:38:49,600 --> 01:38:52,639
to either cesa the fbi or i know we

2845
01:38:52,639 --> 01:38:54,960
don't know what sector this company was

2846
01:38:54,960 --> 01:38:56,560
in but we're going to presume that it

2847
01:38:56,560 --> 01:39:00,320
has a maybe a sector isaac or isil if

2848
01:39:00,320 --> 01:39:02,080
they're not critical infrastructure so

2849
01:39:02,080 --> 01:39:03,920
was there something about

2850
01:39:03,920 --> 01:39:05,280
in the plan there that you left out

2851
01:39:05,280 --> 01:39:07,840
about reporting reporting this prior to

2852
01:39:07,840 --> 01:39:09,679
the to the ransomware and then those

2853
01:39:09,679 --> 01:39:11,440
reporting requirements

2854
01:39:11,440 --> 01:39:12,960
but just when he's like hey something's

2855
01:39:12,960 --> 01:39:15,760
going on we identified some malware

2856
01:39:15,760 --> 01:39:19,280
and uh reporting that to cisa

2857
01:39:21,600 --> 01:39:22,639
so i think some of that would have

2858
01:39:22,639 --> 01:39:24,080
probably happened in the kind of

2859
01:39:24,080 --> 01:39:26,000
pre-incident phase and to be honest with

2860
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:26,880
you

2861
01:39:26,880 --> 01:39:30,080
so uh when trying to scope the exercise

2862
01:39:30,080 --> 01:39:32,239
right we could have made this exercise

2863
01:39:32,239 --> 01:39:35,360
we did not get into a lot of places

2864
01:39:35,360 --> 01:39:37,360
because it was just going to run us down

2865
01:39:37,360 --> 01:39:39,040
rabbit holes that that really you know

2866
01:39:39,040 --> 01:39:41,440
we were trying to inform everyone of how

2867
01:39:41,440 --> 01:39:43,360
ics for ics would work and how the

2868
01:39:43,360 --> 01:39:45,280
instant command system works but there's

2869
01:39:45,280 --> 01:39:47,280
again a lot of details on a lot of other

2870
01:39:47,280 --> 01:39:49,440
things that that would that would happen

2871
01:39:49,440 --> 01:39:52,080
in real life that we just couldn't cover

2872
01:39:52,080 --> 01:39:54,560
in the time we had um especially when

2873
01:39:54,560 --> 01:39:56,719
not ever we had to spend some time

2874
01:39:56,719 --> 01:39:58,000
letting everyone know like what the

2875
01:39:58,000 --> 01:39:59,760
incident command system is broadly right

2876
01:39:59,760 --> 01:40:01,040
because uh you know

2877
01:40:01,040 --> 01:40:02,320
i won't ask you to show your hands

2878
01:40:02,320 --> 01:40:04,080
because i'm afraid to ask the question

2879
01:40:04,080 --> 01:40:05,600
but how many people actually knew what

2880
01:40:05,600 --> 01:40:07,280
the incident can system was at all

2881
01:40:07,280 --> 01:40:08,880
before they got to this did this thing

2882
01:40:08,880 --> 01:40:10,960
probably wasn't very high right and so

2883
01:40:10,960 --> 01:40:12,080
there was a lot of that that needed to

2884
01:40:12,080 --> 01:40:13,760
go on but yeah there's going to be legal

2885
01:40:13,760 --> 01:40:15,360
reporting requirements there's going to

2886
01:40:15,360 --> 01:40:16,800
be potentially public affairs things

2887
01:40:16,800 --> 01:40:19,520
there might be good reporting to do some

2888
01:40:19,520 --> 01:40:20,880
of that might happen before the incident

2889
01:40:20,880 --> 01:40:22,480
gets declared right at some point it

2890
01:40:22,480 --> 01:40:24,400
gets declared so there's a lot of kind

2891
01:40:24,400 --> 01:40:26,159
of fabric here that we kind of glossed

2892
01:40:26,159 --> 01:40:28,880
over as an exercise artifice but that's

2893
01:40:28,880 --> 01:40:30,560
where a lot of that i think would would

2894
01:40:30,560 --> 01:40:31,679
shake out

2895
01:40:31,679 --> 01:40:33,360
i absolutely agree with you by the way

2896
01:40:33,360 --> 01:40:34,800
though that those activities would

2897
01:40:34,800 --> 01:40:37,040
definitely be occurring yeah most likely

2898
01:40:37,040 --> 01:40:41,199
through the liaison officer capacity

2899
01:40:41,600 --> 01:40:44,639
that's a great observation

2900
01:40:51,440 --> 01:40:53,440
i had one more quick one um does any

2901
01:40:53,440 --> 01:40:55,679
tailoring guidance exist

2902
01:40:55,679 --> 01:40:58,800
for practicing ics in a very small

2903
01:40:58,800 --> 01:41:00,480
organization that may be responding to

2904
01:41:00,480 --> 01:41:02,159
an incident i'm thinking about the

2905
01:41:02,159 --> 01:41:05,280
co-ops or smaller utilities they would

2906
01:41:05,280 --> 01:41:06,880
probably love to have all of these

2907
01:41:06,880 --> 01:41:08,239
artifacts but they might need to

2908
01:41:08,239 --> 01:41:11,360
understand how to tailor it

2909
01:41:15,679 --> 01:41:17,040
thank you i didn't know if you were

2910
01:41:17,040 --> 01:41:19,520
taking that one as well so this was

2911
01:41:19,520 --> 01:41:21,679
built even though we went through

2912
01:41:21,679 --> 01:41:23,360
literally everything and we explained

2913
01:41:23,360 --> 01:41:25,119
the process of filling out you know 12

2914
01:41:25,119 --> 01:41:26,639
different forms today

2915
01:41:26,639 --> 01:41:27,440
um

2916
01:41:27,440 --> 01:41:31,040
this is for a type 1 incident

2917
01:41:31,040 --> 01:41:33,280
type three i'm sorry i always get those

2918
01:41:33,280 --> 01:41:35,760
i always split them so a type three is

2919
01:41:35,760 --> 01:41:37,360
the smallest type of incident which

2920
01:41:37,360 --> 01:41:39,920
normally involves one company a single

2921
01:41:39,920 --> 01:41:42,880
asset not multiple parties as you scale

2922
01:41:42,880 --> 01:41:45,360
up type two would be multiple companies

2923
01:41:45,360 --> 01:41:47,199
then your type one is like your biggest

2924
01:41:47,199 --> 01:41:48,560
and your baddest you've got every

2925
01:41:48,560 --> 01:41:50,159
government in the world involved and

2926
01:41:50,159 --> 01:41:52,880
it's it's a global response right

2927
01:41:52,880 --> 01:41:55,360
for type threes they are designed for a

2928
01:41:55,360 --> 01:41:58,000
single company so the material that

2929
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:00,560
the isa gca has been sponsoring and

2930
01:42:00,560 --> 01:42:02,960
working on and taking the templates it

2931
01:42:02,960 --> 01:42:05,840
is specifically designed for a smaller

2932
01:42:05,840 --> 01:42:08,159
utility or company so they can pick

2933
01:42:08,159 --> 01:42:09,840
which forms to use and which they're

2934
01:42:09,840 --> 01:42:11,520
just like we don't need to borrow

2935
01:42:11,520 --> 01:42:13,040
bother with this for this operational

2936
01:42:13,040 --> 01:42:16,320
period so it is designed for type three

2937
01:42:16,320 --> 01:42:19,679
but future exercises and future content

2938
01:42:19,679 --> 01:42:21,440
and and there are more forums right but

2939
01:42:21,440 --> 01:42:23,840
it's your choice it's it's like burger

2940
01:42:23,840 --> 01:42:25,360
is it burger king have it your way like

2941
01:42:25,360 --> 01:42:27,280
you can you can pick which form you want

2942
01:42:27,280 --> 01:42:29,840
to use so um don't let the forms scare

2943
01:42:29,840 --> 01:42:32,000
you they're they're a tool for you they

2944
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:34,239
should not be used um to slow you down

2945
01:42:34,239 --> 01:42:35,679
or to hinder you but once you get in the

2946
01:42:35,679 --> 01:42:37,840
rhythm of it these forms speed things up

2947
01:42:37,840 --> 01:42:40,320
and they're great artifacts during a

2948
01:42:40,320 --> 01:42:42,239
response one of the largest concerns i

2949
01:42:42,239 --> 01:42:43,520
have today is

2950
01:42:43,520 --> 01:42:44,320
it

2951
01:42:44,320 --> 01:42:46,960
many responses

2952
01:42:46,960 --> 01:42:49,119
i think in cyber tend to be kind of fast

2953
01:42:49,119 --> 01:42:51,119
and loose people are doing what they

2954
01:42:51,119 --> 01:42:53,600
need to do to get the job done but then

2955
01:42:53,600 --> 01:42:55,840
after the fact no one feels great about

2956
01:42:55,840 --> 01:42:58,159
the response they feel fatigued they

2957
01:42:58,159 --> 01:43:00,159
feel that things were left out and they

2958
01:43:00,159 --> 01:43:01,760
don't even have a way to go back and

2959
01:43:01,760 --> 01:43:03,600
look at the postmortem because hardly

2960
01:43:03,600 --> 01:43:06,239
anything was documented so what you do

2961
01:43:06,239 --> 01:43:07,920
want to document during an incident and

2962
01:43:07,920 --> 01:43:09,760
by the way your legal counsel will

2963
01:43:09,760 --> 01:43:11,760
counsel you on what should and should

2964
01:43:11,760 --> 01:43:14,320
not be documented in such a way

2965
01:43:14,320 --> 01:43:15,920
these forms help you they help you

2966
01:43:15,920 --> 01:43:17,600
figure out what happened who made the

2967
01:43:17,600 --> 01:43:19,520
decisions why the decision was made i

2968
01:43:19,520 --> 01:43:22,080
mean every the thing about

2969
01:43:22,080 --> 01:43:24,480
cybers that we're the only

2970
01:43:24,480 --> 01:43:27,760
nationally um understood or recognized

2971
01:43:27,760 --> 01:43:30,080
form of a disaster that does not follow

2972
01:43:30,080 --> 01:43:31,760
incident command system today we're the

2973
01:43:31,760 --> 01:43:34,320
only one everybody else does if you look

2974
01:43:34,320 --> 01:43:36,639
at natural and man-made disasters as the

2975
01:43:36,639 --> 01:43:38,719
federal government classifies them

2976
01:43:38,719 --> 01:43:40,880
we're the only space that hasn't adopted

2977
01:43:40,880 --> 01:43:43,600
it yet so um to ginger's question you

2978
01:43:43,600 --> 01:43:46,080
know hey can can i take this material

2979
01:43:46,080 --> 01:43:48,639
could a smaller company or a utility or

2980
01:43:48,639 --> 01:43:49,600
a

2981
01:43:49,600 --> 01:43:51,440
wastewater facility in a locality could

2982
01:43:51,440 --> 01:43:52,800
they use this yeah we've got the

2983
01:43:52,800 --> 01:43:54,800
material we want them to use it and and

2984
01:43:54,800 --> 01:43:57,360
it's free

2985
01:43:57,600 --> 01:43:59,360
yeah the other power of the the

2986
01:43:59,360 --> 01:44:00,639
structure and

2987
01:44:00,639 --> 01:44:02,800
yes it feels a little burdensome for

2988
01:44:02,800 --> 01:44:05,040
like a smaller but

2989
01:44:05,040 --> 01:44:06,480
there's a lot of value there and it

2990
01:44:06,480 --> 01:44:07,520
makes you think about things you

2991
01:44:07,520 --> 01:44:09,280
wouldn't otherwise consider right

2992
01:44:09,280 --> 01:44:11,920
the thing that drives me crazy is that

2993
01:44:11,920 --> 01:44:13,199
when people have incidents they don't

2994
01:44:13,199 --> 01:44:14,480
think about public affairs so like we're

2995
01:44:14,480 --> 01:44:17,360
gonna keep this quiet sure you are right

2996
01:44:17,360 --> 01:44:19,119
you know even if you manage to actually

2997
01:44:19,119 --> 01:44:21,600
do that it was not a bad it was not

2998
01:44:21,600 --> 01:44:23,920
wasted resources to come out with what

2999
01:44:23,920 --> 01:44:25,520
your holding statement would be at a

3000
01:44:25,520 --> 01:44:28,159
minimum for the incident right and so

3001
01:44:28,159 --> 01:44:29,760
with the structure it kind of makes you

3002
01:44:29,760 --> 01:44:31,119
think about you know if you're an

3003
01:44:31,119 --> 01:44:32,800
incident commander you gotta go okay

3004
01:44:32,800 --> 01:44:34,800
well what do i actually need to staff

3005
01:44:34,800 --> 01:44:36,560
right so like pio is one that always

3006
01:44:36,560 --> 01:44:38,560
gets staffed budget and finance right

3007
01:44:38,560 --> 01:44:40,320
people just kind of start spending money

3008
01:44:40,320 --> 01:44:41,440
they don't really they're not accounting

3009
01:44:41,440 --> 01:44:44,080
for time right this creates a structure

3010
01:44:44,080 --> 01:44:45,440
by which you can have good better

3011
01:44:45,440 --> 01:44:47,440
reporting and know actually what what

3012
01:44:47,440 --> 01:44:49,839
how it went

3013
01:44:49,920 --> 01:44:51,679
i think you had a question as well we

3014
01:44:51,679 --> 01:44:53,280
missed you then we can get to you in the

3015
01:44:53,280 --> 01:44:56,159
back if that's okay

3016
01:44:59,360 --> 01:45:01,360
thank you i also work in a lot of

3017
01:45:01,360 --> 01:45:03,119
incident responses that natural hazards

3018
01:45:03,119 --> 01:45:04,639
other side of things the delegation of

3019
01:45:04,639 --> 01:45:06,800
authority you said it but you went fast

3020
01:45:06,800 --> 01:45:08,320
and that is a critical part of this

3021
01:45:08,320 --> 01:45:09,920
could you speak to the delegation of

3022
01:45:09,920 --> 01:45:11,840
authority how you would see that going

3023
01:45:11,840 --> 01:45:14,800
yeah so uh hopefully uh

3024
01:45:14,800 --> 01:45:16,400
before the incident is part of your

3025
01:45:16,400 --> 01:45:18,000
planning right you're going to get as an

3026
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:19,920
incident commander or or you're going to

3027
01:45:19,920 --> 01:45:21,760
get

3028
01:45:21,760 --> 01:45:23,679
your organization is going to pre-set up

3029
01:45:23,679 --> 01:45:25,040
like where your authority is right what

3030
01:45:25,040 --> 01:45:26,560
your left and right boundaries are what

3031
01:45:26,560 --> 01:45:28,159
your financial resources are for

3032
01:45:28,159 --> 01:45:29,760
whatever level the incident is right

3033
01:45:29,760 --> 01:45:31,199
that's where you have you know the type

3034
01:45:31,199 --> 01:45:32,719
three is the smallest right then you go

3035
01:45:32,719 --> 01:45:35,360
two one but you know you're going to set

3036
01:45:35,360 --> 01:45:36,480
up different boundaries as an

3037
01:45:36,480 --> 01:45:38,960
organization for what decisions can be

3038
01:45:38,960 --> 01:45:40,800
made and at what level what gates you

3039
01:45:40,800 --> 01:45:43,040
need to pass to go up so

3040
01:45:43,040 --> 01:45:44,719
the inside commander role in this in

3041
01:45:44,719 --> 01:45:47,199
this exercise was is kind of

3042
01:45:47,199 --> 01:45:48,560
i approve

3043
01:45:48,560 --> 01:45:50,560
sounds good right but in reality the

3044
01:45:50,560 --> 01:45:52,719
inside commander's running off and

3045
01:45:52,719 --> 01:45:55,600
talking to leadership talking to legal

3046
01:45:55,600 --> 01:45:57,600
talking to finance like making sure that

3047
01:45:57,600 --> 01:45:59,520
everything's good to go is happening in

3048
01:45:59,520 --> 01:46:01,280
that interstitial time when people are

3049
01:46:01,280 --> 01:46:03,119
off doing real work right the ins and

3050
01:46:03,119 --> 01:46:05,440
commander is generally off kind of

3051
01:46:05,440 --> 01:46:07,119
working some of those challenges and

3052
01:46:07,119 --> 01:46:08,159
like

3053
01:46:08,159 --> 01:46:09,760
often working with like finance like hey

3054
01:46:09,760 --> 01:46:12,400
we're getting close to to our line

3055
01:46:12,400 --> 01:46:14,000
right now do we need to get that

3056
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:15,840
increased that's not usually an easy

3057
01:46:15,840 --> 01:46:17,440
thing like it was in the exercise but

3058
01:46:17,440 --> 01:46:19,040
again we didn't want to admire it in

3059
01:46:19,040 --> 01:46:22,719
details that weren't as fun so

3060
01:46:22,960 --> 01:46:24,560
great question though yes

3061
01:46:24,560 --> 01:46:26,719
i just um i worked with the co-ops for a

3062
01:46:26,719 --> 01:46:28,000
long time and

3063
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:29,760
to get to your question ginger we ended

3064
01:46:29,760 --> 01:46:31,920
up using a program called decide which

3065
01:46:31,920 --> 01:46:33,520
was created by newari

3066
01:46:33,520 --> 01:46:35,600
hsip um and

3067
01:46:35,600 --> 01:46:37,199
with the smaller utilities so if you

3068
01:46:37,199 --> 01:46:39,280
imagine a staff of 20

3069
01:46:39,280 --> 01:46:41,760
you've got multiple hats on each one and

3070
01:46:41,760 --> 01:46:43,600
so you can't take something that's that

3071
01:46:43,600 --> 01:46:46,000
structured and fill all the roles so i

3072
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:47,520
think you can take i'm really excited to

3073
01:46:47,520 --> 01:46:49,600
see this but i think if you want to work

3074
01:46:49,600 --> 01:46:51,600
with the smaller utilities with it you

3075
01:46:51,600 --> 01:46:53,199
really need to think about cutting it

3076
01:46:53,199 --> 01:46:55,600
into stepping stones and even taking it

3077
01:46:55,600 --> 01:46:58,000
a few steps back from this structure but

3078
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:00,639
the overall structure they'll get but

3079
01:47:00,639 --> 01:47:02,480
you can't implement it with that many

3080
01:47:02,480 --> 01:47:04,560
roles and that much complication because

3081
01:47:04,560 --> 01:47:06,159
they just don't have the staff resources

3082
01:47:06,159 --> 01:47:09,040
at that size but we really like decide

3083
01:47:09,040 --> 01:47:11,679
we the first time we ran it we had 36

3084
01:47:11,679 --> 01:47:13,360
utilities and i think the second time

3085
01:47:13,360 --> 01:47:16,239
there were more than a hundred

3086
01:47:16,400 --> 01:47:18,320
i mean you can run an incident with two

3087
01:47:18,320 --> 01:47:20,159
people you can run you can run an

3088
01:47:20,159 --> 01:47:21,920
incident with an incident commander and

3089
01:47:21,920 --> 01:47:23,679
then i'd say the second position which

3090
01:47:23,679 --> 01:47:25,440
is quite frankly

3091
01:47:25,440 --> 01:47:27,280
i've always loved being a planning

3092
01:47:27,280 --> 01:47:28,639
section chief

3093
01:47:28,639 --> 01:47:31,119
so in theory you could run an incident

3094
01:47:31,119 --> 01:47:33,440
with an ic and a planning section chief

3095
01:47:33,440 --> 01:47:37,040
so again the the org chart um

3096
01:47:37,040 --> 01:47:38,880
the way it was presented to you today

3097
01:47:38,880 --> 01:47:40,239
and this is like a little bit of

3098
01:47:40,239 --> 01:47:42,000
background from almost two years ago

3099
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:44,800
when we started this is mark bristow me

3100
01:47:44,800 --> 01:47:45,760
neil

3101
01:47:45,760 --> 01:47:48,080
i think chris systrunk was uh was in the

3102
01:47:48,080 --> 01:47:50,800
meeting too we said if we knew nothing

3103
01:47:50,800 --> 01:47:54,480
about an ics incident and someone said i

3104
01:47:54,480 --> 01:47:56,239
need you to send a fly away team

3105
01:47:56,239 --> 01:47:58,480
somewhere at a minimum

3106
01:47:58,480 --> 01:48:00,080
what would be the roles you would want

3107
01:48:00,080 --> 01:48:02,880
to have to go in there and so i really

3108
01:48:02,880 --> 01:48:05,280
we doubled down on the op section that's

3109
01:48:05,280 --> 01:48:06,719
where you see the specialty and the

3110
01:48:06,719 --> 01:48:08,880
incident command system to where if you

3111
01:48:08,880 --> 01:48:10,080
got to go in and figure out what

3112
01:48:10,080 --> 01:48:11,440
happened those were the roles that you

3113
01:48:11,440 --> 01:48:13,199
needed but to your point

3114
01:48:13,199 --> 01:48:14,960
most incidents if you're talking about

3115
01:48:14,960 --> 01:48:17,199
day-to-day activity or even

3116
01:48:17,199 --> 01:48:18,800
things coming in that you're reviewing

3117
01:48:18,800 --> 01:48:21,280
and you're trying to decide it it's very

3118
01:48:21,280 --> 01:48:23,360
small staff we're talking two three four

3119
01:48:23,360 --> 01:48:26,080
people but the the benefit of the

3120
01:48:26,080 --> 01:48:28,960
framework is not necessarily the roles i

3121
01:48:28,960 --> 01:48:31,119
don't want you to focus on the roles i

3122
01:48:31,119 --> 01:48:33,040
want you to focus on

3123
01:48:33,040 --> 01:48:36,320
the general framework and the concept of

3124
01:48:36,320 --> 01:48:39,199
unity of command separation of authority

3125
01:48:39,199 --> 01:48:41,119
everybody has one role and they're

3126
01:48:41,119 --> 01:48:43,679
allowed to play that role another large

3127
01:48:43,679 --> 01:48:46,320
problem i see today is that say a cyber

3128
01:48:46,320 --> 01:48:48,719
incident happens you're not recused from

3129
01:48:48,719 --> 01:48:51,119
your day job i've seen so many cyber

3130
01:48:51,119 --> 01:48:52,639
incidents where

3131
01:48:52,639 --> 01:48:54,480
it's out it's run out of a sock you've

3132
01:48:54,480 --> 01:48:57,040
got a sock director who

3133
01:48:57,040 --> 01:48:59,679
is commanding 20 people they're standing

3134
01:48:59,679 --> 01:49:01,760
up a call you've got one person running

3135
01:49:01,760 --> 01:49:04,000
the call taking notes on the call

3136
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:05,600
telling somebody to do something else i

3137
01:49:05,600 --> 01:49:06,320
mean

3138
01:49:06,320 --> 01:49:08,719
it is so stressful and it creates such

3139
01:49:08,719 --> 01:49:11,040
horrible response fatigue the way that

3140
01:49:11,040 --> 01:49:13,760
we did this and i saw people suffering

3141
01:49:13,760 --> 01:49:15,920
and not having a common framework to use

3142
01:49:15,920 --> 01:49:17,599
or common terminology and it's all

3143
01:49:17,599 --> 01:49:19,360
different by company to company today

3144
01:49:19,360 --> 01:49:20,880
even the utilities like everything's

3145
01:49:20,880 --> 01:49:21,920
different

3146
01:49:21,920 --> 01:49:22,800
so

3147
01:49:22,800 --> 01:49:24,800
this at least gives us a common language

3148
01:49:24,800 --> 01:49:26,400
and a common framework that can be

3149
01:49:26,400 --> 01:49:29,920
adapted is it perfect no of course not

3150
01:49:29,920 --> 01:49:31,679
it's not meant to be but first

3151
01:49:31,679 --> 01:49:34,080
responders use it every single day

3152
01:49:34,080 --> 01:49:35,679
so who am i

3153
01:49:35,679 --> 01:49:38,560
in my vanity to imagine that i can

3154
01:49:38,560 --> 01:49:41,679
create a special cyber response system

3155
01:49:41,679 --> 01:49:43,440
not using this

3156
01:49:43,440 --> 01:49:45,280
and so that was the entire premise is

3157
01:49:45,280 --> 01:49:46,800
that we don't want to create something

3158
01:49:46,800 --> 01:49:49,440
new we want to use what every single

3159
01:49:49,440 --> 01:49:51,199
other first responder in the world is

3160
01:49:51,199 --> 01:49:54,000
using and it's good enough for me so

3161
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:56,080
yeah and i think that goes back to two

3162
01:49:56,080 --> 01:49:57,920
two important pieces right so the first

3163
01:49:57,920 --> 01:49:59,679
thing was we declared an incident we

3164
01:49:59,679 --> 01:50:01,840
kind of glossed over that as well right

3165
01:50:01,840 --> 01:50:03,840
but most organizations will have a

3166
01:50:03,840 --> 01:50:05,119
threshold by which they would even

3167
01:50:05,119 --> 01:50:06,239
activate

3168
01:50:06,239 --> 01:50:07,199
this

3169
01:50:07,199 --> 01:50:08,239
right so

3170
01:50:08,239 --> 01:50:11,119
your day-to-day stuff may fall below the

3171
01:50:11,119 --> 01:50:13,440
threshold of activating and like

3172
01:50:13,440 --> 01:50:15,040
declaring a formal incident right and

3173
01:50:15,040 --> 01:50:16,639
then the second thing we did was

3174
01:50:16,639 --> 01:50:18,320
basically figure out what's going on and

3175
01:50:18,320 --> 01:50:19,840
then tailored the incident and tailored

3176
01:50:19,840 --> 01:50:22,000
the roles right so to megan's point it

3177
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:24,159
can be even if you've gone into a

3178
01:50:24,159 --> 01:50:25,920
declared incident as previously divined

3179
01:50:25,920 --> 01:50:27,440
by your organization

3180
01:50:27,440 --> 01:50:28,800
you now may

3181
01:50:28,800 --> 01:50:30,560
still only manage it with two people

3182
01:50:30,560 --> 01:50:32,080
because that's all you have or that's

3183
01:50:32,080 --> 01:50:33,599
all the resources that you can you can

3184
01:50:33,599 --> 01:50:35,280
apply or it's all it's needed for the

3185
01:50:35,280 --> 01:50:38,239
thing

3186
01:50:38,239 --> 01:50:39,280
okay

3187
01:50:39,280 --> 01:50:40,320
so

3188
01:50:40,320 --> 01:50:43,280
with that um i just have two two quick

3189
01:50:43,280 --> 01:50:44,880
slides we're landing on and it's just

3190
01:50:44,880 --> 01:50:46,480
really to kind of give you all an update

3191
01:50:46,480 --> 01:50:48,000
and tell you all where we're landing the

3192
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:50,080

and engage your support as well so we

globally based on the exercise performed

3196
01:50:58,159 --> 01:51:00,639

3197

you like this this was just an idea it

3234
01:52:23,440 --> 01:52:25,760
was a dream and all of us got together

3235
01:52:25,760 --> 01:52:27,440
and said we think that this could

3236
01:52:27,440 --> 01:52:30,320
actually work and now we have over 1500

3237
01:52:30,320 --> 01:52:32,480

i mean this is huge we never could have

3239
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:36,000
anticipated this because we feel it's

3240
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:37,440
