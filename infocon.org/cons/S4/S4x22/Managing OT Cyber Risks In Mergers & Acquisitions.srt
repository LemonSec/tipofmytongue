1
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,799
today we want to talk about something

2
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:08,400
that may be a little bit different from

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,320
the technical discussions that typically

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,480
go on at a conference like this

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,200
and that is bridging in this commercial

6
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:18,000
concept and what we've seen over

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,480
the last year last multiple years is

8
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,279
that

9
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:23,920
commercial deal leaders are really

10
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,880
seeing this risk what we started off as

11
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,320
just calling cyber risk and now we're

12
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,720
targeting starting to

13
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,120
get deeper into those types of risks and

14
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,960
we need to figure out how we address it

15
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,559
how do we manage it how do we mitigate

16
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:38,320
all these types of things

17
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,719
and so about a year ago started looking

18
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:41,600
into

19
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,000
what is risk and there are tremendous

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,600
amount of articles out there basically

21
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,320
saying we've got things like

22
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,600
cyber risk

23
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,199
it was just one bucket we've got things

24
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:53,760
like m a and it's just one bucket

25
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,520
it's all great it's we're seeing a lot

26
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,360
of movement forward but where we're at

27
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,680
today is we need to really take a step

28
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:00,559
back

29
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:03,280
and properly place the type of cyber

30
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,640
risk with the type of m a and so today i

31
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,320
want to talk about

32
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,080
parsing those out a little bit more and

33
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,000
so from cyber risk we can think about it

34
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,479
as your traditional i.t cyber risks but

35
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:15,759
we also need to be thinking about it

36
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:17,680
specifically as your ot cyber risk as

37
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,479
well

38
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:19,920
and then mergers and acquisitions we

39
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,560
need to separate out not all m a is the

40
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,280
same and so we can flip those into about

41
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,200
three main buckets

42
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,280
the first bucket being a technology

43
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,600
company buying a technology company

44
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,880
and in this case typically what happens

45
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,240
is if the tech's not good the deal

46
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,159
doesn't get done so you're really

47
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:41,119
focused on a lot of the deep diligence

48
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:42,960
it makes or breaks a deal

49
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,159
the next

50
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,240
is a company buying a company where

51
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,200
technology is a critical part but not

52
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,200
necessarily going to kill the deal

53
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,600
and that splits up into two as well

54
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,399
you have first your traditional i.t

55
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,000
technology risks things that you might

56
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,040
see more of social media tech company or

57
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,119
things that you might see of a financial

58
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:05,280
services company where they're really

59
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,200
worried about your traditional i.t

60
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,720
related risks

61
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,080
but then you have a whole another

62
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,920
category of m a and this is one we

63
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,879
really want to focus on today which is

64
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:18,239
acquisitions of physical assets critical

65
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:19,520
infrastructure

66
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,599
things like energy

67
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,920
which covers oil and gas and power as

68
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,319
well as industrials and others

69
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:27,440
and so

70
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,319
why is this becoming a big piece and

71
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:32,319
why is commercial or the commercial side

72
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:33,840
of house starting to come in and want to

73
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,760
understand this a little bit more

74
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,000
and so we see first and foremost

75
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,800
that

76
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,440
business leaders and technology leaders

77
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,920
agree that there are significant risks

78
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,800
in cyber when it comes to an acquisition

79
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,120
point in time and if we look at what

80
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,200
this would have been years ago

81
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,120
it could be less than 10 depends on what

82
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,760
study you look at but now we see a good

83
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,120
majority of companies are starting to

84
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,120
realize this and one of the biggest

85
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,760
reasons that they're realizing this

86
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,959
is because

87
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:06,159
over 50 percent of these deals are

88
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:09,120
seeing some type of critical cyber issue

89
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,159
or incident during the m a deal process

90
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:14,159
and so when that happens you really

91
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:15,599
start to

92
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,440
gain the attention of not only the

93
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,599
management but also the deal teams and

94
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,680
the reason this is is because there's a

95
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,519
lot of money at risk

96
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:25,120
and traditionally on the commercial side

97
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,640
you think about risk differently you

98
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,239
think about it as

99
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:30,720
maybe commodities risk so what happens

100
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,599
if

101
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:35,840
prices go down or prices go up by 10 20

102
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,840
what does that do to my return of this

103
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,599
asset what does that do to my pricing of

104
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:41,120
this asset

105
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,200
likewise you maybe especially now be

106
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,799
thinking about inflation what does

107
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:47,200
inflation due to my input cost how do

108
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,720
all these things

109
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,319
change the way that i'm

110
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:52,959
dealing with this opportunity and then

111
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:55,599
on the back of that how do i mitigate it

112
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:58,000
in the process what do i do

113
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,120
and the ot side really has started to

114
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,360
come up of asking the question in the

115
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,640
deal room of

116
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,120
what happens if my asset goes down

117
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,519
and the impact of an asset going down

118
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:12,159
even for a short period of time

119
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:14,480
has in some cases just as big of an

120
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,120
impact as a 5 10

121
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,000
decrease decrease in price or some rise

122
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,639
in inflation and so because of this

123
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:24,479
it really starts to get attention not

124
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:26,320
only at the deal team level but at the

125
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,800
management the board level and so

126
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,199
because of this we see

127
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,199
that the threat actors are also looking

128
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:36,800
at this as a as a unique point in time a

129
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,800
lot of discussions again are around what

130
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,960
happens during normal run and maintain

131
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,639
situation

132
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:44,720
and from the again the deal side the

133
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,320
world i come from

134
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,440
we're seeing

135
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,720
a whole bunch of different things we're

136
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,440
seeing articles come out about attackers

137
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,360
targeting in the acquisition points in

138
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,680
time we see other articles coming out

139
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,680
around the number of

140
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,759
threat groups are growing the number of

141
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,280
threats are growing

142
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,280
and it really you know took some time to

143
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,000
say

144
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,440
why is acquisition a different point

145
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,280
than traditional run and maintain and

146
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,520
why should we be focusing on it as part

147
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,600
of the traditional deal process

148
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,520
and some discussions kind of landed on

149
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,199
three main things that we'll talk about

150
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:18,240
today

151
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,600
by far these aren't the only three

152
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,639
things but i think the ones that are

153
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:22,160
worth talking about

154
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,840
and so first and foremost is

155
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,680
acquisitions are typically very easy to

156
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,440
find um

157
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,280
they're typically done with a press

158
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,240
release

159
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,600
for those of you wondering can we just

160
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,960
solve this problem by not doing press

161
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,560
releases probably but that's not how

162
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,240
deals work

163
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,720
and so what happens is it's out there

164
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,039
and so now you've got an easy

165
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:43,199
identification of an acquirer and of a

166
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:44,320
target

167
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,919
and the second piece of that press

168
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:48,400
release of being easy to find

169
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,039
is there's large capital involvement

170
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:51,759
so

171
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:54,479
not only have you said hey this company

172
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:57,520
is buying that company you've also said

173
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,880
there's a lot of money coming to the

174
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,600
table that has a vested interest

175
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,560
in

176
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,039
the the asset operating as it should be

177
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:06,240
growing as it should be in all these

178
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,440
things

179
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,600
but the third is the most important

180
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,080
which is it is a point in change and

181
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,160
it's a critical point in change

182
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,440
for anyone that's ever done an

183
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,199
acquisition or been part of an

184
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:18,319
acquisition

185
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:19,840
it's probably one of the most chaotic

186
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,759
points in time

187
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:24,400
for people to try to figure out

188
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,240
and so when we think about

189
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,680
assets

190
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,680
during the acquisition versus normal run

191
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,960
and maintain

192
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,560
we also have to think about why are they

193
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,400
different why are the procedures

194
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,400
protocols processes in place that we

195
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,720
have for normal run and maintain

196
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,720
different acquisition how should we

197
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,000
think about them differently what should

198
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,360
we do

199
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,680
and so we can parse these out a little

200
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,080
bit more the first is visibility and we

201
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,919
talked about visibility in the sense of

202
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:51,440
easy to find

203
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,080
but the second part of visibility is

204
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,919
in an acquisition

205
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:58,639
you have groups coming in and basically

206
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:00,560
assessing all aspects of the business

207
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,000
you need to know what you're buying you

208
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,599
need to know what's out there

209
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:05,759
and because of that you have external

210
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,160
groups management basically shining in

211
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,160
the spotlight across the entire

212
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,080
organization to figure out

213
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,520
what is going on

214
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,360
and that's typically done in deep

215
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,440
diligence assessments things like that

216
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,919
but ultimately it's a different set of

217
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:22,000
exposure that you have as as

218
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,039
leaders

219
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:24,479
the second is a different group of

220
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:26,800
stakeholders so for the groups that have

221
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,960
really figured out their organization

222
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,039
how do i get the right management in

223
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:33,759
place bought into the programs we have

224
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:35,280
bought into these technologies that

225
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,800
we're trying to implement

226
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,759
uh largely again in the good case that's

227
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:41,840
familiar you know who those people are

228
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,120
you know how they think you know how to

229
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,720
position things to them

230
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,039
during acquisition you have two

231
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:49,599
additional groups one is the deal team

232
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:51,199
group they'll come in and then they'll

233
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:54,160
disappear and then the second is

234
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,840
a whole nother set of stakeholders in

235
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,440
the other company and if you're the ones

236
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,199
being acquired those are going to be the

237
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:00,879
individuals that are making the decision

238
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:04,160
of where do we invest how do we mitigate

239
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,919
all these types of things

240
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:07,759
and so because of that

241
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:09,520
you have two views in the best world

242
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,800
they all come together and it makes

243
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,879
sense but more often than not there's

244
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:15,280
differences and those differences create

245
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,039
some complexity within the type of risk

246
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:18,560
that's being managed

247
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,840
you may have

248
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,680
people moving from one organization to

249
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,440
another you may have

250
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,120
changes that typically you're not used

251
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,639
to dealing with in that normal run and

252
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,319
maintain situation

253
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:30,160
and what that does is it creates this

254
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,680
group of risks that somehow we need to

255
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,839
get better control of

256
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:35,120
and not only do we need to get better

257
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,120
control of it we also need to figure out

258
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,120
how to mitigate it or

259
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,799
manage it somehow

260
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:43,519
and the the the fourth piece here and

261
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:46,160
this is more i guess byproduct is

262
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,160
in the companies we've worked with in

263
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,720
the past in the articles we read in in

264
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,120
the market we see the attack frequency

265
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,120
during that point of acquisition

266
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,120
starts to increase and so we know that

267
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,519
others are paying attention as well

268
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:02,240
and so thinking a little bit more about

269
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,560
what is the deal process and who's

270
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,160
involved and how do you mesh these

271
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,440
things together

272
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,959
we've got to then take a step back and

273
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:09,760
say

274
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,399
okay this thing called a deal so for for

275
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:14,480
those unfamiliar you've got a deal

276
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,399
that's the actual transaction

277
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:17,760
oversimplify it by saying you have a

278
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,440
period of time beforehand which is the

279
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,440
pre-deal period of time afterwards which

280
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,040
is post deal

281
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,920
traditionally what happens is again if

282
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,160
you're buying an asset that's done for

283
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,760
strategic reasons

284
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,959
the decision to execute that deal is

285
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:34,959
largely going to move forward regardless

286
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:37,360
of the the issues raised from a

287
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,800
technology team

288
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,480
uh unless it's really really bad that

289
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,399
deal is going to go through and so what

290
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,399
happens is there's this thing called

291
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:46,880
integration which is done in post deal

292
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,399
that's when the technology teams get a

293
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:49,760
call that's when the vendors get a call

294
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,959
and they say hey we've already made the

295
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:52,320
decision we're doing it it's going to be

296
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,240
a mess go figure it out

297
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,240
and that is the point of time where

298
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,560
there's an open window of risk and so we

299
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,040
need to figure out how do we bridge that

300
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:01,920
gap

301
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,720
earlier into the deal process connected

302
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,680
into the right types of stakeholders

303
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,839
that would make that transition easier

304
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:11,519
it makes it smoother and something more

305
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:12,959
sustainable

306
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:14,720
and so to do that we've got to first

307
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,880
think about who's involved

308
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:20,160
and so we have a set of commercial folks

309
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,920
these are strategy new business

310
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,680
development type people

311
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:26,399
and they're largely around the pre-deal

312
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:28,079
phase thinking about why do we want to

313
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:30,000
buy this asset why is it strategic that

314
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,399
we have a pipeline leading up to this

315
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,560
refinery in terms of you know

316
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,040
the business reason

317
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,040
on the back of that you have your

318
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,760
finance folks and in your finance area

319
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,279
you've got your tax professionals

320
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:45,040
treasuries controllers

321
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,720
same with legal

322
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,240
and then you've got this group of other

323
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,120
people um and those are health safety

324
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,279
and operations and so on and so forth

325
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:55,440
and for the largest time there's just

326
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,279
been this concept of oh and you also

327
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:59,360
have technology people

328
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,680
and coming from the finance side

329
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,320
that to me is crazy because

330
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,000
in finance you don't just have finance

331
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,640
people it's known the function of a tax

332
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,320
person it's known the function of a

333
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,839
treasury person

334
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:14,240
and they all have a seat at the table

335
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,839
they all are trying to manage different

336
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,920
things and they're all integrated into

337
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,200
that process

338
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,279
much earlier that way

339
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:23,279
again post integration they can do

340
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:25,839
something about what they've found or

341
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:27,920
they can do something about the pieces

342
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,519
that they have in place

343
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:32,480
and so what from a from a deal team's

344
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,000
perspective we need to do

345
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,160
and from an ot professional's

346
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,920
perspective need to do

347
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:41,519
is really take a step back and say

348
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:44,480
okay it's not just cyber risk and m a we

349
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,880
need to think about it as what do we

350
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,399
actually need to do

351
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:50,720
as that next step and the first thing is

352
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,680
separating i.t from ot particularly in

353
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,480
what we're looking at in diligence list

354
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,000
and i'll say this from the diligence

355
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,920
list i've seen typically you have a

356
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,160
laundry list of commercial finance legal

357
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,279
items

358
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:04,800
technology

359
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,079
you know if you're lucky sometimes it

360
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:07,440
just says they have a technology

361
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,959
department

362
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:11,680
maybe they have a cso in place

363
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,079
they've got some procedures

364
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:16,240
it's a check mark that gets steel done

365
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,880
and again everything's pushed to post

366
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,959
post steel integration and so we've

367
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:23,440
gotta better tailor those solutions to

368
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,200
actually itemize what are the assets out

369
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,399
there in the field that we're acquiring

370
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:28,160
how are they protected have those

371
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,560
discussions much earlier in the process

372
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,240
than we are today

373
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,920
and the reason we need to do that is

374
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,399
because the risk during acquisition has

375
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:39,120
real world impacts and so again talking

376
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,360
more to the energy side let's take the

377
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,279
example of midstream companies these are

378
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:45,120
companies that are consistently

379
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,880
bought and sold

380
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,040
whether that be by a large corporate or

381
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,760
that be by private equity firms

382
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,639
and these these assets out there

383
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:56,160
you know at a high level

384
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,200
have

385
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,959
a bunch of different supplier component

386
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:00,399
partners they have different vendors

387
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:01,440
they have

388
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,279
multiple systems out in the field

389
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:04,160
there's

390
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,920
different levels of sophistication

391
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,040
posture

392
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,440
reporting all these types of things

393
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,920
that now you have to merge into one

394
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,279
and that period of time where you're

395
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:15,279
trying to merge them into wine

396
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:18,399
really creates a set of risks and those

397
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:20,240
i think for this group are very well

398
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,240
understood types of risks that might be

399
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,440
things like operational loss of control

400
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,639
operational

401
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,200
visibility all these items but from a

402
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,680
commercial side that's not really ever

403
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,760
understood it's just there's this risk

404
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,760
somehow it will be managed and so we've

405
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,839
got to think about when we do these

406
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:40,160
steps when we get into these risks how

407
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,680
do we manage those and the reason we

408
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,839
need to figure out how to manage those

409
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:46,320
is because the impacts are real and the

410
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,519
impacts

411
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:49,839
not not may not just be about the the

412
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:52,000
risk exposure regardless if that's you

413
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:52,800
know

414
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,279
unmanaged risk exposure or regardless if

415
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:58,000
that's unquantified risk exposure but

416
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,560
also things just like unplanned spending

417
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,639
or delay of timelines

418
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:04,959
and so traditionally what happens in

419
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:06,160
these is

420
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,440
you have

421
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,880
a

422
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,880
a process

423
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:13,120
on the m a side

424
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,519
and on the m a side you just kind of run

425
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:17,839
that process it's well understood again

426
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:20,000
pre-deal deal and post deal

427
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
what i want to do is talk about the set

428
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,639
of actions that we can look at from a

429
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:26,320
commercial team

430
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:29,040
bridging into an assurance and handover

431
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,720
process

432
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,880
more something more familiar to the the

433
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,240
ot side

434
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,079
and what a set of actions and how we

435
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:38,320
need to address these to move it from

436
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,680
beyond just

437
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:42,320
hey there's cyber risk we need to do

438
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,199
something about it and so the first set

439
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:46,399
of actions

440
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:48,720
really starts when the deal starts and i

441
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,560
know this is probably the furthest along

442
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,800
this is the ideal state

443
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,880
but having a set of

444
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,839
technology ot cyber risk related

445
00:14:57,839 --> 00:14:59,839
discussions right at the beginning of

446
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:02,160
deals being done so as the deal teams

447
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,399
are thinking about strategy of what

448
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:06,480
types of companies do we want to buy

449
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,639
why do we want to buy them what types of

450
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:10,480
cultures do we want in terms of people

451
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,480
all these types of things we need to

452
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,199
have some type of

453
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:17,600
posture or hygiene reviews of what are

454
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,800
the types of things that we're looking

455
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,040
for and this is really getting into the

456
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:24,639
mindset of the deal teams themselves

457
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:26,560
and then bridging that gap over into the

458
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,240
technology groups

459
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,920
and the reason that this is important is

460
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,639
because once that process starts it

461
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:35,759
allows you to get into the discussions

462
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:37,839
much much quicker

463
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:40,639
and get to a place

464
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:42,720
where you know what's going on again the

465
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,880
worst case scenario is just coming in at

466
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,759
the integration creating all the risk

467
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:49,759
and on the back of that

468
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:52,160
we see them moving into a deal and it's

469
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,759
important for those

470
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:55,680
hopefully everyone knows this but when

471
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,160
you see one deal announced that likely

472
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,160
means tens or hundreds of deals were

473
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,480
assessed to get to that one deal

474
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:05,040
and so there's a lot of understanding as

475
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,120
we go find that particular deal

476
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,560
that happens in terms of the due

477
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,639
diligence phase of mergers and

478
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:12,000
acquisitions

479
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,720
and when mapping the due diligence phase

480
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,279
into kind of an understanding of what's

481
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:18,480
out there

482
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,199
the closest action that we can think of

483
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:22,880
between an impact assessment and

484
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,959
remediation step

485
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:27,279
into the due diligence phase is doing

486
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:30,399
some type of ot risk assessment so

487
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:32,800
understanding what is out there

488
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,639
and a lot of times we need to be able to

489
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:35,759
bridge

490
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:37,440
what are these things

491
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,519
with then to the deal team of what

492
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:41,279
should we be focusing on

493
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:43,040
because the the fact of knowing there's

494
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,360
a laundry list of problems

495
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,120
becomes challenging we don't know what

496
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,800
to to mitigate against we don't know

497
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,040
which ones we should prioritize

498
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,600
so when we when we think about this

499
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,560
ot risk assessment it starts to do a

500
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:57,680
couple things in the way that we

501
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,120
communicate between

502
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,880
technical organizations and commercial

503
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,480
organizations

504
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,160
the first is understanding where to

505
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,919
focus so the concept of something is red

506
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:09,119
is great

507
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:11,520
but is it a really really bad red or is

508
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,439
it not as bad of a red

509
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:15,199
it you don't know

510
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:17,679
and so there needs to be some type of

511
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:19,839
understanding of how do we rank these

512
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:21,439
because i know as part of the deal we

513
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:23,679
can't attribute the solution to all of

514
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:25,599
them so what are the ones we really need

515
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:27,199
to be worried about

516
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:28,799
and then beyond that

517
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:30,160
what are the best ways that we can

518
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,440
quantify that

519
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,720
is it a

520
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,480
big unknown risk that we need to find a

521
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,960
solution for uh

522
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,880
regardless of how we mitigate it or is

523
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,880
it something that we can live with and

524
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,880
we may make different decisions

525
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,720
throughout that deal process

526
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,200
of how we want that to work

527
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,640
and so on the back of that it moves us

528
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,320
to the next piece of the deal process

529
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,960
which is negotiations

530
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,400
and so we can't know what we're

531
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,480
negotiating for again unless we've done

532
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:59,039
an assessment unless we've prioritized

533
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:01,039
what we need to go solve for

534
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:02,880
and on the back of that we know the

535
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,039
value of it and for some things that we

536
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:07,120
won't know the value of we'll figure it

537
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,400
out but that's part of negotiation

538
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,520
process

539
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,799
and this is where it becomes really

540
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:12,160
interesting because

541
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,000
there can be a set of risk-related

542
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,840
provisions and mitigations that are put

543
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,360
into the deal

544
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,960
to help with these different types of

545
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,200
risks because inherently

546
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,240
when a risk gets identified it exists

547
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,840
and we have choices of what we can do

548
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:26,960
with that

549
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,840
we can try to reduce it which obviously

550
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,520
is a good thing

551
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:34,000
we can as two parties figure out who

552
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,120
holds it

553
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,799
well the thing is important here is

554
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:38,160
there's there's actually three parties

555
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,840
in an m a deal

556
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,559
the acquirer the seller and someone else

557
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,720
and that someone else may be hey the

558
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,200
solution is we're going to

559
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,280
buy an insurance policy to to cover this

560
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,799
so we're shifting that risk between

561
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:52,640
parties and within that we need to

562
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,799
understand what that means

563
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:58,080
we've seen again over the last year two

564
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,039
years

565
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:00,960
these types of provisions becoming more

566
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,960
and more important in the deal

567
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,120
the latest legal documentation that i

568
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:08,480
saw showed about 70 of deals

569
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,720
have some type of cyber security

570
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,559
representations in them

571
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:14,799
which mean that you as a company are

572
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:17,120
representing to that acquirer

573
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,760
that there are no known cyber issues

574
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,400
that there's certain things in place

575
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,840
and if you don't if you breach that

576
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,600
representation

577
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,960
then typically there's something that

578
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,360
comes back on the back end now

579
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,039
there's new solutions that we see coming

580
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:34,799
to market some of those are getting more

581
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:36,880
traction than others you could buy reps

582
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,640
and warranty insurance

583
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,720
assuming that might fit what you need

584
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,960
you may put it into provision of the

585
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,039
deal where you claw back some money if

586
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:46,880
something goes wrong but ultimately

587
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,799
something needs to be done with it

588
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:50,960
and this is the most critical part of a

589
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,280
deal team looking at it and saying we

590
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,919
need the ot teams to help us understand

591
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:58,160
what that risk is we need to quantify

592
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,679
that and then we need to put something

593
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:00,720
in place

594
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:04,080
and if we can really get that active

595
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,760
then again it moves the conversation

596
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,679
from hey we just did this deal and

597
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:09,120
there's a bunch of stuff out there go

598
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,240
figure it out

599
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,799
into here's what we're going to do next

600
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:15,120
and that what do we do next really sits

601
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,520
in the next part and this is actually

602
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,840
pre-announcement so these are things you

603
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:22,159
put in prior to an announcement

604
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:23,679
and so in traditional private

605
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:25,679
equity-based deals a lot of times

606
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:27,360
corporates do this as well

607
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,400
they have something that's called a

608
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,840
100-day plan

609
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:32,240
it's a plan of how do you integrate

610
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,159
the great people can actually integrate

611
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:36,159
in 100 days most people get nowhere

612
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:37,280
close

613
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,360
and what we've seen as

614
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,240
the

615
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,880
industry looks more at the space is

616
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,960
different numbers of

617
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:47,039
from the point of transaction how many

618
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:48,320
days until you actually find that

619
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,240
there's been a problem

620
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:54,559
and the in the sec's recent proposal of

621
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:56,400
more disclosures in the space which

622
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,559
we'll talk about in a second

623
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:00,840
i think the number they used was like 44

624
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:04,400
days in terms of identifying a breach

625
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,400
and when you look at 100-day plan you're

626
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,000
halfway through at that point so the

627
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,159
question is how do you actually

628
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:12,240
get a plan in place of this is how we're

629
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,760
going to transition

630
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:16,000
that transition could be transition

631
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,919
service agreement where you say we're

632
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:20,000
going to keep on these folks for a

633
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,919
period of time to transition train and

634
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:23,120
otherwise

635
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,440
but there needs to be something in place

636
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,280
for that transitory period

637
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,559
because we know

638
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:29,440
that

639
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,280
resourcing is typically a challenge

640
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,880
during this time

641
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,880
the uncertainty of

642
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,960
job security and where everyone lands

643
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,600
and who reports to who is important

644
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,360
and so having a plan out there that

645
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,200
allows us to then integrate into this

646
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,559
100-day plan

647
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:47,039
traditionally used on the deal side is

648
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:48,960
really really critical

649
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,200
the other thing that's important is

650
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,880
not only from the technical folks that

651
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,200
are managing the assets themselves but

652
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,960
also all the vendors and i know there's

653
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,640
a lot of vendors here today

654
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:01,440
and what happens is if you've got

655
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,440
duplicate systems or things that may

656
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,200
work together you just sold into an

657
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,159
account

658
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:08,240
and they're now getting acquired

659
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,760
then there's there's naturally always

660
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,840
going to be a discussion especially in

661
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:14,000
this integration process is what do we

662
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,320
keep what do we spend on how does all

663
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,679
this work

664
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:20,080
and traditionally what you'll see is

665
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,440
the decision saying well i don't want to

666
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,720
remove anything because if i remove

667
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,080
something then that might create a hole

668
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:26,159
and then that gets me in trouble and

669
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:27,919
then that may be true for a period of

670
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:28,880
time

671
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,039
but the problem is that can't sustain

672
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:32,320
forever because

673
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,760
as we all know there's not unlimited

674
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:34,880
budgets

675
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,720
and so it's really kind of figuring out

676
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,559
how do all these pieces come together

677
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:40,960
and how do we put a plan in place

678
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,280
and then how as we're integrating and

679
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:46,400
moving to kind of what do we do about it

680
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,360
how do we kind of keep up on that and so

681
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,520
very similar to an ot risk assessment

682
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,600
having some type of a

683
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,440
ot health check

684
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:59,200
that says okay we have a 100 day plan

685
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,960
halfway through hope you know hopefully

686
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,799
there's no breach but that's long short

687
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:04,720
of when we'll figure that out and we

688
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,799
need continuations which then get us

689
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:09,039
further into multiple checkpoints and so

690
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:10,880
we can think about this as a module that

691
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:13,440
taps in to that 100-day plan and becomes

692
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,240
more

693
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,880
consistent and then on the back of that

694
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:19,679
becomes a connection tool

695
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:21,280
that goes through

696
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,840
ongoing threat visibility reporting

697
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:27,200
to senior managers and directors

698
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,799
and when you get that what you've done

699
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:31,440
is you've created cohesiveness from this

700
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,960
pre-deal process

701
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:36,880
into the deal now into post deal you've

702
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,240
positioned

703
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:41,039
right alongside the commercial teams

704
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:43,039
and then on the back of that you've kept

705
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:46,000
focus within management boards

706
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,159
and what we're seeing is that management

707
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:50,960
and boards are now raising

708
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:53,840
more awareness because there's more

709
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:56,559
coming back on them and so

710
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:58,080
talked about a reference a little bit

711
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,279
before

712
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:01,279
what we're seeing now in things like the

713
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:04,159
the sec's proposal around security

714
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:05,679
disclosures

715
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:07,360
it's a handful of things it's things

716
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,919
like do you have a procedure in place do

717
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:12,000
you have policies in place

718
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,440
but there are there's a couple really

719
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,919
critical ones as it pertains to

720
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:17,760
what is your board's level of knowledge

721
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:20,480
around cyber risk and what is management

722
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,400
and how is management involved in these

723
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,840
types of risks

724
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:26,480
and nothing gets an individual or group

725
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,240
more active than accountability and

726
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,880
responsibility and so we're seeing these

727
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,240
types of things start to come in a

728
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,360
little bit more

729
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,679
and it's a natural place to then bridge

730
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:38,480
these gaps and again these this this gap

731
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:41,360
of communication of the the ot side

732
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,520
or cyber risk site as a whole getting

733
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,360
split into it ot

734
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,760
deals getting split into

735
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,679
physical assets

736
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:51,679
not only the commercial side

737
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:54,559
through the deal process but post deal

738
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:56,640
creates a really good platform to keep

739
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,799
those conversations going

740
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:01,760
and so on on with that the question is

741
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:04,080
really where do we go from here

742
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,240
and so the first thing that we need to

743
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,279
do

744
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:09,679
is work together so we need to augment

745
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:11,679
the traditional deal teams

746
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:15,120
with ot cyber security stakeholders

747
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,960
again this this can't be a situation

748
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:17,840
where

749
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,600
right at the end of a deal or towards

750
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,440
the end when when it's in place there's

751
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,440
really nowhere to figure things out we

752
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,120
just say hey it's your problem now go

753
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,559
figure it out and hopefully don't don't

754
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:28,400
screw up the returns that we expect it's

755
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,320
not going to get the outcomes we need so

756
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,559
pulling that earlier in the process

757
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:34,159
having those communications come into

758
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:36,400
play is really really critical

759
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,840
and sometimes that's just being able to

760
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,440
speak a common language

761
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,039
other times that's just being able to

762
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:43,360
know who the people are

763
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:46,000
the second piece is to set a common uh

764
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,760
set of benchmarks so i know there's a

765
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,320
lot of standards and procedures and

766
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,400
things like that on the cyber security

767
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,440
side

768
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,880
really create ones that are fit for

769
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,880
purpose around the specific risks that

770
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,159
are created

771
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:00,559
in the deal environment so what are the

772
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:02,720
things that we need to be thinking about

773
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:03,600
about

774
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,919
that's not traditional run and maintain

775
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:08,720
that is as companies are transitioning

776
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:11,600
from one technology team merging into

777
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,840
another technology team one group of

778
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:16,480
assets systems vendors merging into

779
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,640
another group of systems and vendors

780
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,440
and create a common let's see framework

781
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,440
or way that those pieces can work

782
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,720
together

783
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,320
and then the third i've touched on this

784
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,600
a lot of times and i'll touch on it one

785
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,039
more time

786
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:31,600
is we have to assess early and often

787
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,760
so we've got to really go in and

788
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:36,000
integrate these concepts

789
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,320
into the deal framework

790
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,880
and when we do that what it does is it

791
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,440
gives us the capability on the back end

792
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,520
to start as deal teams pricing and the

793
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:49,679
residual risk so no longer is

794
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:52,159
cyber security just this thing that

795
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:53,360
exists

796
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,960
it's a thing that we somehow do

797
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,919
something about in a deal and so

798
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:01,679
that means we need to again identify it

799
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:03,360
we need to understand it to the best of

800
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:06,320
our abilities to wrap our arms around it

801
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,919
and then we need to start putting that

802
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:10,000
into some type of value

803
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,240
and then with that value

804
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,240
impacting the deal itself

805
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,720
and that impacts potential valuation

806
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,880
metrics ways that we think about

807
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,320
putting money in escrow ways that we

808
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,320
think about insurance all these types of

809
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,480
things we need to translate

810
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,640
traditionally what is green

811
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,559
and and red and orange and things like

812
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:30,000
that into

813
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,080
specific clauses actions and stuff that

814
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,720
we can use to protect and and that's

815
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:37,120
really the last point which is we've got

816
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:40,480
to revise the traditional contract terms

817
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,600
and we're already starting to see this

818
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:42,799
happen again

819
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:44,960
we didn't see cyber reps and warrants

820
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,480
the same way

821
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,799
five ten years ago that we're seeing now

822
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:50,000
and we're going to see that continue to

823
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,520
evolve over time

824
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,200
and we need to think about a more

825
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,120
creative set of solutions

826
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:57,760
beyond just saying accept the risk or

827
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,120
ignore the risk

828
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,320
or

829
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,559
put put all that on one group to figure

830
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:05,120
out we need to be solving that from

831
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,880
legal perspective we need to be solving

832
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,720
it from commercial perspective

833
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,640
and we need to be solving it from

834
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,320
insurance angles

835
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,799
we need to be looking at how do we give

836
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:16,799
the commercial side

837
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:19,360
a connection to the ot side

838
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,679
and so with that what it does is it puts

839
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:23,600
us in a position to say

840
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,600
if we can do all of this

841
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:28,000
then it puts us all in a better spot

842
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,039
and what it really helps with is saying

843
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:35,120
this is no longer just cyber risk in mna

844
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,640
we now understand that we're taking a

845
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,159
step further retaining a step forward to

846
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:39,200
say

847
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:43,279
it's ot cyber risk in energy m a deals

848
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:45,520
and this is how we deal with it or it's

849
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,279
ot risk in

850
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:48,880
industrial companies

851
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,480
still manufacturing other things like

852
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,320
that and this is how we deal with it

853
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:53,840
that way we can get the right solutions

854
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:54,880
in place

855
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:57,520
and protect the ultimate goal of the

856
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:59,279
transaction which is

857
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:02,720
to have a consistent solid handover

858
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:05,120
and generate good returns with the least

859
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,360
amount of exposure as possible

860
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,159
and

861
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:08,960
just

862
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,559
be able to achieve

863
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:12,720
ultimately the right visibility within

864
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,240
the organization

865
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:16,159
and so with that it definitely takes the

866
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:17,760
efforts of

867
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:18,880
both the technical side and the

868
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:21,120
commercial side it's great as a

869
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,159
commercial

870
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:23,760
individual being able to come to an

871
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,360
event like this where there's a lot of

872
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:27,760
great technical experts and look forward

873
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,520
to continuing the conversation of how we

874
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,760
bridge the two sites together to create

875
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,679
a better outcome for both thank you very

876
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:36,679
much
