1
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:07,359
uh welcome everybody and thank you

2
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:09,519
especially the coming to tenable sponsor

3
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:10,880
stage today

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:13,360
uh first of all it's happy i'm happy to

5
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:15,839
see my friends right from

6
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:20,400
the uh s4s gone uh past right this is a

7
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,240
this is a great reunion that we're

8
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:24,160
having today so today i'm gonna talk a

9
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,560
little bit about a concept that i've

10
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,199
been pushing now for i'm gonna say a

11
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:30,400
couple years

12
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,120
and this is the concept that you know we

13
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:38,399
we basically look at these uh

14
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:42,399
ics ot operational systems

15
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:44,480
we look at them differently than we look

16
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,600
at the pipes and the metal and the pumps

17
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:48,960
of a plant

18
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,079
and so

19
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:52,960
when i was in and my primary industry

20
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,440
was pulp and paper when i was in pulp

21
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,840
and paper

22
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,840
a number of years ago we should say a

23
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,960
number of decades ago probably uh

24
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,720
i remember

25
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,840
buying an industrial control system

26
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,760
sort of screen one pane of glass right

27
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,000
vax vms based

28
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,479
250 000 to expand to get one more

29
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:20,080
operator position

30
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,640
that's what it cost

31
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,280
so all that was capitalized right so he

32
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,080
had to go through all kinds of budget

33
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,640
meandering and capitalization and

34
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:34,400
finance and i remember when we took

35
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,840
the first

36
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,200
windows nt operator station it's like it

37
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,439
was 2 500 bucks i thought this is

38
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:43,119
fantastic so we bought a bunch of them

39
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:45,680
and i stuck them in the control room

40
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,240
and then two or three years later

41
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,520
we came back and uh the vendor

42
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,479
said oh by the way this pc you know was

43
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:56,560
probably a 386 or something with a

44
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,119
co-processor in it you need to replace

45
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,680
that because the new software needs a

46
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,320
bigger stronger faster computer

47
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,320
and so okay i went back to the

48
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,080
engineering manager or the plant manager

49
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,280
and i said i need like 75 000 to upgrade

50
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,920
the pcs in this control room to run the

51
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,520
new software

52
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,120
and the accounting people looked at me

53
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,520
and they said

54
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,800
you you you you have 27 years of

55
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,640
depreciation left on that asset

56
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,440
and and i really you know a young

57
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,599
engineer right that's like i'm going i

58
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:33,599
don't understand they said well we

59
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:35,200
bought it the same way we had bought

60
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,160
every control system component before

61
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,519
and so it was completely capitalized

62
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:43,920
had not been depreciated off the books

63
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,400
and it's like i came to this realization

64
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,360
it's like

65
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,280
we got to do this different this stuff

66
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,440
is going to turn over right so now we

67
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,680
treat the control system pieces more

68
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,920
like our it pieces right where you get a

69
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,319
new laptop every you know three years or

70
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,159
five years or whatever the period of

71
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:01,360
time is

72
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,680
i believe that there's some components

73
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,840
of that that we need to do

74
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,959
within the um industrial control system

75
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:11,760
security arena too and we need to treat

76
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,879
these systems more like we treat we we

77
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:17,599
kind of put them on a pedestal or we we

78
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:19,519
treat them differently right they're

79
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:21,680
just another piece of plant equipment

80
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,080
they should be programmed into the same

81
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,239
sort of financial decisions risk

82
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:28,799
decisions and i believe maintenance

83
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:31,760
decisions right

84
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,120
the other thing that i've never

85
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,000
understood in this industry

86
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,599
is that

87
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:39,440
these systems

88
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:42,080
are the crown jewels and bread and

89
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,640
butter of your entire enterprise right

90
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,200
when the control system stops

91
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,440
either really bad things happen which we

92
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,840
hopefully don't see or your you mean

93
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,000
your production goes down

94
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,680
but we spend a lot of money on

95
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,599
mitigating risk on the i.t side of the

96
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:58,640
house

97
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,040
and we kind of ignore this or we shuffle

98
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,439
it under the carpet the risk that

99
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:05,360
we have introduced into our

100
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,879
manufacturing environments with the

101
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:10,799
computerization of uh the control system

102
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:14,720
right so i i i've never been able to

103
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:19,120
satisfy my curiosity for why we haven't

104
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,639
recognized that and invested financially

105
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:25,199
at a level to take that risk down to an

106
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:26,880
acceptable level

107
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,639
right

108
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:30,160
now let's change over to the maintenance

109
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,240
subject and i am not a maintenance

110
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,479
engineer so if you are please bear with

111
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:36,880
my over simplification of maintenance

112
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,560
practices right

113
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,280
but maintenance practices have changed

114
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,840
significantly over the years if you look

115
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:44,720
back

116
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,040
at uh you know

117
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,280
how we originally maintained equipment

118
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,000
within a plant

119
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,280
when it broke

120
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,880
we fixed it

121
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,400
that's called corrective maintenance

122
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,280
right

123
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,240
you run it to failure it breaks and you

124
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,360
fix it

125
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,120
most people will say that's a fairly

126
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,680
spendy way of doing maintenance right

127
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,160
the next one is preventative or schedule

128
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,000
driven that's like okay i'm gonna take

129
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,160
my car in every five thousand kilometers

130
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,759
or three thousand miles or whatever the

131
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:15,600
interval is and i'm gonna change the oil

132
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,960
no matter what

133
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,199
i do it on a schedule and i do it

134
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:20,400
religiously

135
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,520
and it's shown to prevent downtime or

136
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,479
failures

137
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:26,000
then you get into proactive and

138
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,759
predictive maintenance which is where

139
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:30,720
you're actually doing some analysis

140
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,919
around the environment so that you can

141
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:36,320
do the right amount of maintenance to

142
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,000
the equipment right that's where the

143
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,560
sweet spot is from a

144
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,520
economics perspective right things like

145
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,520
lube oil analysis right where you're

146
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,680
actually analyzing the lubricant in the

147
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,039
machine

148
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:51,600
and you predict oh it's going to fail

149
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,840
soon well we should do something about

150
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,240
it before that soon happens and then

151
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,440
that prevents um any outages or or

152
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,319
issues like that right

153
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:05,360
so i may i maintain that the whole run

154
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,840
to failure thing uh there's a lot of

155
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:11,680
risk there right and it's expensive so

156
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,120
you you

157
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,680
you don't plan it right it's you're

158
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,240
basically tossing the dice or rolling

159
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,479
the dice and just

160
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:22,400
when the machine decides to fail it's

161
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,960
going to fail and you have to respond

162
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,160
probably more importantly in my personal

163
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,600
opinion

164
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,360
this is hard on people this is ir this

165
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,479
is fire fighting this is all hands on

166
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:39,280
deck something's broken the whole plant

167
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,759
is down we're losing x

168
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:44,080
times ten thousand dollars a minute or

169
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,800
whatever your sort of revenue run rate

170
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,800
is on that machine

171
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,160
it is very stressful and is very costly

172
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,520
right and so i believe we need to

173
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:58,160
pivot away from that and but this is

174
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,080
quite frankly this is what we do in

175
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,039
cyber right now for the most part we're

176
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:04,560
focusing on

177
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,840
response we're focusing on you know af

178
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,319
what what a good friend of uh many of

179
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:11,919
ours mike asante would have called you

180
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:13,440
know are you sort of the right of boom

181
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,280
left of boom right we're focusing on

182
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,599
what happens after

183
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:21,680
the breach right post breach

184
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,120
run to failure is also not necessarily

185
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,280
good at handling some of the common mode

186
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,280
failures like if you have an electrical

187
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,160
surge in your plant and it comes in and

188
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,720
it wipes out all of these you know sort

189
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,759
of uh

190
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:38,800
transformers or electrical devices like

191
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,720
it's really hard to replace them all at

192
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,080
the same time

193
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,280
right so

194
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,520
um there's some common mold failure

195
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,840
issues here too

196
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,199
so

197
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:51,120
my premise right

198
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,039
this is what i was talking about a

199
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:54,879
little earlier right we

200
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:58,479
we tend to treat cyber like the run to

201
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:01,520
failure part right

202
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,240
we wait until ransomware comes into the

203
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,919
system to

204
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:09,198
respond to it

205
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,160
the legacy equipment issues that we

206
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,680
still face right

207
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,120
i am guilty i had a boss in that same

208
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,039
unnamed pulp mill

209
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:19,919
who

210
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:22,560
uh i think one of the reasons he hired

211
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,919
me is because i had come from a plant

212
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:28,000
that used the same

213
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,759
old and this was

214
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,000
hp 1000

215
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,320
hp 7906 hard drives that were 10 meg and

216
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,559
as big as a washing machine that's what

217
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:41,838
we ran our dcs on

218
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,640
he bought all the equipment from the

219
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,800
plant that i came from and had it in a

220
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,560
warehouse and i think he

221
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,279
hired me because i i was one of the few

222
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:53,839
that knew how to keep that stuff running

223
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:56,560
the vendor had obsoleted it you know 15

224
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,800
years earlier so there's this entire

225
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,440
gray market that still exists on ebay or

226
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,120
there's companies that have stood up

227
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,440
that they go around and they purchase

228
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,200
the equipment

229
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,480
from plants that are being

230
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,720
decommissioned and you know they have

231
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,399
some guy in there with a toothbrush guy

232
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:13,360
or gal

233
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,200
cleaning the boards and putting them in

234
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,720
the ultrasonic thing and spinning them

235
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,160
up and cleaning them and testing them

236
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:18,880
and

237
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,040
you know okay

238
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,680
really you will lose a hundred thousand

239
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,160
dollars a minute if your production line

240
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,800
is down but you're gonna go buy parts on

241
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,959
ebay

242
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:32,880
we're not having the right conversation

243
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,040
with with the business people here right

244
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,760
i think if the uh chief risk officer of

245
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,680
the company knew that you were doing

246
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,000
that they would figure out a way to help

247
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,040
get the

248
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,320
updates or upgrades or or uh what not

249
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,760
done right

250
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:48,800
so

251
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,880
i believe

252
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,720
that if you look at like the nist cyber

253
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,800
security framework and you look at the

254
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,040
steps that you should go through

255
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,160
um i disagree with some of the others in

256
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,560
the uh industry that

257
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,760
all of your focus should be on detection

258
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,760
and response

259
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,839
and i know cyber security hygiene is a

260
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:12,640
bad word or phrase i actually believe

261
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:15,040
that you can do an awful lot in the

262
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,320
prevention

263
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,240
category right we can do better we need

264
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,320
to do better as a community about

265
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,000
getting the

266
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,920
systematic um

267
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,079
processes in place

268
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:30,640
to be able to harden these systems so we

269
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,440
do

270
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,399
more to

271
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,560
prevent boom right left of boom kind of

272
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,880
stuff

273
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,200
okay so that was kind of the run to

274
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,760
failure piece so if i kind of make this

275
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:42,959
analogy

276
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:44,480
move forward

277
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,640
i talked about scheduled maintenance

278
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,640
preventative maintenance right something

279
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:51,600
you do on your car every five thousand

280
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,920
kilometers or three thousand miles

281
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,200
to me

282
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,120
that's no different than hiring a

283
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,000
consultant to come in every three years

284
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,079
and walk around with a clipboard

285
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:03,519
and they're going to go and open a bunch

286
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:05,600
of cabinets oh yeah that's you've got

287
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,600
this many plc's from this company and

288
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,440
this many from this company

289
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,040
and they're going to look at a few logs

290
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,000
and go around they're going to give you

291
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,959
a big fat report that costs 25 grand or

292
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:17,440
something that will gather dust on the

293
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,839
shelf until the end of time but makes

294
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:22,240
your auditor happy right

295
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,200
so you have complied with the

296
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,480
intention of whatever you know nirkship

297
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,959
or whatever regulatory uh regime that

298
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:33,200
you live under

299
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,760
but the day even before it's complete

300
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,480
it's obsolete right it doesn't really do

301
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,399
you any good from a maintenance

302
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:43,760
perspective it it it helps you satisfy

303
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,880
the the tick box i

304
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,680
i believe that in today's sort of threat

305
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:50,959
environment

306
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:51,760
that

307
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:52,959
anybody

308
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:54,240
that

309
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,760
i don't believe that that meets the due

310
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,480
diligence kind of sniff test for what

311
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,160
you should be doing

312
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,639
on a day-to-day basis to understand what

313
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:04,480
your environment looks like how to

314
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,040
defend it and and

315
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,680
you know it it served a purpose right it

316
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,839
got us to where we are now

317
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:14,720
but it it doesn't it's it's like old

318
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,079
cheese or something it doesn't really

319
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:18,800
age that well i like old cheese by the

320
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,720
way but like not the stuff in the fridge

321
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,360
that has different colors than what were

322
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,320
what it was supposed to look like right

323
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,000
so let's talk about you know doing

324
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,079
things on a proactive basis

325
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:34,720
we had this cool technology

326
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,959
when i was in industry

327
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:40,560
and these cameras cost like 30 grand or

328
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,760
something like that and you had to have

329
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,440
a special training and you had to have a

330
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,200
special person that came with you to

331
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,279
make sure you didn't break the 30 000

332
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:48,959
camera

333
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:50,880
but you took this infrared camera around

334
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,720
and we took pictures of electrical

335
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,200
switch gear we took with open switch

336
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,880
gear we would take pictures of it we

337
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,240
would look at what

338
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,480
buses were hot if there was any bolts

339
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,160
that were loose perhaps that were

340
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,800
causing some issues thermally

341
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,079
this picture is of a motor and a pump

342
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:10,079
and you can see that the motor

343
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:12,560
there's some red and some white that

344
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,639
indicates that there's a lot of heat in

345
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:18,320
that particular area of that motor

346
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,680
to place i stole the picture from

347
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:24,000
indicated that that was because the fan

348
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,320
had broken on the motor so there was no

349
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,079
cool there was no cooling happening on

350
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:30,000
that motor

351
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,800
the motor pump chain has not failed yet

352
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,800
it's still running it's the plant is

353
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,680
still running but by using a tool like

354
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,800
thermal imaging you can go look at the

355
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,360
pump and the motor and you can go oh

356
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,040
this thing is is

357
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,279
it's kind of on its last legs

358
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:49,199
so you can order

359
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:51,920
a new one you can have it sitting there

360
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,320
as a standby or a spare

361
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,920
and you can

362
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,000
program it into your next maintenance

363
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,680
schedule okay well we're going to have

364
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,600
two weeks we're going to do a turnaround

365
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,399
and we're going to replace that right

366
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:06,079
no downtime

367
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,360
less cost

368
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,600
you're not expedited shipping stuff

369
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,680
i worked for a company that sold control

370
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:12,720
valves

371
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,519
and some of the craziest i remember

372
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:18,079
chartering entire planes to put parts on

373
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:19,920
to get them to a plant

374
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,719
and you know

375
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:25,279
not being able to breathe when they told

376
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:27,600
me how many dollars i would spend you

377
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,680
spent we spent 10 times as much on

378
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,399
shipping the device as the device

379
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:35,279
actually cost and these were still like

380
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:37,040
thousands and thousands and thousands of

381
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:40,000
dollars worth of of actual parts

382
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,880
but when it's uh 100 000 a minute for

383
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,959
whatever plant you're at and that's the

384
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:46,000
cost

385
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,880
the cost of a private jet to fly that to

386
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,519
some remote place in british columbia

387
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:53,920
was was was not a big issue it was not a

388
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,920
big deal right it was like thank you you

389
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,440
did the right thing

390
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,800
but

391
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,880
this is better

392
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:01,839
okay

393
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:03,440
so

394
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,920
wouldn't it be cool if we can do that on

395
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,639
our ot assets

396
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:10,800
well so this is the tenable sponsor

397
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,639
stage so i get to talk about product

398
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:13,519
right

399
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:16,240
we can do that

400
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,880
if you went back a decade

401
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:21,680
or or so ago

402
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,680
i would have stood on the same stage and

403
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,680
i would have said you know what

404
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,000
we have a technology problem we do not

405
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,199
have

406
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:32,079
customized technology to safely and

407
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:33,519
reliably

408
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:35,759
inspect and communicate in these ot

409
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:37,839
environments right

410
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:40,160
i maintain now we have a people problem

411
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,800
we have technology that can fix this and

412
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,240
it's not just tenable there's other

413
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,399
vendors around that

414
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:49,519
we have specialized purpose-built safe

415
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:51,120
and reliable

416
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,279
methods to look inside of your

417
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:55,600
industrial control system and to help

418
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:59,120
you predict or detect when things don't

419
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,240
look right

420
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,519
i mean

421
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:04,079
look at the network traffic you can

422
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:06,560
baseline that and tell when things are

423
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,440
starting to go awry right before it

424
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,839
actually breaks you can get

425
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:15,040
indicators that there may be uh an

426
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,920
attacker or an intruder in the system

427
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,839
that you can

428
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:23,519
contain before the damage gets too big

429
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:27,199
right so i i kind of think of all this

430
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:28,399
as a

431
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:31,120
proactive you know preventative type of

432
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,199
maintenance scheme

433
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:34,480
so

434
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:37,279
we can do that at tenable through uh

435
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:39,360
passive network traffic analysis right

436
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,920
so we stick a sensor on your network or

437
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:45,040
we do a span or r-span to consume all of

438
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,440
the network traffic and we run that

439
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,000
through our passive detection engines

440
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,639
those engines are what came from indigee

441
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:54,720
when we purchased the indige company and

442
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,440
rolled that into tenable ot or it comes

443
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,000
from what used to be called pvs passive

444
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,560
vulnerability scanner or nnm which is

445
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:05,039
nessus network monitor those are the two

446
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:07,119
engines that we use to passively analyze

447
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:11,280
the traffic based on if the traffic is

448
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,480
it sort of oriented or ot or iot

449
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,400
oriented

450
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,400
that wasn't really enough

451
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,000
um in

452
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,720
a lot of these cases these devices are

453
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,039
are very quiet right they only only talk

454
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:26,880
when they're taught you know speak speak

455
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,440
when you're spoken to and so one of the

456
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,160
things the main driver for why um

457
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,840
tennable purchased syndigi was the

458
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,320
active query capabilities so we actually

459
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:39,039
have the capability to communicate using

460
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:41,360
the vendor's own protocols

461
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,720
with the plc or with the rtu

462
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:48,320
so siemens plc we ask it hello we see

463
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:51,360
your siemens plc what's your firmware

464
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,679
what's your programming like and we have

465
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:56,960
a a very safe and reliable communication

466
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,799
with it exactly the same as how siemens

467
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:01,120
does it right so that gives us very

468
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:05,039
granular detailed information

469
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,400
the other kind of i think

470
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,080
for me anyway

471
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,240
thing that makes tenable stand out

472
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:12,840
is

473
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,200
that most

474
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,480
over 50

475
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,679
they

476
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:20,480
of the assets that exist in your ot

477
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,720
environment they're actually i t assets

478
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,240
right their switches and routers and

479
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,600
windows pcs and servers and and stuff

480
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,440
like that so what we do

481
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,960
is we take the

482
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,799
uh specialized ot technology

483
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:36,400
we build a list of all of those

484
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,720
sensitive controller devices

485
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,440
and

486
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,360
we say if you're not in the list of

487
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,280
sensitive controller devices you as a

488
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:46,240
customer can now scan those other it

489
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:50,640
assets using nessus right so we have a

490
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,720
version of nessus that's included in the

491
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,520
tenable ot product line so that you can

492
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,679
basically manage both your it and your

493
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:00,400
ot assets that happen to live on the ot

494
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,960
side of the firewall

495
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:07,039
okay so that's the product pitch part

496
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,080
now

497
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,679
that and that and that was more about

498
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:11,360
asset identification device

499
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,440
classification right where we're talking

500
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,039
about how do you build this asset

501
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:16,320
inventory

502
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:19,520
the next part of sort of the maintenance

503
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,520
and this ties into kind of like the lube

504
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:24,640
oil conversation right in a machine you

505
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,880
would take a sample of the oil you would

506
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,799
run it through a testing laboratory or

507
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:30,400
you have some testing capabilities

508
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,600
yourself

509
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,080
and based on what you saw you would sort

510
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,760
of

511
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,440
predict or program in your next

512
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,960
maintenance schedule

513
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,960
well we can do that with detection right

514
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,039
so if we have passive

515
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:45,520
access to the data that's transiting

516
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,520
these ot networks

517
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,200
we can run it through a number of

518
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,799
detection engines

519
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:52,640
to be able to tell you if there's

520
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,720
anything wrong with what's going on

521
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,799
inside of these networks

522
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:58,400
tenable we do that in three different

523
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,280
ways

524
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,679
we run it through a policy engine

525
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:05,919
so very powerful engine that you as the

526
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:08,880
customer get to write the rules for we

527
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,960
have a whole set of sample rules for

528
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,159
most of the things that have been

529
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:14,240
requested over the years

530
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,480
but things like you know

531
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:19,200
if you see this default password

532
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,280
transiting on the network trip this

533
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,520
policy because we thought we had gotten

534
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,080
rid of that clear text default password

535
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,960
right so you can anything that you can

536
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,000
kind of describe in that policy language

537
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,159
we can look at as it's flying down the

538
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:35,200
wire

539
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,799
very very powerful

540
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:38,720
the second one is an anomaly-based

541
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,720
engine the anomaly-based engine is

542
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:44,320
essentially baselining all the traffic

543
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,360
and then

544
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:48,559
you can enable alerts if you deviate

545
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:52,000
from that so an example of that would be

546
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,520
i only run

547
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:57,760
ge plcs in this particular plant

548
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,880
why is some device trying to talk to me

549
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,679
in rockwell sip protocol

550
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:05,840
that could be malware right we've seen

551
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:06,960
malware

552
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,360
kits and frameworks that will go out and

553
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,760
they'll kind of walk through all the

554
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:14,159
different protocols until they find

555
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:16,720
something that answers so you should not

556
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,320
have

557
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,640
a vendor's protocol on your network that

558
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,320
you don't have that vendor's equipment

559
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,559
on your network right so we can alert on

560
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:25,440
that

561
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,200
the third one is a signature based

562
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,840
detection engine right so we're

563
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:31,440
consuming uh and we're writing our own

564
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,760
uh malware signatures to detect the

565
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:36,000
known malware that transits your network

566
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,679
so that's kind of a no-brainer that's

567
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:39,919
that's the nids kind of

568
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:42,320
approach

569
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,600
now

570
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,919
when we

571
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:51,600
built the active query capability

572
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,159
to communicate with the controllers

573
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:57,679
using their own native language

574
00:21:57,679 --> 00:21:59,280
an interesting side effect or an

575
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,840
interesting capability came to to bear

576
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,559
at the same time we found that we could

577
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:06,799
ask the controller for its logic

578
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:09,280
we can ask it for its config right

579
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,600
so if we have a

580
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,799
brockwell

581
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:15,440
plc control logics plc

582
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,640
we can say

583
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:19,520
oh hello mr rockwell plc can you please

584
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,440
send us your configuration and it will

585
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,600
give us all of its ladder logic and

586
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:26,159
configuration settings we can store that

587
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:28,320
as a snapshot

588
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:31,440
and then you can use that to

589
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,840
see any configuration changes that have

590
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:34,960
been made

591
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:37,520
now i know and i'm not purporting to be

592
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:40,080
like an asset management system right

593
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,640
you can buy those capabilities from

594
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,320
individual vendors

595
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:47,039
we have manufacturers that have

596
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:49,360
20 different kinds of plc's in their

597
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,120
environment and

598
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,720
there are very few

599
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,880
solutions that let you kind of track

600
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:58,799
changes in one place on all of those

601
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:01,280
different devices so we have some of our

602
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,039
customers that this is one of the most

603
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:04,480
important features

604
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,400
they almost could care less about the

605
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:09,760
security parts of our security product

606
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:12,400
they're using it to track kind of rogue

607
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,480
changes it's like well why is my product

608
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,880
off spec it's like oh well somebody at 2

609
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:19,200
am changed this parameter from this to

610
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,360
this and now the robot is moving

611
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:24,080
different and so this product is is kind

612
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:27,120
of quality skewed because of that

613
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:30,480
and so uh this is a pretty powerful uh

614
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,960
capability that is

615
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,799
i think one of the

616
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:37,840
capabilities that appeals to the ot

617
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,679
engineering side of the house right so

618
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:41,279
we always talk about this

619
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:44,000
challenge between the

620
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,400
information technology people the i.t

621
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,720
people and the ot people

622
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,039
well we've found that it's very useful

623
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:53,679
to have features and capabilities that

624
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:55,840
appeal to each of those different

625
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:58,960
audiences so yep lots of security stuff

626
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,559
but guess what there's also some

627
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:02,320
hardcore maintenance kind of

628
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:03,760
productivity

629
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:06,880
features here as well

630
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,080
so

631
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,919
in summary

632
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:13,919
if you go back to the premise of my

633
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:14,799
talk

634
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:17,039
i believe that we

635
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:19,760
treat are

636
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:22,480
highly critical so i i still believe

637
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,799
that the control system

638
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:26,960
is one of the most critical assets you

639
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,120
have in the plant right

640
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:31,360
and i think i know this because i used

641
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,400
to wear

642
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,039
pagers and radios and two-way radios and

643
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:37,120
cell phones and all this stuff and at 2

644
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,200
am when something broke because the

645
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,760
control system broke it was marty's body

646
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,840
that started to buzz and vibrate and

647
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:46,000
ding and there was literally a two-way

648
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,440
radio on my

649
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,480
desk

650
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,559
my bed stand right

651
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:53,120
so if they're that important why

652
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,760
why do we just wait till they break

653
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,159
and that can be physically breaking if

654
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:00,159
you're using legacy equipment and then a

655
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:02,000
card fails or you have some sort of

656
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,640
hardware failure in your system i mean

657
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:07,279
we used to fight like oh your c drive is

658
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:08,400
full

659
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,159
right we filled the hard disk up with a

660
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:12,840
log and so the control system stopped

661
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:15,679
working why do we wait for that failure

662
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:18,320
to happen why do we wait for breach to

663
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,559
happen why do we wait for ransomware to

664
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:22,320
get in the system before we actually

665
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,840
start to

666
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:26,480
apply defensive techniques i mean you

667
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,480
know that ransomware operators for the

668
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,960
most part they're not going burn in zero

669
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,279
days on on ransomware right they're

670
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:35,679
using vulnerabilities that are published

671
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:38,480
known and have been around for like

672
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,679
years

673
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:42,799
well if you know that why aren't you

674
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:44,640
doing some basic vulnerability

675
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:47,039
management practices to avoid the

676
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:49,120
ransomware trap right

677
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:52,960
so if you get into a more proactive

678
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:55,279
monitoring regime

679
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:57,840
in these systems i maintain that we can

680
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,919
we can run it like a piece of physical

681
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:02,960
equipment we have an economic sweet spot

682
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,799
you can over invest right that's the

683
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:06,960
right hand side of the curve

684
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,799
but there is a sweet spot in the middle

685
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:11,919
that you can use that will save you

686
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:13,440
money

687
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,480
so

688
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,799
that's my that's my pitch

689
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:19,360
uh thank you for coming and i'm happy to

690
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:22,240
take a few questions

691
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,480
or a lot of questions yes and they're

692
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,559
going to have a mic run runner because

693
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:28,480
this is being recorded so we have a

694
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,200
question up here

695
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:35,520
there's a mic that's on its way

696
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,559
just hold your hand up so he knows where

697
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:39,600
you're where you're coming from there

698
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:42,240
you go hi thanks man um you did mention

699
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,480
about the animal detection that you had

700
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,400
and you you said that you needed to have

701
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:49,120
a baseline established to detect anomaly

702
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:51,760
yeah is that a baseline um

703
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,520
is that something that a plan manager

704
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,279
would said or is that something like a

705
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:57,120
machine learning driven baseline that

706
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,720
kind of learns it's going to be

707
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,880
something that that's learned by the

708
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,880
product right so the product is going to

709
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:05,919
sit there and gather that data and then

710
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:08,400
you can set the parameters of how you're

711
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,880
going to flag for that so a great

712
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,400
question okay

713
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,679
dr

714
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:15,520
conklin

715
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:18,159
we talked about this briefly yesterday

716
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:19,520
i think it was yesterday it was in the

717
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:20,799
sun

718
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:22,799
and that is if i have a plant and i've

719
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:26,080
got 16 pumps and 42 valves and all that

720
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,480
and these things require greasing and

721
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,840
turning on and off and various

722
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,919
maintenance activities i know how many

723
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:33,760
people it takes to do that maintenance

724
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:36,080
and i can set up a work schedule it says

725
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,600
on thursday you're going to do this on

726
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,120
tuesday

727
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,039
why can't we do the same with all our

728
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:43,600
cyber assets and go to the next level

729
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,039
and say

730
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:47,039
for me to maintain

731
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:48,799
this control system

732
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:50,880
it requires this much time for this as

733
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:53,200
much time for this this person for this

734
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,039
this person for that

735
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:56,640
put it all in the spreadsheet because

736
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,159
excel is the second best tool for

737
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:00,080
anything you want to do

738
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:02,240
and ship it off to the boss and say

739
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,640
that's what i need next year yeah it's

740
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:07,120
it's a great qu great conversation that

741
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,039
we had you know i think when you have

742
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:12,080
better data that can come out of your

743
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:14,320
environment your systems you do have

744
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:17,279
better justification or actual work

745
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:18,799
schedules right i mean we were talking

746
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:21,679
about sort of the navy context where

747
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:24,000
every single thing you do has

748
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,799
as an sop that tells you you need these

749
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:29,600
parts you need these people with this

750
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,440
training and it's going to take you this

751
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,760
many minutes to do you know each kind of

752
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,039
task

753
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:37,120
there's no reason we can't get there in

754
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,960
in kind of the cyber security space

755
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:42,720
right where we have defined the roles

756
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:45,440
the responsibilities the specific job

757
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:48,399
training requirements etc so i i believe

758
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:50,720
we can get there and i think that

759
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,080
having better

760
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,399
insight and visibility into these

761
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:56,840
networks gives us

762
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:59,760
um a better i don't want to use the word

763
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,840
argument it gives us a better case to go

764
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:04,799
to management and leadership and say

765
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:07,039
you've asked me to do this i need this

766
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:09,200
many people to do this job and if you

767
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,279
remember when i opened the conversation

768
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:12,799
i said you know i used to argue that it

769
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:14,399
was a technology problem we don't have

770
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:16,480
the tech i think we have the tech it's a

771
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,640
people problem now so

772
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,720
that's great question art

773
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,880
any other questions

774
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,720
thanks for coming i i want to let you

775
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:27,520
know that uh the closing session on the

776
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:30,240
tenable stage today was going to be our

777
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:33,679
cto glenn penley who can't make it and i

778
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:35,679
acknowledge andrew there so i'll be

779
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:37,279
replacing glenn so if you like to hear

780
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:39,200
marty talk come back here at i think

781
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,240
it's two

782
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:42,000
i think it's andrew in the lights over

783
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,320
there go ahead mr ginter

784
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,679
oh i was i was gonna ask you another

785
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:47,919
question yes um i love the the

786
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:50,080
maintenance analogy that uh

787
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,640
to me an issue with the with the analogy

788
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:53,440
is

789
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,760
a lot of the maintenance statistics look

790
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:58,080
backwards when things fail we break them

791
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,840
we replace them we have numbers for how

792
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:02,320
much this cost us and so when we go to

793
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:04,080
the the business decision makers and say

794
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:06,159
i want a different maintenance system i

795
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:07,840
want you to spend 2 million on a

796
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,919
predictive maintenance system they ask

797
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:12,320
where's the roi and we can give them the

798
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:15,440
roi based on historical failures

799
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,120
the problem is in the cyberspace we

800
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:19,520
don't often have the average site

801
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:23,520
doesn't have 27 historical failures with

802
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,720
well-known you know well-understood

803
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,640
costs when when we get the question

804
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,640
what's the roi for this security we're

805
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,880
looking forward not backward how do we

806
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:33,039
answer that yeah so it's a great

807
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:34,320
question

808
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,080
i think we're in a lot better place than

809
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:38,399
we were like say even two years ago i

810
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:40,960
think the proliferation of ransomware i

811
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:43,919
think extremely well publicized and

812
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:45,600
analyzed events like the colonial

813
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:48,960
pipeline or maersk shipping or jbs meets

814
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,880
or any one of a number of these big

815
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,919
ransomware events are giving us enough

816
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:54,880
data

817
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:57,679
to be able to say hey i know this wasn't

818
00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:01,039
our plant but if it was

819
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:03,679
can we calculate what the cost would

820
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:05,679
have been for us to

821
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:08,640
respond be offline for a week etc etc

822
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:11,200
etc and so i think we i think you can

823
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:14,000
build a much stronger argument i also

824
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,279
maintain

825
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:17,120
that especially with some of the

826
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:19,279
configuration control aspects where

827
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:21,919
we're we're helping you track what's

828
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:24,240
happening inside the controllers and any

829
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,279
changes

830
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:28,000
there's there's it's it's

831
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,799
that helps with being able to prevent

832
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:32,399
downtime right so this is some of the

833
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:35,200
downtime avoidance conversation and it's

834
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,440
not just a cyber based it's not just a

835
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:40,640
security-based conversation anymore it's

836
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:43,120
a conversation about the overall health

837
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:45,840
of this asset right so i think we have

838
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,600
much better data

839
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,600
yes every company probably doesn't have

840
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:52,399
it but if you've been dealing in cyber

841
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:54,240
insurance at all guess what they're

842
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,240
asking you the same questions so if you

843
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:58,480
get the right people the risk officer

844
