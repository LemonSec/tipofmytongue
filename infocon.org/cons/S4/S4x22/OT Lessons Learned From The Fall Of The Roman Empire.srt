1
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,680
thank you this is the classic literature

2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,920
and history conference correct in the

3
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:11,599
right place

4
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:13,200
no i promise i'm not going to do a big

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,799
long history thing here but there's just

6
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:17,680
some interesting uh some parallels i

7
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,520
think that we can draw upon as we're

8
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,400
thinking about securing our ot assets

9
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:23,359
so

10
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:25,439
over the course of history there were

11
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:28,400
three primary occasions when rome was

12
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:29,439
sacked

13
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:31,840
beginning in uh 387 when the gauls were

14
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,440
the first successful one after the

15
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,440
creation of the roman empire

16
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,040
to sack rome

17
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,960
the one that is kind of generally

18
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,520
acknowledged as the end of the western

19
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,680
roman empire was an actually four that's

20
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,760
475 but it was in 476 the ostrogoths now

21
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,760
the eastern empire lived on for many

22
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,399
many you know many years after that many

23
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:54,960
hundreds of years that is generally the

24
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,480
end of you know the roman empire

25
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,640
so

26
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:03,440
that was from the wrong way here we go

27
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,799
so

28
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:06,400
what the heck

29
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,720
has that got to do with control system

30
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,720
cyber security

31
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,360
well first let's talk about how rome

32
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,600
kind of went and how it how it became to

33
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:16,560
be

34
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,920
rome started as a small city state

35
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,680
and through a series of one might call

36
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,119
mergers and acquisitions it grew

37
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:27,200
substantially

38
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,840
and it became maybe till this day the

39
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,759
most multicultural

40
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:34,079
society in the world

41
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:36,240
by the time of its fall there were

42
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,479
people from all over the empire doing

43
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:39,920
all kinds of different things speaking

44
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,280
different languages and different

45
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,399
cultures

46
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:44,399
similar societies never happened again

47
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:46,479
until many hundreds of years

48
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:48,798
later

49
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:50,880
think about

50
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,040
industrial control systems

51
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,640
they started with one little computer

52
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,119
doing some stuff over time

53
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:58,960
and organically this thing has just

54
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,719
grown i'm sorry one last thing about

55
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:03,600
rome is that ultimately while it grew to

56
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,200
be that big

57
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,479
essentially it just became overstretched

58
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,959
it was it just was not sustainable in

59
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:13,840
regards to a government structure

60
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,959
similarly ot it all began we used to

61
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:18,959
have pneumatic you know control panels

62
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:21,360
then came in digital control and then it

63
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,400
just grew

64
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,840
over time

65
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,160
basic process control systems and safety

66
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,959
systems and plc's and optimizers and all

67
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:30,480
that stuff is oftentimes been put in a

68
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,200
plant it's been there for 40 50 60 years

69
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,680
it's very common you walk into a plant

70
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,920
in the basic process control system is

71
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,080
literally 40 years old

72
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,519
talking to an optimizer that might be

73
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:44,160
input in last week and so is this very

74
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,920
diverse atmosphere it's getting worse

75
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:51,760
iiot iot convergence let's put in more

76
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,000
sensors and get all kinds of information

77
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,800
the business is demanding more data

78
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,319
from these systems to manage the

79
00:02:58,319 --> 00:02:59,920
business

80
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,159
just like the roman empire

81
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:03,599
i submit as we're trying to protect

82
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:04,879
these systems

83
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:07,599
we're getting overstretched

84
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:09,200
the second thing is

85
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,120
why did they attack in the first place

86
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,239
why why why was it sacked main reason he

87
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:15,760
was there

88
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,599
those first attacks on rome were not

89
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:19,760
about destroying rome

90
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,680
it was about basically taking it over

91
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,400
for its riches at the time

92
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,239
when the gauls first

93
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:29,120
invaded and successfully sacked rome

94
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,200
by that time in the empire the way

95
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,200
secession happened between emperors was

96
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,799
two or three guys would say i'm the

97
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:36,560
emperor and whoever had the strongest

98
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,159
legions won

99
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:40,239
those legions had all kinds of people

100
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:42,000
from all over the empire also many

101
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,200
people said wait a minute here why

102
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,360
should i just sit by for this

103
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,120
i got a better legion they do let's go

104
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,200
i'll take this thing over so ultimately

105
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,480
it was a big fat meaty prize

106
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,959
full of riches it was there and so

107
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:58,080
ultimately it led to its downfall

108
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,680
well let's think about

109
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,920
critical infrastructure sizza has

110
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,560
defined 16 industries as critical uh to

111
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,120
the well-being of our society from food

112
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,239
and agriculture and energy and you know

113
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:11,920
dams etc i'm not going to list them all

114
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,280
here

115
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,439
that is a big fat

116
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:18,320
overextended juicy target

117
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,238
whether it be from nation states trying

118
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:23,040
to disrupt society for whatever purposes

119
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,199
certainly criminal enterprises have

120
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,919
realized i can make a heck of a lot more

121
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:29,360
money sticking ransomware on these

122
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,600
system than grandma's pc

123
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,440
and so these are big fat juicy targets

124
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,440
that are frankly under attack and so

125
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,520
just like rome we have very overextended

126
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,000
systems that grew over time

127
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,320
we also have a very meaty target

128
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,240
so what do we do

129
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,600
what do we do

130
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,520
ultimately

131
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,320
i believe that in order to get cyber

132
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,919
security the right place we really have

133
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:56,880
to focus on resiliency what does

134
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,479
resiliency mean

135
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:00,720
basically resiliency is the recognition

136
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,120
you're going to get punched in the face

137
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,199
and how well can you recover these

138
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:07,360
systems will be attacked it's going to

139
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,360
happen the question is can you take the

140
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,120
punch can you react to it can you

141
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,600
minimize the downtime um and can you get

142
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,680
back up off the map and recover and

143
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,280
that's ultimately what we have to do

144
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,639
from a security perspective i want to

145
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:20,479
talk more about that as we go through

146
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:22,840
the rest of the

147
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,440
presentation so certainly there are

148
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,360
challenges and if you've been coming to

149
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,680
this conference for a number of years as

150
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,199
i have

151
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:33,039
none of these things that are challenges

152
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:35,360
to cyber security are new

153
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,199
some we've made some progress on some we

154
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:38,800
haven't how many years have we been

155
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,800
talking about we have to get a good

156
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,160
inventory dale talked about our first

157
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,280
time you know this morning in his

158
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,960
keynote we're still talking about we

159
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,880
need a better inventory and i completely

160
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,800
agree but ultimately it's still a

161
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,639
challenge for us

162
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:52,000
understanding how to do vulnerabilities

163
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,440
we all know you can't patch everything

164
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,600
in ot and all those issues out there we

165
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,440
still haven't solved that problem

166
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,759
managing the configuration of these

167
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,280
devices is a big challenge i'm going to

168
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,880
talk more about that a little bit later

169
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,400
but the end of the day

170
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,840
all this is about risk

171
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,840
it's about risk management

172
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,840
and getting our security to the point

173
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,840
where we feel comfortable yep i can

174
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,000
operate these facilities i've reduced

175
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,560
the risk to an acceptable level

176
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,720
we cannot take the risk to zero although

177
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,199
actually we can i do have a solution i

178
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:26,639
can 100

179
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:27,759
solve

180
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:29,600
the ot cyber security problem without

181
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,240
shutting the plants down

182
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,080
we rip out digital control and we go

183
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,919
back to panel boards

184
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:38,240
i promise you they are not hackable

185
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,520
now

186
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,199
screwdrivers and crescent wrenches will

187
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:43,280
kill you i've made a lot of mistakes

188
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,039
with those way way way back in the day

189
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:46,639
but my point is i'm being i'm joking

190
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:48,400
here we're not going back to that

191
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,680
so we're going to have to manage this

192
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,319
risk there's a chip monitoring a process

193
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:53,520
someone can get to it there's a

194
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,599
potential problem

195
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:57,680
so let's talk a little bit more about

196
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,639
risk

197
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:00,160
and what that means from an ot security

198
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,560
perspective well simply risk

199
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,840
is equal to

200
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,199
likelihood times consequence

201
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:09,360
the higher those two factors are the

202
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,160
more risk that you are going to have

203
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,479
on the likelihood side things like the

204
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:16,160
vulnerabilities that exist on the

205
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,800
network what threats may be either

206
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,440
lurking or potentially lurking out there

207
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,599
what vulnerabilities currently are known

208
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:26,319
to be exploited what is connectivity

209
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:28,479
zones and conduits and coming out and

210
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:30,720
then ultimately always

211
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,560
the weakest link is the people someone

212
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,840
clicking on the wrong email doing the

213
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,599
wrong thing setting up the wrong

214
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:38,160
configuration these are always factors

215
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,400
and they all increase

216
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,840
the probability of an

217
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,840
attack consequence so someone gets in

218
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,440
they do something what bad things can

219
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,280
happen that is consequence

220
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,280
things like if we're lucky unplanned

221
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,680
downtime that's not good but it's not

222
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,840
the worst possible thing equipment

223
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,280
damage

224
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,599
safety incidents brand reputation having

225
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:01,599
to pay the darn ransom these are all

226
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:02,800
potential

227
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,319
consequences

228
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:07,039
from a successful cyber attack

229
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:09,680
what i submit is that

230
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,400
i believe as an industry

231
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,479
we have focused

232
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:15,599
more

233
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:18,080
on the likelihood side of the equation

234
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,520
than on the consequent side of the

235
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,160
equation but it is a factor

236
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,840
and at some point

237
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,000
we better address the consequent side

238
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
and make sure we can reduce the

239
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,680
consequences associated with cyber

240
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,000
attacks if we're going to continue

241
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,760
making risk

242
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:37,679
getting risk to an acceptable level

243
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:40,479
so at the end of the day

244
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:42,559
you're not going to protect

245
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,880
your way out of this cyber security

246
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,040
issue it's just not going to happen uh

247
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,240
there's just way too many things that

248
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,920
can happen we can minimize it by the end

249
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,040
of the day

250
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,519
we're going to have to be able to better

251
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:56,240
improve our resiliency and reduce the

252
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,200
consequent side of the equation

253
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,240
so

254
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,240
the galls are at the gate

255
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,560
they're attacking they're having at it

256
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,920
what the heck are we going to do about

257
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,279
it well you know what

258
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:08,640
on that wall

259
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,880
you have a multi-function team i got

260
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,800
pikeman i got guys with swords i got

261
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,200
archers i got guys pulling boiling pitch

262
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,760
i've got a multi-functioned team

263
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,959
to repel the attackers

264
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:22,160
same thing if we're dealing with

265
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,360
security incident i better have a

266
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:27,360
multi-functional team to deal with this

267
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,120
certainly i need security professionals

268
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,800
people understand you know how people

269
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,720
attack and what they do i need people

270
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,080
that understand the networks and how

271
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,120
things are there and how things are

272
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,600
designed i.t professionals

273
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,040
i'm going to talk about this quite a bit

274
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,880
more if you don't have a control

275
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,800
engineer on that wall with you

276
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,080
you're going to have a problem

277
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,040
we'll talk more about that we're going

278
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,720
to get very specific here shortly in a

279
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:50,399
in a real type of scenario for an attack

280
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,000
what do they need to do their job if

281
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,120
they're just up there with the different

282
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,399
teams they need their bows and arrows

283
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:56,399
and everything else what do they need to

284
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:58,959
do this job well first and foremost they

285
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:01,920
better have been trained how do respond

286
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,839
to an attack who do i call who gets up

287
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:06,079
on that wall how what do we do

288
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:07,120
and they should have gone through

289
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,200
tabletop exercises to make sure that we

290
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,480
are prepared we've been trained we're

291
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,920
good to go the armor's been trained not

292
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,000
just pulled out of bed and here's your

293
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,720
sword go fight

294
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,920
they need other tools as well though

295
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,040
certainly they're going to have to have

296
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,560
you know network traffic analysis we can

297
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,600
figure out what's been going on within

298
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,839
the networks i know the event data that

299
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:25,360
may have flowed you know before during

300
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,279
and after the attack i better have

301
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:29,519
network maps and inventory that word

302
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:31,200
again of all the stuff that is out there

303
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,279
so i can know what you know where where

304
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:34,560
things may be

305
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,399
i need the vulnerability information in

306
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:37,680
regards to wait a minute here these

307
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:38,880
vulnerabilities exist it could be

308
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,880
they're attacking this and you know get

309
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,880
af get after different ways i should

310
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,560
have some good threat intelligence hey

311
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,240
this looks similar to things that have

312
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,920
happened over here

313
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,720
but also very important is you need and

314
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,160
this is where the control engineer comes

315
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:52,880
in

316
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,079
detailed configuration information and

317
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:57,839
forensic change analysis i'm going to

318
00:10:57,839 --> 00:10:59,440
show you an example here of how an

319
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,040
attack can lead to

320
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,640
really bad things by getting the

321
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,680
configuration of that device

322
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,079
finally the worst case scenario really

323
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:09,920
bad whether it be ransomware or gosh

324
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,519
thing has gone too far

325
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:14,560
i need a trusted restore point and let

326
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,160
me tell you what i mean by that

327
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:19,519
trusted restore point is not a backup

328
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:21,600
control systems are not like a computer

329
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,600
where i can you know ghost it put it on

330
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,399
the shelf oop not good wipe it clean put

331
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:28,720
it back on control systems don't work

332
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,720
that way oftentimes there isn't a backup

333
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,399
you can just load and go

334
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:34,640
before you turn it on

335
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,160
there could have been changes made that

336
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,760
oh my gosh i mean i can cause a real

337
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,360
problem if i turn the key and turn that

338
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,760
plant on that could cause a real problem

339
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,680
you need a very detailed here is the

340
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,440
configuration before here's the

341
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,680
configuration after will this plan

342
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,839
operate properly through that startup to

343
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:52,639
make sure yep i can do this thing so

344
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:54,959
backup and recovery

345
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:57,120
in the traditional sense doesn't work in

346
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,000
ot

347
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
trusted restore point with a complete

348
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,399
understanding of the configuration

349
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:04,000
and is it the right configuration for

350
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,800
startup is critical to approving

351
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,120
resiliency to make sure that i can

352
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,959
recover from the punch that we just took

353
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:14,320
so let me look at this in a bit more

354
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,320
detail

355
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,399
i'm going to walk you through an example

356
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:20,399
this is a typical process this is an

357
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:22,880
ethylene cracking furnace ethylene is

358
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,880
the basic building block for

359
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,399
many of the plastics that are in this

360
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:27,839
room today that implement leads to

361
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:29,120
polyethylene

362
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,680
how do you make ethylene

363
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,519
well basically what you do is you have a

364
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:34,480
furnace

365
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:37,200
what is a furnace it's a big giant box

366
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,079
of fire that box of fire is fed through

367
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:42,240
fuel and inlet air at the bottom

368
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,560
to heat up that furnace

369
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,160
on the inside of that furnace there's a

370
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,079
big set of tubes

371
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:50,320
those inlets include the hydrocarbon

372
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,000
feed it could be ethane or other things

373
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:52,880
that you're going to use there's

374
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,480
different ways to make ethylene and

375
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,600
steam

376
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,399
what happens is is that you mix

377
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:00,880
basically hydrocarbon and steam you heat

378
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,880
it up like crazy in the chemical

379
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,519
reaction takes place

380
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:07,040
a couple interesting things about this

381
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,480
number one

382
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,000
is that

383
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,160
the um

384
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,440
the

385
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,040
you think about the these tubes that are

386
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,880
in there where this is this is basically

387
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,279
rushing through okay at the end of the

388
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:22,000
day what's coming out of the back end

389
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,000
is hydrocarbon that's at 1400 degrees

390
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,519
fahrenheit

391
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:29,440
if anyone can tell me how to make this

392
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,959
process 100

393
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:32,959
safe i'm looking forward to hearing it

394
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:37,040
it is inherently risky to make ethylene

395
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,399
second thing

396
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:40,399
where that stuff does tubes where the

397
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:42,880
hydrocarbon is going through it's a very

398
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,880
basically a little thin wall of metal

399
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,760
why is that let's make a thicker tube

400
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,120
the reason we want to do that is this

401
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,680
this reaction is highly endothermic what

402
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,199
that means is i need a lot of heat

403
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:54,720
getting in to make the reaction happen

404
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,120
where's that heat come from that's fire

405
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,480
going against those tubes to make this

406
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,160
thing really really really hot

407
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:03,760
if you overheat those tubes they fail

408
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:07,040
how do you keep the tubes cold enough

409
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,920
you shove enough hydrocarbon through

410
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,600
which is the cooling agent while it's

411
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,519
going through its reaction

412
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,360
that's what keeps it cool enough if you

413
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,160
slow down the flow too much the tubes

414
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,000
could potentially fail you can also get

415
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,760
bad product and everything else so my

416
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,680
point is is that essentially how do you

417
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,279
make ethylene

418
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:28,240
you essentially have a controlled bomb

419
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,240
and make sure it doesn't explode and pop

420
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,839
ethylene on the back end

421
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:34,480
okay that's what it is

422
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,279
all right

423
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:36,079
so

424
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:38,079
let's talk a little bit oh gosh

425
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:39,839
and then there's all the control strains

426
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:41,440
you got to balance the fuel air ratio

427
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,360
and the you know a lot of constraints

428
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,560
you have to manage make sure you're not

429
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,720
making too many other products if you

430
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,399
leave the resident time too long you

431
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:49,600
make the wrong stuff let's not get into

432
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,959
all that

433
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:52,639
so uh oh

434
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:54,079
three o'clock in the morning got some

435
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:56,399
suspicious activity

436
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:58,079
we could be having a cyber attack that

437
00:14:58,079 --> 00:14:59,680
could potentially impact this unit what

438
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,680
the heck we're going to do about it

439
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,519
well let's get the team on the wall

440
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:04,720
let's go to work let's figure out what

441
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,839
we're going to do to mitigate the

442
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:08,320
situation and try and minimize it

443
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,160
so let's first start with eventually

444
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,320
i'll call it the entry point for the for

445
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,639
the cyber experts for you know network

446
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:16,079
engineers etc the first thing is i

447
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:18,720
better have sort of environmental and

448
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,360
connectivity context all right what are

449
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,279
the network maps what are the inventory

450
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:24,320
what are the

451
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,720
what traffic is taking place what

452
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,399
vulnerabilities exist out there that

453
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:30,560
could potentially be exploited that's

454
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,519
the basic context that i need okay

455
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:35,839
and that red box you see there on the

456
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:37,680
the lower right that would be a

457
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,759
potentially a computer that is connected

458
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:41,839
to a in this case a distributed control

459
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:43,360
system

460
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,800
now

461
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,959
going deeper understanding what that

462
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:49,120
distributed control system is

463
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,880
once you get to that distributed control

464
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,279
system you start to run into a whole

465
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:55,040
bunch of things that run the process

466
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,360
that are potentially do not even have an

467
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,759
ip address especially for older dcs

468
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:01,199
systems different types of network

469
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:03,839
things they can receive information

470
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,199
from your basic computers your

471
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:06,639
engineering stations and everything else

472
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:08,160
more on that here in a minute but you

473
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,440
can do a whole bunch of things down

474
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,120
there which is where you actually

475
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,279
control that process of your controlled

476
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:14,720
bomb to make sure it's not going to

477
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,959
explode that if you do the wrong things

478
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:20,880
down there really bad things happen

479
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,720
so what i'm kind of showing you here is

480
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,000
now we're down in the control system

481
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,680
you've got controllers and io cards and

482
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,440
all the stuff that is down there that's

483
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,759
actually running the process but oh

484
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:32,800
someone has made a change

485
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,880
to the configuration

486
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,399
of one of these things that are down

487
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:37,199
there

488
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:38,480
so what is it

489
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,560
and what do we do about it well this is

490
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,680
really

491
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:42,800
really

492
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,560
where the control engineer is going to

493
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:47,120
be critical to understanding what the

494
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,120
change is do i care and do we do

495
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,120
something about it i know this is kind

496
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,199
of a very like a bunch of spaghetti but

497
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:54,880
let me explain what you're looking at

498
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,880
this is a graphical representation of

499
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,279
the control strategy for a flow

500
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:01,360
controller maybe it's the

501
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,360
maybe it's the inlet into the whether it

502
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,199
be the fuel or whether it be the um you

503
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:06,720
know the input to the furnace that we

504
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,319
just talked about

505
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,240
begins on the left with the transmitters

506
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,839
in this case there's a

507
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:13,679
you know this this uh you might be

508
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:15,359
whatever rosemont whatever transmitter

509
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:17,359
and then it feeds into an i o card that

510
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:19,679
goes into basically the basic

511
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:21,839
fundamental of the control a flow

512
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:23,679
controller that's based in inside the

513
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:26,079
dcs system and the control logic block

514
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:28,559
that makes it work it has lots of other

515
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:30,720
inputs and outputs as well

516
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,400
on the right and the one thing at level

517
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,480
two this may be feeding information to

518
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,640
historian for used for it but on the

519
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,080
lower right

520
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:40,480
that is connection into an advanced

521
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:43,360
process control system

522
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:46,480
that thing has read write capabilities

523
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,799
it wants to know hey what the process is

524
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,880
and it sends a signal back out to that

525
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:54,720
thing called fc 001 to tell it do what i

526
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:55,840
want to do because i'm trying to make

527
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,240
more product that's a great avenue to

528
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,080
make changes to make really bad things

529
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,320
happen that i don't want other things i

530
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,520
could i could make changes and other

531
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,640
things as well but i'm just showing an

532
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,240
example of the level of complexity you

533
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,120
get to

534
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,480
when you get down to it's not just as

535
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,760
simple as all there's a block down there

536
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,919
doing something this stuff gets complex

537
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:14,080
and meaty and nasty that control

538
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,160
engineer better have this information in

539
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,760
real time what am i going to do what am

540
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,679
i going to do about it and i suggest

541
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:21,600
that the you know

542
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,400
this is why you need this

543
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,000
multifunctional team when we get down to

544
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,840
this layer the control engineer is going

545
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,760
to be invaluable as respond at three

546
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,280
o'clock in the morning what are we gonna

547
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,640
do about it

548
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,320
but oh my gosh

549
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,320
there was a change made

550
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,760
and it gets down into the really

551
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,160
nitty-gritty so we're looking now at a

552
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:41,120
subset of the configuration of the logic

553
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,200
that decides what that control valve is

554
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,480
going to do

555
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:47,039
and in this case this is a change made

556
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:49,120
to the gain setting

557
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,200
basically what gain is what gain setting

558
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,799
is is basically if i want to respond

559
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,400
open the valve up really far or really

560
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,760
short depending upon the command it's

561
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,520
best way i can describe it

562
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,840
by changing that i can have a dramatic

563
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:00,880
effect

564
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,480
on the flow that's going to go through

565
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,840
that furnace whether it's the fuel or

566
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,080
whether it is the feed the old value was

567
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:09,840
0.41 and the new value was 0.7 by making

568
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,760
that change and potentially some other

569
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,240
changes maybe to alarm settings

570
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,840
i could start to affect that flow i

571
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,440
talked about going into the tube which

572
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,520
is the coolant that ultimately can lead

573
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,960
to a failure

574
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,000
now

575
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,200
the scenario that i just ran you through

576
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,880
i can't cite a cyber attack before that

577
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,160
you know someone has had this level of

578
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,760
knowledge

579
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,520
but i can cite several incidents where

580
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,200
this stuff actually led to explosions

581
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,640
okay control problems that actually led

582
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,360
to

583
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:38,160
to explosions and ethylene furnaces okay

584
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,320
but the point that i'm trying to make

585
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,679
is that

586
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:44,400
our adversaries are getting smart if you

587
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,360
look at some recent attacks where

588
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,480
they're between ukraine and everything

589
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,240
else the first thing they figured out

590
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,559
was infiltration how to get in

591
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:52,640
the next thing they figured out is what

592
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,720
are these devices down there before they

593
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,240
were just like big giant black boxes

594
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,919
they had no idea what the thing was and

595
00:19:57,919 --> 00:19:59,840
they've been figuring that out the third

596
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:02,480
thing they've learned is process context

597
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:05,200
what is down below there they i mean you

598
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,720
hear stories of they brought in chemical

599
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,720
engineers to understand the process

600
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,440
underneath and what to go get if they

601
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,280
want to go get it

602
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:16,640
okay so in order to meet that attack

603
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,640
we better have the right people on the

604
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,559
wall that can respond

605
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:21,919
and give them all the tools they need to

606
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:24,320
do so because ultimately

607
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,760
if my

608
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,280
intent

609
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,440
is to do damage

610
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:32,559
cause physical harm

611
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:33,919
i'm probably going to change the

612
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:37,120
configuration or the logic or the brains

613
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:40,158
that drives the process

614
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,559
so

615
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,039
what can we conclude

616
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:47,280
well i hope we all agree and you're here

617
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,039
today critical infrastructure is a

618
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:50,559
target if it wasn't we wouldn't be here

619
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:51,840
we'd be we'd be at the history

620
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,760
conference that i guess i'm late for a

621
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,840
little bit later

622
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:58,480
you will be attacked it is inevitable

623
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,559
it's not a matter of if it is a matter

624
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:02,880
of when the question is because they are

625
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,679
overextended and vulnerable

626
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:07,440
this is a risk game

627
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,080
we must be able to reduce risk we are

628
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,840
never going to take risk to zero the

629
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,840
process underneath are hazardous

630
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:16,240
the systems have computer chips they are

631
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,400
accessible

632
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,480
you have to improve or make sure that as

633
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,640
a part of your incident response team

634
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,559
you have deep forensic analysis of

635
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:27,440
configuration changes and ultimately

636
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,840
with trusted restore points have the

637
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:30,880
ability

638
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,280
to recover as quickly as you can at the

639
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,280
end of the day

640
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,799
if i'm an owner operator and i'm

641
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:39,440
operating plan my demand of the my

642
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,880
demand of the security team is not

643
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,320
prevent all attacks

644
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,080
my demand would be is if something bad

645
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,039
happens

646
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:46,720
we can go on the news and say that i'm

647
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,960
really sorry uh we've taken the proper

648
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,039
steps and we'll be back online within

649
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:52,960
three days or four days or whatever the

650
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,799
case may be that's probably the best

651
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:56,000
that we can get to from a risk

652
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,240
perspective

653
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,919
okay

654
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:02,400
so uh that's really it for i had my my

655
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,720
conversation today uh before i conclude

656
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:05,840
i want to open it up does anyone have

657
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:08,400
any questions or thoughts or

658
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:11,400
comments

659
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:15,280
yes sir david hi mark do you think i

660
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,960
just have a general question

661
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,600
uh i sincerely accept your point about

662
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,760
uh having a control engineer in your

663
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:24,640
cyber response team uh but in general

664
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,400
practice beyond the

665
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,559
trusted restore point there's probably a

666
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:31,200
startup sequence pre-programmed yep and

667
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,440
even probably a specialized safety

668
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,760
shutdown sequence where appropriate yep

669
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,760
so do you need a process engineer in

670
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,000
that room too yeah i mean it i i

671
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,200
probably should have i could have said

672
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,880
process slash control engineer they're

673
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,880
certainly going to be required right and

674
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,799
some some in some places they're one in

675
