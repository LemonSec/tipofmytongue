1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,240
foreign

2
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:07,859
like to thank you all for taking the

3
00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:11,219
time to come down today

4
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:12,960
and discuss with us the digital

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,400
forensics and incident response for plcs

6
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:21,180
you may note that my cohort in crime Ken

7
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:23,580
is not here today he was actually unable

8
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:28,199
to make the trip down and so I will be I

9
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:30,599
will be flying with this solo that being

10
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:32,940
said I've actually got considerable help

11
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:35,340
here sitting out in the audience I have

12
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:38,840
Chris sistrunk who has

13
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:44,340
performed numerous forensics engagements

14
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:48,040
[Laughter]

15
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:49,559
[Music]

16
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:51,480
so as we move through the presentation

17
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,280
here one of the things I would like to

18
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,840
note is if you do have any questions

19
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:57,120
feel free to go ahead and bring those up

20
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,660
during the course of the discussion we

21
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:03,120
would certainly not at all

22
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,339
I try to discourage any type of

23
00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:06,860
interactive

24
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:10,979
process during the conversation there is

25
00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:14,280
a mic that is going around the room so

26
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,960
if you have a question raise your hand

27
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,700
they'll bring the mic and we will

28
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:19,140
discuss it

29
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:20,700
so with that we will go ahead and get

30
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:23,040
kicked off here

31
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,320
so digital forensics and incident

32
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:26,880
response

33
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,420
as many of you may have noticed in a

34
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:34,080
presentation that was actually done on

35
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:37,380
Tuesday mandiant has developed a

36
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:38,340
framework

37
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:40,140
for digital forensics and incident

38
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:43,979
response specific to plcs and devices

39
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:48,780
that are typically found in layer one of

40
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:51,119
the Purdue model

41
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:54,119
one of the reasons behind focusing in

42
00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:56,880
this particular area is that through the

43
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,220
course of numerous engagements we have

44
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:02,460
found that attempts to apply a lot of

45
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:04,439
the I.T processes

46
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:09,179
to the actual plcs and IEDs that exist

47
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:11,038
at layer one

48
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:13,080
do not always provide the desired

49
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,580
results

50
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:17,040
so through this process we're going to

51
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,840
look at the device and Tool

52
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,879
identification

53
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:23,940
focusing on both the the mutable and the

54
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:26,640
immutable characteristics of the systems

55
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,920
that are actually deployed and the

56
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,379
tooling that you have

57
00:02:30,379 --> 00:02:33,599
mutable being those things which can be

58
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:36,239
changed that would be expected to change

59
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:38,760
so for example if you are looking at the

60
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:42,239
firmware versions software versions in

61
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:44,280
some cases you do have re-engineering of

62
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,900
the systems where in some cases

63
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:48,780
connections can actually change

64
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:50,760
in other cases you're looking at

65
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,860
immutable characteristics things like

66
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:54,959
the the physical location of the device

67
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:57,660
the

68
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:59,340
well actually saying that that the

69
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:01,620
physical location of the device is not

70
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:04,440
or is immutable is not not totally

71
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,000
correct because we have have actually

72
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,220
seen devices and locations other than

73
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:10,319
where they were shown on paper and so

74
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:11,280
that's one of the things that we

75
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,920
actually look to address here

76
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,620
also looking at OEM collaboration and

77
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:20,340
and this is a particularly large area of

78
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:23,099
interest when you are looking at dfir

79
00:03:23,099 --> 00:03:27,060
for plcs because in many cases the oems

80
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:28,680
will actually have tools that they have

81
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,739
developed in support of their

82
00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:34,440
engineering efforts those tools can

83
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:38,580
often be leveraged to support the actual

84
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:40,379
dfir process

85
00:03:40,379 --> 00:03:42,420
we'll be actually looking at some of the

86
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:46,379
tools that are provided specifically for

87
00:03:46,379 --> 00:03:50,519
different devices and also for some of

88
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:52,440
the operating systems

89
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:55,319
running on those individual devices

90
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:57,659
we'll also be talking about the customer

91
00:03:57,659 --> 00:04:00,180
availability so in some cases you are

92
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:02,819
looking at instances where the software

93
00:04:02,819 --> 00:04:05,819
may or may not actually be available to

94
00:04:05,819 --> 00:04:07,500
a customer in those cases you may

95
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,959
actually have to bring the OEM in to

96
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:12,239
assist with that type of effort

97
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:14,640
and then you also have tools that are

98
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,279
generally available I know for a fact

99
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:19,380
that that mandian has actually developed

100
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:21,600
several tools that we will identify

101
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,800
during the course of our discussions

102
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,940
here

103
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:28,020
that are freely available out of GitHub

104
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:29,520
we're also going to be talking a little

105
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,280
bit about data identification and

106
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,900
collection

107
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:36,479
starting off with the inventory uh

108
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,840
not to be one to

109
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:42,540
argue with Dale's point that he made

110
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:44,660
during the the opening session on Monday

111
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:47,639
but from our perspective especially when

112
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:50,160
you're talking about dfir inventory is

113
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,120
critical

114
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,919
and we'll be talking about some of the

115
00:04:52,919 --> 00:04:55,880
reasons that the inventory

116
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:58,800
of not only the equipment itself but

117
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,800
also of the tooling is critical when you

118
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,900
are doing dfir

119
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:06,000
we will also be looking at some of the

120
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,100
communications that are ongoing

121
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:10,560
so for example you have the you know HMI

122
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,080
you have local interfaces you have

123
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,360
remote connectivity

124
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,520
and one of the things that we have noted

125
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,199
across a number of engagements that we

126
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:22,020
have had at mandiant is that in some

127
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:26,039
cases the intention is for the device to

128
00:05:26,039 --> 00:05:29,280
only be remotely accessed however in

129
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,680
practice that is not always the case and

130
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,820
I will actually cite a couple of

131
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:34,620
examples where we where we have seen

132
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:36,539
that

133
00:05:36,539 --> 00:05:39,600
so as we begin to move through looking

134
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,740
at

135
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:44,180
we miss one no okay

136
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:47,039
okay so we're looking at device and Tool

137
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:49,380
identification so some of the the key

138
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:53,220
points that are are very Salient to this

139
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:55,199
discussion and the actual practice of

140
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:56,699
dfir

141
00:05:56,699 --> 00:05:58,860
is the function of doing structured

142
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:00,240
record keeping

143
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,139
and very clear and concise methods for

144
00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:07,800
communicating with different products

145
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,680
hmm you want to perform asset inventory

146
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:13,560
to identify the relevant devices

147
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:16,800
and it's very important that when you do

148
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,900
this type of inventory you actually do

149
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:21,840
the physical walk downs on those it it

150
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,840
is not at all uncommon for devices to

151
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:27,240
either be mislabeled or to have been

152
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,979
moved in fact we actually had one

153
00:06:28,979 --> 00:06:32,759
engagement where the identifier for the

154
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:34,800
device that was given was something

155
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,039
along the lines of

156
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:40,860
cd-s47 colon A1 and that was a

157
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:43,080
description of the device

158
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,000
with that type of description it's not

159
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,039
particularly easy one to identify what

160
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,560
the device is and two to identify where

161
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,819
the device is

162
00:06:50,819 --> 00:06:52,560
so in that particular case we worked

163
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,660
with the smes we went through their

164
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:58,800
different diagrams and what we noted in

165
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,560
in the course of that was that we found

166
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,880
the rack where the equipment was

167
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,759
actually located however the designation

168
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,100
for 1A where the device was supposed to

169
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:11,039
be was actually empty and so in talking

170
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:13,080
with folks we were trying to identify

171
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,660
which device this was actually working

172
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:17,819
with and what we noted it was actually

173
00:07:17,819 --> 00:07:19,699
down in in

174
00:07:19,699 --> 00:07:23,460
5A and location 5A and the reason that

175
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:25,199
they had moved it is because they didn't

176
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:26,520
have cables that were long enough to

177
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,720
support it

178
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,940
so let's say some of the some of the

179
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:32,699
logic some of the reasoning Behind These

180
00:07:32,699 --> 00:07:34,560
functions is is not always clear and

181
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,780
apparent so it's important to do those

182
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:39,060
walk downs have the accurate

183
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:43,440
documentation and to work with the smes

184
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,720
you also want to collaborate with the

185
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:48,560
device owners and the internal teams

186
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,060
those of you who have worked with me

187
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:54,000
over the years are very familiar with a

188
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,280
comment that I have especially when

189
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,680
you're looking at itot integration

190
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:01,080
that in many cases the engineers who

191
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,240
actually work out in the field

192
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:07,800
have a mindset that cyber security is

193
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,199
doing security to them rather than for

194
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:11,460
them

195
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:13,800
and in some cases you know they've had

196
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,819
things break during this process and

197
00:08:16,819 --> 00:08:19,379
there may not necessarily be a lot of

198
00:08:19,379 --> 00:08:22,560
communication between the organization

199
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,500
which is charged with cyber security and

200
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,780
the organizations that are charged with

201
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:30,660
actually working with the devices

202
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:34,500
also for the asset owners you want to be

203
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,719
sure to to speak with them directly and

204
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:39,779
in some cases the asset owners are not

205
00:08:39,779 --> 00:08:42,360
actually the individuals who are

206
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,860
functioning with a company they may

207
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:46,560
actually be vendors who manage that

208
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,420
particular equipment the equipment may

209
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:51,839
only be leased that is very common when

210
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:53,700
you are working with equipment that is

211
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,740
in the medical space

212
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:58,860
we've actually had an engagement about

213
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:01,500
two years ago where we went out to a

214
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,820
hospital we were looking at a number of

215
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:05,160
different devices that they had looking

216
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,800
to do embedded testing and on one

217
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,360
particular device they had approximately

218
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,339
a thousand units distributed across the

219
00:09:11,339 --> 00:09:12,720
hospital facility

220
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,580
and what we found was there was

221
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:17,880
absolutely no record of the firmware

222
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:20,279
versions on those different devices any

223
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:21,720
type of patching that had actually been

224
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,620
done

225
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:25,320
and when we asked about that the comment

226
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,779
was well our vendor actually takes care

227
00:09:27,779 --> 00:09:29,940
of that for us when we talked to the

228
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:32,640
vendor the vendor says to us well we

229
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,959
don't actually keep records of that

230
00:09:33,959 --> 00:09:35,459
because we don't want to disclose the

231
00:09:35,459 --> 00:09:37,200
Hospital's information

232
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,500
so they both had what they thought were

233
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,060
very valid reasons for not having the

234
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:44,640
information but the bottom line is it

235
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,620
makes that type of Engagement much more

236
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:50,040
difficult and so it's a very key aspect

237
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:53,060
of working through that

238
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:57,360
so in moving from the actual inventory

239
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:02,040
let's look at the tool identification

240
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:04,320
the OT and ICS devices

241
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,100
that may be in an environment will have

242
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:09,540
certain

243
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:12,300
software certain capabilities that are

244
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:14,580
typically used by the engineering teams

245
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:17,940
that utilize and manage those devices

246
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:20,880
that software may actually be remote in

247
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,440
some cases the data is actually sent

248
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:25,200
back to another facility

249
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,040
and in many cases the links between the

250
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:33,240
actual plc's and the devices is not

251
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,820
specifically identified

252
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:37,440
you look at the software applications

253
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,899
that that are utilized to connect to the

254
00:10:39,899 --> 00:10:43,019
devices in some cases those are strictly

255
00:10:43,019 --> 00:10:46,019
serial devices

256
00:10:46,019 --> 00:10:47,399
you have to actually be physically

257
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:49,680
present at the device to be able to

258
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,680
access and to utilize that software in

259
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,120
some cases the devices are only

260
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:58,380
programmed via a local device such as a

261
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:01,740
laptop or in some cases they will

262
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:03,000
actually have a computer that they

263
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,940
utilize to do the configurations

264
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:08,339
however those devices are not always

265
00:11:08,339 --> 00:11:12,300
present when you're ready to do a dfir

266
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:14,040
similarly the software which is running

267
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,779
on those the software which is used to

268
00:11:15,779 --> 00:11:18,300
configure that device is not actually

269
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:19,560
present

270
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,000
and so those are things that you have to

271
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,380
look at in fact we actually had one

272
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:24,779
engagement and we'll discuss it

273
00:11:24,779 --> 00:11:28,019
a little bit more in detail later but in

274
00:11:28,019 --> 00:11:29,880
this particular engagement we actually

275
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:32,100
had a device which was configured with a

276
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,200
laptop

277
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,000
that laptop was connected directly to a

278
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,440
PLC

279
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,839
another port on that laptop was actually

280
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:43,500
connected to an internet uplink

281
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,180
and in that particular case we actually

282
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:50,160
had a hacker gain access to the laptop

283
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,700
and we could actually see on the laptop

284
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:56,459
that this particular individual was

285
00:11:56,459 --> 00:12:01,019
manipulating screens on the plc

286
00:12:01,019 --> 00:12:02,459
so like I said we'll talk about that a

287
00:12:02,459 --> 00:12:03,959
little bit more in depth

288
00:12:03,959 --> 00:12:05,820
so in some cases like say the equipment

289
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:08,160
may actually be removed for a valid

290
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,019
reason however it's not going to help

291
00:12:10,019 --> 00:12:12,779
the dfir process and we'll talk about

292
00:12:12,779 --> 00:12:14,279
that a little bit more as we get into

293
00:12:14,279 --> 00:12:17,000
the conversation

294
00:12:17,339 --> 00:12:18,600
you're also looking for the

295
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,700
documentation that that is supporting

296
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:24,060
the the actual engagement so as I had

297
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:25,320
previously mentions you know the

298
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,660
locations of the equipment is very

299
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:28,680
important

300
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:32,640
but the locations and access to the

301
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,380
backup configurations

302
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:36,360
is also very important

303
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:39,060
it's also important to note that in some

304
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:43,800
cases the repository for the actual

305
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:46,380
configuration data is not going to be

306
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:51,060
the same as the repository for

307
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:53,880
the program the logic program which is

308
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:56,040
actually running on the plc

309
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,839
those may actually be managed by two

310
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,180
completely separate organizations and

311
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:02,100
they may be housed into entirely

312
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:03,660
different facilities

313
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:06,240
so that is part of the reason that we

314
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:10,139
focus on the framework is to provide a

315
00:13:10,139 --> 00:13:13,740
level of guidance that you can utilize

316
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:16,519
as you work through this process

317
00:13:16,519 --> 00:13:19,019
similarly you have issues with

318
00:13:19,019 --> 00:13:21,060
credentials you may not always have

319
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:24,899
individuals on site who have

320
00:13:24,899 --> 00:13:27,899
sufficient credentials to access the

321
00:13:27,899 --> 00:13:31,200
equipment now that may be directly

322
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,260
connecting to the PLC in other cases it

323
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:35,639
may be that they don't actually have

324
00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:37,980
access to the jump host which is

325
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:41,100
utilized to access that device we have

326
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:43,920
actually seen in at least one client

327
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:47,339
site where they have gone to utilizing

328
00:13:47,339 --> 00:13:51,240
jump hosts even for local access to the

329
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,380
device

330
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:54,600
this is providing them with with two

331
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:58,019
capabilities one is non-repudiation for

332
00:13:58,019 --> 00:14:00,839
shared accounts so they gain a benefit

333
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:02,100
from that

334
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:04,440
they also gain the benefit of having

335
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:07,500
very limited distribution of the actual

336
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,540
credentials which are used to access the

337
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:12,920
device however when you go into a

338
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:16,139
incident response engagement in that

339
00:14:16,139 --> 00:14:18,180
type of environment it takes a lot more

340
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:19,680
planning and it takes a lot more

341
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,420
resources to ensure that you have all of

342
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:24,360
the individuals necessary to be there

343
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:26,220
again that is one of the reasons that

344
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:28,019
you want to utilize the framework it

345
00:14:28,019 --> 00:14:30,300
helps to

346
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:33,000
provide guidance for Gathering all of

347
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,360
this information

348
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:38,519
so when you're looking at the framework

349
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:40,079
let's say for those of you who are at

350
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:42,060
Daniel's presentation on Tuesday

351
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:44,279
this image is going to seem rather

352
00:14:44,279 --> 00:14:47,100
familiar I say it's very very high level

353
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:49,500
at this point obviously there would be a

354
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,660
lot more detail that you would want to

355
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:53,100
capture

356
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,019
however it is a very good starting point

357
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:57,420
so you identify the individual vendors

358
00:14:57,420 --> 00:15:00,480
you identify specific assets you

359
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,500
identify software that is associated

360
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,959
with those different assets

361
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:09,240
you're also looking at the physical

362
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:11,519
Communications so for example if it has

363
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:13,980
serial Port if it has an Ethernet port

364
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:16,440
those are the different types of

365
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,720
accesses that you may actually have and

366
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,160
that you would actually find in the

367
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,959
repository of information

368
00:15:21,959 --> 00:15:25,860
however when you get into the field

369
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:27,420
what you actually see is going to be

370
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:30,060
different so instead of you know just a

371
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:33,839
name what you're actually going to see

372
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:35,880
is something like this

373
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,199
so you're actually going to be looking

374
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:40,199
at at these individual devices

375
00:15:40,199 --> 00:15:42,180
now the reason that it is important

376
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:44,579
again to do the walk downs is because

377
00:15:44,579 --> 00:15:46,500
when you look at a device like this it's

378
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,959
very important to ensure that you have

379
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:51,300
the model number and the serial number

380
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:55,500
for this device captured prior to the IR

381
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,959
and the reason that is important is

382
00:15:57,959 --> 00:16:00,120
because when you start looking at say

383
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:02,699
for example the serial port

384
00:16:02,699 --> 00:16:04,680
you're not actually going to be able to

385
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:07,440
access that serial Port utilizing the

386
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:11,339
software which is available to you

387
00:16:11,339 --> 00:16:12,959
now one thing that you'll note about

388
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:14,459
this software

389
00:16:14,459 --> 00:16:16,139
is if you look at the upper left hand

390
00:16:16,139 --> 00:16:17,779
corner very small print

391
00:16:17,779 --> 00:16:22,500
what you'll also see is that it is

392
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:25,320
considered to be restricted now that

393
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:28,079
restriction means that the the software

394
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:30,420
is not fully operational

395
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:33,180
there are various types of licenses that

396
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:35,880
would be provided with the software to

397
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,980
be able to actually access and utilize

398
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:40,380
different capabilities within that

399
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:41,820
software and we'll show that a little

400
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:43,500
bit more

401
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:46,019
but you're also looking at the the

402
00:16:46,019 --> 00:16:48,660
physical environment so for example you

403
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:51,540
have this you know this five pin

404
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:54,420
serial Port well on paper when you say

405
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:57,000
that okay it's a Serial interface the

406
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,380
vast majority of people are going to

407
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:00,600
think okay well it's a DB9 connector to

408
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,880
a DB9 connector you plug them in and you

409
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,160
go not a problem well that is not the

410
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,839
case in this particular piece of

411
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:08,400
equipment you actually have a different

412
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,140
type of cable

413
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:11,819
other considerations that you have to

414
00:17:11,819 --> 00:17:13,220
look at when you're working through this

415
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:16,380
is not only that it is a different type

416
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:19,740
of cable but the cable may actually have

417
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:21,839
different versions different wiring

418
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:24,480
configurations based on the model number

419
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,040
of the device that you're actually

420
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,419
accessing

421
00:17:27,419 --> 00:17:29,220
so this is another reason that it is

422
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:31,799
very important to do the actual testing

423
00:17:31,799 --> 00:17:34,679
and have the equipment available or

424
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:36,780
staged at least in a in a closely

425
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:38,100
available area

426
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:40,740
to be able to actually look at these

427
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:42,419
different types of interfaces and ensure

428
00:17:42,419 --> 00:17:44,039
that they actually work

429
00:17:44,039 --> 00:17:45,780
when you're talking about the software

430
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:48,120
you want to ensure that you have the

431
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:50,820
proper licensing for that software

432
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:53,520
that would be required to work through

433
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:56,520
the Playbook that you have to manage the

434
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:58,919
actual incident response process

435
00:17:58,919 --> 00:18:00,960
another advantage that you have in

436
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,520
working through this process to ensure

437
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:06,120
that the software and the hardware are

438
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:08,940
both compliant and compatible is that

439
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:11,220
that will help you as you work through

440
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:13,559
the actual Playbook as you develop that

441
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:16,080
Playbook you'll come across a lot of the

442
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,120
the little things the gotchas the the

443
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:20,760
thing that the the person who has been

444
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,860
there at the facility for 20 years he's

445
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:25,919
the only guy that knows this you know in

446
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:27,480
some cases that that may sound like a

447
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:29,220
platitude but we've actually had that

448
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:32,280
happen in a natural engagement so for

449
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:34,260
example we actually had a cable

450
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:37,260
that we utilized and we attempted to

451
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:39,600
connect it to the device however the

452
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,840
cable that the folks on site told us was

453
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:46,200
correct was an eight pin ethernet cable

454
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,480
problem was the device actually had a

455
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,419
four five pin ethernet connector

456
00:18:51,419 --> 00:18:53,520
so they didn't match up so they said

457
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:54,720
okay well we're going to have to get

458
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,039
this other cable so they went to the

459
00:18:56,039 --> 00:18:58,200
process to get the other cable brought

460
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,539
it in hooked it up so still didn't work

461
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:03,360
and so we were trying we were going

462
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,940
through that issue and one of the

463
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:08,280
engineers there at the plant actually

464
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,260
came in and said oh by the way that's

465
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:12,000
that's not actually going to work

466
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,299
because that's not a Dash 4 version of

467
00:19:15,299 --> 00:19:16,919
the cable you you have to have a

468
00:19:16,919 --> 00:19:18,720
dashboard version of the cable

469
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,400
and it's like what's the difference

470
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,600
between a dashboard and the dash five

471
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,299
well there's an extra wire in it so you

472
00:19:24,299 --> 00:19:25,940
know these type this type of knowledge

473
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:29,760
is only going to be acquired as you work

474
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,799
with the individuals who are in the

475
00:19:31,799 --> 00:19:35,120
field with this equipment

476
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,820
so

477
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:41,160
as we're talking about device and Tool

478
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:43,380
identification I wanted to give a few

479
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:46,200
high-level tips that go along with this

480
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,179
so you want to store the documentation

481
00:19:48,179 --> 00:19:51,000
and the data in a secure format

482
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,660
and at the site where it will actually

483
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:57,720
be used or at a site from which it is

484
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,520
easily retrievable

485
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,860
you want to be sure to update the IR

486
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:05,640
procedures to include device data and

487
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,260
backups

488
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:09,720
when you're talking about the backups

489
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:12,240
again you are not just looking at the

490
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,700
configuration

491
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:16,679
of the device itself within the software

492
00:20:16,679 --> 00:20:19,380
you're also looking at backups of the

493
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:21,320
logic programs

494
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:24,900
and the importance of that we'll

495
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:26,280
actually touch on here in just a few

496
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:27,840
minutes

497
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,640
as I previously mentioned you want to be

498
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,660
sure

499
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:33,960
to have the correct hardware and

500
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:37,799
software on site for interoperability

501
00:20:37,799 --> 00:20:39,960
you want to ensure that tooling is

502
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:42,179
available for each of the hardware and

503
00:20:42,179 --> 00:20:44,880
software versions that are deployed we

504
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:48,480
have actually seen instances where the

505
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,919
hardware

506
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:52,080
for a particular device that is actually

507
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:55,020
in the field is not present at the

508
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:57,419
facility it is no longer available from

509
00:20:57,419 --> 00:21:00,179
the manufacturer so to acquire that we

510
00:21:00,179 --> 00:21:02,460
actually had to go out on eBay to find a

511
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:05,340
cable to make that connection

512
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:07,380
so ensuring that you have that type of

513
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:10,679
equipment available ensuring that you

514
00:21:10,679 --> 00:21:12,480
know these things don't get thrown away

515
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,220
when you're doing house cleaning are

516
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:15,419
things that are definitely very

517
00:21:15,419 --> 00:21:17,580
important

518
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:20,039
you want to also incorporate the

519
00:21:20,039 --> 00:21:23,460
workflow into existing processes this is

520
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:25,500
of particular importance again when you

521
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:26,940
are looking at not just the

522
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:28,440
configuration

523
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:31,080
but also when you are planning for the

524
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:33,059
actual engagement

525
00:21:33,059 --> 00:21:35,600
so one of the

526
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,919
one of the tips that we will typically

527
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:40,500
give when we're talking about that

528
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:43,919
actually goes back to you know Occam's

529
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:48,000
razor the idea being that you know the

530
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,940
simpler the more simple that you can

531
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:55,020
execute and function the better off that

532
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:56,220
you're going to be

533
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:59,240
so in moving through that you look at

534
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:04,020
three specific precepts that always need

535
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:06,120
to be at the front of your mind when

536
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:10,200
you're doing dfir for plcs and IEDs any

537
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,419
equipment really that lives at layer one

538
00:22:12,419 --> 00:22:14,220
or the Purdue model

539
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:16,440
the first being that your primary

540
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:20,520
function is to ensure safety now that

541
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:23,100
may be environmental safety safety

542
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:26,100
against hazards for individuals

543
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:28,200
but that needs to be your primary

544
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,760
consideration

545
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,799
your second consideration is going to be

546
00:22:31,799 --> 00:22:34,919
is the device secure and when I'm

547
00:22:34,919 --> 00:22:36,299
talking about security

548
00:22:36,299 --> 00:22:39,539
you're looking at does the adversary

549
00:22:39,539 --> 00:22:42,780
still have access to this device

550
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:44,580
one of the reasons that is important is

551
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:46,740
because if you you pull a configuration

552
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,720
you look at it you see that it has not

553
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:52,080
changed you go away and then the

554
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:55,760
attacker actually goes in and puts his

555
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:58,860
software or his configuration changes in

556
00:22:58,860 --> 00:22:59,820
place

557
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:01,380
so you always want to be sure that

558
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:04,140
you're managing that

559
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:08,280
and so in doing that you look at that

560
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:10,919
from the perspective of for example a

561
00:23:10,919 --> 00:23:12,360
lot of the the courses that are out

562
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:17,580
there today that really focus on the fir

563
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:20,880
for ICS and we do make a definite

564
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,760
distinction between dfir for ICS and

565
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:28,500
dfir for plcs because the the processes

566
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,960
in some cases are somewhat similar

567
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:34,320
however if show of hands here how many

568
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:38,220
folks have ever attended and a dfir for

569
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:39,720
ICS course

570
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,700
either through Sands or Idaho National

571
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:43,919
Labs okay so there's actually a fair a

572
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:46,320
fair number of you so if you think back

573
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,059
to that course

574
00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:50,159
how much of that course content was

575
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:54,000
actually focused on network

576
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,500
tools

577
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,960
data that you can collect from the

578
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:00,179
network itself essentially you're using

579
00:24:00,179 --> 00:24:03,539
the exact same Tools in many cases as

580
00:24:03,539 --> 00:24:06,419
you're going to be using in an I.T

581
00:24:06,419 --> 00:24:09,299
forensics type investigation

582
00:24:09,299 --> 00:24:11,520
and this is this is not a bad thing I

583
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,960
said this is this is something that is

584
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,760
important because that's where you're

585
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:17,880
going to find a lot of your logs for

586
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,679
things that had happened you're going to

587
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:22,740
have the proxy devices which may

588
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:24,600
actually do a peekout for you and you'll

589
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:27,120
be able to see what a remote attacker

590
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:29,100
has actually done

591
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:31,980
however when you are looking at devices

592
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:35,760
at level one in many cases that

593
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:39,240
capability is going to be insufficient

594
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:43,860
in many cases the devices that live at

595
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:46,440
layer one are not actually going to be

596
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:48,600
sending logs to a Sim

597
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,419
I know that some of you have done

598
00:24:50,419 --> 00:24:53,940
extensive work in the area of trying to

599
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:57,360
take those logs and

600
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,460
drive those up to a Sim only to have the

601
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:01,860
Sim actually reject the logs in some

602
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:03,840
cases there has been a type of leveling

603
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,940
which is attempted modify the log to a

604
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:07,380
point where it can actually be accepted

605
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:09,240
by the SIM

606
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:11,520
that doesn't always work I know that

607
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,740
every actually had a project on that a

608
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:15,720
number of years ago where they were

609
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:18,840
working with radaflow to try and

610
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:21,120
normalize the logs that are coming out

611
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,520
of different devices so that they can

612
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,559
actually be sent up to a Sim

613
00:25:25,559 --> 00:25:28,279
never never really came to to fruition

614
00:25:28,279 --> 00:25:30,240
because there are just too many

615
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,159
different types of devices that are out

616
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:33,779
there

617
00:25:33,779 --> 00:25:35,400
those types of differences are one of

618
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,500
the reasons that you need to be able to

619
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:40,080
access the individual devices

620
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,940
another reason that you need to be able

621
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:44,880
to access those types of devices is the

622
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,700
incident that I talked about earlier

623
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:50,940
where we actually had a vendor go out to

624
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:53,059
a remote client site

625
00:25:53,059 --> 00:25:56,460
put sit down a laptop connect to a PLC

626
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:58,919
start making connections they needed to

627
00:25:58,919 --> 00:26:01,799
download some software and they did a

628
00:26:01,799 --> 00:26:03,900
direct connect to the internet now this

629
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:05,520
is a laptop with

630
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:08,279
is connected to the internet no firewall

631
00:26:08,279 --> 00:26:12,240
no AV absolutely zero protections none

632
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,679
at all

633
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:15,360
and so when we when we actually went

634
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,380
into there

635
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:19,200
their site you know we noted that oh

636
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,880
okay the laptop actually isn't here

637
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,500
anymore

638
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:24,900
and so we didn't have the tooling that

639
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:27,840
was available to actually access the plc

640
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:31,559
when we acquired the tooling from the

641
00:26:31,559 --> 00:26:34,320
from the actual client that tooling

642
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,299
didn't work because the vendor was using

643
00:26:36,299 --> 00:26:38,520
a different version of the tooling to

644
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:40,500
access the device

645
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:42,840
so that's one of the reasons that you

646
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:45,179
really want to incorporate the different

647
00:26:45,179 --> 00:26:47,580
workflows is to ensure that you have

648
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:49,440
visibility into those types of

649
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:52,039
environments

650
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:56,580
so when you're looking at the OEM

651
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:58,980
collaboration you know some of the some

652
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:01,440
of the basic tips when you're talking

653
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:04,860
with the oems is crucial for the DSi

654
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:06,480
dfir

655
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,940
process and the framework

656
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:12,059
the OEM support is likely to be required

657
00:27:12,059 --> 00:27:14,640
in the event of a major incident as we

658
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,620
talked about some of the tooling that

659
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:18,779
they will actually provide

660
00:27:18,779 --> 00:27:22,440
may only be accessible to their test

661
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,059
Engineers so they may actually have to

662
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:26,700
send someone out on site to utilize that

663
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:28,020
software because they don't provide it

664
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:29,700
to anyone else

665
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:32,880
data Gathering is made easier with the

666
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,460
support of the oems as I mentioned they

667
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:36,960
have they have the tooling they have the

668
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,220
expertise

669
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:41,159
and in many cases they actually have

670
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:44,100
built-in capabilities that are not

671
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:46,500
commonly known to the vendor or in some

672
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:47,640
cases even to the responding

673
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:50,179
organization

674
00:27:53,779 --> 00:27:56,820
so as you're looking at you know OT for

675
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:59,400
ICS and the devices and the environment

676
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:02,820
looking at OEM collaboration

677
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:04,820
you want to

678
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:08,520
preemptively identify the data that may

679
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:12,600
be available on a particular device

680
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,340
this is particularly important because

681
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:16,980
the various types of data are going to

682
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:19,220
give you different types of information

683
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:22,440
which in some cases will be similar to

684
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:24,480
what you would be able to acquire in an

685
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,580
I.T environment so for example the

686
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:28,380
device may actually have logs that are

687
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:30,779
available however those logs may require

688
00:28:30,779 --> 00:28:33,900
a certain type of software or a certain

689
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:35,760
sequence of commands that may in some

690
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:38,159
cases be very cryptic in order to

691
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:40,980
recover those logs uh similarly as we'll

692
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:42,840
discuss here in just a moment

693
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:45,240
there are capabilities to do memory

694
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:46,260
dumps

695
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:48,240
that are built into the equipment that

696
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:51,000
are not necessarily always known to the

697
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,919
process engineers

698
00:28:52,919 --> 00:28:56,400
they are very tightly held

699
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,980
capabilities that the vendor does not

700
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:02,720
typically make the clients aware of

701
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:06,900
and you also may need their guidance

702
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:10,260
in particular with the sequencing of

703
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:11,760
some of the events that you actually

704
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,320
work through

705
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:16,620
so for example in some cases there may

706
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:19,279
be instances where you do a disconnect

707
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:22,640
of of an ethernet connection

708
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,960
there's the possibility that actually

709
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:27,120
removing that ethernet connection will

710
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,399
actually cause certain processes to stop

711
00:29:29,399 --> 00:29:30,840
running

712
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:34,620
there are also instances where the

713
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:38,480
attacker actually executed an exploit

714
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:42,000
which performed a function that is very

715
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,700
difficult to recover from for example

716
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:47,760
when indestroyer came out

717
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,559
there were a number of capabilities that

718
00:29:49,559 --> 00:29:51,179
that particular tool had

719
00:29:51,179 --> 00:29:54,419
one of the tests that we were actually

720
00:29:54,419 --> 00:29:58,080
able to witness actually was written by

721
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,419
Mr Ben Suter where he was able to

722
00:30:00,419 --> 00:30:03,299
acquire the the industrial code place it

723
00:30:03,299 --> 00:30:05,760
into a lab environment

724
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:08,360
do some a few modifications to the code

725
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:11,760
and send out a specific

726
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:14,279
specifically crafted packet

727
00:30:14,279 --> 00:30:16,140
two

728
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:19,260
the devices that are out on the land

729
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:22,440
what was noted there was the the actual

730
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,700
crafted packet was sent to three

731
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:25,679
different devices two of those devices

732
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:28,679
it had absolutely zero impact however

733
00:30:28,679 --> 00:30:31,140
that third device

734
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:33,240
it completely crashed and it was a hard

735
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:36,179
crash the the buttons on the front panel

736
00:30:36,179 --> 00:30:39,360
no longer functioned the LEDs panels

737
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,120
that you where you would read the status

738
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:43,740
completely blank ethernet connection

739
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:46,140
wouldn't even respond to a paint

740
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:48,799
so when you have something like that

741
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:53,760
utilizing the vendors understanding and

742
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:56,760
the understanding of the individuals who

743
00:30:56,760 --> 00:31:00,000
are actually on site what you might be

744
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,760
able to do is actually acquire that

745
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:05,279
information from a different device so

746
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:08,279
for example if you have so for example

747
00:31:08,279 --> 00:31:10,799
that particular device was a super tech

748
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:13,020
however it was on the same land with a

749
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:15,779
GE well someone who is very familiar

750
00:31:15,779 --> 00:31:18,000
with the GE equipment might have a way

751
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,559
for you to actually to look back through

752
00:31:19,559 --> 00:31:21,720
the

753
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:24,000
ethernet Communications that had been

754
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,220
going on with that device and so from

755
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:28,799
there you're actually pulling the dfir

756
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:30,720
information not from the device which

757
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:33,600
was actually attacked which which saw

758
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:37,140
the the actual functional impact but you

759
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:38,700
might actually get it from a different

760
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:41,220
PLC device that is on that Network

761
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:43,020
so that's another reason why you want to

762
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:45,000
be able to have information about those

763
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,159
different devices and access to those

764
00:31:47,159 --> 00:31:49,260
oems

765
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:52,440
now in some cases with the hardware you

766
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:55,380
may also want to be able to acquire a

767
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:57,240
replacement device for one that is

768
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:01,919
crashed the the sipper Tech incident is

769
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:03,539
is actually

770
00:32:03,539 --> 00:32:06,000
very pertinent to this particular topic

771
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,179
because what an engineer in the field is

772
00:32:09,179 --> 00:32:10,740
typically going to do when they see a

773
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:13,559
device crash that hard is they're going

774
00:32:13,559 --> 00:32:15,299
to make the Assumption okay this this

775
00:32:15,299 --> 00:32:17,279
device is bad it's completely blown up

776
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:19,620
and they're going to replace it

777
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:21,419
when they replace it the exact same

778
00:32:21,419 --> 00:32:23,460
thing is going to happen again because

779
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:25,860
the individual who is executing the

780
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:27,980
attack still has access

781
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:30,419
to that device

782
00:32:30,419 --> 00:32:33,299
and so understanding that you know even

783
00:32:33,299 --> 00:32:35,700
though you replace the device it may not

784
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:37,500
necessarily solve the problem in some

785
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:38,840
cases

786
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:41,520
in less severe cases other than the

787
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:42,960
super tech you may actually want to be

788
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:46,380
able to maintain power on that device in

789
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:48,320
order to collect additional information

790
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,820
utilizing OEM tooling that can be

791
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:51,899
brought in

792
00:32:51,899 --> 00:32:55,080
so if you have the capability to do a

793
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:57,720
hot switchover to another device you

794
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:00,659
know certainly that would be

795
00:33:00,659 --> 00:33:04,140
an expected and

796
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:05,940
it would be a practical

797
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:09,480
solution however if this is actually the

798
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:11,580
result of an attacker on that hot

799
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:13,559
switchover they may now actually have

800
00:33:13,559 --> 00:33:15,779
access to that device as well

801
00:33:15,779 --> 00:33:17,700
so these are the types of things that

802
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:19,919
you need to work through as you're going

803
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:21,960
through your playbook it's one of the

804
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,460
reasons that

805
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:27,419
you want to be sure to have the smes in

806
00:33:27,419 --> 00:33:30,059
place and participating in the

807
00:33:30,059 --> 00:33:32,580
discussions that you have with respect

808
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:36,860
to the dfir for the plcs

809
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:40,200
the oems can also provide specific

810
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:42,000
software that you may not necessarily

811
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,799
have available as I mentioned with the

812
00:33:43,799 --> 00:33:46,799
example on the sipper Tech it may not

813
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:50,039
always be the OEM

814
00:33:50,039 --> 00:33:52,200
for the product which was actually

815
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,760
attacked it may actually be a different

816
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:56,220
OEM who might be able to provide

817
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:58,380
additional support so having those good

818
00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:01,080
relations is very important

819
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:04,679
another point along that same line is

820
00:34:04,679 --> 00:34:07,520
that when you try to make those

821
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:10,619
connections with the OEM

822
00:34:10,619 --> 00:34:12,300
you're going to have your best leverage

823
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:14,040
when you're looking to purchase

824
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:16,199
equipment from them so have those

825
00:34:16,199 --> 00:34:18,480
discussions when you're talking to the

826
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,099
vendor about actually buying their

827
00:34:20,099 --> 00:34:21,300
equipment

828
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:24,800
you're going to have their ear

829
00:34:25,159 --> 00:34:27,960
very well tuned to the different things

830
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:29,639
that you will have to say and the

831
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:31,139
different things that you're actually

832
00:34:31,139 --> 00:34:33,418
looking to gain from them

833
00:34:33,418 --> 00:34:37,500
in many cases sales can give the nudge

834
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:40,139
nudge wink wink to the folks over in

835
00:34:40,139 --> 00:34:42,119
engineering to get that additional

836
00:34:42,119 --> 00:34:43,679
support you know they can bring them

837
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:45,540
into the conversation because they have

838
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:49,379
those connections and that familiarity

839
00:34:49,379 --> 00:34:51,239
however in some cases if you do this

840
00:34:51,239 --> 00:34:52,940
after the fact

841
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:57,660
those Engineers may be too busy to go

842
00:34:57,660 --> 00:34:59,339
out to the site and help you out unless

843
00:34:59,339 --> 00:35:01,140
that has been a pre-arranged agreement

844
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:02,880
so it's certainly something to think

845
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:05,000
about

846
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:09,240
very simple to to-do list here with

847
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:11,880
respect to the OEM collaboration

848
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:14,040
I've already touched on most of these

849
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:16,380
points actually so we'll go ahead and

850
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:19,020
and we will move through

851
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:22,940
to talk about resources and tooling

852
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:32,460
so in many cases the tooling that you

853
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:34,200
will utilize may not actually be

854
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:36,180
provided by

855
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:37,579
the

856
00:35:37,579 --> 00:35:39,119
OEM

857
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:41,280
it may actually be provided by a third

858
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,300
party

859
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:45,119
so for example we have several devices

860
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:49,380
that utilize the the Q and X operating

861
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:50,460
system

862
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:53,160
well q and x actually has a significant

863
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:56,460
number of tools that are available and

864
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:58,740
freely available that you can pull down

865
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:01,500
from their website and that may be

866
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:05,339
utilized and so the this is going back

867
00:36:05,339 --> 00:36:07,560
again to the inventory so it's not just

868
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:10,619
a matter of identifying the serial model

869
00:36:10,619 --> 00:36:14,339
the model number of the individual

870
00:36:14,339 --> 00:36:15,359
devices

871
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:17,780
but you would also like to acquire

872
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:20,390
what's typically called

873
00:36:20,390 --> 00:36:21,660
[Music]

874
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:25,500
an s-bomb a software bill of materials

875
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:28,200
trying to identify the specific software

876
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:30,480
which may be running on a particular

877
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,339
device

878
00:36:32,339 --> 00:36:34,560
this is not only important from the

879
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:38,280
perspective of identifying additional

880
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:40,320
tooling that could be used

881
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,940
but it's something that can also feed

882
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:44,880
into your vulnerability management and

883
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,820
your patch management

884
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:50,339
capabilities and processes so for

885
00:36:50,339 --> 00:36:52,619
example if you're able to identify that

886
00:36:52,619 --> 00:36:55,260
they utilize a particular version of

887
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:58,800
Apache and there are several cves for

888
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,420
Apache out there

889
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:02,880
then you can look at okay well does this

890
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:05,160
really need to be patched you may not be

891
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:07,020
aware that your particular device is

892
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:10,800
actually vulnerable to a particular

893
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:13,140
exploit that is being used against a

894
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:15,780
particular version of Apache and so

895
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:17,820
being able to utilize this and feed it

896
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:20,520
into your vulnerability management

897
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:24,180
system is a definite gain of this type

898
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:25,500
of search

899
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:28,200
so getting that that s-bomb

900
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:30,300
ahead of time again when you have that

901
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:31,680
leverage when you're talking to the

902
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:34,260
sales folks being sure that that type of

903
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:36,540
information is included is going to be

904
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:38,460
important

905
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:42,300
in addition to the what I would refer to

906
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:45,720
as a second party such as qnx where you

907
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:47,700
know they actually have software which

908
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:50,579
is available on the product and they

909
00:37:50,579 --> 00:37:52,980
provide additional tooling you have the

910
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:54,380
third parties

911
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:57,960
here we actually have an example of some

912
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:02,220
coding that that Chris worked with our

913
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:06,060
our Flair team to develop where we can

914
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:10,079
actually go out to a D20 and do very

915
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:12,660
specific memory dumps acquire different

916
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:16,020
types of information from those devices

917
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:19,079
in some cases the vendor will be very

918
00:38:19,079 --> 00:38:22,020
aware of this type of capability in

919
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:23,579
other cases they may be completely

920
00:38:23,579 --> 00:38:26,339
unaware of this type of capability

921
00:38:26,339 --> 00:38:28,260
and so

922
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:31,520
this is where your your connections with

923
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:35,040
your third-party organizations some of

924
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,540
the teams that actually manage the

925
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:40,079
equipment is going to be very important

926
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:43,380
when you look at identifying the the

927
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:45,420
responders you know this is some of the

928
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:47,760
things that you want to try to attain

929
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:50,460
information on ensuring that they have

930
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:52,619
the capabilities to actually address

931
00:38:52,619 --> 00:38:53,839
address

932
00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:57,780
vulnerabilities and specific known

933
00:38:57,780 --> 00:39:00,119
capabilities of attackers that are out

934
00:39:00,119 --> 00:39:02,480
in the field

935
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:05,640
so here we're actually going to do a

936
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:07,020
real quick walk through just a real

937
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:11,520
quick example of the use of one of the

938
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:13,140
the vendor tools

939
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:16,740
to acquire some additional information

940
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:18,300
so what you'll note here this is very

941
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:20,640
similar to the tool that we identified

942
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,020
earlier

943
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:25,079
and what you'll notice here is that it's

944
00:39:25,079 --> 00:39:26,520
this is not actually a restricted

945
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:28,560
version this is actually a licensed

946
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:29,579
version

947
00:39:29,579 --> 00:39:32,760
so with this you can actually perform a

948
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:35,099
number of operations that will allow you

949
00:39:35,099 --> 00:39:37,680
to compare

950
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:41,220
the known good file with the file that

951
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:43,440
you pull from a PLC

952
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:45,599
going back to the precepts that we

953
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:48,180
talked about earlier is it safe is it

954
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:49,680
secure

955
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:51,780
you want to be able to identify any

956
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:53,339
changes

957
00:39:53,339 --> 00:39:56,280
which have been undertaken on that

958
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:58,380
device that is in the field

959
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:01,020
very often this is not a capability that

960
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:03,119
your it team is going to be able to

961
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:05,040
provide to you

962
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:08,460
so as an engineer as the individuals

963
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:11,520
responsible for this equipment in the

964
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:15,420
field ensuring that not only you know is

965
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:17,640
it safe is it secure but is it

966
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:19,500
functional you're going to need this

967
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:21,960
type of access and you're going to need

968
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:24,359
it at the site itself not necessarily

969
00:40:24,359 --> 00:40:26,520
from a remote location

970
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:30,800
so for example as you work through this

971
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:36,300
so here we've already done the the

972
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:37,380
download

973
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:40,440
or excuse me the upload from the

974
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:44,040
suspected defect infected device

975
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:45,540
and so we're going to utilize this

976
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:49,680
function on the the pxworks tool PC

977
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:52,200
Works tool and we're going to do a

978
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:53,220
compare

979
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:55,260
what you'll note here is that it

980
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:57,119
actually provides you with a very clear

981
00:40:57,119 --> 00:41:00,960
indicator that there is a mismatch

982
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:05,880
between the Baseline version and the

983
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,800
version that you actually pulled from

984
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,180
the device

985
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:11,339
as you work down through here you can

986
00:41:11,339 --> 00:41:14,540
actually see the specific coding section

987
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:18,060
where that issue is found

988
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:21,240
and what it will actually show you is

989
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:23,579
the specific variable which in this case

990
00:41:23,579 --> 00:41:25,740
has actually been removed from the

991
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:27,079
device

992
00:41:27,079 --> 00:41:29,520
now in this particular case this is

993
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:32,599
something that an unauthorized person

994
00:41:32,599 --> 00:41:35,579
actually did of course this is in a test

995
00:41:35,579 --> 00:41:37,740
environment of course we did we did not

996
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:40,619
do this on a live system but what we

997
00:41:40,619 --> 00:41:44,160
have seen on a live system is after

998
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:46,380
acquiring the correct software and the

999
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:48,839
correct licenses utilizing this type of

1000
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:51,780
capability we were actually able to

1001
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:54,720
identify a number of changes that had

1002
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,579
been undertaken

1003
00:41:56,579 --> 00:42:01,560
between the deployed device and the

1004
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:04,160
Baseline

1005
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:09,420
the caveat to that is that in subsequent

1006
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:11,820
conversations with the vendor they

1007
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:13,980
actually confirmed that they had made

1008
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:16,500
these modifications but had not actually

1009
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:18,060
gotten around to documenting those

1010
00:42:18,060 --> 00:42:19,680
modifications

1011
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:21,780
and so again this is one of the things

1012
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:24,060
where you want to be sure to have those

1013
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:25,800
contact points you need to have those

1014
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:28,380
conversations because had we not been

1015
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:30,660
able to acquire that information you

1016
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:33,599
know our response to the client was okay

1017
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:36,300
there is a difference on this device it

1018
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:39,240
has been modified

1019
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:41,579
and so you know that that definitely

1020
00:42:41,579 --> 00:42:43,560
would have

1021
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:46,440
caused a different set of reactions from

1022
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:47,880
from the client they would have gone

1023
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:50,940
through a much more extensive process in

1024
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:53,640
trying to cleanse this device even

1025
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:55,680
though it was it was very much a one-off

1026
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:58,740
device other devices were not impacted

1027
00:42:58,740 --> 00:43:00,720
uh that was very clear through the

1028
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:03,680
course of the investigation

1029
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:06,540
so in talking about the OEM

1030
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:08,160
collaboration tips

1031
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:10,859
and we talk about you know IR with the

1032
00:43:10,859 --> 00:43:13,319
OEM again before the purchase is made

1033
00:43:13,319 --> 00:43:15,180
these are some tips that you can take

1034
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:17,460
away things that you definitely want to

1035
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:21,300
have in terms of considerations

1036
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:25,020
your OEM likely support many different

1037
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:27,300
IRS so that you know they're called in

1038
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:29,099
by other companies so they're going to

1039
00:43:29,099 --> 00:43:33,420
have a certain amount of experience with

1040
00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:35,579
the IR that you're calling them to

1041
00:43:35,579 --> 00:43:37,079
support

1042
00:43:37,079 --> 00:43:39,420
in some cases they may be able to say oh

1043
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:42,240
yes well we know that if we go to this

1044
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:44,700
log and we look at this information that

1045
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:46,319
will take us over here to look at this

1046
00:43:46,319 --> 00:43:49,200
file and then that file will give us a

1047
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:52,619
link to the location of the actual

1048
00:43:52,619 --> 00:43:55,260
ethernet address of the device which was

1049
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:56,579
actually which actually sent the packet

1050
00:43:56,579 --> 00:43:58,920
yeah I mean they've actually worked to

1051
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:01,500
that level and they're able to identify

1052
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:04,380
those types of information

1053
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:07,319
also understanding their response

1054
00:44:07,319 --> 00:44:09,119
efforts and capabilities

1055
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:11,700
is very important in some cases you may

1056
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:14,520
be working with a vendor that no longer

1057
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:17,339
supports a particular type of device in

1058
00:44:17,339 --> 00:44:19,079
other words it may have it may be end of

1059
00:44:19,079 --> 00:44:22,079
life however within your particular

1060
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:24,359
deployment it may still have 10 years

1061
00:44:24,359 --> 00:44:27,000
left before you actually get around to

1062
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,339
to replacing that device and so they

1063
00:44:29,339 --> 00:44:32,240
might be able to help you identify

1064
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:35,520
third-party resources that have

1065
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:37,440
additional background with those devices

1066
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:39,720
and can actually help you with it but

1067
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:42,000
according to their own policies

1068
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,560
they're not going to support an IR

1069
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:45,180
against the device because it is end of

1070
00:44:45,180 --> 00:44:46,920
life you know that is a consideration

1071
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:48,359
for the equipment that you have out

1072
00:44:48,359 --> 00:44:50,280
there

1073
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:53,940
also looking at the the OEM for the

1074
00:44:53,940 --> 00:44:55,920
third party tools is something that's

1075
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:57,359
important in many cases they will

1076
00:44:57,359 --> 00:45:01,319
identify uh for example you know Chris

1077
00:45:01,319 --> 00:45:04,920
talks with GE on on a regular basis GE

1078
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:08,339
is very well aware of the FireEye

1079
00:45:08,339 --> 00:45:10,500
mandiant tools that have been developed

1080
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:12,900
to support IR for a number of their

1081
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:16,440
products and so like say with GE and

1082
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:19,940
there are other organizations as well

1083
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:25,680
so additional items to be very specific

1084
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:29,160
about information collected that is

1085
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:31,079
possible to build or

1086
00:45:31,079 --> 00:45:34,680
or enhance asset inventories now there's

1087
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:37,440
there's a caveat here because in many

1088
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:39,560
cases you'll hear

1089
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:41,119
the

1090
00:45:41,119 --> 00:45:43,740
software vendors the the folks who go

1091
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:45,540
out and collect this type of information

1092
00:45:45,540 --> 00:45:47,599
for you

1093
00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:50,099
they'll say that they can access you

1094
00:45:50,099 --> 00:45:52,260
know ICS devices they can identify those

1095
00:45:52,260 --> 00:45:55,800
devices based on Communications that

1096
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:58,079
they see going across the individual

1097
00:45:58,079 --> 00:46:01,440
lands however many of the devices that

1098
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:04,220
are actually deployed out at level one

1099
00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:07,280
do not actually utilize

1100
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:10,319
land segments that are being monitored

1101
00:46:10,319 --> 00:46:12,000
by that tooling

1102
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,819
so that there again that's very

1103
00:46:14,819 --> 00:46:17,339
important to to do your walk downs to go

1104
00:46:17,339 --> 00:46:20,280
through the actual deployment that you

1105
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:22,920
have and identify places where that type

1106
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:25,200
of tooling can help you identify places

1107
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:28,440
where it cannot in some cases you may

1108
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:30,359
actually look to deploy that type of

1109
00:46:30,359 --> 00:46:32,700
tooling because it has additional

1110
00:46:32,700 --> 00:46:36,119
capabilities for example nazomi and

1111
00:46:36,119 --> 00:46:38,099
Clarity have capabilities you know

1112
00:46:38,099 --> 00:46:39,359
certainly with intrusion detection

1113
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:41,760
intrusion prevention

1114
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:43,920
they also have certain capabilities when

1115
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:46,980
it comes to inventory identification

1116
00:46:46,980 --> 00:46:49,859
so even though that is not necessarily a

1117
00:46:49,859 --> 00:46:53,640
core function of the tooling that you're

1118
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:55,560
looking at there it's a capability which

1119
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:57,780
you may be able to leverage to help you

1120
00:46:57,780 --> 00:47:01,140
with the inventory management of those

1121
00:47:01,140 --> 00:47:04,220
very low level devices

1122
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:07,140
also looking at the the data

1123
00:47:07,140 --> 00:47:09,900
identification and collection

1124
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:11,880
should follow the same standard

1125
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:14,339
practices that you utilize for it

1126
00:47:14,339 --> 00:47:16,920
forensics you do not want to have

1127
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:19,160
completely separate

1128
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:22,260
processes that you work through but

1129
00:47:22,260 --> 00:47:25,140
again the caveat to that is that in

1130
00:47:25,140 --> 00:47:28,619
instances where the I.T processes and

1131
00:47:28,619 --> 00:47:30,540
procedures and tooling are not

1132
00:47:30,540 --> 00:47:34,700
sufficient to support actual dfir for

1133
00:47:34,700 --> 00:47:38,040
devices at that very low level the plcs

1134
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:41,819
the IEDs the relay controllers you know

1135
00:47:41,819 --> 00:47:43,319
there you will actually have a certain

1136
00:47:43,319 --> 00:47:45,359
amount of Divergence as you work through

1137
00:47:45,359 --> 00:47:47,598
that

1138
00:47:49,260 --> 00:47:53,119
so then we go to the data identification

1139
00:47:53,119 --> 00:47:56,520
and collection so here we're talking

1140
00:47:56,520 --> 00:48:00,540
about Digital Data but there's also

1141
00:48:00,540 --> 00:48:04,260
considerations for physical data

1142
00:48:04,260 --> 00:48:07,500
and also physical access and I wanted to

1143
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:09,839
touch on those here before we get into

1144
00:48:09,839 --> 00:48:12,440
the Digital Data

1145
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:16,800
in a number of the engagements that

1146
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:20,839
Mandy has had we have had

1147
00:48:20,839 --> 00:48:24,680
requirements to utilize specific

1148
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:27,900
PPE personal protection equipment

1149
00:48:27,900 --> 00:48:30,480
we have had certain trainings and

1150
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:32,700
certifications that you have to go

1151
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:33,960
through in order to be able to actually

1152
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:37,160
access the client's site

1153
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:39,560
these types of things should be

1154
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:43,380
identified they should be certainly

1155
00:48:43,380 --> 00:48:46,560
documented and they should be a part of

1156
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:49,440
the actual response process because some

1157
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:51,119
of these things take actually have a

1158
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:53,599
very long lead time and in some cases

1159
00:48:53,599 --> 00:48:56,520
your incident responders may not be able

1160
00:48:56,520 --> 00:49:00,119
to acquire the necessary certification

1161
00:49:00,119 --> 00:49:03,540
the perfect example of that is I know

1162
00:49:03,540 --> 00:49:05,579
that that both the you know Chris and I

1163
00:49:05,579 --> 00:49:07,160
have actually

1164
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:12,180
done work out on oil rigs and on drill

1165
00:49:12,180 --> 00:49:15,780
ships one of the requirements for that

1166
00:49:15,780 --> 00:49:18,960
is what they call a bosia Hewitt

1167
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:21,300
certification now that particular

1168
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:23,960
certification actually takes three days

1169
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:26,280
for those of you who are unfamiliar with

1170
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:29,960
it it includes basic firefighting

1171
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:33,780
evacuation from the facility different

1172
00:49:33,780 --> 00:49:37,800
types of survival techniques that you

1173
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:39,660
actually have to go through how to get

1174
00:49:39,660 --> 00:49:42,240
into a raft how to get off of a raft

1175
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:44,760
but then it also has some things that

1176
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:47,760
some incident responders simply will not

1177
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:50,160
want to do so for example when you're

1178
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:51,900
looking at the Hewitt that that's

1179
00:49:51,900 --> 00:49:53,819
actually the you know if I get the gift

1180
00:49:53,819 --> 00:49:55,859
if I get this wrong uh correct me Chris

1181
00:49:55,859 --> 00:49:57,720
but I believe it is helicopter

1182
00:49:57,720 --> 00:50:00,960
underwater evacuation training

1183
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:03,420
and in in this particular type of

1184
00:50:03,420 --> 00:50:06,240
Engagement they they strap you into a

1185
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:07,260
helicopter

1186
00:50:07,260 --> 00:50:10,260
uh simulator they turn you upside down

1187
00:50:10,260 --> 00:50:12,599
they put you in underwater and they tell

1188
00:50:12,599 --> 00:50:13,980
you to get out

1189
00:50:13,980 --> 00:50:15,060
foreign

1190
00:50:15,060 --> 00:50:18,420
so four years ago when when we went

1191
00:50:18,420 --> 00:50:21,359
through this wow that was an adventure

1192
00:50:21,359 --> 00:50:23,099
today

1193
00:50:23,099 --> 00:50:25,680
not so much so you know you're going to

1194
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:27,359
have instances where your incident

1195
00:50:27,359 --> 00:50:29,760
responders you know they're just they

1196
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:31,500
may not physically be able to do it now

1197
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:33,119
even though I could today I could

1198
00:50:33,119 --> 00:50:35,520
probably still do the Hewitt not that I

1199
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:37,619
would necessarily want to

1200
00:50:37,619 --> 00:50:40,680
point this out but

1201
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:44,040
no but there are also things that go

1202
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:46,200
along with that that you know for some

1203
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:48,540
folks it's just easier than others so

1204
00:50:48,540 --> 00:50:50,579
for example with the you actually had to

1205
00:50:50,579 --> 00:50:52,920
be able to uh Traverse a certain

1206
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:55,440
distance underwater using a compressed

1207
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:56,700
air breather

1208
00:50:56,700 --> 00:50:58,980
so I actually had much more trouble with

1209
00:50:58,980 --> 00:51:02,099
that than I did with with the helicopter

1210
00:51:02,099 --> 00:51:04,140
Escape helicopter Escape had breezed

1211
00:51:04,140 --> 00:51:06,300
through that no problem but I couldn't

1212
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:08,940
keep the I couldn't keep the

1213
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:12,300
the actual compressed air device in so

1214
00:51:12,300 --> 00:51:15,140
it kept coming out so very very

1215
00:51:15,140 --> 00:51:17,099
unpleasant experience not necessarily

1216
00:51:17,099 --> 00:51:18,059
one that I would want to go through

1217
00:51:18,059 --> 00:51:21,119
again but your incident responders have

1218
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:23,280
to be able to do those types of things

1219
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:24,780
if that's the environment that they're

1220
00:51:24,780 --> 00:51:26,700
going to go into

1221
00:51:26,700 --> 00:51:29,460
and it's very important to have that as

1222
00:51:29,460 --> 00:51:31,760
part of the incident response process

1223
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:34,920
because you know like I said I see some

1224
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:36,480
of the folks out here smiling and

1225
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:37,859
nodding their head and it's kind of like

1226
00:51:37,859 --> 00:51:40,200
well I'd like to try that well you know

1227
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:42,359
that's that that's a good thing but be

1228
00:51:42,359 --> 00:51:44,339
sure to go and be sure to get it before

1229
00:51:44,339 --> 00:51:46,079
the incident response is required

1230
00:51:46,079 --> 00:51:48,059
because it takes several months to be

1231
00:51:48,059 --> 00:51:50,280
able to set set up the class that you

1232
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:51,839
can actually attend

1233
00:51:51,839 --> 00:51:53,940
so these are types of of information

1234
00:51:53,940 --> 00:51:56,280
that that you also need to be aware of

1235
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:58,319
you know like say it's not just the data

1236
00:51:58,319 --> 00:52:02,040
collection not just the Digital Data

1237
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:04,140
so you're also looking at

1238
00:52:04,140 --> 00:52:06,480
when you do start looking at the Digital

1239
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:08,400
Data you know you're looking at the the

1240
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:11,400
previous steps that should help provide

1241
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:15,300
methods to access the data

1242
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:18,900
a very good example of this would be a

1243
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:21,180
penetration test that that mandian

1244
00:52:21,180 --> 00:52:22,380
actually did

1245
00:52:22,380 --> 00:52:25,140
and one of the findings that we had in

1246
00:52:25,140 --> 00:52:27,660
that particular test was that there was

1247
00:52:27,660 --> 00:52:29,760
a device out in the field rather far

1248
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:31,619
afield which is providing information

1249
00:52:31,619 --> 00:52:32,960
back

1250
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:36,180
utilizing an LTE connection

1251
00:52:36,180 --> 00:52:38,940
what we also found was that they were

1252
00:52:38,940 --> 00:52:42,059
using a public IP address a

1253
00:52:42,059 --> 00:52:45,119
public-facing IP address on that LTE

1254
00:52:45,119 --> 00:52:47,940
device which was accessible essentially

1255
00:52:47,940 --> 00:52:50,819
to anyone who could actually ping that

1256
00:52:50,819 --> 00:52:52,740
particular device and so we were

1257
00:52:52,740 --> 00:52:54,540
actually able to gain access to the

1258
00:52:54,540 --> 00:52:56,280
interface utilizing that particular

1259
00:52:56,280 --> 00:52:59,040
interface just over the internet

1260
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:01,680
well we had you know they they shut that

1261
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:03,780
down immediately after we found it but

1262
00:53:03,780 --> 00:53:05,640
there was still an open question as to

1263
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:07,319
what they were actually utilizing that

1264
00:53:07,319 --> 00:53:08,520
interface for

1265
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:11,160
that question hasn't been answered yet

1266
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:16,440
so in some cases there may be potential

1267
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:19,020
hindrances to operations

1268
00:53:19,020 --> 00:53:21,240
when you start identifying some of this

1269
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:24,900
Digital Data and there's the potential

1270
00:53:24,900 --> 00:53:27,180
let's say when there is the potential to

1271
00:53:27,180 --> 00:53:29,579
negatively impact operations

1272
00:53:29,579 --> 00:53:31,500
this is those are the instances where

1273
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:33,240
you need to be sure to have the smes

1274
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:37,619
available on hand to talk about that

1275
00:53:37,619 --> 00:53:40,619
using the inventories as a collection

1276
00:53:40,619 --> 00:53:44,940
list for the different types of data is

1277
00:53:44,940 --> 00:53:47,700
a very good starting point for for the

1278
00:53:47,700 --> 00:53:50,040
data collection process however as we

1279
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:52,859
talked about previously not all of the

1280
00:53:52,859 --> 00:53:54,960
equipment not all of the assets from

1281
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:57,059
which you want to collect data are going

1282
00:53:57,059 --> 00:53:59,220
to be in that inventory

1283
00:53:59,220 --> 00:54:00,960
and so that's one of the reasons to

1284
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:03,059
utilize the framework to ensure that you

1285
00:54:03,059 --> 00:54:06,540
have a much broader view of the assets

1286
00:54:06,540 --> 00:54:08,400
which may be included in that type of

1287
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:10,760
Engagement

1288
00:54:14,420 --> 00:54:17,400
so examples of Digital Data that you may

1289
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:21,720
want to acquire date and time you know

1290
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:25,020
last known approved configuration the OS

1291
00:54:25,020 --> 00:54:26,960
version the firmware version

1292
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:29,579
now these these are a particular

1293
00:54:29,579 --> 00:54:33,059
interest because in some cases you may

1294
00:54:33,059 --> 00:54:36,000
have a

1295
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:40,980
process built into your playbook that is

1296
00:54:40,980 --> 00:54:42,900
expecting capability that is provided

1297
00:54:42,900 --> 00:54:45,420
from a particular firmware version

1298
00:54:45,420 --> 00:54:49,260
well if you update the firmware on that

1299
00:54:49,260 --> 00:54:50,760
particular device

1300
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:52,500
there may not necessarily be a

1301
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:54,200
connection between

1302
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:58,500
the incident response Playbook and the

1303
00:54:58,500 --> 00:55:00,480
configuration management system

1304
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:02,220
so that's another area where you need to

1305
00:55:02,220 --> 00:55:04,680
be sure to identify those types of links

1306
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:07,440
between the different repositories of

1307
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:09,359
information that you have the different

1308
00:55:09,359 --> 00:55:11,339
processes that you're going to undertake

1309
00:55:11,339 --> 00:55:14,099
during a dfir when you're looking at

1310
00:55:14,099 --> 00:55:16,339
those very low level devices

1311
00:55:16,339 --> 00:55:18,720
another example uh you know when we're

1312
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:20,220
talking about the CPU and memory

1313
00:55:20,220 --> 00:55:21,740
utilization

1314
00:55:21,740 --> 00:55:24,599
in in many cases you know if you have a

1315
00:55:24,599 --> 00:55:26,819
Windows box or a Linux box this

1316
00:55:26,819 --> 00:55:28,260
information is not necessarily

1317
00:55:28,260 --> 00:55:31,140
particularly hard to acquire in in some

1318
00:55:31,140 --> 00:55:33,540
devices there may actually be very

1319
00:55:33,540 --> 00:55:36,740
specific vendor

1320
00:55:36,740 --> 00:55:39,660
shell commands that you can utilize to

1321
00:55:39,660 --> 00:55:41,819
to acquire this information

1322
00:55:41,819 --> 00:55:44,220
the reason that this capability is

1323
00:55:44,220 --> 00:55:47,040
important is in a dfir is because when

1324
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:50,160
you look at that CPU utilization

1325
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:52,020
you're not only you should be able to

1326
00:55:52,020 --> 00:55:54,960
Baseline that so typical operations for

1327
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:57,000
a given device you know should fall

1328
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,579
within a particular range that should be

1329
00:55:59,579 --> 00:56:01,680
documented so for example if it

1330
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:04,200
typically runs between uh you know 30

1331
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:07,859
and 40 percent of capability then that's

1332
00:56:07,859 --> 00:56:09,059
you know that's something to be expected

1333
00:56:09,059 --> 00:56:11,040
that should be in your Baseline

1334
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:13,920
when a forensics investigator goes out

1335
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:15,900
and looks at that and they say oh well

1336
00:56:15,900 --> 00:56:18,720
this guy's running at 98 percent then

1337
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:21,180
the the indicator is that okay there's

1338
00:56:21,180 --> 00:56:22,680
something else running on that device

1339
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:25,619
that is not expected so that is

1340
00:56:25,619 --> 00:56:26,760
definitely something that you want to be

1341
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:28,859
able to look at being able to identify

1342
00:56:28,859 --> 00:56:30,599
running processes

1343
00:56:30,599 --> 00:56:32,460
is also something that you want to be

1344
00:56:32,460 --> 00:56:34,859
able to collect on devices that utilize

1345
00:56:34,859 --> 00:56:37,079
for example qnx

1346
00:56:37,079 --> 00:56:39,599
you know even though it is not a

1347
00:56:39,599 --> 00:56:42,540
vendor-specific tool because it is

1348
00:56:42,540 --> 00:56:44,880
running qnx qnx provides capabilities

1349
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:46,319
for you to be able to find that

1350
00:56:46,319 --> 00:56:47,180
information

1351
00:56:47,180 --> 00:56:49,920
similarly if you're running a basic

1352
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:53,220
Linux kernel on an embedded device you

1353
00:56:53,220 --> 00:56:54,599
may actually have a shell where you can

1354
00:56:54,599 --> 00:56:58,200
get in and identify that information

1355
00:56:58,200 --> 00:57:00,140
now there's also

1356
00:57:00,140 --> 00:57:02,760
logs and diagnostic Data Network traffic

1357
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:05,700
memory dumps there's also one that

1358
00:57:05,700 --> 00:57:08,579
actually came up here very recently that

1359
00:57:08,579 --> 00:57:11,640
is important to look at because there

1360
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:13,740
are actually two types of attacks that

1361
00:57:13,740 --> 00:57:16,440
are associated with it so for example

1362
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:20,579
looking at the shadow file and the

1363
00:57:20,579 --> 00:57:24,540
password file that is existing on a

1364
00:57:24,540 --> 00:57:26,819
Linux based system

1365
00:57:26,819 --> 00:57:29,220
the reason that that it's important to

1366
00:57:29,220 --> 00:57:30,599
be able to pull those and to be able to

1367
00:57:30,599 --> 00:57:32,880
look at those is to see if a user has

1368
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:35,700
actually been added to that

1369
00:57:35,700 --> 00:57:40,319
in most cases let's say the you know the

1370
00:57:40,319 --> 00:57:42,420
the rule of thumb is that well okay they

1371
00:57:42,420 --> 00:57:44,099
don't they didn't have access to it

1372
00:57:44,099 --> 00:57:45,780
there's no way that they could have

1373
00:57:45,780 --> 00:57:48,599
actually been able to utilize it if they

1374
00:57:48,599 --> 00:57:50,099
had that because it's in a locked room

1375
00:57:50,099 --> 00:57:52,619
you can't actually you know get physical

1376
00:57:52,619 --> 00:57:55,500
access to it and so it's it's not really

1377
00:57:55,500 --> 00:57:57,780
a problem however what we have actually

1378
00:57:57,780 --> 00:58:01,079
seen recently is some of the testing

1379
00:58:01,079 --> 00:58:03,720
where we have done uh actually executed

1380
00:58:03,720 --> 00:58:06,680
threat models against the supply chain

1381
00:58:06,680 --> 00:58:10,500
we have actually identified a particular

1382
00:58:10,500 --> 00:58:13,859
device where it is very easy to get root

1383
00:58:13,859 --> 00:58:16,380
access to that device while it is in the

1384
00:58:16,380 --> 00:58:18,540
supply chain this is this is through an

1385
00:58:18,540 --> 00:58:20,460
open interface inside of the device so

1386
00:58:20,460 --> 00:58:22,800
basically you pull the cover you plug in

1387
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:24,660
you now have root access to that

1388
00:58:24,660 --> 00:58:26,059
particular device

1389
00:58:26,059 --> 00:58:29,640
the attacker could actually

1390
00:58:29,640 --> 00:58:34,500
insert a root user on that device we

1391
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:35,819
actually did this as part of a test

1392
00:58:35,819 --> 00:58:39,599
where we installed a root user you box

1393
00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:41,520
the device back up

1394
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:45,299
you put it back together and again where

1395
00:58:45,299 --> 00:58:48,359
your the comments about not being able

1396
00:58:48,359 --> 00:58:51,299
to access the device because it is

1397
00:58:51,299 --> 00:58:52,579
physically remote

1398
00:58:52,579 --> 00:58:54,900
really didn't hold up because what we

1399
00:58:54,900 --> 00:58:57,660
were actually able to do is utilize

1400
00:58:57,660 --> 00:59:01,140
yield cell phone and within 30 feet of

1401
00:59:01,140 --> 00:59:05,579
the device actually SSH into the device

1402
00:59:05,579 --> 00:59:08,940
use VI the the editor which is built

1403
00:59:08,940 --> 00:59:10,140
into the device

1404
00:59:10,140 --> 00:59:12,480
make the change on the device to where

1405
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:14,579
we changed our

1406
00:59:14,579 --> 00:59:17,099
root user we change the name so

1407
00:59:17,099 --> 00:59:19,559
basically we had route one they had root

1408
00:59:19,559 --> 00:59:21,859
so we basically just swap the names

1409
00:59:21,859 --> 00:59:24,599
because the web interface would only

1410
00:59:24,599 --> 00:59:27,260
allow the root user access

1411
00:59:27,260 --> 00:59:31,260
to the the high level functions the

1412
00:59:31,260 --> 00:59:33,540
capabilities to reconfigure the device

1413
00:59:33,540 --> 00:59:35,520
however in doing that we were actually

1414
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:38,460
able to utilize our the password that we

1415
00:59:38,460 --> 00:59:41,160
defined for a root user

1416
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:43,619
changed his name to root we were

1417
00:59:43,619 --> 00:59:45,599
actually able to utilize that to gain

1418
00:59:45,599 --> 00:59:47,940
complete and total access to the device

1419
00:59:47,940 --> 00:59:50,339
and that was actually through cell phone

1420
00:59:50,339 --> 00:59:52,559
so we weren't physically connected to

1421
00:59:52,559 --> 00:59:55,859
the Box we used a tool called termias to

1422
00:59:55,859 --> 00:59:59,460
actually gain the SSH access to do the

1423
00:59:59,460 --> 01:00:02,400
vi manipulation of the file we then

1424
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:04,200
brought up the web interface and we had

1425
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:06,599
complete and total access to the box and

1426
01:00:06,599 --> 01:00:08,460
that that attack would have a could have

1427
01:00:08,460 --> 01:00:10,680
occurred in the supply chain

1428
01:00:10,680 --> 01:00:13,200
now that's you know some folks say well

1429
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:15,059
okay you have to be within 30 40 feet

1430
01:00:15,059 --> 01:00:16,980
you know of the device to be able to do

1431
01:00:16,980 --> 01:00:18,480
that

1432
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:21,240
however that particular device also had

1433
01:00:21,240 --> 01:00:24,059
an LTE interface on it

1434
01:00:24,059 --> 01:00:26,520
so as I had mentioned previously when

1435
01:00:26,520 --> 01:00:28,140
you're when you're looking at that LTE

1436
01:00:28,140 --> 01:00:29,460
capability

1437
01:00:29,460 --> 01:00:33,540
if that LTE has a public IP address and

1438
01:00:33,540 --> 01:00:36,000
let's say the attacker in the supply

1439
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,640
chain is able to identify that they have

1440
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:40,500
a root user on your box they have access

1441
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:42,540
to your box they own you

1442
01:00:42,540 --> 01:00:44,760
so

1443
01:00:44,760 --> 01:00:47,480
yes sir

1444
01:00:48,079 --> 01:00:51,299
how long did it take to actually execute

1445
01:00:51,299 --> 01:00:56,240
the the to execute it took about

1446
01:00:56,460 --> 01:00:58,200
10 minutes

1447
01:00:58,200 --> 01:01:01,079
the because the once the root user was

1448
01:01:01,079 --> 01:01:05,700
on there the the process of SSH into the

1449
01:01:05,700 --> 01:01:07,859
box very short very quick

1450
01:01:07,859 --> 01:01:12,480
the process of using VI to change the

1451
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:15,540
root username very short very quick and

1452
01:01:15,540 --> 01:01:17,099
and that's the reason we used Root and

1453
01:01:17,099 --> 01:01:19,260
root one is because all we had to do was

1454
01:01:19,260 --> 01:01:20,880
pull the one out of one name and put the

1455
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:23,040
one into the other name and then we had

1456
01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:26,940
access uh I said utilizing VI on an

1457
01:01:26,940 --> 01:01:29,579
iPhone not always the easiest thing to

1458
01:01:29,579 --> 01:01:32,280
do but using that technique it didn't

1459
01:01:32,280 --> 01:01:35,280
take very long and then in that

1460
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:38,819
particular instance we were not able to

1461
01:01:38,819 --> 01:01:42,859
acquire access through the LTE interface

1462
01:01:42,859 --> 01:01:47,280
simply because the vendor for that

1463
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:49,160
particular device

1464
01:01:49,160 --> 01:01:51,720
did not have

1465
01:01:51,720 --> 01:01:55,200
LTE functionality at the location in

1466
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:56,460
which we were working

1467
01:01:56,460 --> 01:01:58,680
however as I mentioned with with the

1468
01:01:58,680 --> 01:02:00,180
other device where we did actually find

1469
01:02:00,180 --> 01:02:02,640
an IP we were able to get into it you

1470
01:02:02,640 --> 01:02:04,680
know it is certainly a a plausible

1471
01:02:04,680 --> 01:02:07,680
scenario

1472
01:02:09,020 --> 01:02:11,520
so I said that that was one of the

1473
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:13,200
really fun ones I don't really like that

1474
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:14,180
one

1475
01:02:14,180 --> 01:02:17,040
so uh any other questions before we

1476
01:02:17,040 --> 01:02:18,540
before we move on

1477
01:02:18,540 --> 01:02:20,099
I can't really see the folks back there

1478
01:02:20,099 --> 01:02:22,640
so well

1479
01:02:32,180 --> 01:02:37,920
hi um when do you know not to trust the

1480
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:42,180
the shell in the embedded device and you

1481
01:02:42,180 --> 01:02:43,980
have to go no I'm going to pull it from

1482
01:02:43,980 --> 01:02:45,480
the hardware

1483
01:02:45,480 --> 01:02:47,220
like using

1484
01:02:47,220 --> 01:02:50,579
direct access to the chip yes okay so

1485
01:02:50,579 --> 01:02:52,260
that's that's actually a very good very

1486
01:02:52,260 --> 01:02:53,760
good question because that is something

1487
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:56,520
that we have actually done on several

1488
01:02:56,520 --> 01:02:59,819
recent engagements where we have we've

1489
01:02:59,819 --> 01:03:01,200
gone into the device and essentially

1490
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:02,579
pulled the cover off

1491
01:03:02,579 --> 01:03:04,799
now in in those particular instances

1492
01:03:04,799 --> 01:03:06,260
because

1493
01:03:06,260 --> 01:03:09,119
there were restrictions on utilizing the

1494
01:03:09,119 --> 01:03:12,240
shell and there were restrictions on

1495
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:14,880
physical damage to the device we were

1496
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:16,500
actually able to identify a technique

1497
01:03:16,500 --> 01:03:20,400
where you can take a a chip clip and you

1498
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:22,400
could actually place it on the device

1499
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:24,960
utilizing that you can hardwire it into

1500
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:27,000
a programmer and you can actually pull

1501
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,760
the program from the device that way

1502
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:32,640
so now in that particular instance the

1503
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:35,819
information that we pulled was only log

1504
01:03:35,819 --> 01:03:39,780
data so that particular IC was only log

1505
01:03:39,780 --> 01:03:43,740
data we're not able to access the the

1506
01:03:43,740 --> 01:03:46,619
actual flash device because it was on

1507
01:03:46,619 --> 01:03:50,460
the other side of the PC board and they

1508
01:03:50,460 --> 01:03:52,859
had used compression fittings to hold

1509
01:03:52,859 --> 01:03:55,500
the PC board onto the device because we

1510
01:03:55,500 --> 01:03:57,660
were not allowed to do any physical

1511
01:03:57,660 --> 01:03:59,700
damage to the device we couldn't

1512
01:03:59,700 --> 01:04:01,980
actually flip it over however being able

1513
01:04:01,980 --> 01:04:04,559
to gain that type of information is

1514
01:04:04,559 --> 01:04:06,720
certainly plausible with with that type

1515
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:08,220
of technique and we have done it on

1516
01:04:08,220 --> 01:04:10,879
numerous occasions

1517
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:14,880
right Aslam from miter uh quick question

1518
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:18,119
you mentioned that given the number of

1519
01:04:18,119 --> 01:04:21,299
divers endpoint types in the ICS

1520
01:04:21,299 --> 01:04:23,119
environment

1521
01:04:23,119 --> 01:04:26,579
the tools are very important in this

1522
01:04:26,579 --> 01:04:30,180
whole process dfir process do you have a

1523
01:04:30,180 --> 01:04:34,920
list of type of tools that would be

1524
01:04:34,920 --> 01:04:36,359
desired

1525
01:04:36,359 --> 01:04:41,099
also does mandian provide any kind of

1526
01:04:41,099 --> 01:04:45,059
tools to assist the dfir process

1527
01:04:45,059 --> 01:04:47,880
yes there are there are definitely uh

1528
01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:51,059
tooling that that we utilize to support

1529
01:04:51,059 --> 01:04:53,839
the dfir process

1530
01:04:53,839 --> 01:04:56,099
a few screens back we were actually

1531
01:04:56,099 --> 01:04:59,760
looking at the you know the listing of a

1532
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:02,099
few of the tools that we had actually

1533
01:05:02,099 --> 01:05:03,380
provided

1534
01:05:03,380 --> 01:05:06,599
for public use there are a number of

1535
01:05:06,599 --> 01:05:10,260
other tools so right now that the names

1536
01:05:10,260 --> 01:05:12,780
just start popping into my head it's

1537
01:05:12,780 --> 01:05:15,059
certainly something that if if you'd

1538
01:05:15,059 --> 01:05:18,180
like to send me an email about those

1539
01:05:18,180 --> 01:05:19,819
type of tools I'd be happy to respond

1540
01:05:19,819 --> 01:05:23,579
and provide you with what I can find in

1541
01:05:23,579 --> 01:05:25,079
most cases when I'm looking for those

1542
01:05:25,079 --> 01:05:27,960
types of tools I am both to admit it but

1543
01:05:27,960 --> 01:05:31,140
I will admit it I just go ask Chris so

1544
01:05:31,140 --> 01:05:33,799
the so

1545
01:05:33,799 --> 01:05:38,460
he he has he has a very uncanny memory

1546
01:05:38,460 --> 01:05:41,220
he he remembers all of these things in

1547
01:05:41,220 --> 01:05:43,140
fact I was we were having a conversation

1548
01:05:43,140 --> 01:05:45,480
the other day about the you know the

1549
01:05:45,480 --> 01:05:48,140
issues with cabling and the potential

1550
01:05:48,140 --> 01:05:50,520
for you know the cables to have actually

1551
01:05:50,520 --> 01:05:53,640
have a mismatch in the wiring and he was

1552
01:05:53,640 --> 01:05:56,160
actually giving me the pin out for a GE

1553
01:05:56,160 --> 01:05:58,079
cable and the changes that they had made

1554
01:05:58,079 --> 01:06:00,420
to make it proprietary that he had used

1555
01:06:00,420 --> 01:06:04,260
years ago and so uh like I say Chris is

1556
01:06:04,260 --> 01:06:06,780
definitely a a resource that that we

1557
01:06:06,780 --> 01:06:08,299
lean on very heavily

1558
01:06:08,299 --> 01:06:11,280
but yeah send me an email and I will

1559
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:12,420
definitely be able to get that

1560
01:06:12,420 --> 01:06:15,200
information to you

1561
01:06:20,040 --> 01:06:22,680
so here we were talking about the you

1562
01:06:22,680 --> 01:06:25,319
know data collection and it's very

1563
01:06:25,319 --> 01:06:27,960
important to actually perform the data

1564
01:06:27,960 --> 01:06:30,599
collection exercises in some cases

1565
01:06:30,599 --> 01:06:32,940
bringing in you know your IR responders

1566
01:06:32,940 --> 01:06:36,599
if they're not in-house if you utilize

1567
01:06:36,599 --> 01:06:38,520
uh you know certain organizations under

1568
01:06:38,520 --> 01:06:41,339
contract not only do these exercises

1569
01:06:41,339 --> 01:06:45,539
provide the ability to you know identify

1570
01:06:45,539 --> 01:06:47,640
and test specific devices that are in

1571
01:06:47,640 --> 01:06:48,960
the field ensuring that you have the

1572
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:51,660
proper software you have the proper

1573
01:06:51,660 --> 01:06:55,859
connectivity but they also provide an

1574
01:06:55,859 --> 01:06:58,740
opportunity to familiarize the IR

1575
01:06:58,740 --> 01:07:01,500
responder with the environment in which

1576
01:07:01,500 --> 01:07:03,359
these tests are going to be undertaken

1577
01:07:03,359 --> 01:07:07,200
and that is very important when you're

1578
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:10,980
trying to execute an IR engagement very

1579
01:07:10,980 --> 01:07:13,559
quickly it is particularly important

1580
01:07:13,559 --> 01:07:18,059
when that type of ir engagement is being

1581
01:07:18,059 --> 01:07:19,160
done

1582
01:07:19,160 --> 01:07:24,960
on a on a pipeline that is 35 miles from

1583
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:28,280
the nearest town and it is six degrees

1584
01:07:28,280 --> 01:07:31,140
so I said you're not necessarily doing

1585
01:07:31,140 --> 01:07:33,599
the test on that specific device but

1586
01:07:33,599 --> 01:07:36,599
having the the learnings from those

1587
01:07:36,599 --> 01:07:39,660
types of exercises is going to be very

1588
01:07:39,660 --> 01:07:41,160
important

1589
01:07:41,160 --> 01:07:43,500
you want to be sure to exercise The

1590
01:07:43,500 --> 01:07:45,960
Collection processes the potential

1591
01:07:45,960 --> 01:07:48,559
impact of that process

1592
01:07:48,559 --> 01:07:51,660
for example we had one one instance

1593
01:07:51,660 --> 01:07:52,980
where we were actually doing an

1594
01:07:52,980 --> 01:07:56,640
engagement and they stood up a lab with

1595
01:07:56,640 --> 01:07:58,020
which the act with the actual

1596
01:07:58,020 --> 01:08:00,480
configurations for the devices that were

1597
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:04,260
in the field because the

1598
01:08:04,260 --> 01:08:07,020
the worry was that we could have

1599
01:08:07,020 --> 01:08:09,660
potentially uh negatively impacted that

1600
01:08:09,660 --> 01:08:12,000
system uh and that worry was actually

1601
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:13,559
justified in that particular case

1602
01:08:13,559 --> 01:08:15,299
because what we were actually able to do

1603
01:08:15,299 --> 01:08:17,640
was we were able to actually insert a

1604
01:08:17,640 --> 01:08:23,040
hub into the connection between the PLC

1605
01:08:23,040 --> 01:08:27,238
and the HMI we were able to collect the

1606
01:08:27,238 --> 01:08:28,679
messages that were being sent down from

1607
01:08:28,679 --> 01:08:31,738
the HMI we were able to reverse engineer

1608
01:08:31,738 --> 01:08:33,960
the protocol that was used and that

1609
01:08:33,960 --> 01:08:36,299
actually took less than a day we were

1610
01:08:36,299 --> 01:08:38,640
able to create a fake message which

1611
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:41,399
allowed us to modify a set point

1612
01:08:41,399 --> 01:08:43,799
generate the proper CRC that caused the

1613
01:08:43,799 --> 01:08:46,140
device to accept it and actually modify

1614
01:08:46,140 --> 01:08:48,479
that set point so we were able to not

1615
01:08:48,479 --> 01:08:50,460
only demonstrate the capability of

1616
01:08:50,460 --> 01:08:52,920
gaining access to the device for IR

1617
01:08:52,920 --> 01:08:55,679
purposes but we were also able to

1618
01:08:55,679 --> 01:08:57,899
demonstrate the ability that an attacker

1619
01:08:57,899 --> 01:09:00,120
would have to negatively impact that

1620
01:09:00,120 --> 01:09:01,140
system

1621
01:09:01,140 --> 01:09:03,719
utilizing capabilities which are not

1622
01:09:03,719 --> 01:09:06,960
monitored by the IDS there were no logs

1623
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:08,520
there were no

1624
01:09:08,520 --> 01:09:11,279
no alerts for that there were no alarms

1625
01:09:11,279 --> 01:09:13,979
one of the things that we also noted was

1626
01:09:13,979 --> 01:09:16,439
that the HMI that they were utilizing

1627
01:09:16,439 --> 01:09:18,359
didn't tell them that the information

1628
01:09:18,359 --> 01:09:21,600
that they pulled from the PLC had

1629
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:23,819
actually changed so if they were not

1630
01:09:23,819 --> 01:09:25,859
actually watching that specific screen

1631
01:09:25,859 --> 01:09:28,020
and that was one of maybe 80 screens

1632
01:09:28,020 --> 01:09:31,140
that they would not know that that value

1633
01:09:31,140 --> 01:09:33,179
had actually been modified

1634
01:09:33,179 --> 01:09:35,819
and so doing those types of exercises

1635
01:09:35,819 --> 01:09:38,640
are actually very important not only for

1636
01:09:38,640 --> 01:09:41,460
the value that they add to the IR

1637
01:09:41,460 --> 01:09:43,620
process but also for ancillary

1638
01:09:43,620 --> 01:09:45,060
informations that you can get out of

1639
01:09:45,060 --> 01:09:47,120
that

1640
01:09:49,439 --> 01:09:53,040
so here as we had talked about the the

1641
01:09:53,040 --> 01:09:55,380
the different types of physical data

1642
01:09:55,380 --> 01:09:57,960
we've already talked about this to a

1643
01:09:57,960 --> 01:10:00,239
certain extent so I will not go over

1644
01:10:00,239 --> 01:10:03,239
this again I will however mention like I

1645
01:10:03,239 --> 01:10:04,980
said the PPE again like I said we talked

1646
01:10:04,980 --> 01:10:07,860
about the the Basia and the Hewitt and

1647
01:10:07,860 --> 01:10:09,960
those types of things but they're also

1648
01:10:09,960 --> 01:10:11,699
much simpler things which will actually

1649
01:10:11,699 --> 01:10:14,480
keep you out of a site so for example

1650
01:10:14,480 --> 01:10:17,219
you're walking into a site with steel

1651
01:10:17,219 --> 01:10:22,199
steel toed boots that are the green

1652
01:10:22,199 --> 01:10:24,360
green diamond certified so that's

1653
01:10:24,360 --> 01:10:26,880
puncture resistant but if you're at a

1654
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:29,219
site up in Canada if you don't have the

1655
01:10:29,219 --> 01:10:31,219
orange Omega on there which is actually

1656
01:10:31,219 --> 01:10:35,400
a a qualification for dissipation of

1657
01:10:35,400 --> 01:10:37,620
electricity through the ground they're

1658
01:10:37,620 --> 01:10:38,699
not actually going to let you in the

1659
01:10:38,699 --> 01:10:40,500
building and it didn't matter that it

1660
01:10:40,500 --> 01:10:42,060
wasn't a substation it was their

1661
01:10:42,060 --> 01:10:44,940
requirement and so it was one of those

1662
01:10:44,940 --> 01:10:46,800
things where you know you had to go out

1663
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:48,780
Unfortunately they actually knew of a

1664
01:10:48,780 --> 01:10:49,860
supplier

1665
01:10:49,860 --> 01:10:51,719
there's only about 40 miles away you

1666
01:10:51,719 --> 01:10:55,080
drive out there get the right get the

1667
01:10:55,080 --> 01:10:56,699
right shoes and then you can get back in

1668
01:10:56,699 --> 01:10:59,159
and you can start working on it but you

1669
01:10:59,159 --> 01:11:00,420
know those types of things definitely

1670
01:11:00,420 --> 01:11:03,120
need to be a consideration we we

1671
01:11:03,120 --> 01:11:05,580
constantly run into those types of

1672
01:11:05,580 --> 01:11:07,140
issues

1673
01:11:07,140 --> 01:11:09,620
again here's a you know high level

1674
01:11:09,620 --> 01:11:13,080
look at some of the the physical data

1675
01:11:13,080 --> 01:11:16,679
that that you can look to collect uh you

1676
01:11:16,679 --> 01:11:17,880
know certainly these slides will be

1677
01:11:17,880 --> 01:11:19,260
available so if there's information you

1678
01:11:19,260 --> 01:11:20,520
want to get out of here

1679
01:11:20,520 --> 01:11:22,980
and if there's additional information

1680
01:11:22,980 --> 01:11:25,580
additional Insight that you would like

1681
01:11:25,580 --> 01:11:28,260
related to you know the collection of

1682
01:11:28,260 --> 01:11:31,020
any of these types of information if

1683
01:11:31,020 --> 01:11:33,540
you'd like additional information about

1684
01:11:33,540 --> 01:11:37,140
some of the specific instances of

1685
01:11:37,140 --> 01:11:40,199
equipment that we have seen some of the

1686
01:11:40,199 --> 01:11:42,000
special techniques some of the special

1687
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,520
care that we've had to go through uh you

1688
01:11:44,520 --> 01:11:45,900
know certainly those are questions that

1689
01:11:45,900 --> 01:11:47,300
we can answer

1690
01:11:47,300 --> 01:11:51,179
and as we work through this you know I'd

1691
01:11:51,179 --> 01:11:53,040
also like to note that we are in the

1692
01:11:53,040 --> 01:11:55,100
process of

1693
01:11:55,100 --> 01:12:01,020
revamping our dfir for plc's class that

1694
01:12:01,020 --> 01:12:03,120
is a class which is specific to the

1695
01:12:03,120 --> 01:12:05,219
plc's this is not as we talked about

1696
01:12:05,219 --> 01:12:08,040
earlier this is not another

1697
01:12:08,040 --> 01:12:10,860
you know cyber security for ICS or

1698
01:12:10,860 --> 01:12:13,260
digital forensics for ICS this is

1699
01:12:13,260 --> 01:12:16,400
specific to those level one type devices

1700
01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:19,140
and a lot of the the tools and the

1701
01:12:19,140 --> 01:12:20,400
techniques that you would be able to

1702
01:12:20,400 --> 01:12:22,440
utilize in that process

1703
01:12:22,440 --> 01:12:25,860
so as we revamp that you'll be seeing

1704
01:12:25,860 --> 01:12:28,260
additional information coming out

1705
