1
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:08,080
hey folks

2
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,320
happy wednesday we have two small

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,920
corrections that we need to make before

4
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,799
we get started uh the first as you saw

5
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:18,080
on the board still had patrick's name

6
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,400
patrick was not able to join us but we

7
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,720
were super fortunate that danielle from

8
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:26,960
nozomi was gracious enough to step in

9
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,439
secondly is that i have a small personal

10
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:31,840
correction to make i actually as some of

11
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,520
you may know left schneider very

12
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,399
recently today is my third official day

13
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:38,399
as the new product security research

14
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:40,640
manager for rockwell automation

15
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,879
so this session is not just a panel

16
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:48,640
it is now also a factory talk

17
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:50,399
you knew that was coming

18
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:53,360
so anyways to get started what we're

19
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,520
talking about here is going to be

20
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,440
how do we navigate international law

21
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,160
when it comes to cyber conflict

22
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,079
this session was initially accepted by

23
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:04,400
dale about a year ago for

24
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,680
the what was supposed to be the s4 2021

25
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,520
and i was really concerned when it got

26
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,880
accepted that this was going to be too

27
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,560
dry it was going to be too academic we

28
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,040
hadn't really seen a specific

29
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,479
nation state ics tailored malware

30
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:20,960
really since triton and i had a lot of

31
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,960
anxiety about you know how how

32
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,479
interesting is this talk even going to

33
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:25,439
be

34
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:27,360
and then the past two weeks happened as

35
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,040
proof that someone upstairs has a real

36
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,720
sense of humor about the things that i

37
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,400
worry about

38
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,640
so we're going to go over some very

39
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,720
short basics to some of you this is

40
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,320
going to be

41
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,320
old hat you know it very well but just

42
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,680
to make sure that everyone is on the

43
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,159
same page uh this is for the benefit of

44
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,479
the folks next to you who have never

45
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:48,320
seen these things before so these are

46
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,799
just some basic principles to lay the

47
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:52,560
groundwork for the rest of this panel

48
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,399
about what we mean when we talk about

49
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:56,880
different principles of international

50
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,040
law when it comes to conflict

51
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,200
so the first one is distinction

52
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,360
this is basically the obligation on the

53
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:07,280
part of a participant in a conflict to

54
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,679
at all times make a differentiation

55
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:11,680
between who is a civilian

56
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,879
and what is a military objective

57
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:17,440
there is a lesser extent of this that is

58
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,560
also

59
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,360
important in very specific circumstances

60
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,920
that deals with the obligation of

61
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,599
combatants to also

62
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:27,920
specifically distinguish themselves as

63
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,599
combatants which we can get to a little

64
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:32,879
bit more in the panel discussion

65
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,319
the next one is going to be

66
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:36,000
proportionality this one gets

67
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,680
misunderstood a lot this one gets

68
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,000
misconstrued sometimes as

69
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,200
a proportional response which it is not

70
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,440
what this is dealing with is

71
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,640
if i am going to plan out a military

72
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:52,800
objective the perceived potential for

73
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,480
civilian cost

74
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,480
can't outweigh

75
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,040
what is sort of the expected military

76
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,159
gain of that so if joe sloick's house is

77
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:04,400
my objective i can't take out all of

78
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,760
albuquerque

79
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,239
that would not be a proportional

80
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:10,560
sort of military move

81
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,280
the next one is necessity so you have to

82
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,519
actually be able to show that you you

83
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:16,879
have a

84
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:20,080
an arguable need to you know sort of go

85
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,840
after whatever you're going after when

86
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,120
it comes to the the conflict at play so

87
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,040
uh you know you have a battalion over

88
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,959
here that is you know potentially

89
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:30,959
cutting off a road so

90
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:32,640
we're going to go after that battalion

91
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,799
because you know sort of as part of this

92
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:37,840
conflict that is uh strategically

93
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,360
important

94
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,840
those three really govern sort of once

95
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,440
you're in the mix once you're in the

96
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,760
conflict sort of what your boundaries

97
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:46,879
are

98
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:49,680
the last one is really defining how you

99
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,560
can move into that conflict space so

100
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,239
under what circumstances you are

101
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:56,480
actually allowed to start a war more or

102
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,439
less

103
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:00,480
and it really comes down to self-defense

104
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,280
at you know both the macro level from a

105
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,519
state perspective and then sort of down

106
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:06,959
from on there

107
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:09,519
so those are really just the baseline

108
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:11,439
principles um the real spark notes

109
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:13,439
versions of what we're going to be

110
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:15,760
talking about today and i'm super

111
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,759
excited to introduce both of my lovely

112
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:19,918
panelists we put joe in the middle to

113
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:21,918
make joe happy

114
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:24,560
so we can start with you joe i know mine

115
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,280
was the only one that we had recorded so

116
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,840
if you both would like to start off with

117
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,479
sort of who you are where you work and

118
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:34,400
we can get started from there

119
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,520
hi i am joe sloick i currently lead

120
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,520
threat detections and

121
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,520
threat intelligence information type

122
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,919
intelligence analysis at gigamon been

123
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:45,680
there for about a year now so you might

124
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,600
not be familiar with me at that location

125
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,600
i also do consulting and training for a

126
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,479
company called paralysis

127
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:54,400
i'm danielle jabansky i'm an ot cyber

128
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,400
security strategist with nozomi networks

129
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,680
and a non-resident fellow with the

130
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,759
atlantic council focused on operational

131
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,440
technology cyber security

132
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,400
and i'm super happy to be here with you

133
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,120
all

134
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,639
yeah and for those of you who aren't

135
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,720
aware this also this setup is also a

136
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,400
very thing one thing too in cat in the

137
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,560
hat with me and danielle

138
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,000
so the way that we're going to structure

139
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,080
this panel if i still have slides do i

140
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,199
not still have slides you still have

141
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:16,639
slides you got them i still have slides

142
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:18,560
there we go i still have slides

143
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,400
is we are going to basically pose uh

144
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,800
what we felt were three three big

145
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,639
problems when we are approaching

146
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,479
international conflict through the lens

147
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:29,199
of

148
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:31,199
uh you know international humanitarian

149
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:33,759
law and the law of armed conflict and so

150
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:35,680
the first one which i'm going to let you

151
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,360
lead off with joe

152
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,800
is that when we look at the cyber domain

153
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,440
reconnaissance for a destructive

154
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,160
destructive attack can look

155
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,039
very similar if not identical to sort of

156
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:51,600
run-of-the-mill cyber espionage

157
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,639
so

158
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:55,600
where in the attack chain

159
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,080
do we start looking at

160
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,800
applying international law

161
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,520
to sort of cyber network attacks and

162
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,759
cyber network operations well that's an

163
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:07,120
excellent question because i would argue

164
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,560
that right now we just really don't know

165
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,000
because these items overlap

166
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,160
significantly especially as you start

167
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,960
taking a

168
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:16,560
non-unitary view of how cyber operations

169
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,039
take place that the sorts of access

170
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:20,639
technique development and even

171
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:23,360
deployment that would be necessary

172
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,520
sorry thanks the types of access that

173
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,080
would be necessary for a intelligence

174
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,840
operation are really quite similar to

175
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,319
those that would be necessary for then a

176
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:34,400
kinetic effects or disruptive effects

177
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,000
sort of operation so for example we

178
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,680
could look at something like nobelium

179
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,680
the solarwinds microsoft

180
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,680
event which was very widespread did not

181
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,160
result in any known disruptive effects

182
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,919
but very easily could have transitioned

183
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:47,600
into that whereas you know looking at

184
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,280
the various wipers that have taken place

185
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,199
in ukraine since

186
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:52,960
last month two months ago it's been

187
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,520
going on a while now at this point um

188
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:58,000
you know fairly blunt instrument tools

189
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,520
but in order to get in place to deliver

190
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,039
those wipers you would need to proceed

191
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:02,960
through an intrusion that could just as

192
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,440
easily be used to dump the databases

193
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,599
from the ukrainian uh motor vehicle

194
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:09,360
registration service as well as then

195
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,680
wiping them afterwards so that dual use

196
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,759
tension which we've seen in activities

197
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:16,720
like dragonfly the subsequent palmetto

198
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,720
fusion campaigns represent very

199
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,919
difficult

200
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:22,319
items for us to parse because at what

201
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:24,240
point does that adversary switch over

202
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,599
and you could make an argument at this

203
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:27,120
case and i would sometimes that this is

204
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,960
where attribution does actually matter

205
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,720
and that having some

206
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,880
sense of who the adversary is and what

207
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,880
that adversary's mission or purpose

208
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,360
might be can serve a vital function in

209
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,199
trying to differentiate this is just an

210
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:41,199
espionage group versus this is sandworm

211
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:43,280
team which we know very well is

212
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,240
associated with these sorts of actions

213
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,080
perfect and then danielle i'd love to

214
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,520
give you a chance to respond and add

215
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,360
your thoughts to that as well

216
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,520
um so on the adversarial intent and

217
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,960
distinction part i think it gets into

218
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,199
the next topic which is

219
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:58,879
what what defines a combatant in

220
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:01,440
cyberspace um and that distinction now

221
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,440
has moved away from who you are and what

222
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,680
you care about to what you target and

223
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,440
what the impact is of that target and so

224
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,360
i think that that actually to joe's

225
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,840
point makes attribution count even more

226
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,319
as a political message and norm setting

227
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:16,800
capability to say i don't care who you

228
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,800
believe in and what your freedom flag is

229
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,800
but if you target these things and do x

230
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,720
y and z in terms of effects

231
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,319
that's going to be a problem for the

232
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,400
world so

233
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,919
and i guess one final point on this

234
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:29,199
because i think this is a very important

235
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:31,199
topic when talking about this sort of

236
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:32,640
sense when we start moving away from

237
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,559
just general i.t operations and into

238
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:37,120
industrial environments there's also a

239
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,519
very important distinction between

240
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,519
what are intentional effects and because

241
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:42,799
we're talking about environments that

242
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,320
have a certain degree of fragility to

243
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,279
them

244
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:48,000
when do adversaries screw up and cause a

245
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
disruption inadvertently which we may

246
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,920
have seen previously if we look at

247
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:55,040
something like the very murky

248
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,200
german steel mill incident from 2014 on

249
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,399
which we still don't have much in the

250
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:00,560
way of detail but

251
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,240
looks like it may have been even just an

252
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,680
accident potentially as opposed to a

253
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,440
very deliberate operation and

254
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,720
potentially looking at that but an

255
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,920
adversary that accesses a that accesses

256
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:10,720
a

257
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,519
you know plc to dump configurations for

258
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:14,800
whatever reason

259
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,560
and knocks over the device resulting in

260
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,959
disruption have they just inadvertently

261
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:21,760
strayed into being a combatant or as

262
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,440
previously they were operating under

263
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,600
something more akin to like u.s title 50

264
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,000
authorities so to speak sure so also

265
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,680
similar to the a little bit to the

266
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,760
colonial incident where you know not

267
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,240
necessarily apts but you had a

268
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,800
ransomware group go after you know who

269
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,600
they thought was just sort of a

270
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,680
financially high value target and then

271
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,160
it very quickly became a good bit more

272
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,920
than that

273
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,240
so awesome the the next

274
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,399
uh problem set that we are going to look

275
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:53,040
at is who is a combatant under

276
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,360
international law you know it's

277
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,120
these laws were written back when we

278
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,959
were dealing with you know sort of very

279
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:01,120
traditional kinetic warfare

280
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,680
and combatants wore uniforms and they

281
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,800
moved in you know formations and now we

282
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,560
are you know in this sort of brave new

283
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,160
day and age where

284
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,920
you know a combatant is behind the

285
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,040
keyboard a world away and they may be a

286
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,000
direct

287
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,800
state-sponsored individual or they may

288
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,240
just be sort of

289
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,519
you know there's the whole spectrum of

290
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:23,920
you know state tolerated state aligned

291
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,880
uh so i would love to uh danny let you

292
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,519
take the first stab at this uh under

293
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:32,640
international law sort of how wide do we

294
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,560
spread the umbrella for who should be

295
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,760
considered

296
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,880
you know a combatant party to a conflict

297
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,240
yeah and for the record maggie's the

298
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,600
only person who's allowed to call me

299
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,640
danny uh on the earth

300
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,800
so the definition right becomes a

301
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,560
combatant that's part of an armed forces

302
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,240
typically in an armed conflict and we

303
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,079
obviously don't see armed conflict in

304
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:54,399
the same sense in in cyber operations

305
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:55,680
and that's because the individuals

306
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,920
involved in those operations are fluid

307
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,320
and conditional but the thing we forget

308
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,640
is that they also have targets and so

309
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,079
they don't throw darts at a wall

310
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:05,839
typically there are some low-hanging

311
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:07,200
fruit that we like to talk about that

312
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,120
are opportunistic attacks but the most

313
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,279
sophisticated and resourced ones focus

314
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:12,800
on targets and so i think the

315
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,040
definitional considerations aside the

316
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,320
targets become

317
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,560
the main important factor and where

318
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,240
military targets are an extension of

319
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,480
warfare i think critical infrastructure

320
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,480
targets are an extension of civil

321
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,399
society and civil society is an

322
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:27,680
indicator of whether or not you live in

323
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,839
a fragile or stable state

324
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:30,720
um

325
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,240
less so than whether or not your country

326
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,480
is at war either home or abroad and so

327
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,800
back to the the combatant status you

328
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,800
know what do they target and why and

329
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,160
what effect does that have in civil

330
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,160
society i think is a whole nother realm

331
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,320
of truth that we have to unpack but at

332
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,959
the same time when you identify a target

333
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:48,560
and spend all of your time and resources

334
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,480
and energy we pretend that there aren't

335
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,959
actual rules of engagement and there are

336
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:55,680
there are red lines so to speak in those

337
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,440
operational engagements and environments

338
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,440
that we're not privy to that sometimes

339
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:03,279
result in accidents but also you know

340
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:05,200
coordinate those attacks to say well we

341
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,959
shouldn't do x y and z because we know

342
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:08,720
the potential ramifications but we

343
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,639
pretend that it's all sort of ad hoc and

344
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:12,639
not well planned out which is ironic to

345
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:14,320
me because then we talk about the most

346
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,079
sophisticated and tailored tailored

347
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:18,560
attacks requiring all of these resources

348
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,079
and things like that so just because the

349
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:21,600
rules of engagement for combatants and

350
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,880
cyber aren't written down somewhere in

351
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,399
geneva doesn't mean that they don't

352
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:25,920
exist and i would love joe's response to

353
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,200
this because i've actually seen

354
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,760
offensive cyber actors in different

355
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,600
countries say that that's a good thing

356
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,480
because

357
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,000
as soon as you write down those red

358
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
lines you might actually create a false

359
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,040
crisis by having them you know trip a

360
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:42,000
wire that would potentially not be

361
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,160
like not necessitate a big conflict and

362
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,760
my favorite example before i get joe's

363
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,279
response because i see him chomping at

364
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:48,560
the bit

365
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,920
is

366
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,600
the united states beyond international

367
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,360
law takes combatants and breaks them

368
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,040
down into lawful and unlawful and

369
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,200
unlawful will capture terrorism and when

370
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,680
the conti group came out and said our

371
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,279
objectives are on behalf of a certain

372
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:03,040
nation-state that we

373
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,959
are warm with

374
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:06,800
everyone that had studied any of these

375
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,000
topics said

376
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,600
i don't think that's the flex you think

377
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,560
it is

378
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,240
and it took i think like a couple of

379
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,399
hours for them to recant their statement

380
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:16,720
and say oh no no no we didn't mean that

381
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,480
we are still operating in this fluid and

382
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,079
conditional environment along the

383
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:22,480
spectrum of you don't know who we are

384
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,160
and you will only hunt us down if we do

385
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,160
something really really really bad which

386
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,360
is still true

387
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,959
so

388
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:30,560
so another perspective on this as well

389
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,360
and all excellent points danielle

390
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,959
but uh

391
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:37,120
looking you know for example taking into

392
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,120
consideration the most recent item of

393
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,360
interest in controller pipe dream the

394
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,800
chernovite group and drawing a

395
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,320
distinction that was made already this

396
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,160
morning between having a access

397
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,160
development team versus an effects team

398
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,839
it's also important to note that we have

399
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:51,519
things like development teams which

400
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:53,920
maybe this trinovite entity really is

401
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,600
the development team given that we only

402
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,000
have leaked code of some sort as opposed

403
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,320
to an actual incident well if that's the

404
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,360
case

405
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,600
is ternavite a unlawful or an enemy

406
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,519
combatant of some sort sort if all they

407
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:07,360
did was develop some code that could do

408
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,639
some very nasty things but they were

409
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,560
never actually going to deploy it and we

410
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,240
can start taking this back a little bit

411
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,440
further by looking at you know for

412
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,320
example barry who works for raytheon is

413
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,720
a shit-hot developer and put together

414
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,240
some really interesting capability or

415
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,600
whatever and handed it over to the

416
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,519
military and then it's captain smith

417
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:25,360
that actually deployed it well if it

418
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,880
ends up knocking over a children's

419
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,800
hospital in the process and some people

420
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,959
non-combatants die is that captain

421
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:32,639
smith's fault for deploying it or is

422
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:34,560
barry who put this capability together

423
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,880
in the first place also having some sort

424
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,320
of blame over this and we can make the

425
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,760
argument about this like you don't blame

426
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,279
the weapons manufacturers when someone

427
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:44,160
drops a bomb but given the integration

428
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,079
and the especially from a threat

429
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:47,680
intelligence and a threat analysis

430
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,240
perspective how frequently we collapse

431
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,680
into each other and don't make very

432
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,160
useful distinctions between developers

433
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,240
access development teams and the actual

434
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,199
impacts teams the way that blame accrues

435
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:01,760
to our recruits to certain individuals

436
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,440
becomes very interesting so in looking

437
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,279
at xenotime for example from a few years

438
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,680
ago and the triton incident

439
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,160
schnickum the russian research institute

440
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,399
that was implicated as being involved

441
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:14,160
it's not necessarily proven that that

442
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,760
was the organization that executed the

443
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,839
operation but rather through indictments

444
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:19,519
and so forth it was shown that they were

445
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:23,120
certainly involved do they if say at the

446
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,959
facility where the triton incident took

447
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:27,040
place that if it had resulted in a loss

448
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,320
of life because of the impact to a

449
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,959
safety controller would schnickum as an

450
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:33,440
organization be responsible in some way

451
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,880
well as far as the u.s treasury is

452
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,600
concerned they thought yes and offact

453
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,519
them essentially which is a non-trivial

454
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,600
sort of thing so identifying roles and

455
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,040
responsibilities within the cyber

456
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:46,480
ecosystem uh is a interesting topic that

457
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,399
i don't think we've really explored that

458
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:49,680
much in trying to figure out who is

459
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,000
actually a combatant within these spaces

460
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,079
and all the insurers run out of the room

461
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:56,079
yeah i know

462
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:57,920
so and i think this is a really great

463
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,000
segue to the last slide about

464
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,600
approaching arms control and i would

465
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,800
like to

466
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,240
you know frame this in sort of the

467
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,480
traditional sense but also

468
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,079
tag team a little bit off of that

469
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:09,759
conversation

470
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:11,279
so you know sort of this is going to be

471
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:13,120
a twofold of

472
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,399
a

473
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:16,399
exactly this how do we look at doing

474
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:18,959
arms control for cyber security so

475
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:20,480
uh in

476
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,839
and i know everyone's going to blow up

477
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:23,920
the back channel when i say this uh but

478
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,880
in a case like stuxnet

479
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,880
where you know there were very specific

480
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,120
technical controls around that sort of

481
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:31,920
what

482
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,079
uh what that could be used for and in

483
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:36,320
what environments that could actually be

484
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,480
be viable

485
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,519
a

486
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:41,920
under international law do we do we feel

487
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,920
that there are sort of deep obligations

488
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,399
to put those sort of

489
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:50,560
bounds around the payloads so that they

490
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:53,600
the malware itself will apply or will

491
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,600
adhere to distinction

492
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,920
for the target environments for instance

493
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,079
within controller that it

494
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:02,160
didn't use a separate configuration file

495
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,520
it was actually hard-coded so that that

496
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,799
piece of code would only work in a

497
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:08,880
certain environment sort of thing

498
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,359
uh or do we think that you know back to

499
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:13,439
the weapons engineering

500
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:15,599
uh that you know it's sort of at mercy

501
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:17,280
of whoever deploys it

502
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,760
and then the the second part of this

503
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:23,199
that i would also like to pose to you is

504
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:26,079
do we think we're doing a good job in

505
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:28,240
how we're as we're approaching this with

506
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,919
cyber security

507
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:32,160
making sure that it matches backwards

508
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:35,120
that we're not inadvertently setting

509
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,200
precedents for cyber that are going to

510
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,440
translate you know back to barrie at

511
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:42,720
raytheon in in ways that

512
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,559
you know might have

513
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:47,679
been a little unforeseen or

514
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:49,760
might change the way that we look at

515
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,600
international law in ways that weren't

516
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,120
necessarily

517
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,280
a good and i'll let you take the first

518
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,679
step at that joe sure and i hear

519
00:17:57,679 --> 00:17:59,760
whenever you say cyber arms control or

520
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,120
whatever that you know automatically

521
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:04,000
people say wasanar and several cyber

522
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,440
twitter personalities or whatever

523
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,799
materialize from the either and start

524
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:09,440
yelling at you but in thinking through

525
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,200
this in a fairly objective manner

526
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,559
there's a lot of confusing bits about

527
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:14,160
this because for example in looking at

528
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,200
enablement tools things like or you know

529
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,440
products like cobalt strike which was

530
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,840
used in the triton event for example by

531
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,760
the adversary in that case in a very

532
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,520
specific sort of fashion and that has

533
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,200
come up in other actions as well that's

534
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,799
a commercial entity and if they're

535
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:30,320
enabling these sorts of items like what

536
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,000
sort of responsibility adheres to that

537
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,840
and is this something that deserves some

538
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,480
degree of control or do care in fairness

539
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,640
the organization that sells the product

540
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,720
does do stringent vetting of customers

541
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,559
but that doesn't prevent source code and

542
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,640
cracked versions from leaking online so

543
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,760
we start looking at things that are a

544
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,280
bit more capable

545
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,799
of trying to control access to some of

546
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:50,320
these items there's also a very

547
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,799
interesting

548
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,679
difference or distinction between not

549
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:57,600
just the offensive tool development and

550
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,000
actors using these items but also for

551
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,080
threat researchers and analysts for

552
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,880
presenting about these items and you

553
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,720
know one of the things like from the in

554
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,160
controller pipe dream like people are

555
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,440
asking like where are the samples like

556
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,400
well

557
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,840
probably shouldn't give you any samples

558
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,160
because this is a bad sort of thing that

559
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,559
could be used for very bad purposes or

560
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:18,080
whatever and as we've seen with other

561
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,240
things these items tend to leak very

562
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,640
widely and far once they begin some even

563
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,600
limited distribution and in those cases

564
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,480
does a mandiant rodregos or a silent

565
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,080
partner or whatever that acquired this

566
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,799
originally or schneider have some

567
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:34,559
responsibility then if these sorts of

568
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:36,960
items leak out and then get attached to

569
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,640
some other organization or this virus

570
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,320
total bear some responsibility if they

571
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,000
don't take these sorts of items down

572
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,600
because there was some controversy over

573
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,840
the triton framework when bits and

574
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,679
pieces of that slowly dribbled out into

575
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:50,080
commercial malware repositories is there

576
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:50,960
a

577
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,799
requirement or some sort of due

578
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:54,320
diligence on the part of these sorts of

579
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,840
providers in order to screen their

580
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:56,960
content for things that could

581
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:59,760
potentially be repackaged and reused for

582
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,520
these sorts of events i don't have

583
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:02,960
answers to these sorts of things because

584
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,640
i'm not that cool but these are

585
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:05,919
definitely questions that i don't think

586
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:08,159
it brought up often enough and they

587
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:09,679
could probably employ some lawyers for

588
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:11,280
quite a bit of time in order to try to

589
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,120
unravel what might take place not just

590
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,080
from a

591
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,080
legal you know loac sort of requirement

592
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,760
but also from a

593
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:18,840
uh

594
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:22,240
more you know potential opening oneself

595
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,919
up to lawsuits or other sorts of items

596
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:25,120
but i don't know danielle will correct

597
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,600
me now yeah and i i just realized real

598
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,919
quick uh that i misspoke i meant in

599
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:31,520
destroyer two not in controller but the

600
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,120
configuration file

601
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,640
i realized that after you started

602
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,120
talking so i didn't

603
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,400
don't be confused about that it was

604
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,440
industry or two that had the

605
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,440
configuration file hard coding

606
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,039
i think to go back to your question

607
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:44,000
about like whether or not we can

608
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,080
retrofit basically proportionality based

609
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,080
on impact the answer will always be

610
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,919
there are thresholds because every

611
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:53,200
operation will be fluid and conditional

612
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,679
um always both and so

613
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:58,000
i'll use a kind of cheesy

614
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,440
quote which is

615
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,880
in cyber we have to kind of wrap our

616
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,559
heads around the paradox of one man's

617
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:03,840
terrorist as another man's freedom

618
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:04,799
fighter

619
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:06,080
except

620
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,000
famously ronald reagan responded to that

621
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,240
and said but freedom fighters don't hold

622
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,640
societies don't terrorize societies into

623
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:15,360
submission and i think that was a hold

624
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,480
my beer

625
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,559
moment for cyber if you look back at

626
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:20,000
those kinds of quotes because they said

627
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,679
well we're not going to terrorize anyone

628
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:23,600
right they actually have limits to the

629
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,200
operations and the reason that we all

630
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,760
care about ics is because we like cyber

631
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,360
and we're nerds we also don't want to

632
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,400
see people die

633
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,480
and so that was almost an invitation of

634
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,480
well i won't terrorize populations i'm

635
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,679
going to be really careful not to take

636
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:38,080
out the hospital but in the interim in

637
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,360
the gray zone i'm going to do as much as

638
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,760
i possibly can to you know meet my

639
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,960
objectives that are written down

640
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,559
somewhere but you don't have them and so

641
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:46,320
you can't base any of your legal

642
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,720
ramifications or reactions on written

643
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,080
law and precedent because you don't have

644
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,679
intent to prosecute you don't have all

645
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:53,039
these things you need and on the

646
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:54,480
thresholds thing i always come back to

647
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,240
my nuclear weapons background which is

648
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,400
kim jong-un used a chemical weapon and

649
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,000
we didn't call it a wmd attack because

650
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,400
it didn't meet a threshold for that

651
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,760
capability

652
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,679
um but in cyber we can't regulate those

653
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:07,520
capabilities it has to be about impacts

654
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,520
and and maybe sometimes intent but if we

655
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,880
don't have that we just look at these

656
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,720
threshold of your impacts

657
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,159
and then again in nuclear which i would

658
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:15,840
never relate a cyber weapon or

659
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,240
capability to a nuclear weapon

660
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,159
but what we do there is we do fall out

661
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:22,240
data analysis so if you take out new

662
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,840
york city with a nuclear weapon there

663
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,039
are all these really smart people that

664
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:25,919
have looked at well what would the

665
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:27,520
impact be on financial markets what

666
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:28,720
would it look like for all these other

667
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,520
things and that impact analysis and that

668
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,440
fallout zone for the different kind of

669
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,360
ics attacks that we're starting to see

670
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,440
that really do zero in on those networks

671
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,200
that we care about for cyber physical

672
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,360
operations hasn't been done nobody's

673
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,960
done it and if it has been done it's

674
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,400
been done in a weird

675
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,559
statistical significance way where

676
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:48,240
typically things are skewed if you have

677
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,720
a big outlier incident and so then you

678
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,400
don't have really good significance in

679
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,400
your data and so it's a big open

680
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,000
question like joe started out with which

681
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,280
is we don't really know a lot about it

682
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:01,679
so agreed to a point but i would like to

683
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:03,520
just slightly push on one of the items

684
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,840
there is that i think we have

685
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,559
seen and maybe i have seen some evidence

686
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:10,080
of this sort of like battle damage

687
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,799
analysis and target tier work that we

688
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:14,400
see with you know putting together the

689
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,960
psyop for nuclear delivery in you know

690
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,600
u.s doctrine and so forth um i wouldn't

691
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,440
say that it doesn't happen in cyber i

692
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,960
would say it's just very unclear what

693
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,240
that looks like and where the limits get

694
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,559
drawn um

695
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:28,080
i don't know without getting into

696
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,720
background items um you know

697
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,960
the open question is whether or not that

698
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,720
sort of sense of due care and even just

699
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:38,320
trying extends to other entities like a

700
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,480
entity that would back door a piece of

701
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,880
accounting software and then unleash a

702
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,679
destructive worm that ends up wiping

703
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:47,600
organizations as far afield as denmark

704
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,279
the united kingdom and the united states

705
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:51,120
when aiming at ukraine so there's

706
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,760
certainly a bit of you know who's

707
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,520
yoloing out there and who is actually

708
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,440
you know exercising some degree of

709
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,440
attempted restraint but there's also the

710
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,120
question as well of unintended

711
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,400
consequences when it comes to these

712
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,480
items so stuxnet yes i'm sorry but you

713
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,320
know half of the people in the audience

714
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,520
still don't actually understand how it

715
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,640
works so i'm going to say it until

716
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,640
everyone's got read up on it kim's out

717
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,919
here somewhere i think so go read her

718
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:14,960
book but uh anyway the main point being

719
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,640
is that as maggie referenced earlier

720
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:19,200
stuxnet was very narrowly targeted from

721
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,840
a fx capacity but from an enabling

722
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,279
perspective given the zero days that

723
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:25,520
were employed it roamed fairly far and

724
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:28,000
widely until uh virus blockada i can't

725
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,200
remember the name of the researcher who

726
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,039
would then move to kaspersky was able to

727
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:32,880
discover it and then mushroomed from

728
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:33,760
there

729
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:37,120
and the result of that is you had a not

730
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,720
an impact capability in terms of the

731
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,159
step seven plc's that were being

732
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:41,600
targeted in the centrifuge hall or at

733
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,360
least the very specific instantiation of

734
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:44,960
those items but you did have these

735
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,200
enabling capabilities that had proven

736
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,360
some measure of success when combined

737
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:51,360
with some ways of jumping air gaps and

738
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,760
whatnot of being able to spread into

739
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,279
sensitive networks and then how do we

740
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:57,679
start processing that capability like

741
00:24:57,679 --> 00:24:59,919
did someone get in trouble in

742
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:01,840
maybe israel or maybe the united states

743
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,760
or whatever because stuxnet was just a

744
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,200
little bit too aggressive or more

745
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,720
aggressive than we needed to i don't

746
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,159
know but joe i would say my question

747
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:09,679
wasn't whether or not the we've done the

748
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:11,360
analysis that is that the fallout and

749
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,520
impact analysis has not given us the

750
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,480
threshold

751
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,320
for when we determine oh something is a

752
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,919
weapon or something is an incident or

753
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:19,520
something is an attack or something is

754
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:20,640
cyber war

755
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,400
we've done all the analysis we've done

756
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,760
for good reasons and for different you

757
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,360
know doctrines and things like that but

758
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,200
it's never produced a threshold where we

759
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:30,080
can say yep that is what we care about

760
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:32,480
and that is a kim jong-un crazy boy like

761
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,320
i mean that's about it another

762
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,240
interesting take on this as well uh just

763
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,400
going to personal experience

764
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:41,679
the revision of targeting

765
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:45,200
allowances if you look at the g watch

766
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,120
activities so both iraq and even

767
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,400
especially afghanistan since we were

768
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,159
there so freaking long

769
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:52,400
the evolution in what was allowed versus

770
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,000
what was just completely written off is

771
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,679
unacceptable because of the potential

772
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:57,360
for

773
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,279
civilian casualties or unintended

774
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:01,520
effects revised very dramatically from

775
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:04,799
the early 2000s until the late 2010 you

776
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:06,400
know late teens or whatever you want to

777
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,360
call them

778
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:09,600
and that was based upon experience very

779
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,240
nasty very unfortunate experiences but

780
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,600
there was some learning going on they're

781
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:16,320
like oh crap we can't do this anymore or

782
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,840
you know behavioral targeting has some

783
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:20,320
very significant limits the reason i

784
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,000
bring this up is that there was that

785
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,279
incidents happen and we learned from

786
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:24,720
them then revise

787
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,080
we've seen from a critical

788
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:28,159
infrastructure perspective five six

789
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:30,000
seven ish or whatever events that have

790
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,120
taken place

791
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,000
and

792
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,360
you know most of those are still some

793
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,039
questions about who was responsible to

794
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:36,720
what extent you know were the what were

795
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,200
the goals and in mind here and we just

796
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,039
haven't had the events in question to

797
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:42,559
begin shaping these things just as we

798
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:44,240
say that safety rules are written in

799
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,720
blood within the industrial space well

800
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,320
when it comes to some of the things like

801
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,000
you know geneva conventions the law of

802
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,520
armed conflict etc is like it's based

803
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:54,080
upon people previously screwing up in

804
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,760
very nasty ways and unfortunate

805
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,600
fortunately or unfortunately we haven't

806
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:58,880
had that many yet to release that we

807
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,880
know of yeah what would you say to if i

808
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,799
can ask jay a question and i argue that

809
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:04,080
there are rules of engagement that we're

810
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,360
not privy to and that's a good thing

811
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,640
because it doesn't create false

812
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,080
tripwires you know how would you respond

813
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,360
to that from all the learning we've done

814
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,360
with traditional armed conflict you know

815
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:12,320
do you think that those rules of

816
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,840
engagement exist do you think that there

817
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,600
is you know a conti person that has a

818
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:16,799
higher up that they have to go get

819
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:18,320
clearances on and the yellow brick road

820
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,320
for you know approval and authorization

821
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,000
or do you think they're

822
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,600
learning better than us as they go

823
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:24,960
actually well i think if nothing else

824
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,880
there's always the rule or law of

825
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,240
self-interest so if you look at someone

826
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,440
like conti when they come out and it's

827
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,120
like oh yes glory to mother russia and

828
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:33,840
it's like oh like that that puts a

829
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,600
big you know cybercom is just like you

830
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:36,640
know rubbing its hands together it's

831
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,000
like that's right we're coming

832
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,520
after you now yeah

833
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:42,240
um but uh you know there certainly are

834
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,760
rules of engagement out there if nothing

835
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,600
else just do restraint because someone

836
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:46,640
doesn't want to get jade damned or

837
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,080
whatever after a certain point depending

838
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,679
upon what you're doing that's a little

839
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:51,840
extreme but you know we've seen some

840
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,200
people drop bombs on buildings or

841
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,600
whatever in response to you know alleged

842
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,919
cyber operations uh so certainly there

843
00:27:57,919 --> 00:27:59,440
are more mature organizations like i

844
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:02,000
would say cyber command is both very

845
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
mature well you know as mature as you

846
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,279
can get in this space and coming up with

847
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:06,960
the sort of items as well as in publicly

848
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,720
presenting it through things like the

849
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,480
defend forward concept and all the

850
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,480
documentation that surrounded that but

851
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:15,840
we don't know what the svr or gru's

852
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,279
rules of engagement are we don't know

853
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:18,880
what the ministry of state security or

854
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,840
the ssrf or whatever may do and that

855
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,760
leads to lots of

856
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,360
confusion

857
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:26,960
yeah and sometimes we pretend that they

858
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,399
don't have them and it blows my mind

859
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:29,760
because then really you know we've all

860
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,919
been asked well how likely is it that i

861
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:34,240
as a company am the next target

862
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,919
and then we have to like massage that to

863
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:36,640
say

864
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,080
the question you wanted me to answer

865
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:41,120
that you meant to ask was how severe

866
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:43,520
could any impact be and so i just wonder

867
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,960
why we don't extend that into our

868
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,720
conversations about international law

869
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,799
because we care about the extent of the

870
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:50,960
severity of what happens to you more

871
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,720
than whether or not you're targeted and

872
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,000
the intent of that and if i'm wearing a

873
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,360
blue coat or a red coat or whatever it

874
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:56,480
is

875
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:57,600
but we haven't done that yet we haven't

876
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,200
made that leap

877
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,760
well we are down to the last minute so i

878
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:04,559
just want to take our last 60 seconds to

879
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:06,159
thank you both for this awesome

880
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:08,720
conversation i think this was

881
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:09,600
a

882
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,520
wonderful discussion and beneficial to

883
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:14,399
everyone and i want to also thank

nilufara for speaking on

885
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:19,440
an issue that abutted this very closely

886
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,760
yesterday because i think it gave us all

887
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,279
some really fun discussion talking

888
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:25,039
points setting up for this

889
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:27,279
and i want to thank you all for for

890
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:30,000
being here for it and looking forward to

891
