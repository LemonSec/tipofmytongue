1
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:06,960
hi everybody thank you so much for

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,800
joining me to this presentation i'm

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,120
going to be talking about plc libraries

4
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:13,519
for detecting abnormalities

5
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:16,079
so what we are going to see today is why

6
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:17,680
it is important to have it in the

7
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,080
detection at the plant level and then

8
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,760
the difference between the security

9
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,080
alarms and also operational and safety

10
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,400
alarms and what we don't want to mix up

11
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,320
them and then make the operators

12
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,519
confused

13
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:32,399
so we are gonna create also using

14
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:35,280
built-in plc so use what you already

15
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,600
have in the plc and then from there we

16
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,000
create a detection library so we are

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,480
creating several blocks that are going

18
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,719
together to create this library and then

19
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:46,960
we have the library categories and how

20
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:51,520
we display the alarms in the in the hmi

21
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:55,360
so how this idea came from it came from

22
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,520
actually one year ago when i was about

23
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,079
to join dragos during my interview my

24
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:03,199
boss asked me about the key switch if i

25
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:06,159
know how to detect that i didn't really

26
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:09,760
know it so i get so frustrated and after

27
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,760
that i went to my peers and i started

28
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,560
asking them if they actually do that so

29
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,439
most of them or i think all of them told

30
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:18,799
me that this is something that

31
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:21,439
automation engineers really we don't do

32
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:23,920
it but we do diagnostics so with the

33
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,320
diagnostics that we normally do is for

34
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,680
io modules and also to do the

35
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,320
uh the communication between the plcs

36
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,520
and

37
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,079
and other stuffs for the processors

38
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:39,119
so i joined alejandro cadena and also

39
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:41,439
mike hoffman so though they are my

40
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:43,200
mentors wanting control another

41
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,320
insecurity and then we arise that we can

42
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,119
pick things three things so the the main

43
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:51,680
things were like safety logic is first

44
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,479
process and safety logic is our priority

45
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:57,200
then we want to have also alarms for

46
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,600
security safety and process and then we

47
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,320
have also the standard so use what you

48
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:05,119
have so the plc has already a lot of

49
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:07,680
things in there that you can use it and

50
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,239
of course to provide visibility for

51
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:12,640
awareness to the lower controls to make

52
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,599
the operations also to be aware of some

53
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:18,879
other uh incidents that they can have

54
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:21,200
so what it is important to have the in

55
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,280
the field of detection it is because the

56
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,239
operations are our our eyes in the plant

57
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:27,840
they are the hands in the plants so they

58
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,000
will know when things are changing when

59
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,800
things uh if there is a maintenance if

60
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,519
there is an out there

61
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:38,000
if there is a stop in the plant so if

62
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,080
they see like there is a download in the

63
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,160
plc they will know actually if the

64
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,120
download is because it is a

65
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,760
job doing or if it is something else

66
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,160
and of course we want to introduce them

67
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,120
to the incident so they can also be

68
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,760
aware of what they can do and

69
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,680
because they do it with maintenance so

70
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,519
if they see that one switch is not

71
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:01,440
working they they call maintenance

72
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,280
immediate immediately because they have

73
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,000
those alarms integrated so with that

74
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,400
they will have also alarms that they can

75
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,440
help

76
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,319
the incident responders and and so on to

77
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:15,760
to be aware of of the of the events

78
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,519
and then what is the difference so we

79
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:19,680
have safety operation and security so

80
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,239
please don't mix up all those alarms

81
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:23,360
because

82
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,360
being in the plant and then seeing a lot

83
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,840
of alarms just popping up suddenly the

84
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,239
operators will not be interested and

85
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:33,040
take care of those alarms so we have

86
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,280
safety operation and security so safety

87
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,000
is mainly to mitigate the hazards and

88
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,760
then operation will inform the

89
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,000
deviations in the process and security

90
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,560
is as you all know is the integrity

91
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,200
integrity of the system so here are just

92
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,680
examples so if you have safety for

93
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,920
example then means that you can have a

94
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,840
stop activated so if you see like for

95
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,239
example in a line in a process line it's

96
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:57,920
not working on something like that you

97
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,519
will see like

98
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:01,840
i'm sorry

99
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:03,599
so the first thing that you will see is

100
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:05,760
they stop activated that means that

101
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,519
somebody press the push button and then

102
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:10,000
we have also high high level balfour

103
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,319
opening or high high pressure and then

104
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:14,879
that is when the seize is coming and

105
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:17,279
also we have operation that for example

106
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:19,279
we have open fault that means that

107
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:21,279
somebody is moving the arm

108
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:23,759
an arm or it's moving some kind of valve

109
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:25,919
and then you have a timeout so that is

110
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:27,840
not security it could be just like the

111
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,560
sensor should move or the or the other

112
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,919
valve is just lockout so we have a block

113
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:34,639
that

114
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:36,080
it integrates

115
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,680
several events that you can then

116
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,759
integrate it to the security

117
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:42,800
i will explain that later so we have for

118
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,880
example for security we create a block

119
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,440
to detect the setpoint delta and then

120
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,840
also of course the key switch and range

121
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:53,840
manipulation and other another alarms

122
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,800
so how do you detect that using what you

123
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,520
have already in the plc we have we use

124
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,440
rockwell because it was a plc that i

125
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,160
have handy and i use version 20 in this

126
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,800
case and we were using the get system

127
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,840
value

128
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,400
message audit value and regular

129
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,440
functions

130
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,320
so they get system value is mainly as a

131
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,160
function that it it brings all the

132
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,720
status bits to get the data processor

133
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,320
and then module and then do the

134
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,560
diagnostics we have the message and that

135
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,720
is the to get the memory data from the

136
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,440
processor it creates also logs and it's

137
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,560
also that

138
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,240
that function it we use it it's for

139
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,639
integrating the but for communicating

140
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:37,280
different plcs different brands of plcs

141
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,440
and then we have the audit values so the

142
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,600
audit value is actually a built-in

143
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,720
function in rockwell that it detects

144
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,720
download changes it detects also the key

145
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,160
switch it detects several things and

146
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,919
then put it in a log

147
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:52,639
but that one it changed depending of the

148
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:55,919
version so version 20 is kind of old and

149
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:58,000
sometimes you have to work a little bit

150
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,840
around and then we have the regular

151
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,160
function so the regular functions are

152
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,240
like very easy logics comparations

153
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,840
additions

154
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,919
you will see that i just have contacts

155
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:10,160
coils that's it what i have

156
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,759
so and of course each each platform is

157
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:16,319
different so siemens for example handles

158
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:19,520
sfbs sfcs that are similar to the get

159
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,919
system values

160
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:23,840
so this is what we have in the library

161
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,680
this is one block this is actually for

162
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,919
the key switch so the first thing that

163
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:29,840
you have to think when you are designing

164
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,759
those blocks is the parameters what do

165
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:34,240
you want your engineer to parametrize

166
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,919
it's very important that you don't put

167
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:38,479
like a lot of a lot of information for

168
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:40,000
them to parametrize because it's when

169
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,759
errors come

170
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:44,479
so in this case we create just like tags

171
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:47,199
the tags was the first one and you can

172
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:49,280
create also like the limits parameter

173
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,680
things like that and then use the main

174
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,199
function the get system value the

175
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:54,960
message what you have already and then

176
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,039
play around with what you are getting

177
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:59,360
from there to to trigger the alarms and

178
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,199
as you can see it's a very simple logic

179
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:03,280
there is nothing special here is just

180
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,120
normal contact

181
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,759
contact opens and close opening and then

182
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:10,000
we have also internal tags so the

183
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,080
internal tags are the ones that you

184
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,639
don't want to to put it in to put it

185
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:16,800
outside of the logic that one is

186
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,599
integrated in your block so that one is

187
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:21,360
because you don't want that information

188
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,120
to be manipulated it's actually your

189
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,599
logic and then we have your hmi your

190
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:28,840
alarms what are you gonna trigger in the

191
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,520
hmi and this is what the result so you

192
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,680
don't have like a big logic this is not

193
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,039
something that it will affect your

194
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:36,880
memory

195
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,120
so why do we have embedded logic and

196
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,880
what we use it normally we use it as

197
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,560
automation engineers we are not like

198
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,039
creating all the time the logic we

199
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:47,039
actually create libraries and we use

200
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:49,280
that and we just improve the logic that

201
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,680
we have it so that the thing is in in

202
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,440
rockwell the main thing is that you

203
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,800
cannot change the aois and when you are

204
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,319
running online and also in in siemens

205
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:03,039
the fbs are complete protected so you

206
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:04,560
can protect those

207
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,039
and the logic is

208
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:10,240
so you can use also a sourcing

209
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,759
sourcing protection that sourcing

210
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:14,479
protection will give you

211
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:16,960
uh you just put it in a text file and

212
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,199
that text file is saved and it creates

213
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:21,599
some kind of key and then it can be

214
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:23,440
easily imported so you just have to

215
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:26,000
create that block import exported from

216
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,520
your project important to the other

217
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,039
project and then the only thing that you

218
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:31,680
have to change are the parameters and

219
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,839
also the tag that's it you need to

220
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:35,919
create all the logic and then change a

221
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:38,559
lot of logic and a lot of parameters and

222
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:41,120
a lot of tags that are embedded inside

223
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,080
of that so and then you have the

224
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,080
when when you create a library means

225
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,399
that you have already tested that so

226
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,000
it's not that you are going to be on

227
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,160
site testing that kind of stuff and

228
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,839
making their life difficult for the

229
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:56,080
automation engineers so we have to think

230
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,399
about them as well

231
00:08:58,399 --> 00:08:59,680
so what is the

232
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,080
library classification that we create so

233
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,399
we have the security functions and we

234
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:06,320
created in three phases controller

235
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,600
performance and we have the operation

236
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,080
and we have also what is the risk of

237
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,640
misabuse and inside of that we have a

238
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,640
security handlers so the security

239
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,640
hunters are actually the ones that are

240
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,720
monitoring and are

241
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,720
creating security for the security

242
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,200
functions and also we have developed in

243
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,640
the security handlers a block

244
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,959
a block that is a multiplexer and that

245
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:33,120
block is creating the events you can

246
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,160
create events inside of that one

247
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,240
and then from there we don't just want

248
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,240
to have it in the

249
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,480
we just don't want it to have it in the

250
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,839
plc and hmi we we want also to to send

251
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:48,959
it to acm to another ideas that have

252
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:51,040
more tools more capabilities that you

253
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,519
can do analysis and things like that so

254
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:56,399
we create a socket in in the plc and

255
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:59,040
from there we check the information as

256
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,720
excel or our text

257
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,800
so this is what we have so we have the

258
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,480
controller performance and this is the

259
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,560
three blocks that we are creating and

260
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,560
those are the ones that you created as a

261
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,399
set baseline when you finish your

262
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:15,279
project so you have to create what is

263
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:17,360
the memory that you have already what

264
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,600
are the alternate objects that you have

265
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,760
to that plc and also you have the the um

266
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,640
the scanning cycle

267
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,200
so for example the memory usage it is

268
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,920
this one it's mentioned in the top 20

269
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,000
they are checking the trends and then

270
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,240
comparing it and putting in the hmi in

271
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,320
this case it's a good idea but we

272
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,360
created also an alarm for that so if you

273
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,360
are beyond that memory

274
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,519
then you create your alarm and then the

275
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,440
operators will know it's just an alarm

276
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,120
they don't have to be checking something

277
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,200
else

278
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,519
i'm sorry

279
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,360
and then we have the program execution

280
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,079
so the active connections

281
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:00,720
is a block that it's gonna call

282
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,399
from zip the connections that you

283
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:04,240
already have we are testing some of the

284
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,560
blogs so i'm not showing all of them but

285
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,519
we are

286
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:10,160
we are publishing a paper and also we

287
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,600
are working in a blog where we are

288
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,519
explaining all of those

289
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:15,360
and then we have the program execution

290
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,440
so the program execution

291
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,880
is basically

292
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,640
when we want to detect if there is a

293
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,800
change in the logic and this is done

294
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,959
according on what the changes on the

295
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:27,200
scan the scan cycle

296
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,399
so we we actually detected the change

297
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:32,800
but what we see

298
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,440
it was in when you go to lower scan

299
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,680
cycles it's very difficult so what i'm

300
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,240
showing here is actually how do you

301
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,519
detect we are in 300 400 microseconds

302
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:45,360
detecting so as you can see you cannot

303
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,800
see anything so what we did we create

304
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:52,000
just a filter for 200 milliseconds so we

305
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,959
have a better explanation of here and

306
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:57,680
then we create a full logic and then we

307
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,399
import it and once we import it and then

308
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:03,279
execute the logic with attack this high

309
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:05,200
peak so that means there is a change

310
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,360
that was good we have that but we are

311
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,160
engineers we have to test more things so

312
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,800
what we did we create a small logic

313
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,519
after what it is calling it and then we

314
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:17,760
that is when we see the issue we didn't

315
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:21,040
see anything in here so 200 milliseconds

316
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,959
is not enough we cannot just create like

317
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:25,120
a basic filter here

318
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,680
so what are we proposing in this case is

319
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,120
to use a little

320
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,880
and then the lead will be used to use

321
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,800
the amplitude and the lag it's gonna be

322
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,120
to to check the the frequency once

323
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,040
having that then you can compare and

324
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:40,240
then do a set baseline to have both and

325
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,480
then we can compare to have the changes

326
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,800
if it is minimal or not and also we want

327
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,480
to have it also in this

328
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,040
very low scan cycles this one is still

329
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,880
under construction we are testing that

330
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:55,040
one so we have the process operation

331
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,959
so the process operation actually we

332
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:59,839
have two blocks those two blocks are for

333
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:02,399
limits and are also for

334
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:04,480
for setpoint delta this one you can

335
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,639
integrate it to the process but it is

336
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:09,360
going to be for security in this case

337
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,560
what we created is we have a profile for

338
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:15,920
the electric fornas so we have to have

339
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,800
hard coded those limits that is

340
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,320
something that it's also mentioned in

341
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,240
the top 20 you can see that they they

342
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,480
will tell you you have to hard code it

343
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,720
so if you are not doing is like

344
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,399
okay so

345
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:30,800
what we have here is like you you have

346
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:34,240
the the block of those those those

347
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,279
limits

348
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:38,000
and then the second limit is actually

349
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,800
our block that block locks since the

350
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:44,639
beginning that that limitation

351
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:47,120
so and once if the adversary comes and

352
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,600
change those values then it's when we

353
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,519
trigger an alarm

354
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:53,680
and then we have the the use case for

355
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,680
the setpoint delta and in this case you

356
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,760
can use it also for process to check

357
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,600
where is your calculation and also it

358
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,000
can be checked if somebody is changing

359
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,399
that value so we have a right to select

360
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:06,240
that one

361
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,480
to select what is the next profile after

362
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,360
the hit is is coming so in this case we

363
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,839
have a setpoint and base set point one

364
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:16,160
and also this block have a selector that

365
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,120
it will

366
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,320
uh

367
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,880
detect if it is the base set point will

368
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,120
change or not those selections those

369
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,480
parameterization are also locked

370
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,720
so in here in case for example but not

371
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,480
the difference so the difference should

372
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,160
be always the one that you are selling

373
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,160
in this case if you have one

374
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,800
so we we wanted to go one by one in each

375
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,839
of the arrays so you got for one

376
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:41,839
in this case we have an example of hits

377
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:44,880
six the next kids will be seven if it is

378
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,880
eight then is one will trigger that

379
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,800
alarm in here

380
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,360
so and then it will change the the new

381
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,199
the new set point value you have to go

382
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:57,120
back to get to get rid of those alarms

383
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,040
and then we have the risk misabuse

384
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,480
together we have the key switch

385
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,440
detection of course there is a gsb plus

386
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,120
the status bits

387
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,519
and then we have a program firmware this

388
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:10,560
one we actually use it with another plc

389
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,560
it was a click plc

390
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,800
so we get the information we send

391
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,560
information to the click the click is

392
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,480
saving that value and send it back to

393
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,440
this plc and then this plc is the one

394
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,760
that it is going to be

395
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,519
triggering the alarm if it doesn't

396
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:28,800
detect the same as the click

397
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:31,040
and then we have the program download

398
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,279
online changes that we are using the

399
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:35,920
audit value and also as i mentioned

400
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:38,639
before it is on the top 20 and you can

401
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:40,720
use it directly as it is it will create

402
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,279
a hash and that has you can log it and

403
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:45,759
then you see that in the analysis and

404
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:47,920
also in the new versions of rockwell

405
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,759
they have some kind of tracking but in

406
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,120
the old versions you don't you don't

407
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,240
have that so what we are creating is to

408
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,959
put the value at you you don't detect

409
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:58,560
everything but at least you detect the

410
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,720
download and the change playing with

411
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,800
those bits with the bits that you see

412
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,480
from the status

413
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,839
or you can use the performance

414
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:08,320
controller and functions by the memory

415
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,320
and also the scan cycle

416
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,320
changing so what have we have the

417
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,639
security handlers so the security

418
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:16,720
handlers we have the function monitoring

419
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,639
the initialization parameters so the

420
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:20,959
initial parameters are actually the ones

421
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:22,880
unlocked the security functions

422
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,199
monitoring is the one that is changing

423
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:27,279
everything and then we have the events

424
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:30,480
so the events is actually the one that

425
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,800
you select where are you the different

426
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,480
events that you can put it in there and

427
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:37,440
then we will create the alarms and here

428
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,160
is how it is programmed so you have in

429
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:43,360
your 100 milliseconds you have

430
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:46,079
um you have your delta

431
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:48,240
block and also you have the the

432
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,920
monitoring so the monitoring block

433
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,079
because it is a security block we put it

434
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:55,440
in a 10 second 10 milliseconds a task

435
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,759
and that one is sending a heartbeat also

436
00:16:57,759 --> 00:16:59,759
to the click so that one is monitoring

437
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:00,880
between the

438
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,720
the blocks and then we have the main

439
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:05,439
tasks so the main task

440
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:07,119
sorry the key switch is the only one

441
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:08,559
that it has to be in the main task

442
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:10,559
because the program is not detected in

443
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:13,439
other another task in other cycle tasks

444
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:15,199
and from there you have the same thing

445
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:17,199
it goes to the monitoring and then we

446
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:19,839
create the alarms if you lose that one

447
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:21,760
and this is the log that we are creating

448
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,959
and sending to the to the others

449
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:27,119
and this is the demo so this is the lab

450
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:29,679
that i use it and it was just with a

451
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:31,520
click and then a plc

452
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:35,120
and then can we start the demo

453
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,000
can we play the demo

454
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:45,080
okay

455
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,679
let me go back

456
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:02,000
okay so it's coming so i create two

457
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,840
banners to show what is the difference

458
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,080
between the process and the

459
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,919
and the security and here is the logic

460
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:08,880
so

461
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,600
we have a valve and a heater and we have

462
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,320
also the control for the for the level

463
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:17,120
and we use a pian id in this case

464
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,840
to show the the alarm and we have uh the

465
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:22,640
memory that it is displaying

466
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,559
here and then we have also the key

467
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:26,480
switch local and also the firmware that

468
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,679
we are reading

469
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:29,840
so and and this is the the same thing

470
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,799
that i showed you before

471
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:35,200
and then we have here the key switch as

472
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,919
i told you you cannot put it in a task

473
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:40,240
so we are using the main task

474
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,919
and then this is the logic that it is

475
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:44,640
representing how do you put it together

476
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,600
and now that that is what we do so we

477
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,440
have a difference here in the block that

478
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,720
it is 10

479
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,840
and you set point base is 10. so if you

480
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:56,000
change it to 5 we will not have any

481
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,760
alarm because you are inside of that

482
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,080
range

483
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:04,080
and now i'm gonna be changing that

484
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:06,320
to

485
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,559
to 15

486
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:11,039
and then those 15 is still inside of the

487
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:12,880
range so it's it's not going to create

488
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,120
any alarm of course

489
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:18,640
because we're still inside of the range

490
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,360
so now and now we want to change it

491
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,360
change to the 25

492
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,200
and then the alarm will come so that

493
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,039
means that there is a difference in your

494
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:28,960
set point

495
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,919
and it's when the the alarm came and

496
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:33,760
that means that because normally you

497
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,000
work in certain range but you need to

498
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,080
have also another range because normally

499
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,240
the operations can work in another there

500
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,640
are two ways that you can get rid of

501
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,799
that alarm one is going back to your

502
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:47,520
range that you will should be working or

503
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,120
the other one is that you have an

504
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:52,240
acknowledge in another screen that will

505
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,799
change the set point base in the use

506
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:56,640
case that i showed you before they don't

507
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,679
have

508
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:00,320
that selector is inside of the block so

509
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,480
you don't have to be acknowledging that

510
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,480
right now i'm changing just to five just

511
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,559
to demonstrate that

512
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:08,559
there is no alarm we get rid of the

513
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:11,919
alarm again and i'm changing to 50

514
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:14,320
again and this one will will trigger the

515
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,080
alarm and then we want to get rid of the

516
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,400
alarm but the operator wants to work in

517
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,880
that range so he wants to work from 50

518
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:24,640
to 60 50 to 40. so there they he will

519
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,159
accept the set point and then we'll

520
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:28,960
trigger uh that we don't need that alarm

521
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,640
anymore

522
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,720
so if you go back to the five you will

523
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:35,840
see the same thing

524
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:41,360
so now i'm changing to 5 again and then

525
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,200
the alarm is coming because we are in a

526
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:47,080
new set point value

527
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,280
now we have we were back to 55 we are

528
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,520
inside in the new setpoint base

529
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,039
and then we got

530
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:56,960
so now we are going to talk about the

531
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,440
hysteresis loop that i have here and

532
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,520
this is for the limits those limits are

533
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,760
already locked that is the flash bit

534
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,480
that we created and this one will lock

535
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,720
the value so that means that you cannot

536
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,960
change it anymore so you have to create

537
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,440
another tag but first of all i need to

538
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,200
change it from the remote so i i'm

539
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,159
testing the key switch block and this is

540
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:20,240
what we got so we have a

541
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,080
sensor and then we have the limitations

542
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,480
here we have the status

543
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,159
coming from the block and then we have

544
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:28,480
the program once i change it to to

545
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,520
remote

546
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,360
then we trigger the alarm that the key

547
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:34,879
switch has changed to remote

548
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,600
and now i have to change it to again to

549
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,200
program just to demonstrate that this

550
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,120
block is working so

551
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:46,399
that's what i'm doing now

552
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,880
so i just change it to local remote and

553
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,760
then as you can see i'm sorry to program

554
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:58,400
and you can see now is in program and

555
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,880
we're still having the red color over

556
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,440
there because it's not normal to have it

557
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,840
like that

558
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,880
and we are going to go back to remote

559
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,200
but because you are in program the key

560
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,600
switch will continue in programs so we

561
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,799
just

562
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:17,360
keep tr tripping the program trip in

563
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,918
this case

564
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:23,280
and then we have the local

565
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,960
and now i'm gonna change it to remote

566
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,400
because i want to change the limit

567
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,760
values right

568
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:30,000
so i'm doing it inside from the

569
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,240
engineering station i'm changing that i

570
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,080
have the remote

571
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,480
my alarm will change to remote

572
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,720
and then we keep having the the sensor

573
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:41,840
as red

574
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,120
so now now we need to change the the

575
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,280
limit so i'm going to change the limits

576
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,640
for the

577
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:53,360
for the hearer and the here is

578
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:56,320
uh and once i change those values they

579
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,880
we will have an alarms i'm also changing

580
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,840
the the the limits for the valve those

581
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,640
limits are to open and close the valve

582
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,720
so if you have a heater and then you

583
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:07,600
need to

584
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,919
to cool down the oil and you don't do it

585
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:11,840
in the time that you need it you will

586
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,240
have like problems in the depending of

587
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,799
the process

588
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,559
so we are changing this one and then

589
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:20,320
once we accept that it takes a little

590
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:23,280
while but it will show the alarms

591
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,280
and another thing is that for example in

592
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,559
the in the

593
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:29,760
in the valve i i change both

594
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:32,240
the both limits so you don't want to to

595
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,480
show them that maximal and minimal so

596
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,240
you just create one alarm that it says

597
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:39,280
both limits have been changed

598
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,840
so the less alarm it's better to have it

599
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:44,400
for the operators and the things that

600
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,559
they can also

601
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:49,039
be relevant and i'm just showing how the

602
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:50,480
blocks are working

603
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:53,440
and the limitations that you have

604
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,360
now i'm just going back to the values

605
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,960
because you cannot get rid of that

606
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,720
without

607
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,720
without getting back to what you have

608
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,720
hardcoded

609
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,720
okay it's good it takes a little while

610
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,200
now it's changing that and we are gonna

611
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:34,000
have now the actual memory

612
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,159
so i'm sorry we are gonna display the

613
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:37,840
the firmware i did some kind of

614
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,679
simulation in this case because i didn't

615
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:41,600
want to change my firmware

616
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:44,400
so i just have the the alarm from there

617
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,720
once i hit the simulation firmware i'm

618
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:49,679
receiving back the value to to my plc

619
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:51,039
and then i'm just

620
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:53,279
uh checking that and you have to

621
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:55,600
acknowledge that firmware you have to

622
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,360
observe what was the changes i think

623
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,120
things like that but once you have

624
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:03,520
changed your firmware you cannot go back

625
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,760
to the to the one that you have it

626
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,440
before

627
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,840
and now i'm gonna just check the the

628
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:12,240
memory so in this case if i am beyond

629
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,480
that memory that memory that you need

630
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:17,440
into your plc then it's when it's gonna

631
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:20,400
trigger the alarm

632
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:26,559
and then we have this is the logs and

633
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:28,799
it's to copy what are the logs to the

634
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:31,200
buffer and then you will have

635
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,120
the information in there and we create

636
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,400
the socket

637
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:37,279
and that goes to to text or excel file

638
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:39,039
and then from there you can take it from

639
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:40,840
other other

640
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:42,400
places

641
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,960
the takeaways that we have it is

642
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:45,919
so

643
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:48,559
create security functions but don't mix

644
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:50,240
them with operations it is very

645
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,960
important that you also have separate

646
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:55,840
them because it is also easy for the

647
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:58,000
automation engineers to create them to

648
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,799
test it and also to do the commissioning

649
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:01,760
and

650
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,520
create the libraries is very important

651
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,440
that you create always libraries and

652
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,520
just generate the parameterizations and

653
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,360
use what you have already in the plc

654
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:10,960
there are a lot of tools that you can

655
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,480
already use them

656
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:15,840
and of course this is just a plc so

657
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,600
don't expect that it's going to be doing

658
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,440
some security stuff

659
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,559
so

660
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:22,799
you have to create another detections

661
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:25,440
you have to have also you this is just

662
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,600
part of the defensive depth this just a

663
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,760
detection that we created to have the

664
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,840
operations more informed

665
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:32,640
so

666
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,840
yeah

667
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,679
and this is the reference that i use it

668
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:39,200
so we have the logix 5000 of course all

669
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,919
the manuals for for rockwell we have the

670
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:43,679
top 20 security

671
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:46,240
coding practices uh we create a block

672
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:49,279
for the key switch and then we have

673
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:50,960
the logic controllers information and

674
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,960
status that one is the one that includes

675
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:55,520
all the tools

676
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,760
and thank you so much so if you have any

677
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:00,240
questions

678
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:04,840
thank

679
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:06,640
you

680
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:09,760
do you have any questions

681
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:14,400
thank you this is very good this is what

682
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,840
i was hoping was going to happen when i

683
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,440
made this presentation

684
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,880
two years ago

685
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,559
um

686
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:22,480
i have a question the display you were

687
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,880
showing up there was that

688
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:27,279
not embedded so we see what was going on

689
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:29,200
would would a would a regular plc

690
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,240
programmer

691
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,720
see that display with all the security

692
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:33,840
stuff in there were you just doing that

693
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:36,240
so we could see what was going on

694
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,799
uh you you mean on the demo or on the

695
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:40,240
demo yes

696
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:43,200
so that that one is actually the block

697
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,720
that we created the logic is embedded so

698
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:49,200
you have from your main function and it

699
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,600
is everything all the logic is inside of

700
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,760
that so what you are seeing is just the

701
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:56,080
alarm triggering right but that that's

702
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,679
not that's not when it's been embedded

703
00:27:57,679 --> 00:27:59,440
that's when it's been that's that's when

704
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,120
you're showing it so we can see what's

705
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:03,279
going on is that what you're doing

706
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:05,039
uh could you actually embed it so that

707
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:08,080
it doesn't display with the regular code

708
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,440
because there's a way to do that with

709
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,720
rockwell

710
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:14,000
yes that is the aoi actually so

711
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,279
let me i can not do the video but i can

712
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:20,080
maybe go back

713
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:29,960
let me see if i can walk

714
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:38,720
so yeah those ones are already the ois

715
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:41,279
inside of these ones you have the logic

716
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:43,600
so the security in the tree

717
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,360
would that be normally hidden using your

718
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,880
embedded mode

719
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,240
or is that supposed to be there

720
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,440
invisible

721
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,600
this one is not going to be invisible

722
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:54,080
you you have it already there

723
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:56,080
that is inside of this one you have a

724
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:59,360
logic okay yes and this is created you

725
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,840
can put those i wanted to put these ones

726
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:04,399
out just to showing you but you can also

727
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:05,840
put it inside of the logo that was my

728
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:08,720
question yes okay thank you yes you're

729
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,320
welcome

730
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:13,840
any other question

731
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,080
hi i just had a quick question in

732
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,600
regards to

733
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,039
you got to mention in the take away

734
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:21,600
section that create other detections

735
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,600
is it other than like the typical xt

736
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:26,960
traffic or any type of beacon activity

737
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,880
is there any specific

738
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,720
i guess other type of detections you

739
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,799
would recommend on

740
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:34,320
creating for

741
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,640
i guess to monitor this type of traffic

742
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:39,360
to assist with with monitoring

743
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:42,000
so we are not checking what it is on the

744
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,679
traffic because that will be like a

745
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:46,080
network ideas we are creating some kind

746
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,760
of low

747
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:50,559
host ids so we want to check just what

748
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:53,200
it is in the processor and what you can

749
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,440
see in there so it's mainly that the

750
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,760
only one that we have and we are like

751
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,679
testing it is the one that you have from

752
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:01,840
the message and then you can see some

753
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:04,320
active connections but you create you

754
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,720
create a set baseline from that one got

755
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:09,039
it okay
