1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:05,189
alright well thank you everybody for

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:06,720
sticking around first and foremost it's

3
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:09,120
been a<font color="#E5E5E5"> long day</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but I hope this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will be</font>

4
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:11,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">a great end to the day a great great cap</font>

5
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:14,040
to the day my name is<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jay Jacobs I'm</font>

6
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:16,560
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be the moderator of this panel</font>

7
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:19,380
and I have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> list of questions that</font>

8
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:21,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">we've developed and gave copies to all</font>

9
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:22,710
three of them so<font color="#E5E5E5"> hopefully we won't</font>

10
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:24,570
catch anybody off guard with anything

11
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:26,400
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> start off here with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

12
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:31,948
pretty easy question could anyone have

13
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:34,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">you define risk quickly all right just</font>

14
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:37,559
agree with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was just a joke no but</font>

15
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:38,910
seriously that the nollie you talked it

16
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:41,660
in your keynote this morning about

17
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:45,239
defining risk and the concept<font color="#E5E5E5"> of risk</font>

18
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:47,069
how is um how<font color="#CCCCCC"> important is that working</font>

19
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:50,160
definition of risk that people agree on

20
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:53,370
it well it's very important<font color="#CCCCCC"> because</font>

21
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:55,309
there's so much confusion about what

22
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:57,809
risk me and for selling and definitions

23
00:00:55,309 --> 00:01:00,050
that are commonly used<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the industry</font>

24
00:00:57,809 --> 00:01:03,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">and many of them contradict one another</font>

25
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:06,479
the most important contradiction is

26
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:08,789
where some<font color="#CCCCCC"> people believe risk is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> high</font>

27
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:10,710
probability and I loss and others

28
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:12,360
believe it's low probability<font color="#E5E5E5"> high loss</font>

29
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:14,759
so you can't get anything more

30
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:16,799
contradictory and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> these are two</font>

31
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:19,350
diametrically opposed views on what risk

32
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:21,450
is and obviously<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you go into meeting</font>

33
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:24,000
and one group believes it's a and the

34
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:25,530
other group believes<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's be there</font>

35
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
talking past each other because they

36
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:28,290
don't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> even understand that</font>

37
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,540
they're talking about completely

38
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:33,060
different concepts so you start off by

39
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:35,340
the reason we wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do this is to</font>

40
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:36,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">make people understand it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not a better</font>

41
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:37,890
right or wrong it's a matter of

42
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:40,049
understanding there are two different

43
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:42,329
business problems they're both important

44
00:01:40,049 --> 00:01:44,520
business problems and it's we get

45
00:01:42,329 --> 00:01:47,189
confused by the terminology so let's

46
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:49,798
agree on terminology and then we can

47
00:01:47,189 --> 00:01:53,850
agree on business problems and we

48
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:56,579
proposed that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> definition of risk of</font>

49
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:59,100
adverse deviation from the expectation

50
00:01:56,579 --> 00:02:01,139
that's consistent with one of the most

51
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:04,289
important risk axioms we've all accepted

52
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:07,160
which is risk represents uncertainty

53
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:10,560
whether certainty the risk is<font color="#CCCCCC"> zero so</font>

54
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:14,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">building on that foundation</font>

55
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:20,459
oh right it's on oh it's upside down

56
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:27,140
maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just go back and go see</font>

57
00:02:20,459 --> 00:02:30,209
everything you just have again<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so</font>

58
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:34,109
this is much better yeah yes under who I

59
00:02:30,209 --> 00:02:39,390
was doing wrong i said but so anyway

60
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:40,680
where was I yeah again so it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

61
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:42,208
matter of right or wrong it's a matter

62
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:46,430
of understanding that these are

63
00:02:42,209 --> 00:02:50,100
different concepts and each concept

64
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:52,650
helps by defining these things in a

65
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:54,000
particular way each with its own

66
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:55,410
definition we have a better

67
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,569
understanding the business problems

68
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:58,709
we're solving so yeah the thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was</font>

69
00:02:57,569 --> 00:03:01,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">saying is you go into a meeting and</font>

70
00:02:58,709 --> 00:03:04,709
people think they're all on the same

71
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:06,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">page in terms of risk and so but if one</font>

72
00:03:04,709 --> 00:03:08,400
group believes that high risk is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

73
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:10,799
the other group believes high risk is be

74
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:13,440
there using the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same word and meaning</font>

75
00:03:10,799 --> 00:03:15,570
completely different things so even

76
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:19,470
where they<font color="#CCCCCC"> think there's consensus there</font>

77
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:22,200
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> isn't so that's why definitions</font>

78
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:24,470
of matter because particularly at risk

79
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:27,480
because this is one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the most</font>

80
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:29,780
important definitions important concepts

81
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:31,858
and it's never being defined yeah and

82
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:33,510
before we<font color="#E5E5E5"> get too far</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I should have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> done</font>

83
00:03:31,859 --> 00:03:35,519
introductions and I don't have any sort

84
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:37,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">of a bi or anything for for all three of</font>

85
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:39,209
you but<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ali obviously we saw your</font>

86
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:40,950
keynote this morning one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of your most</font>

87
00:03:39,209 --> 00:03:42,989
influential works for me was your paper

88
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:45,869
and operational risk I was a few<font color="#CCCCCC"> years</font>

89
00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:48,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">ago and Jack Jones in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the middle the</font>

90
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:51,560
creator of the fair methodology author

91
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:53,940
of a recent book and the title is

92
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:55,859
measuring and managing information risk

93
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:57,780
a fair approach yeah and that just came

94
00:03:55,859 --> 00:04:00,239
out like a month ago month ago yeah and

95
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:03,600
so that's on amazon and<font color="#E5E5E5"> various places</font>

96
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:05,489
like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Jack and I know each other</font>

97
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:07,410
from years ago I went through fair

98
00:04:05,489 --> 00:04:10,470
training things like that but he's he

99
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:12,600
spent years<font color="#E5E5E5"> developing fair</font>

100
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:14,670
and teaching at training people

101
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:16,350
certifying people in it talking to

102
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:19,560
companies<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> risk specifically</font>

103
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:21,630
information security risk and then duck

104
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:24,870
huh Burt on the end you've got three

105
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:26,670
four four books three books multiple

106
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:28,200
editions of your first one third edition

107
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:31,080
is out right now of how to measure

108
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:33,750
anything and definitely also<font color="#E5E5E5"> no heavy</font>

109
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:36,000
influence on me did I capture and you're

110
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:38,850
also a consultant you decision

111
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,470
management support I'm really started

112
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:42,900
struggling here for words am I capturing

113
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:44,640
most of it yeah that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically it all</font>

114
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:45,989
of our clients<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the different</font>

115
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:48,330
industries there<font color="#E5E5E5"> in all have one thing</font>

116
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:51,210
in common they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> making decisions under</font>

117
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:54,570
uncertainty yeah that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> it we do it yeah</font>

118
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:57,690
okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> so let</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me jump back into a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> question</font>

119
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:59,610
here all of<font color="#CCCCCC"> you three actually on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

120
00:04:57,690 --> 00:05:01,320
stage were influential to me and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

121
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:03,570
too many people in the room that<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

122
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:06,330
seen your work and I've all seen your

123
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:08,550
work before<font color="#CCCCCC"> I met you personally</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

124
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:10,469
whoo-hoo for each of you who has been

125
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:12,150
influential in your careers you're being

126
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:14,550
as you are developing your talents and

127
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:16,260
your skills who is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> person or what</font>

128
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:17,940
was the thing that really triggered for

129
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:19,950
you that this is what you wanted to do

130
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:24,870
how did that how<font color="#CCCCCC"> did that come about for</font>

131
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:27,659
us well I I was just<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to say my mo</font>

132
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:29,910
most influential person was my first

133
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:32,070
quantitative methods professor in grad

134
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:33,870
school but I guess I can't say that

135
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:36,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I honestly can't remember his</font>

136
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:37,830
name well what<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that personal</font>

137
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:39,659
trigger together it may not have been

138
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:41,580
that influential but I remember the

139
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:46,020
classes they were there I didn't imagine

140
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:49,050
them but I all the math I had up to that

141
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:51,140
point was all about physics and math so

142
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:53,780
this was a big change<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know that</font>

143
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:56,039
quantitative methods actually applied to

144
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:57,809
policy decisions and investment

145
00:05:56,040 --> 00:06:00,180
decisions it wasn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> just about orbital</font>

146
00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:02,160
mechanics and relativity and stuff right

147
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:06,090
it it actually applied to other things

148
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:07,860
and so it wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> all no decisions under</font>

149
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:10,380
uncertainty you know we did the<font color="#E5E5E5"> game</font>

150
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:12,330
theory<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of it was operations</font>

151
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:14,460
research optimization problems like

152
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:16,409
linear<font color="#E5E5E5"> programming and dynamic</font>

153
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:19,320
programming transportation algorithms

154
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:20,790
and so forth and so I i got into how

155
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:22,620
powerful those could be

156
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:25,590
I kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like that people made money</font>

157
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:27,540
with math because I saw a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of the</font>

158
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:29,900
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> that went through the physics</font>

159
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:31,740
programs it would end<font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with a PhD and</font>

160
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:33,929
I didn't think<font color="#E5E5E5"> they were doing that</font>

161
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:36,180
really I'm glad they love what they do

162
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:38,070
I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure they did but it seemed like you</font>

163
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:39,480
can even be more impactful unless you

164
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:40,650
win a nobel prize in physics or

165
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:43,290
something it seems like<font color="#E5E5E5"> you'd be really</font>

166
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:45,599
impactful by affecting big on certain

167
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:47,670
decisions in government agencies around

168
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:52,380
the world and big corporations it really

169
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:54,450
seemed like it mattered Jack<font color="#E5E5E5"> the person</font>

170
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:56,280
I'd that comes<font color="#E5E5E5"> first to mind to me is a</font>

171
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:59,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">guy named George McKinnon he was the</font>

172
00:06:56,280 --> 00:07:02,099
executive that when I was<font color="#CCCCCC"> a new ciso at</font>

173
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:04,200
Nationwide Insurance it was his

174
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:08,400
questions that I couldn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> answer that</font>

175
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:10,830
prompted me to begin working on fair and

176
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:12,870
without<font color="#CCCCCC"> that conversation</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with him I</font>

177
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:15,030
wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sitting here and that the</font>

178
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:17,490
questions were because I know them I

179
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:19,770
know them I get<font color="#E5E5E5"> to ask so the questions</font>

180
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:22,920
were<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know i just presented my</font>

181
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:25,140
strategy in my budget request of many

182
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:28,620
millions<font color="#E5E5E5"> of dollars and he said</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so tell</font>

183
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:30,030
me Jack how much risk do we have and you

184
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:31,050
know if he'd asked me to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about the</font>

185
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:32,369
threats we face through the

186
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:34,350
vulnerabilities we had I could have

187
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:35,640
talked all day his<font color="#E5E5E5"> question is how much</font>

188
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:38,160
risk do we have and I shrugged my

189
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:40,200
shoulders and<font color="#E5E5E5"> said well lots and he said</font>

190
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,670
if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> spend this 12 million dollars you</font>

191
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:46,740
asking for how much lesser of school we

192
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:48,870
have and I said well less and and I left

193
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:50,850
that meeting recognizing that those were

194
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:52,500
not trivial questions but they were

195
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:54,450
reasonable questions and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> needed to</font>

196
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:56,730
have a reasonable answer so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last 13</font>

197
00:07:54,450 --> 00:08:00,659
years has been spent you know I'm

198
00:07:56,730 --> 00:08:02,970
developing an answer to<font color="#CCCCCC"> that le my</font>

199
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:04,920
answer is a similar to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Doug's actually</font>

200
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:09,720
it was my high school math teacher and I

201
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:16,070
do remember his name is his the David

202
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:16,070
Nelson for a couple reasons one somewhat

203
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:23,340
more humorous but he didn't give partial

204
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:24,600
credit because his idea was that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

205
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:26,250
know if you're building a dam and you

206
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:29,100
get a calculation wrong and that damn

207
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:33,039
worse you can't go back<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> get partial</font>

208
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:37,060
credit for that so it forced me to

209
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:38,860
much more precise or much more accurate

210
00:08:37,059 --> 00:08:40,869
and what I did but the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thing that</font>

211
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:43,690
he did which really helped me was it

212
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:46,420
when I was a junior in<font color="#E5E5E5"> high school he</font>

213
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:50,230
got me<font color="#CCCCCC"> to start teaching the freshman</font>

214
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:52,779
algebra class and his view well he was

215
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:55,870
lazy he wanted telling us to do it work

216
00:08:52,779 --> 00:08:57,670
but his idea was you can't know

217
00:08:55,870 --> 00:09:00,990
something or you can't claim to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

218
00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:03,069
something until you can teach it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

219
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:05,829
particularly when your teeth teaching

220
00:09:03,069 --> 00:09:07,630
math even if you find it objective

221
00:09:05,829 --> 00:09:09,370
systematic and logical there are a lot

222
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:12,189
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people who don't see it that way and</font>

223
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:13,930
how to explain something that you may

224
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:16,540
can be convinced is completely logical

225
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:19,329
to someone who thinks differently and

226
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:21,939
that's really guided me throughout my

227
00:09:19,329 --> 00:09:23,620
career because very rarely do you run

228
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:25,660
into people who think exactly<font color="#CCCCCC"> the way</font>

229
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:27,310
you do so being able to try and

230
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:29,680
understand where they're coming from

231
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:31,000
from their questions and then tailor

232
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:34,000
your response so they can have better

233
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:36,339
understanding I was really<font color="#E5E5E5"> fortunate to</font>

234
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:40,959
get introduced to that way<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

235
00:09:36,339 --> 00:09:45,010
approaching explaining problems in high

236
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:46,479
school yeah and also I'm sure we'll come

237
00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:48,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">around with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Mike if anybody has a</font>

238
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:51,569
question to jump in but I'm just<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

239
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:53,500
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> down going down</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my list so</font>

240
00:09:51,569 --> 00:09:55,000
obviously all three of you have

241
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:57,459
accomplished quite a bit already in<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

242
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,800
career is there something in your career

243
00:09:57,459 --> 00:10:01,779
that may not be widely known that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're</font>

244
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:04,029
very proud<font color="#CCCCCC"> of like something that that</font>

245
00:10:01,779 --> 00:10:06,399
came<font color="#CCCCCC"> up that you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> were able to accomplish</font>

246
00:10:04,029 --> 00:10:07,930
and it could be<font color="#E5E5E5"> something very public to</font>

247
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:09,579
it could be you know works that we've

248
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:11,109
already cited or something that but is

249
00:10:09,579 --> 00:10:13,750
there something that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are most proud</font>

250
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:16,600
of and<font color="#E5E5E5"> and why and how did that have</font>

251
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:18,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">that come about or let me ask us a</font>

252
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:20,410
different<font color="#CCCCCC"> way</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think i stumped you guys</font>

253
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:23,050
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that question if you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> guys had to do</font>

254
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:24,760
over would you do something<font color="#CCCCCC"> different or</font>

255
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:26,019
would you tackle a problem sooner

256
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:28,300
there's there something that you would

257
00:10:26,019 --> 00:10:33,550
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to shift or change the way you</font>

258
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:36,540
approached studying what you did in my

259
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:39,370
second book the failure<font color="#E5E5E5"> risk management</font>

260
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:41,290
you know the reason you write a new book

261
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:41,649
is to get in all the stuff you didn't

262
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:43,089
get in

263
00:10:41,649 --> 00:10:46,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">alas Brooke that's always what's</font>

264
00:10:43,089 --> 00:10:48,699
motivated me so in my second book just

265
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:51,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">after that I was coming across a lot of</font>

266
00:10:48,699 --> 00:10:56,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">new and already existing research about</font>

267
00:10:51,879 --> 00:10:58,360
a placebo effect in analysis<font color="#E5E5E5"> that if you</font>

268
00:10:56,769 --> 00:11:00,910
go through a process that seemed

269
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:03,189
structure informal you're going to feel

270
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:05,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">better about your estimates you're going</font>

271
00:11:03,189 --> 00:11:07,719
to feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> better about managing risk just</font>

272
00:11:05,529 --> 00:11:09,429
because hey<font color="#E5E5E5"> what through a procedure was</font>

273
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:11,709
developed by a big consulting firm and

274
00:11:09,429 --> 00:11:13,179
we rated everything is on a<font color="#E5E5E5"> scale of one</font>

275
00:11:11,709 --> 00:11:14,679
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> five and it's all how you be below</font>

276
00:11:13,179 --> 00:11:18,009
they all have colors red yellow green

277
00:11:14,679 --> 00:11:19,749
and is your risk management better and

278
00:11:18,009 --> 00:11:22,689
they would<font color="#E5E5E5"> say yeah you know I think the</font>

279
00:11:19,749 --> 00:11:25,389
consensus is it's definitely<font color="#CCCCCC"> better well</font>

280
00:11:22,689 --> 00:11:27,309
even<font color="#CCCCCC"> though I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of hinted at that in</font>

281
00:11:25,389 --> 00:11:29,499
the book there's really quite a lot more

282
00:11:27,309 --> 00:11:31,569
now I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think I'd make that case even</font>

283
00:11:29,499 --> 00:11:33,100
stronger now now I do I added more of

284
00:11:31,569 --> 00:11:35,649
that to the third<font color="#E5E5E5"> edition</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of first book</font>

285
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:38,499
but it seems like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was a big thing I</font>

286
00:11:35,649 --> 00:11:41,350
could add Jack do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have anything that</font>

287
00:11:38,499 --> 00:11:46,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">you wish</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you could focus more on or do</font>

288
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:47,709
differently I<font color="#CCCCCC"> would probably</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so some of</font>

289
00:11:46,029 --> 00:11:51,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">the more recent developments and fair</font>

290
00:11:47,709 --> 00:11:54,369
expanded the view from measuring risk to

291
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:56,860
understanding being able to measure risk

292
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:58,389
management you know because at the end

293
00:11:56,860 --> 00:12:00,879
of the day how<font color="#E5E5E5"> much risk we have today's</font>

294
00:11:58,389 --> 00:12:02,679
is a lagging indicator of our ability to

295
00:12:00,879 --> 00:12:04,959
manage risk in the past decisions we

296
00:12:02,679 --> 00:12:07,529
made in our ability to execute got us to

297
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:10,869
where we are right and i had actually

298
00:12:07,529 --> 00:12:16,329
kind of developed the early notions

299
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:19,240
around that 68 years ago and then put it

300
00:12:16,329 --> 00:12:22,599
<font color="#CCCCCC">on a shelf and really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> only brought it</font>

301
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:25,120
out publicly in the book a month ago and

302
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:29,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">i'm wishing i not weigh it down yeah</font>

303
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:32,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">i'll lead you only actually what i'm</font>

304
00:12:29,259 --> 00:12:36,449
doing right<font color="#E5E5E5"> now the writing this paper</font>

305
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:39,699
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> define risk which is really being my</font>

306
00:12:36,449 --> 00:12:42,519
basis first living for the last few

307
00:12:39,699 --> 00:12:45,579
years it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm glad I'm doing it now</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

308
00:12:42,519 --> 00:12:47,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">wish i could have solved or find a</font>

309
00:12:45,579 --> 00:12:49,388
solution way<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm thinking about it</font>

310
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:50,860
earlier it's something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that bothered me</font>

311
00:12:49,389 --> 00:12:53,470
from the time<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was in graduate school</font>

312
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:54,529
when it was almost assumed that risk was

313
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:56,959
volatility or

314
00:12:54,529 --> 00:12:58,790
uncertainty of variance and that just

315
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:02,239
didn't sit well with me because clearly

316
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:04,670
you know we all know that risk relates

317
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:06,379
to the adverse aspect so how everyone

318
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:09,740
could is just to assume something that

319
00:13:06,379 --> 00:13:11,360
seemed lately wrong concern to me I wish

320
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:13,790
I could have<font color="#E5E5E5"> had time to work on this</font>

321
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:17,089
earlier but it's taken three and a half

322
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:18,649
years of almost a<font color="#CCCCCC"> full time effort so I</font>

323
00:13:17,089 --> 00:13:21,499
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think I would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have had to had the</font>

324
00:13:18,649 --> 00:13:25,370
opportunity earlier yeah well we're glad

325
00:13:21,499 --> 00:13:26,720
you're doing it<font color="#CCCCCC"> now so Doug in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

326
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:28,579
mention your second book the failure

327
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,470
risk management and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> written</font>

328
00:13:28,579 --> 00:13:31,839
back in two thousand eight correct<font color="#E5E5E5"> two</font>

329
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:34,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">thousand during the amount</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> financial</font>

330
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:36,319
actually manuscript was done<font color="#CCCCCC"> just before</font>

331
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:38,149
the beginning of the whole crisis and

332
00:13:36,319 --> 00:13:40,430
then i got one more shot in the check of

333
00:13:38,149 --> 00:13:43,309
edit to add any new material and so it

334
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:45,199
came<font color="#CCCCCC"> out really early</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 2000 I ok but you</font>

335
00:13:43,309 --> 00:13:46,850
stayed three reasons that risk

336
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:49,189
management fails and I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna read them</font>

337
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:51,649
here<font color="#CCCCCC"> so first the failure to measure</font>

338
00:13:49,189 --> 00:13:53,990
invalidate methods as a whole or in part

339
00:13:51,649 --> 00:13:56,930
number to the use of components<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are</font>

340
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:58,970
known not to work and three the lack of

341
00:13:56,930 --> 00:14:02,269
use of components<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are known to work</font>

342
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:03,889
and that was six years ago five six

343
00:14:02,269 --> 00:14:06,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">years</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ago that you wrote</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that how have</font>

344
00:14:03,889 --> 00:14:09,559
you seen that change if at all have you

345
00:14:06,379 --> 00:14:12,379
seen that evolve well there certainly at

346
00:14:09,559 --> 00:14:16,459
least seems to be a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more</font>

347
00:14:12,379 --> 00:14:19,670
skepticism you know I have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of big</font>

348
00:14:16,459 --> 00:14:23,329
pharma clients several and when you look

349
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:25,969
<font color="#CCCCCC">at how they test a new drug they assume</font>

350
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:28,758
it's a placebo until they prove

351
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:30,680
otherwise now if you think about it if

352
00:14:28,759 --> 00:14:32,329
we actually analyze<font color="#CCCCCC"> decision-making</font>

353
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:34,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">methods and risk assessment risk</font>

354
00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:36,829
<font color="#CCCCCC">management methods that way we come up</font>

355
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:39,620
with completely different methods you

356
00:14:36,829 --> 00:14:42,739
assume it's a placebo and then you try

357
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:44,990
to prove<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i was going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to add to</font>

358
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:47,449
that in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> second book there's a whole</font>

359
00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:49,730
chapter called the ivory tower of babel

360
00:14:47,449 --> 00:14:51,290
and it's all about different definitions

361
00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:54,410
of risk and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talked</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Frank Knights</font>

362
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:57,079
definition and the pmo p.m.<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bach</font>

363
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:59,929
definition that includes<font color="#E5E5E5"> positive</font>

364
00:14:57,079 --> 00:15:02,628
outcomes as risk and there's a couple

365
00:14:59,929 --> 00:15:04,490
bizarre engineering ones where risk is a

366
00:15:02,629 --> 00:15:05,920
binary thing and uncertainties arranged

367
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:08,230
it's there

368
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:10,660
bunch of<font color="#E5E5E5"> goofy stuff but ultimately I</font>

369
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:12,070
come right<font color="#E5E5E5"> back to raleigh is we're</font>

370
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:15,219
talking about risk representing a

371
00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:17,019
function of various magnitudes of losses

372
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:20,079
and probabilities usually expresses the

373
00:15:17,019 --> 00:15:22,029
loss as loss exceedance so we're coming

374
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:26,138
<font color="#CCCCCC">back to the same place glad to hear that</font>

375
00:15:22,029 --> 00:15:28,510
we have yeah consensus<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I think Jack</font>

376
00:15:26,139 --> 00:15:29,769
and I actually both raised our hand at

377
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:31,510
the beginning<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the question when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

378
00:15:29,769 --> 00:15:33,970
were asking<font color="#CCCCCC"> which of these are higher</font>

379
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:36,699
risk you said<font color="#CCCCCC"> you died I'm not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> by myself</font>

380
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:38,380
anyway all right we both raised their

381
00:15:36,699 --> 00:15:40,689
hand on the one that you said was the

382
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:42,070
wrong answer but I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wrong</font>

383
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:45,040
answer for a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things we ended</font>

384
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:46,300
up agreeing on one is we weren't

385
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:48,219
necessarily assuming that high

386
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:49,300
probability was near certainty it might

387
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:51,190
have been thirty percent or something

388
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:53,769
like that because<font color="#CCCCCC"> I define in the book</font>

389
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:57,670
in my book that if it's a near certainty

390
00:15:53,769 --> 00:15:59,560
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really a cost like Walmart doesn't</font>

391
00:15:57,670 --> 00:16:01,510
have a risk of shoplifting that's it

392
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:02,949
cost of doing business there your

393
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:05,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">companies don't have a risk of your</font>

394
00:16:02,949 --> 00:16:10,510
payroll right that's just<font color="#CCCCCC"> a known cost</font>

395
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:12,699
and in a way when they built the Empire

396
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:15,699
State Building there wasn't a risk of

397
00:16:12,699 --> 00:16:18,040
death there's proximately you know the

398
00:16:15,699 --> 00:16:19,510
deaths happened was some rate than those

399
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:22,630
large construction projects the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Hoover</font>

400
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:24,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">Dam and so forth the big risk was having</font>

401
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:26,140
extraordinarily more than you expected

402
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:28,930
so it's all about comparing to

403
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:30,850
expectation the other so it<font color="#CCCCCC"> was an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> issue</font>

404
00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:34,449
the other issue was conflating I think

405
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:37,209
possibly whether or not you even have

406
00:16:34,449 --> 00:16:39,849
high probability high impact events

407
00:16:37,209 --> 00:16:42,969
versus whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> or not if you had one was</font>

408
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:45,670
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> it be worse given our definition</font>

409
00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:49,800
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> high probability so but otherwise I</font>

410
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:49,800
other<font color="#E5E5E5"> than that we're on the same page</font>

411
00:16:50,069 --> 00:16:56,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">Jack as I mentioned</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> needs to create our</font>

412
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:58,779
affair and through the years you've

413
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:00,670
traveled quite a bit given a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

414
00:16:58,779 --> 00:17:05,109
training and certified people on the

415
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:07,299
fair method how have you seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

416
00:17:05,109 --> 00:17:09,040
approach to measuring risk evolved

417
00:17:07,299 --> 00:17:10,809
through the years you know because I

418
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:13,569
know that fair has evolved through the

419
00:17:10,809 --> 00:17:16,540
years<font color="#E5E5E5"> how do you see people adopting it</font>

420
00:17:13,569 --> 00:17:19,329
and things like that and where do you

421
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:19,938
see how important is the the training

422
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:22,158
<font color="#E5E5E5">and</font>

423
00:17:19,939 --> 00:17:25,819
that you did as part of risk assessment

424
00:17:22,159 --> 00:17:28,850
sure so the evolution has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been somewhat</font>

425
00:17:25,819 --> 00:17:30,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">of a surprise to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me because you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

426
00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:32,779
was a CISO and so my world was

<font color="#E5E5E5">information technology and information</font>

429
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:40,610
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of people use it to</font>

because every time I go<font color="#E5E5E5"> and work with a</font>

in a scope that's not my area of

<font color="#E5E5E5">because I just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> learned</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from it but it's</font>

455
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:54,669
gratifying for me to see that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's you</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">that many circumstances as far as</font>

458
00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:03,409
training and certification goes the new

459
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:05,000
certification that's out there well

460
00:19:03,409 --> 00:19:08,559
training<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think is important because</font>

461
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:11,779
you get people using nomenclature

462
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:14,750
consistently and concepts consistently

463
00:19:11,779 --> 00:19:16,820
and such so it reduces variability and

464
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:22,340
how its applied you know the mistakes

465
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:24,950
and such and in the certification that

466
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:26,709
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Open Group provides</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> around it to</font>

467
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:29,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">this point about nomenclature and such</font>

468
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:32,240
that first certification that's out

469
00:19:29,090 --> 00:19:35,209
there is really all about terminology

470
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:36,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">concept this really doesn't focus on how</font>

471
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:38,809
to apply it that's the second

472
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:41,720
certification that's coming out but<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

473
00:19:38,809 --> 00:19:44,389
you need to start with concepts and

474
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:46,400
terminology so that's then I know Doug

475
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:49,340
you do a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of training as well correct</font>

476
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:50,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">and where do you see the value of that</font>

477
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:52,159
kind of thing I know you<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk a lot</font>

478
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:56,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">about calibration if you want to talk</font>

479
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:59,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">about that for a bit yeah so are we</font>

480
00:19:56,540 --> 00:20:02,450
focus on methods like our<font color="#CCCCCC"> pharma clients</font>

481
00:19:59,929 --> 00:20:04,190
we focus on methods that have actual

clinical trials of improving performance

483
00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:09,020
so independent academic published

484
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:10,640
peer-reviewed studies where this kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:12,950
method measurably outperforms an

alternative method well it turns<font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font>

487
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:17,809
that people most<font color="#CCCCCC"> people can be taught</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

488
00:20:15,410 --> 00:20:20,210

490
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:23,630
and our success raised by eighty five

491
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:25,010
percent about eighty-five percent of

492
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:26,780
people who go through calibration

493
00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:29,059
training end up at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the end of the</font>

training about as<font color="#E5E5E5"> good as a booking at</font>

495
00:20:29,059 --> 00:20:33,379
putting odds on things and this is done

496
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:36,320
in a series of trivia questions right

497
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:37,880
you take tribute test and you say true

498
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:41,389
or false a hockey puck will fit in the

499

golf hole you say true how confident are

500
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:45,410
you eighty percent right you do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

501
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:47,870
over over again until we get a large

502
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:49,790
number of trials of each one<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then we</font>

503
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:51,350
show you how bad you were and then you

504
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:53,178
<font color="#CCCCCC">take another test we show you a few</font>

505
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:54,678
techniques there's a few tricks things

506
00:20:53,179 --> 00:20:55,730
like the equivalent bet there's a few

507
00:20:54,679 --> 00:20:58,400
other methods that are already in

508
00:20:55,730 --> 00:21:00,860
literature we've actually this year

509
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:02,960
we've trained just over a thousand

510
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:05,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">people so we actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have more data on</font>

511
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:07,070
calibration training than all the

00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:09,800
published academic literature combined

513
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:12,590
on calibration training which adds up to

five or six hundred data points 500 600

515
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:16,490

516
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:17,900
research on that<font color="#E5E5E5"> but we go a little bit</font>

517
00:21:16,490 --> 00:21:19,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">further because the whole point of</font>

518
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:23,360
getting calibrated is just to use you as

519
00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:25,370
an<font color="#E5E5E5"> instrument so most of my clients they</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">can imagine easily a situation where if</font>

00:21:25,370 --> 00:21:29,449
they use an uncalibrated instrument and

522

00:23:35,930 --> 00:23:39,350
levels of it there's an executive

585

overview where your main takeaways all

00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:43,100
these conceptual ideas you know learning

587
00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:45,199
about a loss exceeds curve it's like a

588
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:47,280
big aha moment like you get that one

589
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:48,390
done and then you get<font color="#CCCCCC"> on to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more tech</font>

00:23:52,910 --> 00:23:58,980
and I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> change the topic a little</font>

594
00:23:55,020 --> 00:24:01,080
bit to dealing with skeptics obviously a

595
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:04,290
risk management risk analysis there's a

596
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:06,090
lot of opposition to some of the

597
00:24:04,290 --> 00:24:08,760
techniques and maybe their new maybe

598
00:24:06,090 --> 00:24:11,070
they're valid on some level but one of

599
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:12,660
the criticisms that I've heard at least

600
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:14,909
in our industry and information<font color="#CCCCCC"> security</font>

601
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:16,650
is this we can't do that<font color="#CCCCCC"> because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

602
00:24:14,910 --> 00:24:18,180
don't have lack we have a lack of data

603
00:24:16,650 --> 00:24:20,760
but then they add a qualifier and they

604
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:22,770
say we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a lack of actuarial quality</font>

605
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:25,920
data for you Ali what does that even

606
00:24:22,770 --> 00:24:29,400
mean and and how valid is that type of a

607
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:31,440
criticism when you first suggested this

608
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:33,990
question and I read it I said<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font>

609
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:35,730
I'm reluctant to even answer this

610
00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:38,190
question because it it seems as though

611
00:24:35,730 --> 00:24:41,640
there's a false<font color="#E5E5E5"> premise built into it in</font>

612
00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:43,170
that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> data doesn't exist but really</font>

613
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:45,600
this question gets to something more

614
00:24:43,170 --> 00:24:48,870
fundamental which is what i mean by

615
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:50,699
sufficient data and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i was wondering how</font>

616
00:24:48,870 --> 00:24:52,500
to answer that question and i was

617
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:55,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">thinking do I need to explain how models</font>

618
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:58,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">work and help you create histograms and</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">PDFs and CDF's and I realized you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

620
00:24:58,170 --> 00:25:02,490
there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> really simple example similar</font>

621
00:25:01,050 --> 00:25:04,919
to the example I talked<font color="#E5E5E5"> about in my</font>

622
00:25:02,490 --> 00:25:07,410
presentation supposing you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> build</font>

623
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:09,390
a house on the beach and you want to

00:25:07,410 --> 00:25:11,670
know how far up<font color="#CCCCCC"> Keats you need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to build</font>

625
00:25:09,390 --> 00:25:14,430

626
00:25:11,670 --> 00:25:16,260
doesn't get destroyed by wave and you

627
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:17,790
have a one in hundred year or one

628
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:19,830
percent tolerance in any given year

629
00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:23,129
you're willing to tolerate the 100-year

630
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:25,830
event if you collect data for five years

631
00:25:23,130 --> 00:25:28,410
and you connect all the wind-driven

632
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:31,139
waves over a five-year period you'll

633
00:25:28,410 --> 00:25:33,720
probably have a million waves you ask a

634
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:36,240
normal statistician is that enough well

635
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:38,790
30 yeah if i want to calculate mean and

636
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:42,090
standard deviation 30 to 35 days so this

637
00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:44,520
is you have a wealth of data would you

638
00:25:42,090 --> 00:25:46,500
rather have that million data points of

639
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:49,950
wind-driven waves or would you rather

640
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:52,590
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 data points collected over 500</font>

641
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:56,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">years of the tsunamis that hit that</font>

642
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:58,830
Beach because if you take<font color="#CCCCCC"> that million</font>

643
00:25:56,610 --> 00:26:01,020
data points and fit it to a mathematical

644
00:25:58,830 --> 00:26:03,419
model very sophisticated

645
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:05,100
it will fit a curve based on the

646
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:06,690
understanding for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the worst-case</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font>

647
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:10,530
that would happen would be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a win driven</font>

648
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:12,750
wave but in reality that ninety-nine

649
00:26:10,530 --> 00:26:14,280
percent level event the 100-year event

650
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:17,040
is not going to be a wind-driven wave

651
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:19,470
it's going to be a tsunami so all you

652
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:23,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">need to do is use a very crude technique</font>

653
00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:27,750
10 data points in 500 years the<font color="#E5E5E5"> 100-year</font>

654
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:30,900
event will be the<font color="#CCCCCC"> second highest lost it</font>

655
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:34,620
gives me a much better estimate five

656
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:36,210
data 10 data points and no model versus

657
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:38,310
a million data points<font color="#E5E5E5"> and a really</font>

658
00:26:36,210 --> 00:26:40,560
sophisticated model if I present to that

659
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:43,379
question<font color="#CCCCCC"> that way how many would have</font>

660
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:45,770
said<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 potato points in male model so</font>

661
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:47,970
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> Co question about data sufficiency</font>

662
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:49,680
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> often we think of data for</font>

663
00:26:47,970 --> 00:26:52,290
substance<font color="#E5E5E5"> e in terms of number of data</font>

664
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:53,580
points but if we're trying to model<font color="#CCCCCC"> it a</font>

665
00:26:52,290 --> 00:26:55,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">certain confidence love</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> when we're</font>

666
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:57,840
looking at it on an annualized basis so

667
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:59,610
what's the one in<font color="#E5E5E5"> hand</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your event it's</font>

668
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:02,429
the number of years in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> data</font>

669
00:26:59,610 --> 00:27:04,620
collection period that drives it so when

670
00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:06,470
you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the say the banking industry</font>

671
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:09,149
and they want a model operational risk

672
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:11,400
many organizations believe that the way

673
00:27:09,150 --> 00:27:13,830
you model your risk because you're

674
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:16,170
unique and I learned the term from Doug

675
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:18,750
earlier David the what is it the<font color="#E5E5E5"> fallacy</font>

676
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:21,330
of you the Union fouls unique unique

677
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:23,760
miss fancy the idea is that you believe

678
00:27:21,330 --> 00:27:25,830
that because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're so unique none of</font>

679
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:27,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">the other data applies to you well you</font>

680
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:29,490
know if your bank there's certain

681
00:27:27,510 --> 00:27:32,580
characteristics you have the dissimilar

682
00:27:29,490 --> 00:27:34,320
to the other banks why did JP Morgan

683
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:35,970
have an unauthorized trading event and

684
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:37,620
suck<font color="#E5E5E5"> gin and all these other yeah</font>

685
00:27:35,970 --> 00:27:39,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">they're all unique but they're all</font>

686
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:41,760
exposed if you're in the trading

687
00:27:39,510 --> 00:27:44,220
business you're exposed to rogue trader

688
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:46,440
risk what would you rather<font color="#CCCCCC"> have if</font>

689
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:49,500
you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> never had a rogue trader event</font>

690
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:51,180
use some other data and try and

691
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:53,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">extrapolate from a million data points</font>

692
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:55,980
or use 10 data points<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the industry</font>

693
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:58,140
knowing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you'll be directionally</font>

694
00:27:55,980 --> 00:28:00,600
correct maybe not precise so I think

695
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:02,520
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fundamental problem here when</font>

696
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:04,909
people talk about data sufficiency don't

697
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:07,950
realize there's a ton of data out there

698
00:28:04,910 --> 00:28:10,650
it will help you get a directionally

699
00:28:07,950 --> 00:28:13,500
correct number which in many cases is a

700
00:28:10,650 --> 00:28:14,179
hundred times better than a measured

701
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:18,369
number

702
00:28:14,179 --> 00:28:20,899
from a model based on data that's not

703
00:28:18,369 --> 00:28:22,549
ideally relevant now one other<font color="#E5E5E5"> quick</font>

704
00:28:20,899 --> 00:28:24,768
point I would make yeah the way I

705
00:28:22,549 --> 00:28:26,658
presented this problem if you know that

706
00:28:24,769 --> 00:28:28,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 100-year vent is going to be a</font>

707

tsunami you'll say<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a model</font>

708
00:28:28,730 --> 00:28:33,409
tsunami separately the problem is many

709
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:36,980
times<font color="#E5E5E5"> we don't know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that our</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> datasets</font>

710
00:28:33,409 --> 00:28:39,619
are categories are heterogeneous we

711
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:41,720
assume they're homogeneous we assume

712
00:28:39,619 --> 00:28:44,240
there's only one kind of wave and then

713
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:47,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">everyone sucked how did this Black Swan</font>

714
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:50,419
event take place our models are great

715
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:53,749
they model predicted the worst way of

716
00:28:50,419 --> 00:28:57,230
whale ahead in wave all having a

717

thousand<font color="#E5E5E5"> years is a 10-foot wave how did</font>

718
00:28:57,230 --> 00:29:03,379
I have a 30-foot wave in year<font color="#E5E5E5"> six that's</font>

719
00:29:00,619 --> 00:29:06,799
fundamentally it sums up one of the

720
00:29:03,379 --> 00:29:08,658
biggest problems about modeling and

721
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:10,730
whenever I've given a talk on what<font color="#E5E5E5"> cause</font>

722
00:29:08,659 --> 00:29:12,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">of financial crisis</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's or anything</font>

723
00:29:10,730 --> 00:29:15,019
relating to this its modeling requires

724
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:18,070
you to understand we have heterogeneous

725
00:29:15,019 --> 00:29:21,259
data sets and we assume homogeneity and

726
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:23,149
and under those circumstances you

727
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:24,889
shouldn't be surprised when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

728
00:29:23,149 --> 00:29:26,779
these models<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> results that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

729
00:29:24,889 --> 00:29:30,320
completely inconsistent with the models

730
00:29:26,779 --> 00:29:33,499
and that sets up a softball a question

731
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:35,480
to your dog how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you actually what is</font>

732
00:29:33,499 --> 00:29:38,149
the criteria to measure a<font color="#E5E5E5"> good model</font>

733
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:40,999
what represents a good model well it

734
00:29:38,149 --> 00:29:42,739
kind of is the same response to your

735
00:29:40,999 --> 00:29:45,409
question<font color="#CCCCCC"> about how do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you answer the</font>

736
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:47,419
skeptics models have a measurable

737
00:29:45,409 --> 00:29:49,129
performance themselves I've had a bunch

738
00:29:47,419 --> 00:29:51,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">of clients</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that were big six sigma</font>

739
00:29:49,129 --> 00:29:53,719
followers I can still tell you what

740
00:29:51,350 --> 00:29:55,850
processes they don't measure they don't

741
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:57,350
measure their portfolio approval process

742
00:29:55,850 --> 00:29:59,209
they don't measure their risk management

743
00:29:57,350 --> 00:30:03,110
process they don't measure the return on

744
00:29:59,210 --> 00:30:05,450
performance metrics so those big apex

745
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:07,490
things they<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't they don't deal with</font>

746
00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:10,549
but the good news is is there really<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

747
00:30:07,490 --> 00:30:12,619
large clinical trials in published peer

748
00:30:10,549 --> 00:30:14,899
review journals about the performance<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

749
00:30:12,619 --> 00:30:18,529
lots of pieces and we call it component

750
00:30:14,899 --> 00:30:20,090
testing so one way to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get the big</font>

751
00:30:18,529 --> 00:30:23,749
picture impact we're dealing<font color="#CCCCCC"> with this</font>

752
00:30:20,090 --> 00:30:26,269
right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> our client in Kenya so we're</font>

753
00:30:23,749 --> 00:30:27,010
measuring the performance of the global

754
00:30:26,269 --> 00:30:28,840
intervention

755
00:30:27,010 --> 00:30:30,370

00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:32,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">agricultural</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> interventions for the</font>

with<font color="#E5E5E5"> all sorts of agricultural</font>

763
00:30:43,630 --> 00:30:48,220
other farming techniques etc so it's

764
00:30:45,730 --> 00:30:49,840
this huge model and they select

765
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:53,440
different modules to deal with different

766
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:55,149
kinds<font color="#CCCCCC"> of interventions and now they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font>

767
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:56,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">to set up a measurement for that this</font>

768
00:30:55,150 --> 00:30:59,860
was actually a recommendation from our

769
00:30:56,950 --> 00:31:02,050
approach that all<font color="#E5E5E5"> models are wrong so is</font>

770
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:04,179
this one<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we're going to set up a</font>

771
00:31:02,050 --> 00:31:05,740
process for measuring and improve in the

772
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:10,060
models we go ahead so we're continuously

773
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:13,210
validating it well one the best<font color="#E5E5E5"> way to</font>

774
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:14,649
do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it ideally is to have great big</font>

775
00:31:13,210 --> 00:31:16,930
controlled experiments where you've got

776
00:31:14,650 --> 00:31:19,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">a whole bunch of people using the global</font>

777
00:31:16,930 --> 00:31:20,920
intervention decision model to form a

00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:22,300
whole portfolio of decisions and then a

are<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very long impact sorts of</font>

782
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:30,219
things and then you<font color="#E5E5E5"> say look the people</font>

783
00:31:28,990 --> 00:31:31,810
who are<font color="#E5E5E5"> using the global intervention</font>

784
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:34,720
decision model<font color="#CCCCCC"> were actually better so</font>

785
00:31:31,810 --> 00:31:36,429
it's the year 2080 and you finally

786
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:39,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">figure it out by the time you're off to</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">Windows 546 or whatever</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> figured out</font>

788
00:31:39,730 --> 00:31:44,050
that one is better than the other but

789
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:47,590
there's also component testing component

790
00:31:44,050 --> 00:31:50,740
testings faster we can test individual

791
00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:52,179
pieces of a whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> system just like this</font>

792
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:53,950
is how you do risk management risk

793
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:55,750
analysis on a racket<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's never flown</font>

794
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:57,190
before or the design of a nuclear

00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:59,200
reactor<font color="#E5E5E5"> that no one's ever built before</font>

796
00:31:57,190 --> 00:32:01,060
you still know the failure rates of

797
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:03,070
individual components of the system and

798
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:05,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can model</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a system and then you you</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">setup</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cascade common mode failures and</font>

800
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:09,040
you say hey there's this problem that

801
00:32:07,270 --> 00:32:10,990
happens<font color="#E5E5E5"> some surprising percentage of</font>

802
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:12,700
the time when I<font color="#E5E5E5"> run these simulations so</font>

803
00:32:10,990 --> 00:32:14,410
you're actually testing components and

804
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:16,300
component testing gives you very fast

805
00:32:14,410 --> 00:32:18,190
feedback there's already a lot of

806
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:20,139
literature on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> performance of</font>

807
00:32:18,190 --> 00:32:21,490
components we know the performance of

808
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:23,710
calibrated estimators we know the

809
00:32:21,490 --> 00:32:25,570
performance of naive statistical models

810
00:32:23,710 --> 00:32:27,100
compared to human experts it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

811
00:32:25,570 --> 00:32:30,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">hard to beat a naive statistical model</font>

812
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:32,169
by the way and when someone is a skeptic

813
00:32:30,250 --> 00:32:34,540
my answer that because I'm really

814
00:32:32,170 --> 00:32:36,670
answering both questions yeah when they

815
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:39,789
are skeptic I say hey I'm a sucker for

816
00:32:36,670 --> 00:32:42,820
empirical evidence if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> could show</font>

817
00:32:39,789 --> 00:32:45,519
one study that<font color="#CCCCCC"> showed that people</font>

818
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:48,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually made better decisions over a</font>

819
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:50,919
significant number of trials using say

820
00:32:48,039 --> 00:32:52,929
high medium low scale of<font color="#E5E5E5"> one to five</font>

821
00:32:50,919 --> 00:32:55,359
putting on a<font color="#E5E5E5"> heat map kind of stuff i</font>

822
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:57,580
would start using it there is no such

823
00:32:55,359 --> 00:32:59,289
<font color="#CCCCCC">thing the only studies that exists is</font>

824
00:32:57,580 --> 00:33:02,049
that they're no better or they're

825
00:32:59,289 --> 00:33:03,970
actually slightly worse they add air in

826
00:33:02,049 --> 00:33:05,859
fact one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the studies was this guy</font>

827
00:33:03,970 --> 00:33:08,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">babyboo desk ooh he actually studied how</font>

828
00:33:05,859 --> 00:33:11,350
people use ordinal scales like very

829
00:33:08,649 --> 00:33:14,109
likely and likely and somewhat likely or

830
00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:17,109
unlikely for for substitutes for

831
00:33:14,109 --> 00:33:19,228
expressions of probabilities and he used

832
00:33:17,109 --> 00:33:21,220
a term that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think actually kind of</font>

833
00:33:19,229 --> 00:33:22,899
directly relates to what Alli was saying

834
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:25,659
before he called it the illusion of

835
00:33:22,899 --> 00:33:28,238
communication you and I both agree that

836
00:33:25,659 --> 00:33:29,590
something's a medium risk and when you

837
00:33:28,239 --> 00:33:31,570
debrief us you find out we meant

838
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:33,609
completely different things so that's

839
00:33:31,570 --> 00:33:35,799
David<font color="#CCCCCC"> budesh go he did a whole set of</font>

840
00:33:33,609 --> 00:33:38,649
experiments at surveys on this it adds

841
00:33:35,799 --> 00:33:42,220
error it<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually can make you worse off</font>

842
00:33:38,649 --> 00:33:44,830
than your unaided intuition alone so why

843
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:46,929
even adopt a method that makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

844
00:33:44,830 --> 00:33:50,019
worse you know that that phrase from

845
00:33:46,929 --> 00:33:51,639
medicine first do no harm yeah let's

846
00:33:50,019 --> 00:33:58,599
first do no harm let's not make it worse

847
00:33:51,639 --> 00:34:00,399
above all else yes and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's something</font>

848
00:33:58,599 --> 00:34:03,779
that tony cox had worse<font color="#CCCCCC"> than useless</font>

849
00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:07,059
yeah that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> how I course than usually so</font>

850
00:34:03,779 --> 00:34:09,730
along the theme of skepticism we often

851
00:34:07,059 --> 00:34:13,409
hear well fine and good but we're

852
00:34:09,730 --> 00:34:16,659
dealing<font color="#CCCCCC"> with intelligent adversaries and</font>

853
00:34:13,409 --> 00:34:19,990
consequently there's no way to predict

854
00:34:16,659 --> 00:34:21,790
their behavior and so game off how would

855
00:34:19,989 --> 00:34:23,558
<font color="#E5E5E5">you respond to that can actually respond</font>

856
00:34:21,790 --> 00:34:27,969
to that I mean I'm just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a moderate but I</font>

857
00:34:23,559 --> 00:34:30,040
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to respond so actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a Wade</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Baker</font>

858
00:34:27,969 --> 00:34:32,469
and I did a presentation at RSA last

859
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:35,199
year where we<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually took the actions</font>

860
00:34:32,469 --> 00:34:37,178
of the adversary as classified and the

861
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:38,949
virus<font color="#E5E5E5"> rumor and we looked at how random</font>

862
00:34:37,179 --> 00:34:41,829
was that and it turned out<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

863
00:34:38,949 --> 00:34:43,449
absolutely not random<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean that that's</font>

864
00:34:41,829 --> 00:34:46,030
what we do right a null hypothesis we

865
00:34:43,449 --> 00:34:48,129
say if they're intelligent and apt and

866
00:34:46,030 --> 00:34:50,480
adaptive that means that they if we

867
00:34:48,129 --> 00:34:52,368
cannot predict them they<font color="#E5E5E5"> must be random</font>

868
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:54,530
I mean randomness is a core component of

869
00:34:52,369 --> 00:34:57,080
crypto right let's make makes crypto

870
00:34:54,530 --> 00:34:58,700
well do well is<font color="#CCCCCC"> it there's randomness so</font>

871
00:34:57,080 --> 00:35:00,799
we said let's look for randomness or

872
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:03,109
more specifically that's like for the

873
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:05,210
lack of randomness and not only<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

874
00:35:03,109 --> 00:35:07,940
there but like we didn't even<font color="#CCCCCC"> need math</font>

875
00:35:05,210 --> 00:35:10,490
you know I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was there was so much</font>

876
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:12,080
patterns in there I mean there was it

877
00:35:10,490 --> 00:35:13,910
was so blatantly obvious that there were

878
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:15,830
patterns and therefore I mean anybody

879
00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:18,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">who says and tells an adaptive therefore</font>

880
00:35:15,830 --> 00:35:19,279
we cannot predict their actions<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

881
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:21,290
would indicate randomest and there

882
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:23,830
absolutely is no randomness so the other

883
00:35:21,290 --> 00:35:26,930
the empirical side of that too I might

884
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:28,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">just interject there is that remember</font>

885
00:35:26,930 --> 00:35:32,480
we're comparing miles what's the

886
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:34,129
alternative model if somebody says well

887
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:36,109
you know we have these intelligent

888
00:35:34,130 --> 00:35:37,940
actors and so they're really

889
00:35:36,109 --> 00:35:40,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">unpredictable you can't just extrapolate</font>

890
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:43,160
from historical data<font color="#E5E5E5"> therefore I have to</font>

891
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:47,300
rely<font color="#CCCCCC"> on my experience and they say that</font>

892
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:48,890
with no<font color="#E5E5E5"> hint of irony right well you're</font>

893
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:50,720
only comparing two models if the

894
00:35:48,890 --> 00:35:52,580
alternative bottle is their intuition

895
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:55,069
how are they dealing with the human

896
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:56,869
actors what is measurably different now

897
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:59,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">I won't say the name but I was sitting</font>

898
00:35:56,869 --> 00:36:02,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">next to one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the letters in our essay</font>

899
00:35:59,330 --> 00:36:06,920
at the RSA<font color="#E5E5E5"> conference and he made this</font>

900
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:08,660
same point he<font color="#E5E5E5"> said but the problem with</font>

901
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:10,340
information securities you're dealing

902
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:12,549
with intelligent actors I said so you

903
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:16,220
think that differentiates you from

904
00:36:12,550 --> 00:36:18,380
actuarial science or insurance do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

905
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:22,970
think they they never have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> insure</font>

906
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:24,859
against fraud or kidnapping I mean they

00:36:22,970 --> 00:36:27,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">insure lots of things often what happens</font>

908
00:36:24,859 --> 00:36:29,299
is people think of the consumer side of

909
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:31,220
insurance my automobile in life and

910
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:34,040
health and so forth but actually

911
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:35,839
actuaries do with all sorts of risk that

912
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:37,009
include things exactly like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

913
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:40,720
including things they<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have</font>

914
00:36:37,010 --> 00:36:44,090
millions<font color="#E5E5E5"> of data points for so if I can</font>

915
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:46,850
jump off of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that as well</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so when I'm</font>

916
00:36:44,090 --> 00:36:50,300
faced with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the skeptic around data right</font>

917
00:36:46,850 --> 00:36:53,779
very often<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll include pretty much what</font>

00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:56,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">you just said which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is any time a</font>

919
00:36:53,780 --> 00:37:00,050
decision is being made there's

920
00:36:56,290 --> 00:37:02,119
comparisons being made based on some

921
00:37:00,050 --> 00:37:02,390
model of some sort it's either the end

922
00:37:02,119 --> 00:37:04,700
of

923
00:37:02,390 --> 00:37:08,269
Jules mental model and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Lord knows what</font>

924
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:11,118
that looks like right yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> and data of</font>

925
00:37:08,269 --> 00:37:13,209
some sort and and so if they're pushing

926
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:15,589
back on we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have enough you know</font>

927
00:37:13,210 --> 00:37:17,750
actuarial quality data or what I'm

928
00:37:15,589 --> 00:37:19,220
saying for a quantitative analysis<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

929
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:21,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">right what kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of data are you using</font>

930
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:23,899
for your mental model that you're doing

931
00:37:21,559 --> 00:37:25,760
you know it's always there's always the

932
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:28,069
model and there's always data and I

933
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:31,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">guarantee you that the data they're</font>

934
00:37:28,069 --> 00:37:35,299
drawing out a you know their memory

935
00:37:31,029 --> 00:37:37,240
right is not going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be any better than</font>

936
00:37:35,299 --> 00:37:40,130
what we<font color="#CCCCCC"> would get through some sort of</font>

937
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:42,769
logical rational effort focused effort

938
00:37:40,130 --> 00:37:45,619
and as far as<font color="#E5E5E5"> the models go unless</font>

939
00:37:42,769 --> 00:37:47,689
they're you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know some people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with real</font>

940
00:37:45,619 --> 00:37:49,700
with great experience gathered over

941
00:37:47,690 --> 00:37:51,680
years right they may have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a very well</font>

942
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:54,288
developed mental model right but that

943
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:58,490
doesn't scale with a dinner right and

944
00:37:54,289 --> 00:38:01,789
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> so but most people don't have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

945
00:37:58,490 --> 00:38:04,220
and so if I'm putting if I have to bet

946
00:38:01,789 --> 00:38:08,170
on a<font color="#E5E5E5"> mental model versus some model</font>

947
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:10,250
that's been kicked around right and and

948
00:38:08,170 --> 00:38:12,589
hopefully been vetted and proven over

949
00:38:10,250 --> 00:38:21,529
time that's where my money is going

950
00:38:12,589 --> 00:38:25,038
every time good another<font color="#CCCCCC"> question so this</font>

951
00:38:21,529 --> 00:38:29,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">is not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a softball question this is</font>

952
00:38:25,039 --> 00:38:32,059
<font color="#CCCCCC">pretty guys</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> oh so all three of you have</font>

953
00:38:29,150 --> 00:38:34,250
are on this panel because you've made

954
00:38:32,059 --> 00:38:36,650
seminal contributions to advancing the

955
00:38:34,250 --> 00:38:39,140
state<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the art yet I think we'd all</font>

956
00:38:36,650 --> 00:38:41,660
agree that our risk analysis risk

957
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:44,089
management information security is not

958
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:46,848

959
00:38:44,089 --> 00:38:50,869
not achieved the sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of impact and</font>

how<font color="#E5E5E5"> long is going to take to get there</font>

965
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:03,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right everyone just has to read our</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">stuff</font>

967
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:11,509
yeah but there's truth to that though

968
00:39:09,450 --> 00:39:15,319
seriously<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's truth to that because</font>

969
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:19,260
because so much of what is<font color="#E5E5E5"> out there is</font>

970
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:22,200
so bad I mean really<font color="#E5E5E5"> so when I was</font>

971
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:24,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">developing fair</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I literally swore off</font>

00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:28,109
reading anything written for the

00:39:24,270 --> 00:39:30,270
industry<font color="#E5E5E5"> for like four years because two</font>

974
00:39:28,109 --> 00:39:33,840
reasons I I didn't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> it to pollute my</font>

975
00:39:30,270 --> 00:39:38,520
thinking right and it<font color="#CCCCCC"> just drove me to</font>

976
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:40,920
madness to see the stuff that was being

977
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:44,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">published out there that could logically</font>

978
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:48,200
stand on its own you know in any way

979
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:52,618
<font color="#CCCCCC">shape or form right and and so I think</font>

980
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:54,770
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know certainly these guys and I like</font>

981
00:39:52,619 --> 00:39:58,230
to thank the stuff that I'm writing is

982
00:39:54,770 --> 00:40:00,570
contributing to I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's what's</font>

983
00:39:58,230 --> 00:40:04,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to carry the profession forward</font>

984
00:40:00,570 --> 00:40:07,349
and but<font color="#CCCCCC"> until there's and frankly I'm</font>

985
00:40:04,950 --> 00:40:09,660
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> an optimist in terms of how quickly</font>

986
00:40:07,349 --> 00:40:12,300
it's going to happen because there is so

987
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:15,480
much inertia out there so much inertia I

988
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:18,359
mean I I'm in meetings you know and I'm

989
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:20,010
in industry groups and such where where

990
00:40:18,359 --> 00:40:22,619
<font color="#CCCCCC">the preponderance of people around the</font>

991
00:40:20,010 --> 00:40:24,540
room can't agree on a definition of the

992
00:40:22,619 --> 00:40:28,980
problem we're trying to solve so until

993
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:31,920
you get past that right it's it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

994
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:34,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">painful also I'd like to add you're not</font>

995
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:36,950
alone you may recall that we had a

00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:39,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">financial crisis a few years ago and</font>

banks who claim to be experts in risk

management we're all taken by<font color="#E5E5E5"> surprise</font>

999
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:45,900
when they found out that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the risk was</font>

1000
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:48,270
actually a hundred times higher than

00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:52,680
their ninety-nine percent level

1002

confidence and predicted you know in the

people's well I didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all but</font>

things that are just conceptually flawed

00:41:09,810 --> 00:41:16,859
or illogical or just inefficient so you

1011
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:19,379
know but again one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the reasons</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

1012
00:41:16,859 --> 00:41:19,970
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> this problem is you have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">principal</font>

00:41:19,970 --> 00:41:24,049
agent issue this is part of the reason

1015
00:41:22,490 --> 00:41:27,770
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the reasons we have the financial</font>

1016
00:41:24,050 --> 00:41:30,650
crisis where you will do what's in your

1017
00:41:27,770 --> 00:41:33,560
best interest and even though you're

1018
00:41:30,650 --> 00:41:36,560
working for a certain firm sometimes

1019
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:37,970
your interests diverge sometimes your

1020
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:39,680
interests diverge and when they do the

1021
00:41:37,970 --> 00:41:41,959
verge you will do what's in your

1022
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:45,529
interest at the expense of what's best

1023
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:47,119
for the company and particularly<font color="#CCCCCC"> in what</font>

1024
00:41:45,530 --> 00:41:48,950
drove the financial crisis is these guys

1025
00:41:47,119 --> 00:41:51,260
knew they were taking too much risk if

1026
00:41:48,950 --> 00:41:54,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">you read our paper and the appendix we</font>

1027
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:58,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">talked about the what happened at AIG</font>

1028
00:41:54,590 --> 00:42:00,560
with credit default swaps and I can't

1032
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:11,240
good on paper based on the metrics that

1033
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:13,940
were being observed but actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

1034
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:15,740
were the wrong metrics so what they were

1035
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:19,849
doing was destroying value but they were

1036
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:22,069
being compensated very well for it among

1037
00:42:19,849 --> 00:42:24,680
other things they used methods like

1038
00:42:22,070 --> 00:42:27,200
value at risk and they figure out<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

1039
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:29,419
fast you can tail load risk right so you

1040
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:32,118
can kind of hide all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> risk by putting</font>

1041
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:33,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">it one end of the distribution because</font>

1042
00:42:32,119 --> 00:42:35,630
your metric doesn't look at how extreme

1043
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:37,700
the loss can be it<font color="#E5E5E5"> just looks at what</font>

1044
00:42:35,630 --> 00:42:39,980
your five percent worst case or one

1045
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:42,460
percent worst-case scenario could be so

1046
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:47,060
the metrics themselves actually

1047
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:48,920
incentivized hiding risk so let<font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font>

1048
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:51,710
explain what that<font color="#CCCCCC"> means is it you know</font>

1049
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:53,869
just not to get too technical but if I

1050
00:42:51,710 --> 00:42:57,230
have a model<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the model says at the</font>

1051
00:42:53,869 --> 00:43:00,320
99 percent level my risk is ten thousand

1052
00:42:57,230 --> 00:43:03,260
dollars well that<font color="#E5E5E5"> seems like okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

1053
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:04,849
not so bad<font color="#E5E5E5"> but VAR models only tell you</font>

1054
00:43:03,260 --> 00:43:06,440
what happens at that point they don't

1055
00:43:04,849 --> 00:43:08,839
give you any indication of what could

1056
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:11,540
happen beyond that what if<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tell you</font>

1057
00:43:08,839 --> 00:43:14,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">that at the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 99 percent level it's 10,000</font>

1058
00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:18,369
but beyond ninety-nine percent in that

1059
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:18,369
one percent time I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to kill</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

1060
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:24,939
that's different<font color="#E5E5E5"> now how do you solve</font>

1061
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:27,910
that problem virus is being heavily

1062
00:43:24,940 --> 00:43:31,029
criticized but the technical solution to

1063
00:43:27,910 --> 00:43:33,098
that is to use what's called t-bar where

1064
00:43:31,029 --> 00:43:36,789
you simply take the<font color="#E5E5E5"> probability weighted</font>

1065
00:43:33,099 --> 00:43:39,279
mean of that space beyond VAR<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok but</font>

1066
00:43:36,789 --> 00:43:41,440
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> can game that as well</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so this is</font>

1067
00:43:39,279 --> 00:43:43,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">the fundamental problem you've got smart</font>

1068
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:45,430
people who understand the metrics

1069
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:48,130
exploit the weaknesses in the metrics

1070
00:43:45,430 --> 00:43:50,230
and this will happen<font color="#E5E5E5"> again so really</font>

1071
00:43:48,130 --> 00:43:52,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's you've got to have someone</font>

1072
00:43:50,230 --> 00:43:55,239
overseeing this stuff who has the right

1073
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:57,069
incentives because again if you bring in

1074
00:43:55,239 --> 00:43:58,450
a consultant to validate the model who

1075
00:43:57,069 --> 00:44:00,788
are you<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to choose</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to validate your</font>

1076
00:43:58,450 --> 00:44:03,098
model someone who you know will give you

1077
00:44:00,789 --> 00:44:04,930
the right answer what happened it you

1078
00:44:03,099 --> 00:44:07,119
know the credit<font color="#CCCCCC"> rating agencies you want</font>

1079
00:44:04,930 --> 00:44:09,308
to get a triple-a credit rating no

1080
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:11,230
problem pass this fee and we'll be<font color="#E5E5E5"> happy</font>

1081
00:44:09,309 --> 00:44:14,440
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> give it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to you so all of a sudden</font>

1082
00:44:11,230 --> 00:44:16,450
junk got a triple-a rating so here's

1083
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:18,819
that you know until we address this

1084
00:44:16,450 --> 00:44:21,519
conflict of interest and the

1085
00:44:18,819 --> 00:44:23,259
principal-agent problem we really<font color="#CCCCCC"> can't</font>

1086
00:44:21,519 --> 00:44:26,319
have confidence in any of the metrics

1087
00:44:23,259 --> 00:44:28,900
we're working with so how<font color="#E5E5E5"> much</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1088
00:44:26,319 --> 00:44:31,180
have left here Lee said we have because

1089
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:33,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">I know we've just completely gone off</font>

1090
00:44:31,180 --> 00:44:36,910
schedule and I I don't care I mean I

1091
00:44:33,670 --> 00:44:38,470
love it so<font color="#E5E5E5"> but you know maybe we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> should</font>

1092
00:44:36,910 --> 00:44:40,149
do a vote or<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe you should make an</font>

1093
00:44:38,470 --> 00:44:41,499
executive decision because let<font color="#E5E5E5"> me at</font>

1094
00:44:40,150 --> 00:44:43,150
least get one more question and<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah</font>

1095
00:44:41,499 --> 00:44:47,019
anybody else has some questions we can

1096
00:44:43,150 --> 00:44:49,809
go there<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so around around this</font>

1097
00:44:47,019 --> 00:44:51,519
skepticism for this type of thing

1098
00:44:49,809 --> 00:44:53,739
obviously<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> financial crisis and</font>

1099
00:44:51,519 --> 00:44:56,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">all the other there's always a headline</font>

1100
00:44:53,739 --> 00:44:59,589
showing the failure of quantitative

1101
00:44:56,170 --> 00:45:01,619
analysis and I think Warren Buffett even

1102
00:44:59,589 --> 00:45:04,150
said beware of geeks with spreadsheets

1103
00:45:01,619 --> 00:45:05,619
right I think all three of you at<font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font>

1104
00:45:04,150 --> 00:45:08,440
point<font color="#CCCCCC"> have been labeled a geek with</font>

1105
00:45:05,619 --> 00:45:14,339
spreadsheet in that context right what

1106
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:14,339
is the how dare you well by others

1107
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:21,490
but what who are the big biggest

1108
00:45:19,029 --> 00:45:23,589
skeptics like what and you know jack

1109
00:45:21,490 --> 00:45:25,629
<font color="#CCCCCC">gonna for you and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> inference security it</font>

1110
00:45:23,589 --> 00:45:27,009
was surprising to hear when years ago

1111
00:45:25,630 --> 00:45:29,710
when you talked about the biggest

1112
00:45:27,010 --> 00:45:32,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">skeptics that you've come across what</font>

1113
00:45:29,710 --> 00:45:34,630
are these skeptics and what are the

1114
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:36,849
objections what are the big objections

1115
00:45:34,630 --> 00:45:40,089
to this type of this I've run into two

1116
00:45:36,849 --> 00:45:42,549
classes of skeptics those who see the

1117
00:45:40,089 --> 00:45:44,170
world strictly through a black and white

1118
00:45:42,549 --> 00:45:46,140
lands there is no gray in their world

1119
00:45:44,170 --> 00:45:48,309
right there world is binary it is

1120
00:45:46,140 --> 00:45:49,900
compliant it's not compliant there's

1121
00:45:48,309 --> 00:45:54,099
risk there's no risk right they can't

1122
00:45:49,900 --> 00:45:56,230
deal with the gray you run into that not

1123
00:45:54,099 --> 00:45:58,809
infrequently but that's but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the more</font>

1124
00:45:56,230 --> 00:46:01,569
common is the person<font color="#CCCCCC"> who took high</font>

1125
00:45:58,809 --> 00:46:03,910
school statistics and bull and believes

1126
00:46:01,569 --> 00:46:06,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">that they understand probability and</font>

1127
00:46:03,910 --> 00:46:09,190
statistics and such and that well if I

1128
00:46:06,490 --> 00:46:12,220
don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> 30 data points and I can do</font>

1129
00:46:09,190 --> 00:46:14,079
quantitative analysis you know and and

1130
00:46:12,220 --> 00:46:18,339
they will sit there and they will argue

1131
00:46:14,079 --> 00:46:20,410
to the nail I had private I was doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

1132
00:46:18,339 --> 00:46:22,750
workshop with one client where we were

1133
00:46:20,410 --> 00:46:25,569
trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get subject matter expert</font>

1134
00:46:22,750 --> 00:46:28,359
estimates from one of their subject

1135
00:46:25,569 --> 00:46:32,500
matter experts using calibrated methods

1136
00:46:28,359 --> 00:46:35,440
and such and and I said you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what</font>

1137
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:37,329
<font color="#CCCCCC">would what would your estimate be for</font>

1138
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:39,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">this event and I forget what the event</font>

1139
00:46:37,329 --> 00:46:41,140
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> and he said I couldn't I couldn't</font>

1140
00:46:39,490 --> 00:46:42,939
give<font color="#CCCCCC"> you a number i said well you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

1141
00:46:41,140 --> 00:46:45,368
here's how it works i reiterated he'd

1142
00:46:42,940 --> 00:46:48,819
been<font color="#CCCCCC"> through calibration thing right he</font>

1143
00:46:45,369 --> 00:46:51,009
didn't do well but using the fifteen

1144
00:46:48,819 --> 00:46:53,259
percent that and na said no<font color="#E5E5E5"> i couldn't</font>

1145
00:46:51,009 --> 00:46:55,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">so i said so you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> telling me that this</font>

1146
00:46:53,259 --> 00:46:59,740
event i think it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> like you know the</font>

1147
00:46:55,930 --> 00:47:03,730
frequency of an insider you know trying

<font color="#E5E5E5">think it could be I don't know a million</font>

1152
00:47:10,690 --> 00:47:15,430
times a year oh yeah it could be<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

1153
00:47:12,250 --> 00:47:17,019
million times really so how many<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

1154
00:47:15,430 --> 00:47:19,629
are we talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about in here do they</font>

1155
00:47:17,019 --> 00:47:22,538
have jobs and this sort of thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I</font>

1156
00:47:19,630 --> 00:47:24,579
could<font color="#E5E5E5"> not get him to actually make an</font>

1157
00:47:22,539 --> 00:47:27,010
estimate he would not under any

1158
00:47:24,579 --> 00:47:28,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">circumstances give me a range</font>

1159
00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:30,700
and we<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> asked some data on that</font>

1160
00:47:28,930 --> 00:47:34,330
so since we've calibrated about a

1161
00:47:30,700 --> 00:47:37,149
thousand people remember it succeeds

1162
00:47:34,330 --> 00:47:38,560
about eighty-five percent of time about

1163
00:47:37,150 --> 00:47:40,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">another ten percent of the time they</font>

1164
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:44,290
improve significantly but don't quite

1165
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:48,550
reach statistically indistinguishable

1166
00:47:44,290 --> 00:47:51,340
from a calibrated instrument and five

1167
00:47:48,550 --> 00:47:52,810
percent don't seem to improve all my

1168
00:47:51,340 --> 00:47:55,240
wife pointed out my wife's a math

1169
00:47:52,810 --> 00:47:56,740
teacher math professor at a local

1170
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:59,439
community college and she pointed out

1171
00:47:56,740 --> 00:48:00,879
that you've heard<font color="#E5E5E5"> of dyslexia there's</font>

1172
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:03,880
actually something called dyscalculia

1173
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:06,940
and about the same percentage of the

1174
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:09,760
population has dyscalculia as dyslexia

1175
00:48:06,940 --> 00:48:11,530
and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 5% in other words numbers</font>

1176
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:13,350
are utterly meaningless to them they

1177
00:48:11,530 --> 00:48:15,730
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> even understand they don't have a</font>

1178
00:48:13,350 --> 00:48:17,500
context for them and I don't know if

1179
00:48:15,730 --> 00:48:19,330
that's it was just an observation I

1180
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:20,740
don't want to publish that yet I think

1181
00:48:19,330 --> 00:48:23,110
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> the interesting observation that</font>

1182
00:48:20,740 --> 00:48:25,390
there are five percent that just don't

1183
00:48:23,110 --> 00:48:27,160
get it through<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> everybody</font>

1184
00:48:25,390 --> 00:48:28,810
else is getting it but at least here's

1185
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:30,520
one thing we have now we have all<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

1186
00:48:28,810 --> 00:48:33,190
day that says hey everyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> else got it</font>

1187
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:34,720
what's wrong<font color="#E5E5E5"> with you so at least they</font>

1188
00:48:33,190 --> 00:48:36,670
they know then it's not just the

1189
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:38,169
procedure for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the training or whatever</font>

1190
00:48:36,670 --> 00:48:41,590
they know that other people are actually

1191
00:48:38,170 --> 00:48:44,290
exceeding that these things I I guess I

1192
00:48:41,590 --> 00:48:46,930
have a more complex variety of skeptics

1193
00:48:44,290 --> 00:48:49,600
maybe I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> break decompose it more I</font>

1194
00:48:46,930 --> 00:48:52,180
have a challenge in my first<font color="#E5E5E5"> book it's a</font>

00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:54,549
ten-thousand-dollar prize and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm happy</font>

00:48:52,180 --> 00:48:55,629
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> write the check</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> anytime</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for anyone</font>

anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> with statistics it's not even</font>

1200

was<font color="#E5E5E5"> first published in 2007 with state</font>

1201
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:07,510
of fries it sounds like a joke I'm

1202
00:49:05,650 --> 00:49:09,670
serious about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it but people say it all</font>

1203
00:49:07,510 --> 00:49:11,350
the time and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> said well then you've got</font>

1204
00:49:09,670 --> 00:49:14,860
ten thousand dollars coming if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

1205
00:49:11,350 --> 00:49:16,480
prove it I'm serious and it's been out

1206
00:49:14,860 --> 00:49:18,670
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> no one's even sent me a single</font>

1207
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:21,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">email saying i think i might have you on</font>

1208
00:49:18,670 --> 00:49:22,960
something because<font color="#CCCCCC"> obviously it's absurd</font>

1209
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:26,380
i can probably take a stab at the

1210
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:29,820
converse<font color="#E5E5E5"> but you can prove nothing this</font>

1211
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:32,320
is it or well something more sinister

1212
00:49:29,820 --> 00:49:35,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">there's the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> expression statistics don't</font>

1213
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:37,390
lie but<font color="#CCCCCC"> Liars use statistics right I</font>

1214
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:40,180
heard that<font color="#E5E5E5"> one too I would</font>

1215
00:49:37,390 --> 00:49:42,129
say well it's true I can prove anything

1216
00:49:40,180 --> 00:49:43,720
to you a statistics but you can't prove

1217
00:49:42,130 --> 00:49:45,700
anything to me was the distance<font color="#E5E5E5"> there is</font>

1218
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:48,279
it I mean you have to have some

1219
00:49:45,700 --> 00:49:51,100
knowledge about these things so yeah

1220
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:53,890
what they mean is it's easy for people

1221
00:49:51,100 --> 00:49:56,620
to get suckered by numbers if that's

1222
00:49:53,890 --> 00:49:58,900
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> they made sure yeah it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> possible I</font>

1223
00:49:56,620 --> 00:50:01,900
run<font color="#E5E5E5"> into other situations where people</font>

1224
00:49:58,900 --> 00:50:04,330
will say I've run into the 30 sample

1225
00:50:01,900 --> 00:50:05,920
size they I say well you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know that's</font>

1226
00:50:04,330 --> 00:50:08,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">just the point where you can use</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the Z</font>

1227
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:09,700
statistic as opposed to the student<font color="#CCCCCC"> T</font>

1228
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:12,130
the student<font color="#CCCCCC"> t and the Z statistic</font>

1229
00:50:09,700 --> 00:50:13,509
converge at 30 you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can just use it</font>

1230
00:50:12,130 --> 00:50:16,330
that's what that meant because I

1231
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:18,220
guarantee or that chapter on student T

1232
00:50:16,330 --> 00:50:20,680
distributions was for smaller samples of

1233
00:50:18,220 --> 00:50:25,720
them 30 right and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> was taught telling</font>

1234
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:27,430
this story at lunch that I'm in a room

1235
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:30,339
full at a farm a client where there's

1236
00:50:27,430 --> 00:50:32,440
several PhD biostatisticians an

1237
00:50:30,340 --> 00:50:35,200
additional pharmacologist and all these

1238
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:37,480
other kind types of people and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> asked</font>

1239
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:39,189
them here's a results of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> sample of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 5 I</font>

1240
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:42,850
showed them a sample of<font color="#E5E5E5"> 5 out of their</font>

1241
00:50:39,190 --> 00:50:44,680
whole organization is this statistically

1242
00:50:42,850 --> 00:50:46,270
significant and a bunch of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> shook</font>

1243
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:48,100
their head right away well the only

1244
00:50:46,270 --> 00:50:49,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">correct answer is you don't know I</font>

1245
00:50:48,100 --> 00:50:50,830
haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> told you my p-value my</font>

1246
00:50:49,690 --> 00:50:52,300
significance level<font color="#CCCCCC"> I haven't say the</font>

1247
00:50:50,830 --> 00:50:54,270
hypothesis yet there's all sorts of

1248
00:50:52,300 --> 00:50:57,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">things but certainly you could have a</font>

1249
00:50:54,270 --> 00:50:59,200
hypothesis you were testing where sample

1250
00:50:57,010 --> 00:51:01,620
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> 5 was significant and it was useful</font>

1251
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:05,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">and told you more than you knew before</font>

1252
00:51:01,620 --> 00:51:08,410
so people<font color="#CCCCCC"> had this pre math judgment</font>

1253
00:51:05,620 --> 00:51:09,819
they make about what uncertainty

1254
00:51:08,410 --> 00:51:11,950
reduction they can get from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the data</font>

1255
00:51:09,820 --> 00:51:13,810
they have or how much uncertainty

1256
00:51:11,950 --> 00:51:15,129
reduction is justified given<font color="#E5E5E5"> the risk</font>

1257
00:51:13,810 --> 00:51:16,540
and make me know the magnitude of my

1258
00:51:15,130 --> 00:51:19,450
decision and<font color="#E5E5E5"> my uncertainty about it</font>

1259
00:51:16,540 --> 00:51:20,650
they're just winging<font color="#CCCCCC"> it you know when</font>

1260
00:51:19,450 --> 00:51:22,359
someone says we don't have sufficient

1261
00:51:20,650 --> 00:51:23,710
data to measure this I say show me<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

1262
00:51:22,360 --> 00:51:25,990
math because that's actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

1263
00:51:23,710 --> 00:51:27,370
mathematical plane when somebody says

1264
00:51:25,990 --> 00:51:29,109
they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have sufficient data to</font>

1265
00:51:27,370 --> 00:51:31,210
measure this what they mean or what they

1266
00:51:29,110 --> 00:51:32,440
should mean is that I have<font color="#CCCCCC"> already</font>

1267
00:51:31,210 --> 00:51:34,270
worked out in advance how much

1268
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:35,890
uncertainty reduction I get from my

1269
00:51:34,270 --> 00:51:37,090
given data and that uncertainty

1270
00:51:35,890 --> 00:51:38,680
reduction doesn't actually reduce

1271
00:51:37,090 --> 00:51:41,980
uncertainty for my<font color="#E5E5E5"> current state without</font>

1272
00:51:38,680 --> 00:51:43,720
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the data actually no one's</font>

1273
00:51:41,980 --> 00:51:45,190
ever produced their calculation to

1274
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:47,290
demonstrate this it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just simply a</font>

1275
00:51:45,190 --> 00:51:49,030
presumption of people throughout and for

1276
00:51:47,290 --> 00:51:50,529
reasons like the uniqueness fallacy I

1277
00:51:49,030 --> 00:51:51,040
used to<font color="#E5E5E5"> call it the fallacy of close</font>

1278
00:51:50,530 --> 00:51:52,450
analogy

1279
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:54,370
and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I found out there was a term</font>

1280
00:51:52,450 --> 00:51:57,730
for it and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I certain</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> calling uniqueness</font>

1281
00:51:54,370 --> 00:51:59,200
fallacy but the fallacy of close analogy

1282
00:51:57,730 --> 00:52:00,550
is one of the reasons why people think

1283
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:02,049
they have very little data when it

1284
00:52:00,550 --> 00:52:05,230
factors quite a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're resourceful</font>

1285
00:52:02,050 --> 00:52:07,180
enough right I the anecdote I was using

1286
00:52:05,230 --> 00:52:10,680
before was my<font color="#CCCCCC"> insurance company has</font>

1287
00:52:07,180 --> 00:52:14,440
technically no data on my rate of death

1288
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:16,089
other than I haven't died yet so how do

1289
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:19,030
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> work out a life insurance premium for</font>

1290
00:52:16,090 --> 00:52:21,940
me aren't I unique there's no one else

1291
00:52:19,030 --> 00:52:23,470
exactly like me well of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course no one</font>

1292
00:52:21,940 --> 00:52:24,970
else is exactly like me but they can

1293
00:52:23,470 --> 00:52:28,480
still interpolate from larger

1294
00:52:24,970 --> 00:52:30,189
heterogeneous sets so yes you're all

1295
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:31,840
unique<font color="#E5E5E5"> as snowflakes just like the</font>

1296
00:52:30,190 --> 00:52:34,660
trillions of other snowflakes all right

1297
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:36,550
you're all uniformly you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

1298
00:52:34,660 --> 00:52:38,170
we can steal interpolate when someone

1299
00:52:36,550 --> 00:52:40,300
says I cannot extrapolate from

1300
00:52:38,170 --> 00:52:42,880
dissimilar data they just shot down our

whole claim no expertise what's their

<font color="#E5E5E5">more skeptics in information security so</font>

1307
00:52:57,220 --> 00:53:01,600
I since I have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of crossover</font>

1308
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:05,260
with information security and my other

00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:06,819
work I really think people<font color="#E5E5E5"> information</font>

1310
00:53:05,260 --> 00:53:09,610
security might be a little bit more

1311
00:53:06,820 --> 00:53:11,860
likely you know I'll reserve this as a

1312
00:53:09,610 --> 00:53:14,050
hypothesis until like collect more data

1313
00:53:11,860 --> 00:53:15,310
but anecdotally I'm observing that

1314
00:53:14,050 --> 00:53:17,650
they're a little bit more likely to

1315
00:53:15,310 --> 00:53:19,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">believe their unique and special but</font>

1316
00:53:17,650 --> 00:53:22,270
their risk are actually different from

1317
00:53:19,930 --> 00:53:24,850
my risk of my clients who dig mines in

1318
00:53:22,270 --> 00:53:26,140
Canada or have no risk of drought in the

1319
00:53:24,850 --> 00:53:28,029
Horn of Africa or something like that

1320
00:53:26,140 --> 00:53:30,580
well we get that argument all the time

1321
00:53:28,030 --> 00:53:32,860
we r you know our risk is different<font color="#CCCCCC"> ya</font>

1322
00:53:30,580 --> 00:53:34,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not everybody's responds</font>

1323
00:53:32,860 --> 00:53:36,700
only not different I mean everybody's

1324
00:53:34,810 --> 00:53:39,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">wrist different subway I suppose but</font>

1325
00:53:36,700 --> 00:53:42,850
we're unique uniformly different ratio

1326
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:45,670
believing you would be accommodating you

1327
00:53:42,850 --> 00:53:47,500
believe in your review hey I'm all about

1328
00:53:45,670 --> 00:53:50,770
like I<font color="#E5E5E5"> said I'm a sucker for empirical</font>

1329
00:53:47,500 --> 00:53:53,380
evidence and I have simple too small to

1330
00:53:50,770 --> 00:53:55,210
be statistically<font color="#E5E5E5"> significant trials that</font>

1331
00:53:53,380 --> 00:53:56,560
we can set up<font color="#E5E5E5"> in spreadsheets where we</font>

1332
00:53:55,210 --> 00:53:58,390
can do tests over and over again to

1333
00:53:56,560 --> 00:53:59,950
estimate the means or meetings and

1334
00:53:58,390 --> 00:54:02,799
populations and if somebody doesn't

1335
00:53:59,950 --> 00:54:05,230
believe those simple equations we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

1336
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:09,490
set up<font color="#E5E5E5"> a simulation</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and I can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just bet</font>

1337
00:54:05,230 --> 00:54:11,650
real money until they run out or until

1338
00:54:09,490 --> 00:54:13,359
they give up and<font color="#E5E5E5"> say I have another</font>

1339
00:54:11,650 --> 00:54:14,980
anecdote to talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> information</font>

1340
00:54:13,360 --> 00:54:16,540
security<font color="#E5E5E5"> people so I do a lot of</font>

1341
00:54:14,980 --> 00:54:19,420
statistical research and stuff like that

1342
00:54:16,540 --> 00:54:21,550
and I'll present to security people the

1343
00:54:19,420 --> 00:54:24,520
research i do and also present to

1344
00:54:21,550 --> 00:54:25,990
statisticians talking about the the code

1345
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:27,820
and the language<font color="#E5E5E5"> and all that stuff</font>

1346
00:54:25,990 --> 00:54:30,790
talking about how I arrived at things in

1347
00:54:27,820 --> 00:54:31,870
my industry and security people say yeah

1348
00:54:30,790 --> 00:54:33,220
I came up with<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and they're like</font>

1349
00:54:31,870 --> 00:54:34,660
we'll wait how'd you do that I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

1350
00:54:33,220 --> 00:54:36,009
know principal component analysis a

1351
00:54:34,660 --> 00:54:38,200
hierarchical clustering stuff like

1352
00:54:36,010 --> 00:54:39,700
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> like slow down a bit go through</font>

1353
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:42,069
that again you know and then I'm gonna

1354
00:54:39,700 --> 00:54:44,049
talk institution statisticians and I'll

1355
00:54:42,070 --> 00:54:46,660
say you know principal component

1356
00:54:44,050 --> 00:54:47,920
analysis and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm like oh you know like</font>

1357
00:54:46,660 --> 00:54:50,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's the under discussion oh but</font>

1358
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:52,060
security people are very very skeptical

1359
00:54:50,140 --> 00:54:53,799
they're like I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't really go through</font>

1360
00:54:52,060 --> 00:54:55,450
all of that again you know explain how

1361
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:57,070
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> works because that that doesn't</font>

1362
00:54:55,450 --> 00:54:58,810
match my statistics course from high

1363
00:54:57,070 --> 00:55:01,300
school you know another angle that I

1364
00:54:58,810 --> 00:55:04,480
think we should<font color="#E5E5E5"> take is we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> should invite</font>

1365
00:55:01,300 --> 00:55:07,510
skepticism absolutely be skeptical of

1366
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:11,230
models I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just say be equally skeptical</font>

1367
00:55:07,510 --> 00:55:13,270
of your expert intuition hold this you

1368
00:55:11,230 --> 00:55:16,420
know judge that by the same standards

1369
00:55:13,270 --> 00:55:18,400
what's the performance of that<font color="#CCCCCC"> method it</font>

1370
00:55:16,420 --> 00:55:19,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">is a method that has been measured by</font>

1371
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:21,760
the way it has a measurable performance

1372
00:55:19,420 --> 00:55:23,920
and many components many parameters of

1373
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:24,940
that method have been measured we know

1374
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:26,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">that people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are statistically</font>

1375
00:55:24,940 --> 00:55:28,690
overconfident we know that<font color="#CCCCCC"> people are</font>

1376
00:55:26,860 --> 00:55:30,280
highly inconsistent no matter how many

1377
00:55:28,690 --> 00:55:31,680
decades of experience they have they

1378
00:55:30,280 --> 00:55:34,390
can't seem to get the same answer twice

1379
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:37,089
you know you ever<font color="#E5E5E5"> had to sit down and</font>

1380
00:55:34,390 --> 00:55:39,069
judge a list of things like the cost of

1381
00:55:37,090 --> 00:55:40,750
an effort or the risk of a bunch of

<font color="#E5E5E5">different things done judgmental list</font>

1383
00:55:40,750 --> 00:55:46,690
should the order of the list matter it

1384
00:55:44,410 --> 00:55:48,310
shouldn't and it does it's been tested<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

1385
00:55:46,690 --> 00:55:50,080
whole bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of times just the different</font>

1386
00:55:48,310 --> 00:55:52,810
orders of the list it's called anchoring

1387
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:54,850
it's a well-established effect now so we

1388
00:55:52,810 --> 00:55:57,580
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> all of these psychological</font>

1389
00:55:54,850 --> 00:55:59,770
weird quirks that we have but here's the

1390
00:55:57,580 --> 00:56:01,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">key thing remember no matter what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you're</font>

1391
00:55:59,770 --> 00:56:04,600
doing it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> about a model and all models</font>

1392
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:07,240
are wrong but some models are measurably

1393
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:08,770
more useful than others you know the

1394
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:12,850
story of the guy is getting ready to go

hiking in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the woods right one guy sits</font>

00:56:17,020 --> 00:56:19,600
his buddy since what are you doing he

1399
00:56:18,340 --> 00:56:20,770
says well I heard you're a bears in the

1400
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:22,750
woods today so I thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> I better put</font>

1401
00:56:20,770 --> 00:56:25,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">out my running shoes his but he says</font>

1402
00:56:22,750 --> 00:56:26,560
well you can't outrun<font color="#CCCCCC"> a bear he says I</font>

1403
00:56:25,420 --> 00:56:29,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't have to outrun the bear</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i have to</font>

1404
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:31,600
outrun you right that's all<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're doing</font>

1405
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:34,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">with the methods I'm sorry if everyone's</font>

1406
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:35,920
heard that a bunch<font color="#CCCCCC"> of times but that's</font>

talking about measurably better you

1409
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:42,370
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to go for perfection it's</font>

1410
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:50,109
just better than<font color="#CCCCCC"> it was before yeah</font>

1411
00:56:42,370 --> 00:56:54,819
Patrick circus certain species of wolves

1412
00:56:50,110 --> 00:56:57,760
that lie there hunting techniques if you

1413
00:56:54,820 --> 00:57:00,640
outrun me because they have sent some

1414
00:56:57,760 --> 00:57:04,480
runners up ahead you'll just<font color="#E5E5E5"> get eaten</font>

1415
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:06,549
before<font color="#E5E5E5"> i geti yeah that's that's it</font>

1416
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:08,290
that's true in nature so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have to</font>

1417
00:57:06,550 --> 00:57:11,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">know the threat right Patrick you have</font>

1418
00:57:08,290 --> 00:57:13,720
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your threats the other thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd</font>

1419
00:57:11,410 --> 00:57:16,029
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to comment yeah I think everybody</font>

1420
00:57:13,720 --> 00:57:18,819
probably knows by now<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I worked in</font>

1421
00:57:16,030 --> 00:57:21,130
medicine for a long time and one of the

1422
00:57:18,820 --> 00:57:26,140
most<font color="#CCCCCC"> astonishing things that I learned</font>

1423
00:57:21,130 --> 00:57:29,790
early on is the role of expert judgment

1424
00:57:26,140 --> 00:57:32,890
in the assessment of clinical outcomes

1425
00:57:29,790 --> 00:57:36,330
non-medical people tend<font color="#E5E5E5"> to assume that</font>

1426
00:57:32,890 --> 00:57:39,250
medicine has all this great data and

1427
00:57:36,330 --> 00:57:42,160
depending if it's Pharma if it's medical

1428
00:57:39,250 --> 00:57:46,120
therapy maybe but if it's a surgical

1429
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:47,980
modality you know not so much and I

1430
00:57:46,120 --> 00:57:50,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">think the big secret information</font>

1431
00:57:47,980 --> 00:57:53,800
security people don't get this is that

1432
00:57:50,410 --> 00:57:57,190
really every discipline relies rather

1433
00:57:53,800 --> 00:58:01,850
heavily at times on the role of expert

1434
00:57:57,190 --> 00:58:03,950
judgment physics chemistry everything

1435
00:58:01,850 --> 00:58:05,990
so I just want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to throw that in but</font>

1436
00:58:03,950 --> 00:58:07,970
remember about the Wolves when you start

1437
00:58:05,990 --> 00:58:11,089
talking about marriage<font color="#E5E5E5"> I you know</font>

1438
00:58:07,970 --> 00:58:13,160
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> always a needle exceptions so if</font>

1439
00:58:11,090 --> 00:58:14,990
we evaluated a drug based on anecdotal

1440
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:17,480
exceptions homeopathy works great

1441
00:58:14,990 --> 00:58:20,029
because then you can always<font color="#CCCCCC"> think of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

1442
00:58:17,480 --> 00:58:21,680
anecdote where it worked right but so i

1443
00:58:20,030 --> 00:58:23,960
think we'll try to wrap it<font color="#E5E5E5"> up here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font>

1444
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:27,440
if we could just<font color="#E5E5E5"> go through each of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

1445
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:29,420
and just say sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a long Russell's</font>

1446
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:32,620
question about where where should people

1447
00:58:29,420 --> 00:58:35,540
go like if a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the people i think</font>

1448
00:58:32,620 --> 00:58:37,100
practitioners are always looking for the

1449
00:58:35,540 --> 00:58:38,990
next thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to learn the next thing to</font>

1450
00:58:37,100 --> 00:58:41,000
look at what's the resource that's

1451
00:58:38,990 --> 00:58:42,319
helped you or you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can even say you know</font>

1452
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:44,210
go read my book or something like that

1453
00:58:42,320 --> 00:58:49,070
but done or what would you recommend

1454
00:58:44,210 --> 00:58:51,410
people go go do to learn more it might

1455
00:58:49,070 --> 00:58:54,110
be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> loaded question but well a lot of</font>

1456
00:58:51,410 --> 00:58:56,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">the things that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> recommend for</font>

1457
00:58:54,110 --> 00:58:59,660
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are things actually cited in my</font>

1458
00:58:56,630 --> 00:59:01,880
book so yeah go read my blog so so

1459
00:58:59,660 --> 00:59:04,250
that's a one<font color="#CCCCCC"> one-stop shopping to go</font>

1460
00:59:01,880 --> 00:59:05,930
look for all that but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I would say one</font>

1461
00:59:04,250 --> 00:59:08,990
key thing just look outside<font color="#E5E5E5"> your own</font>

1462
00:59:05,930 --> 00:59:11,690
discipline yeah it's not new it's been

1463
00:59:08,990 --> 00:59:13,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">done before I tell everybody no matter</font>

1464
00:59:11,690 --> 00:59:14,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">what you're measuring just assume it's</font>

1465
00:59:13,340 --> 00:59:16,010
been measured before assume you've got

1466
00:59:14,690 --> 00:59:17,810
more data than you think assuming you

1467
00:59:16,010 --> 00:59:19,550
need less date or anything those are

1468
00:59:17,810 --> 00:59:21,380
very productive assumptions they almost

1469
00:59:19,550 --> 00:59:23,060
always turn out to be true so no matter

1470
00:59:21,380 --> 00:59:24,740
what you're assessing just assume<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1471
00:59:23,060 --> 00:59:26,029
somebody outside your own has done

1472
00:59:24,740 --> 00:59:28,370
something like<font color="#E5E5E5"> it that you're really not</font>

1473
00:59:26,030 --> 00:59:31,010
unique that's a great<font color="#E5E5E5"> place to start to</font>

1474
00:59:28,370 --> 00:59:33,710
assume you not unique yeah along<font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font>

1475
00:59:31,010 --> 00:59:35,630
lines when I said that I had sworn off

1476
00:59:33,710 --> 00:59:37,690
for those years anything you know

1477
00:59:35,630 --> 00:59:41,360
written by anybody in<font color="#E5E5E5"> our profession</font>

1478
00:59:37,690 --> 00:59:43,130
what I substituted was materials written

1479
00:59:41,360 --> 00:59:46,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">by people outside of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our profession</font>

1480
00:59:43,130 --> 00:59:48,320
right and I had literally within two

1481
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:51,110
years i read<font color="#CCCCCC"> forty some different books</font>

1482
00:59:48,320 --> 00:59:53,660
on probability and statistics and

1483
00:59:51,110 --> 00:59:56,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">decision making and and just weird stuff</font>

1484
00:59:53,660 --> 00:59:58,250
that was really outside<font color="#CCCCCC"> of what we might</font>

1485
00:59:56,030 --> 01:00:01,190
think of as<font color="#E5E5E5"> applicable to this problem</font>

1486
00:59:58,250 --> 01:00:03,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">but that that had some little nugget in</font>

1487
01:00:01,190 --> 01:00:06,290
there that really fed the development of

1488
01:00:03,560 --> 01:00:10,250
the concepts and such and so a big part

1489
01:00:06,290 --> 01:00:13,250
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it too is is being open minded and</font>

1490
01:00:10,250 --> 01:00:15,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">open to being receptive to things that</font>

1491
01:00:13,250 --> 01:00:18,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">might seem tangential but my</font>

1492
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:20,630
not right because that's I think we're

1493
01:00:18,260 --> 01:00:23,030
leaps sometimes occur right it's a

1494
01:00:20,630 --> 01:00:24,859
mutation event if you will mentally for

1495
01:00:23,030 --> 01:00:26,650
you in terms of how you're approaching

1496
01:00:24,859 --> 01:00:29,420
or thinking through a tough problem

1497
01:00:26,650 --> 01:00:30,920
because these are not trivial problems I

1498
01:00:29,420 --> 01:00:33,890
mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> even if we get the nomenclature</font>

1499
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:38,300
down straight and we get decent broken

1500
01:00:33,890 --> 01:00:40,578
models you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know we're still faced with</font>

1501
01:00:38,300 --> 01:00:43,550
some really<font color="#E5E5E5"> tough challenges and getting</font>

1502
01:00:40,579 --> 01:00:47,450
past those because we're not unique

1503
01:00:43,550 --> 01:00:51,410
right sometimes takes prodding or some

1504
01:00:47,450 --> 01:00:53,480
sort of insider from from an unexpected

1505
01:00:51,410 --> 01:00:55,250
source and so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to be receptive</font>

1506
01:00:53,480 --> 01:00:56,960
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> those sources when you're walking</font>

1507
01:00:55,250 --> 01:01:00,109
through Barnes<font color="#CCCCCC"> and Nobles or whatever</font>

1508
01:00:56,960 --> 01:01:01,910
you see a title of just what the heck

1509
01:01:00,109 --> 01:01:04,578
does that mean right pick<font color="#E5E5E5"> it off the</font>

1510
01:01:01,910 --> 01:01:06,348
shelf because probably a quarter of the

1511
01:01:04,579 --> 01:01:08,780
books that i read that really

1512
01:01:06,349 --> 01:01:11,690
substantial in helping me grow my own

1513
01:01:08,780 --> 01:01:14,089
understanding and develop fair didn't

1514
01:01:11,690 --> 01:01:16,280
come from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> statistics shelf or the</font>

1515
01:01:14,089 --> 01:01:19,490
business shelf or anything like that it

1516
01:01:16,280 --> 01:01:21,589
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> something kind of like you know lady</font>

1517
01:01:19,490 --> 01:01:23,868
tasting tea or something like that I was

1518
01:01:21,589 --> 01:01:26,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">like that's odd and I pick</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it up and</font>

1519
01:01:23,869 --> 01:01:28,060
there'd be<font color="#E5E5E5"> something really you know</font>

1520
01:01:26,630 --> 01:01:30,800
meaningful in there so just

1521
01:01:28,060 --> 01:01:33,109
receptiveness to two things outside of

1522
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:36,079
what you might think<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd like to just</font>

1523
01:01:33,109 --> 01:01:38,210
let<font color="#CCCCCC"> go the same sentiments because none</font>

1524
01:01:36,079 --> 01:01:39,710
of us are omniscient but there's a lot

1525
01:01:38,210 --> 01:01:42,890
of there a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> good nuggets in</font>

1526
01:01:39,710 --> 01:01:45,260
virtually everything I for a<font color="#E5E5E5"> long time</font>

1527
01:01:42,890 --> 01:01:47,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">stopped reading things in the risk</font>

1528
01:01:45,260 --> 01:01:49,520
management space because I saw so much I

1529
01:01:47,450 --> 01:01:53,450
disagreed with and it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was just</font>

1530
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:55,700
fundamentally wrong and that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think one</font>

1531
01:01:53,450 --> 01:01:57,200
of the things we need is it why we wrote

1532
01:01:55,700 --> 01:01:59,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">the paper is there needs to be an</font>

1533
01:01:57,200 --> 01:02:01,669
industry consensus definition of risk

1534
01:01:59,089 --> 01:02:04,609
that's a robust theoretically valid

1535
01:02:01,670 --> 01:02:06,890
definition and then we can have an

1536
01:02:04,609 --> 01:02:09,170
intelligent debate on this on many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1537
01:02:06,890 --> 01:02:14,299
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> topics rather than you know people</font>

1538
01:02:09,170 --> 01:02:16,069
talking past each other so I by the way

1539
01:02:14,300 --> 01:02:18,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">also some of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the stuff I've written a</font>

1540
01:02:16,069 --> 01:02:22,369
few years ago i'm embarrassed it hit me

1541
01:02:18,920 --> 01:02:25,930
too so you know as we grow we learn<font color="#CCCCCC"> more</font>

1542
01:02:22,369 --> 01:02:27,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">and recognizing the mistakes we've made</font>

1543
01:02:25,930 --> 01:02:28,759
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright well thank you everybody thank</font>

1544
01:02:27,980 --> 01:02:32,620
for

1545
01:02:28,760 --> 01:02:32,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">our panelist for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> taking the time today</font>
