1
00:00:01,139 --> 00:00:04,600
hello again has it been doing feeling

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:08,019
good

3
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:12,370
pumped fired up yeah I feel the energy

4
00:00:08,019 --> 00:00:14,410
it's awesome so I am pleased introduce

5
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:17,079
Shaam who will be giving a great talk on

6
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:19,300
a really important topic which is hiring

7
00:00:17,079 --> 00:00:29,919
security so please give a warm 1700 hour

8
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:32,020
welcome to sham cool so a brief

9
00:00:29,919 --> 00:00:33,580
introduction about myself I'm the head

10
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:36,730
of product and application security at

11
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:39,099
coinbase in terms of ownership we've got

12
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:41,860
everything from user security like user

13
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:45,190
facing products to crypto nodes and then

14
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:49,060
hardware up it's kind of our purview so

15
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:51,220
also for this talk this is a brief case

16
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:53,470
study in terms of how we built our

17
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:57,519
hiring pipeline why we hire as we hire

18
00:00:53,470 --> 00:01:00,640
and kind of who who we look for again

19
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:02,410
there are a lot of caveats here first is

20
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,209
these are there are a lot of opinions on

21
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:05,459
how to hire well and what you should

22
00:01:04,209 --> 00:01:08,770
look for when you're building a program

23
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:10,030
these are my opinions on what I look for

24
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:12,369
and what I think are important these

25
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:13,930
aren't the only opinions you're welcome

26
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:15,400
I encourage you to tell me that I'm

27
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:17,530
wrong

28
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:21,670
second I'm using coinbase as a case

29
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:23,350
study here so I'm trying to avoid this

30
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:25,150
sounding like a sales pitch as much as I

31
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:27,339
can but I'm gonna reference kind of what

32
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:29,380
we do what we are what's going on a lot

33
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:32,470
in order to kind of get that information

34
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:33,789
across last there's a lot of

35
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:34,539
simplification that's going to be

36
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:36,670
happening here

37
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:38,320
there's many months and years of work

38
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:40,510
that went into getting to where we are

39
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:42,850
right now a lot of that I have to sum up

40
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:45,760
in a slide so I'm gonna be glossing over

41
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:49,869
some stuff it'll be maybe not that

42
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:51,310
obvious so first off like any good case

43
00:01:49,869 --> 00:01:55,270
study let's start with the problem

44
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:57,220
statement coin base at its core has four

45
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:59,740
assets that we really really care about

46
00:01:57,220 --> 00:02:02,380
first is cryptocurrency and we have a

47
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:05,048
lot of it that can be irrevocably lost a

48
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:07,119
second is user data in order to operate

49
00:02:05,049 --> 00:02:08,740
in the u.s. you know we have to collect

50
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:10,780
a lot of user data we have to keep it

51
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:14,110
for a long time it's probably one of our

52
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:16,270
largest liabilities the third is actual

53
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:19,570
user trust that will keep the first two

54
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:21,370
items safe and secure and finally it's

55
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:24,220
an Agilent engineering team that

56
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:28,450
heartily embraces near continuous

57
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:29,950
delivery with those four problems kind

58
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:31,570
of established and kind of the the

59
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:35,230
assets that we have to protect we've got

60
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:38,440
two basic goals keep those assets keep

61
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:39,730
the engineers moving fast I really have

62
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:41,320
nothing else to add here like this is

63
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:43,420
about as simple as it can get in terms

64
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:45,070
of summing it all up there's a lot when

65
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:46,390
it comes to actual operations to enable

66
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:48,209
these but at the end of the day that's

67
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:52,839
that's all it is

68
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:55,420
so what do we decide to do there's three

69
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:56,800
basic things that we did first we want

70
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:59,708
to integrate with sprint planning and

71
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:01,180
sprint retros kandahar dev teams work so

72
00:02:59,709 --> 00:03:02,770
that's be present when the work is

73
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:04,570
getting done so we understand how it

74
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:05,820
gets done know kind of what how the

75
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:09,100
sausage is made

76
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:11,680
the second is working the pipelines

77
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:13,600
themselves the devs have set up CI CD

78
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:16,000
they have automated testing they have

79
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:18,489
code reviews for every pull request add

80
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,470
into those pipelines and processes all

81
00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:22,570
the stuff that we want to get done if

82
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:24,220
they're doing automated testing build

83
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:26,109
security tooling that sits right next to

84
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:27,670
it if they're doing code reviews anyway

85
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:29,790
make sure they know when and how to tag

86
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:32,768
security people into those code reviews

87
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:34,329
and finally if they're you know they're

88
00:03:32,769 --> 00:03:37,000
using feature flags and whatnot to ship

89
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:38,590
fast get security teams opted into those

90
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,739
feature flags make sure that we're part

91
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:43,600
of the test cohorts the last thing that

92
00:03:41,739 --> 00:03:45,700
we really wanted to do was not be a

93
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:48,760
security team that only finds bugs but

94
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:51,130
also like starts to fix them we've we

95
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:53,170
think that there's no point if all you

96
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:54,430
can do is kind of raise the flag we need

97
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:56,708
people who are at least capable of

98
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:58,209
patching small issues maybe not the big

99
00:03:56,709 --> 00:04:01,720
gnarly deep ones but at least

100
00:03:58,209 --> 00:04:03,549
superficial ones essentially let's not

101
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:07,989
be dependent on another team in order to

102
00:04:03,549 --> 00:04:09,549
get our work done so with that how do

103
00:04:07,989 --> 00:04:10,260
you establish kind of who you're looking

104
00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:13,000
for

105
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:14,950
there's a neat little trick that just

106
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,450
happened which is as I described all the

107
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:18,668
different pieces of what we're looking

108
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:21,010
for we've kind of written up a job

109
00:04:18,668 --> 00:04:22,690
description it'll take a little bit of

110
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:24,280
massaging to make HR and talent like

111
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:26,830
actually happy before you can sort of

112
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:28,628
publish that but it's kind of four

113
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:30,639
core things three of which are most

114
00:04:28,629 --> 00:04:32,830
important right now person needs to be

115
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:34,389
able to code review they need to be able

116
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:36,849
to write security tooling that's right

117
00:04:34,389 --> 00:04:38,530
in our DevOps pipeline they need to

118
00:04:36,849 --> 00:04:40,330
write do enough security engineering to

119
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:41,590
be able to fix and like prevent core

120
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:44,650
security bugs in code

121
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:46,150
we also would love some some

122
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:47,560
architecture reviews and threat modeling

123
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:52,179
but if you can do the first three you

124
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:53,650
can solve most of the problems so with

125
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:55,509
that let's start talking about the

126
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:59,669
actual kind of hiring process this is

127
00:04:55,509 --> 00:05:02,469
the meat of what we do and why we do it

128
00:04:59,669 --> 00:05:03,729
so again before we get too deep into

129
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:06,520
that let's figure out what we want to

130
00:05:03,729 --> 00:05:08,650
optimize for we chose a couple core

131
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:10,180
aspects first we want to minimize the

132
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:13,179
number of hops we send a person through

133
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:14,979
it's super painful being in a hiring

134
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:16,360
pipeline right there's lots of people to

135
00:05:14,979 --> 00:05:18,969
talk to you're constantly being judged

136
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:20,620
it's no fun we want that information in

137
00:05:18,969 --> 00:05:23,250
that process of you kind of as clear and

138
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:25,479
as efficient as possible at every step

139
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:27,759
because of that we also want to get as

140
00:05:25,479 --> 00:05:29,469
much like kind of signal as we can out

141
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:32,680
of each huh

142
00:05:29,469 --> 00:05:34,449
while not adding a ton of cost to doing

143
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:36,340
each hop whether that's the cost on the

144
00:05:34,449 --> 00:05:37,810
person who's giving kind of being

145
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:40,359
interviewed or the interview or on the

146
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:42,219
other side end of the day we ended up

147
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:44,740
with three hops and about nine total

148
00:05:42,219 --> 00:05:46,210
hours of work of course it's not nine

149
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:47,919
hours from start to finish it'll still

150
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:50,378
take you know a couple up a couple weeks

151
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:51,758
to get through the fastest we've seen

152
00:05:50,379 --> 00:05:56,169
this kind of go through is about a week

153
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:58,509
and a half so starting off there's two

154
00:05:56,169 --> 00:06:01,020
phone calls the first phone calls with

155
00:05:58,509 --> 00:06:03,759
our recruiting team it covers the basics

156
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:05,859
are you employable in the US or wherever

157
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:07,240
else we're trying to hire you do you

158
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:11,199
actually understand what the job is and

159
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:13,419
do you want this job do you you know are

160
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:14,529
there any other kind of vagaries or

161
00:06:13,419 --> 00:06:16,299
things we need to understand about how

162
00:06:14,529 --> 00:06:18,520
you do work that makes you like not

163
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:19,990
necessarily want to work with us also do

164
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:22,750
you care enough about coinbase to

165
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:25,210
actually work here again the stress of

166
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:26,800
having to protect billions of crypto is

167
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:28,989
enough that you know you need to

168
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,669
self-select in and it's easy to select

169
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:33,550
out we want you to make that decision as

170
00:06:30,669 --> 00:06:35,909
soon as possible there's the second

171
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:38,409
phone call and that's with the the lead

172
00:06:35,909 --> 00:06:40,580
that call is not any kind of screening

173
00:06:38,409 --> 00:06:42,199
that's mostly to answer questions for

174
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:43,490
the candidate what do you want to know

175
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:45,289
about the program what do you want to

176
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:46,759
know about how the team works what do

177
00:06:45,289 --> 00:06:48,590
you want it like what questions can we

178
00:06:46,759 --> 00:06:49,879
answer is there work from home and so on

179
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:51,530
and so forth

180
00:06:49,879 --> 00:06:53,360
we found that there wasn't a ton of

181
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:55,369
signal and actually asking kind of

182
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,539
probing questions getting information or

183
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:58,550
trying to judge a candidate at this

184
00:06:56,539 --> 00:07:01,128
point over the phone nobody really knows

185
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:05,919
them you have a resume to work off of

186
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:08,360
and nothing really else so with that

187
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:09,799
this is generally a very quick pass

188
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:14,120
through there's very few candidates that

189
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:18,080
actually stop at this point here's where

190
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:20,389
we do most of the work we provide a code

191
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,770
sample that we asked are these

192
00:07:20,389 --> 00:07:24,740
developers and these security engineers

193
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:27,859
to take a look at we look for three core

194
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:30,319
things please find the issues please

195
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:33,020
prioritize the issues please fix the

196
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:34,909
highest priority issue if you go back to

197
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:36,859
what we said we wanted to enable our

198
00:07:34,909 --> 00:07:38,090
team with in the earlier slides there

199
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:40,849
were three things that we wanted people

200
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:43,039
to do right we wanted them to be in code

201
00:07:40,849 --> 00:07:45,050
reviews finding bugs we wanted them to

202
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:46,400
be able to fix their own bugs and we

203
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:48,110
wanted them to kind of work with these

204
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,818
dev teams understand how those pipelines

205
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:52,270
and processes work know how to

206
00:07:49,819 --> 00:07:55,340
prioritize get stuff in the right place

207
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:57,740
this gives us kind of the most signal as

208
00:07:55,340 --> 00:08:00,440
far as the technical implementation of

209
00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:02,240
the job is we can possibly get right

210
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:05,870
we're we're using this as the

211
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:07,370
make-or-break for 90% of candidates one

212
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:09,080
thing that we did to kind of balance out

213
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:11,509
how important this is is we made a very

214
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:13,120
robust internal rubric for how to grade

215
00:08:11,509 --> 00:08:15,440
this which means every single

216
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:18,080
vulnerability that we found or has been

217
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:20,810
found or we know about has it's it's

218
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:23,529
kind of its score what the vulnerability

219
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:26,240
is and what an expected fix looks like

220
00:08:23,529 --> 00:08:27,680
we did this for two main reasons one we

221
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,509
found that we weren't being consistent

222
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,800
in scoring across candidates and given

223
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:32,870
how important we made this though that

224
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:35,539
was not that was a non-starter we had to

225
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:38,000
be better at that second is we needed to

226
00:08:35,539 --> 00:08:39,769
reduce bias right like part of

227
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,269
inconsistency is some candidates are

228
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:42,529
being are being selected out because

229
00:08:41,269 --> 00:08:44,810
they didn't write the report the right

230
00:08:42,529 --> 00:08:46,220
way or they fixed a bug that somebody

231
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:48,560
else didn't necessarily think was

232
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:50,149
high-priority we decided for our team

233
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,979
these are high-priority bugs this is

234
00:08:50,149 --> 00:08:53,900
what it looks like everybody like we

235
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:56,840
agree with this rubric so everybody

236
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:59,870
kind of grade the same way for a

237
00:08:56,840 --> 00:09:02,180
candidate this is about four hours for

238
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:05,780
for them to get through it's about 250

239
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:07,579
lines of code it's Sinatra it's not very

240
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:10,220
hard to look at but still we there's

241
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:12,040
about I don't know 50 ish bugs that you

242
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:14,180
could find if you start looking for them

243
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:16,310
when it comes to grading it takes us

244
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:18,560
about 30 minutes to get through a report

245
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:20,989
worst case is about an at like an hour

246
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:22,280
where somebody fixed about 15 of the

247
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:24,920
bugs that they found instead of just the

248
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:27,380
first one what do we look for in this

249
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:29,780
rubric right there scoring did you find

250
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:32,150
enough critical bugs that you can we

251
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:34,069
trust you to find critical bugs did you

252
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:35,480
actually fix the bug right right there's

253
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:37,150
no point if you didn't fix the bug

254
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:39,590
properly you have to fix it correctly

255
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:41,810
and also did you write it up well enough

256
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:43,370
that a dev team a dev team could kind of

257
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:45,109
consume it and understand it right is

258
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:49,340
your prioritization there is that report

259
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:52,460
good this is however the only gate until

260
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:55,040
they actually get to the the in person

261
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:56,930
review in person is much more

262
00:09:55,040 --> 00:10:00,620
lightweight all we're looking for at

263
00:09:56,930 --> 00:10:02,239
this point is given that you've is you

264
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:04,010
know shown competency in the technical

265
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:06,500
part can you actually get along with

266
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:07,939
people and you understand it for those

267
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:10,580
of us who've been doing security for

268
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:12,170
awhile this is probably the hardest part

269
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:13,940
of the job that isn't actually finding

270
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:15,439
the bugs it's convincing everybody else

271
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:16,880
to fix them it's being able to

272
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,950
communicate about them it's being able

273
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:20,990
to work with people kind of in person

274
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:22,760
and get through it and again this is

275
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:25,010
where we lean this interview towards

276
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:26,630
we've we're comfortable with your tech

277
00:10:25,010 --> 00:10:29,120
competency up in this point right the

278
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:30,439
take-home is established it we just want

279
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:33,350
to know how well do you do with people

280
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:37,250
so we break that out into three main

281
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:39,410
interviews the first one is like a pair

282
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:41,780
programming we've asked you to fix a bug

283
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:43,730
that's usually like the one critical bug

284
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:45,980
takes about a line to fix and the code

285
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:47,780
sample in this case it's a couple more

286
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:49,280
lines of code can you do simple enough

287
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:50,810
integration work that you could build

288
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:53,209
enough tools that work in our def

289
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:55,459
pipeline right like we need people who

290
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:57,710
can automate against curls we need

291
00:10:55,460 --> 00:11:00,130
people who can write unit tests and so

292
00:10:57,710 --> 00:11:04,180
forth this only tests up to that point

293
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:07,340
we're not looking for esoteric kind of

294
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:07,819
competencies in weird algorithms we just

295
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:10,880
want to know

296
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:12,500
you get stuff done again this is a pair

297
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:14,120
programming that's led by a developer in

298
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:16,670
our team not necessarily somebody on

299
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:18,620
these security or the OPSEC team we want

300
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:20,360
to know can you work with like a dev and

301
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:22,970
can you guys sit together and get some

302
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:24,650
stuff done again the answer you're

303
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:27,370
looking for is enough code to write a

304
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:30,980
simple task and work with the developer

305
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:33,410
the second kind of major part is an

306
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:35,780
hour-long session that we have it's a

307
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:37,010
whiteboarding session we'll put we'll

308
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:38,600
have a developer like an actual

309
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:40,790
developer in our team put together kind

310
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:43,640
of a rough sketch of an idea that they

311
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:45,680
want to do initially that's all it was

312
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:47,090
we have however kind of gotten rubrics

313
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:49,250
there as well we realized that

314
00:11:47,090 --> 00:11:51,770
developers aid didn't really know what

315
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:53,120
they what were to go with one of these

316
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:55,040
questions once they started asking and

317
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,810
they got stuck and B we started getting

318
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:59,439
bias again in terms of poor questions

319
00:11:56,810 --> 00:12:02,689
being added so again rubric everything

320
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:05,000
but here it's kind of how we actually do

321
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:06,830
work developer will shoulder tap you

322
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,800
you'll they'll sit for half an hour to

323
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:12,110
an hour and whiteboard something out we

324
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:13,849
realized what we what we wanted was

325
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:15,140
somebody who could go back and forth

326
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:17,150
with the developer get an understanding

327
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:18,710
of kind of what are they building how

328
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:21,380
are they building it where security

329
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:22,820
controls need to be but we also wanted a

330
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:25,010
security person in that room to actually

331
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:26,360
judge the quality of the interview the

332
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:28,939
developers were judging against kind of

333
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:30,800
the wrong thing when it came to came to

334
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:32,270
output here they were saying hey is this

335
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:34,670
person friendly you're good to talk with

336
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:36,199
I also want to know can they find

337
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:37,729
critical controls that need to be

338
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:40,940
implemented do they understand where

339
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:43,190
problems are going to come up again

340
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:45,920
we're we're looking forward to things

341
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:48,200
one is can you find this core security

342
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:49,610
concerns early and second is can you

343
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:52,550
work with the dev while they're still

344
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:54,380
just like at the whiteboard stage what

345
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:56,060
what we want to do is by moving kind of

346
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:57,950
to the left it's you're not gonna have

347
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:59,569
documents you're not gonna have like

348
00:12:57,950 --> 00:13:00,890
large architecture or diagrams or

349
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:02,900
whatnot you're just gonna have people

350
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:04,040
with ideas who want to do stuff let's

351
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:07,579
figure out how to help them do that

352
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:09,469
securely the final is what I'm going to

353
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:11,540
say is our softest interview question

354
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:13,040
and this is probably again it's more

355
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:14,630
fraught with bias and we don't have a

356
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:17,360
good solution for how to reduce bias

357
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:19,220
here what we're looking to see is how

358
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:21,769
well can this person work with an engine

359
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:23,389
on a different team right again like

360
00:13:21,769 --> 00:13:24,860
as an absolute personal project person

361
00:13:23,389 --> 00:13:26,089
you're gonna be embedded with or working

362
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:27,350
with all these different developer

363
00:13:26,089 --> 00:13:30,709
developer teams that are doing different

364
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:32,929
things how well do can you handle the

365
00:13:30,709 --> 00:13:34,849
conflict that arises when a dev team is

366
00:13:32,929 --> 00:13:37,540
pushing to ship features and you're

367
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:40,790
pushing to make features more secure

368
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:42,980
this is you know but can you handle the

369
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:44,238
socio-political aspects of the job right

370
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:46,749
can you have those tough conversations

371
00:13:44,239 --> 00:13:49,999
but you know relevant but to your work

372
00:13:46,749 --> 00:13:51,559
again we see very mixed kind of results

373
00:13:49,999 --> 00:13:53,899
here and a lot of this unfortunately is

374
00:13:51,559 --> 00:13:55,429
due to interviewer training and kind of

375
00:13:53,899 --> 00:13:57,739
interviewer experience if you're not

376
00:13:55,429 --> 00:14:00,170
good at giving behavioral questions and

377
00:13:57,739 --> 00:14:05,389
doing behavioral interviews this this

378
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:08,259
section is really hard to run well so a

379
00:14:05,389 --> 00:14:11,269
quick summary as to where we are so far

380
00:14:08,259 --> 00:14:13,759
it's about an hour on the phone just to

381
00:14:11,269 --> 00:14:15,739
are you interested do you get the job

382
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:18,199
are there questions we can answer about

383
00:14:15,739 --> 00:14:20,480
the job it's three to four hours on a

384
00:14:18,199 --> 00:14:21,589
take-home again async it's this is how

385
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,869
you'll do most of your work right

386
00:14:21,589 --> 00:14:25,009
there's code that's sitting there stuff

387
00:14:23,869 --> 00:14:26,540
that needs to be built let's make sure

388
00:14:25,009 --> 00:14:29,329
that it's secure that you've done it and

389
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:30,529
you can present that information back by

390
00:14:29,329 --> 00:14:31,729
getting thirty minutes on our site to

391
00:14:30,529 --> 00:14:33,589
actually review it make sure you've done

392
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:35,389
it right then three to four hours in

393
00:14:33,589 --> 00:14:37,129
person covering all the stuff that

394
00:14:35,389 --> 00:14:39,019
actually has to do with you being a

395
00:14:37,129 --> 00:14:42,319
person doing a job that has other people

396
00:14:39,019 --> 00:14:44,089
on the other side with that said there's

397
00:14:42,319 --> 00:14:45,618
a set of failure cases that I'm worried

398
00:14:44,089 --> 00:14:47,980
about and I've brought it over and over

399
00:14:45,619 --> 00:14:51,019
again and the biggest one here its bias

400
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:53,779
right what is bias cause what does it do

401
00:14:51,019 --> 00:14:55,369
it's you exclude good candidates you

402
00:14:53,779 --> 00:14:57,399
also fail good candidates in your

403
00:14:55,369 --> 00:14:59,689
pipeline when you shouldn't have done so

404
00:14:57,399 --> 00:15:01,490
how do we introduce it you've been

405
00:14:59,689 --> 00:15:02,719
accidentally into the cycle it's the

406
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:05,059
activities that you choose and how you

407
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:07,100
choose to grade against them so even in

408
00:15:05,059 --> 00:15:09,169
our case like we've acknowledged that by

409
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:11,689
asking candidates to do take-homes

410
00:15:09,169 --> 00:15:13,189
we're cutting out a whole swath of

411
00:15:11,689 --> 00:15:16,129
candidates that otherwise would apply

412
00:15:13,189 --> 00:15:18,349
that hurts us but we don't have a good

413
00:15:16,129 --> 00:15:20,480
way of replicating some of this we have

414
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:23,779
ideas around reducing this requirement

415
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:26,360
for people who come in as as referrals

416
00:15:23,779 --> 00:15:27,649
or we've worked with before but again

417
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,939
that's like going to be the exceptional

418
00:15:27,649 --> 00:15:32,360
case it's not going to be the generic

419
00:15:28,939 --> 00:15:33,829
case we also lose candidates to

420
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,410
interviewers who don't know how to

421
00:15:33,829 --> 00:15:36,388
interview

422
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:37,860
their parts right if you don't know how

423
00:15:36,389 --> 00:15:39,120
to run this behavioral if you're doing

424
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:41,040
this pair programming and you're not

425
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,870
looking for just base level code

426
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:45,089
competency you're actually asking for

427
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:46,199
much more esoteric or harder problems

428
00:15:45,089 --> 00:15:47,670
like we're gonna loose candidates

429
00:15:46,199 --> 00:15:51,389
because our interviewers are doing poor

430
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:53,430
jobs but there are paths to success here

431
00:15:51,389 --> 00:15:55,949
right these are fixable or mitigate able

432
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:58,170
for the most part again we can have more

433
00:15:55,949 --> 00:16:00,839
paths to success for where we want more

434
00:15:58,170 --> 00:16:02,399
data you know can you do the core job we

435
00:16:00,839 --> 00:16:04,019
want more activities people can choose

436
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:05,579
from like there's gonna be people who

437
00:16:04,019 --> 00:16:08,519
can't do the take home what's the next

438
00:16:05,579 --> 00:16:10,199
best thing we can offer again those

439
00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:12,540
grading rubrics that we've set up and

440
00:16:10,199 --> 00:16:13,979
having very kind of formalized here's

441
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:15,569
the definition of the interview is all

442
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:17,819
about reducing some of that bias as well

443
00:16:15,569 --> 00:16:19,769
and finally it's you sometimes have to

444
00:16:17,819 --> 00:16:21,540
rotate your interviewers right if you

445
00:16:19,769 --> 00:16:23,310
have the same people talking over and

446
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:25,290
over again and they are asking and

447
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:27,750
falling into the same traps right you're

448
00:16:25,290 --> 00:16:29,879
gonna have to a be there to know that

449
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:31,980
they're making these mistakes and be

450
00:16:29,879 --> 00:16:39,240
actually rotate people in and out so you

451
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:41,100
get fresh sets of eyes so there's a core

452
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:43,800
principle going all the way back to the

453
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:46,130
beginning is your program who you hire

454
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:48,899
why you hire it's all down to the people

455
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:50,310
at the end of the day as much as you

456
00:16:48,899 --> 00:16:52,980
know companies like to abstract out

457
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:55,219
people using like metrics and goals and

458
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:57,089
mission and so forth like levels

459
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:59,610
nothing's gonna make as much of an

460
00:16:57,089 --> 00:17:02,160
impact as who you hire and we're gonna

461
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:05,549
break down who you hire into two key

462
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:07,020
pieces what is your problem and how are

463
00:17:05,549 --> 00:17:09,900
you gonna get the right people to solve

464
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:11,400
that problem we made the summation here

465
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:13,470
very quickly in terms of what coin

466
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:17,309
business problem is we have lots of

467
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:19,020
crypto crypto we lose irrevocably we

468
00:17:17,309 --> 00:17:20,639
need to make sure like code doesn't get

469
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:22,619
out that lets us lose crypto very

470
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:25,230
quickly same with user data same with

471
00:17:22,619 --> 00:17:27,569
user trust with that we needed people

472
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:29,909
who could work with dev teams early work

473
00:17:27,569 --> 00:17:31,918
with code before it was deployed and be

474
00:17:29,909 --> 00:17:33,750
able to you know add to our build

475
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:36,510
pipelines and fix pipelines to make sure

476
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:39,840
that again bad code wasn't getting

477
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:41,760
shipped but again it's these people that

478
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:43,830
we like aim to hire and like that we

479
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:45,179
have hired their knowledge their skills

480
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:47,178
and their hard work that actually makes

481
00:17:45,179 --> 00:17:52,140
things happen

482
00:17:47,179 --> 00:17:54,419
so quick quick outro here it's if you

483
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:55,830
agree with me if you disagree with me if

484
00:17:54,419 --> 00:17:57,750
you want to hit me up if you have any

485
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:59,399
questions about kind of why we chose our

486
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:00,870
pipeline if you're working on your own

487
00:17:59,399 --> 00:18:02,129
pipeline and you want feedback in terms

488
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:03,809
of how to make it better or how to

489
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:06,120
change the problems that we may have

490
00:18:03,809 --> 00:18:08,760
seen hit me up on my email I don't

491
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:32,580
really use social media I don't like it

492
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:34,590
it's very biased again thank you yes

493
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:36,629
the way we modulate some of this and I

494
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:38,699
it's a gloss over it for this interview

495
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:39,000
is you take the different aspects of the

496
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:41,279
job

497
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,929
and you determine kind of how important

498
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:44,460
there are and how difficult they are so

499
00:18:42,929 --> 00:18:45,990
when we first did some the problem

500
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:48,870
discovery here at coinbase we were like

501
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:51,330
hey this this is a rails codebase that's

502
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:53,520
been around since 2011 we really need

503
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:56,370
like competent rails devs that needs

504
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:58,440
that requires more seniority as that

505
00:18:56,370 --> 00:19:00,418
kind of starts to go down in terms of

506
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:02,340
we've fixed it up or we have fewer bugs

507
00:19:00,419 --> 00:19:04,770
that we see coming in we can modulate

508
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:07,529
kind of how good a candidate needs to be

509
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:09,330
in that particular category of work one

510
00:19:07,529 --> 00:19:11,070
thing that we haven't found a solution

511
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:14,789
for was that cross team collaboration

512
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:16,980
bit at that point like even our

513
00:19:14,789 --> 00:19:19,529
definition of like level 1 entry level

514
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:22,350
has way higher cross team collaboration

515
00:19:19,529 --> 00:19:24,600
kind of socio and empathetic

516
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:26,959
requirements than any other team on the

517
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,959
company

518
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:43,729
application products security is seven

519
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:45,439
plus a couple contractors how many

520
00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:48,320
candidates do you reject at that third

521
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:49,820
stage which is the which is the bucket

522
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:52,610
of the three that typically rejects them

523
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:54,010
yeah I'll answer the second question

524
00:19:52,610 --> 00:19:56,510
first

525
00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:58,100
most drop-off we see is people going

526
00:19:56,510 --> 00:20:00,860
from phone call to not doing the take

527
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:05,899
home the next drop up is after the take

528
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:10,490
home rejections after the in-person

529
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:11,840
interview is probably 10% to 20% we see

530
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:14,260
enough drop-off in the earlier pieces

531
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:17,030
that most people who make it that far

532
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:18,290
and they're there generally have been

533
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:23,050
reasonable people because they've had

534
00:20:18,290 --> 00:20:23,050
jobs in the past will pass at that point

535
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:37,000
and how bad is that

536
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:44,178
yeah so what we found was it wasn't

537
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:45,799
necessarily bad as the like written Job

538
00:20:44,179 --> 00:20:49,669
Description and people self-selecting

539
00:20:45,799 --> 00:20:51,080
wasn't nearly as good and so by making

540
00:20:49,669 --> 00:20:52,520
the take home we actually ended up

541
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:54,439
making our job description better which

542
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:56,030
then reduced the need for our a take

543
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:57,230
home it also kind of trained our

544
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:58,730
recruiters in terms of what we're

545
00:20:57,230 --> 00:21:00,620
looking for which also reduced the need

546
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:02,750
of take home so it's kind of like we

547
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:04,340
made ourselves do this work and then we

548
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:07,179
had it in place then we started using it

549
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:07,178
but we didn't need it as much

550
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:24,030
boy

551
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:25,679
yeah that happen as well like your

552
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:27,330
interviewers will make mistakes at some

553
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:28,620
point they will just ask technical

554
00:21:27,330 --> 00:21:31,379
questions when really they want to know

555
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:41,129
how well are you interacting here we

556
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:43,230
can't get away from that do you find

557
00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:45,690
more success with people in security you

558
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:49,309
are a generalist or specialist like for

559
00:21:45,690 --> 00:21:55,980
example like five different languages

560
00:21:49,309 --> 00:21:58,230
decently or like I'm gonna say it really

561
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:59,820
depends on the problem scope part of

562
00:21:58,230 --> 00:22:01,230
what we defined here is we wanted people

563
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:02,850
who could work at the level or

564
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:05,070
developers are working and with them

565
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:07,860
that implied we needed somebody who's

566
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:10,918
really good at Rails in particular right

567
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:12,209
we D prioritize their need for kind of

568
00:22:10,919 --> 00:22:13,590
threat modeling an architecture review

569
00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:15,390
that only comes way later in the

570
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:17,879
lifecycle and the whole reason we did

571
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:20,340
that is because this is like a roughly a

572
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:22,740
relatively baked application it's big

573
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:24,659
it's there's lots of pieces to it but

574
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:26,970
it's not changing architectural II a lot

575
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:28,320
so we didn't need somebody who had seen

576
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:29,730
a lot of problems or seen a lot of

577
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:33,030
things they just really knew rails

578
00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:34,530
pretty well I'm being asked to do this

579
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:40,620
all right

580
00:22:34,530 --> 00:22:42,690
let's shout after I want to take we tell

581
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:46,280
them they they should aim for three to

582
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:46,280
four hours but we don't actually time it

583
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:52,429
alright thank you
