1
00:00:04,009 --> 00:00:10,800
all right next up we have Tom's Samstag

2
00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:22,789
talking about the info con DB please

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:26,070
welcome Tom hi whatever welcome I'm

4
00:00:22,789 --> 00:00:27,630
happy to announce something that I hope

5
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:33,120
will be a good resource for the

6
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:36,000
community info con DB so first off I

7
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:39,140
have a quick disclaimer I'm gonna talk a

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,519
little bit about stats of presentations

9
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:44,190
how many presentations different people

10
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,570
have everything is as of the current

11
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:48,780
state of the database which is not

12
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:51,120
complete if if the database does not

13
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:54,030
represent your years of presentation

14
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:56,610
history don't be offended

15
00:00:54,030 --> 00:01:00,270
nothing was omitted intentionally things

16
00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:02,760
just haven't been cataloged yet

17
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:06,390
everything's far from complete so with

18
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:09,509
that said Who am I my name is Tom

19
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:13,439
Samstag I go by technical Tom or tech on

20
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:18,090
IRC I am a principal security engineer

21
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:20,279
at security innovation we are a security

22
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:23,159
firm specializing in application

23
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:25,049
security always looking for good

24
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:27,659
engineers especially in the Seattle area

25
00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:31,220
so if you understand how software works

26
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:33,990
and know how to break it check us out

27
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:36,289
also check out can you hack got us it's

28
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:38,789
a kollel challenge site that we have for

29
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:41,430
recruiting but it should be fun even if

30
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:42,509
you're not interested in a job fun

31
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:47,220
little CTF type thing

32
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:53,070
I also hang out with the Nick 9 crew I

33
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:55,850
am part of the core Meg 9 staff we are a

34
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:59,100
hacker group that is now primarily

35
00:01:55,850 --> 00:02:01,798
located in Seattle we've been doing CTF

36
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:03,750
s-- for a long time and we apparently

37
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:05,070
accidentally won hacker jeopardy last

38
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:07,140
night still trying to figure out how

39
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:10,560
that happened

40
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:12,900
so yeah normally I'd end my a belt me

41
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,599
there but we need a little bit more

42
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:18,900
background here

43
00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:22,470
so I like cons I like hacker cons I like

44
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:24,930
attending hacker cons this is my current

45
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:28,230
badge collection it's not as extensive

46
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:29,880
as I'm sure many of yours are but I'm at

47
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:32,369
the point where I'm afraid to try new

48
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:34,500
conferences because I know if I do it'll

49
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:39,830
be added to my must attend every year

50
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:42,060
list I just really like attending cons

51
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:44,040
where my friends are the ones that get

52
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:46,400
back from DEFCON talking about how

53
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:50,310
they're never going to go to Vegas again

54
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:51,930
I am the one who's already planning next

55
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:55,620
year and and how to make next year even

56
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:58,380
better I also enjoy watching videos of

57
00:02:55,620 --> 00:03:00,480
conference presentations if you also

58
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:05,040
enjoy watching presentations from

59
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:08,819
conferences I hope you you know of the

60
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:11,429
site info con org this is an amazing

61
00:03:08,819 --> 00:03:13,950
resource it's built out of the dark

62
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:16,830
tangents project the data duplication

63
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:19,339
village that originally was hosted at

64
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:21,870
Def Con and people came to him and said

65
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:24,630
we want access to this outside of Def

66
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:26,850
Con so this is the internet facing

67
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:29,730
version of the data duplication village

68
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:31,620
where he has terabytes of media from

69
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:35,910
conferences going back through the

70
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:38,790
hacker history so it's a great resource

71
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:44,459
but once you start using it you realize

72
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:50,399
it's really just a directory structure

73
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:53,850
of files it's it's just like browsing a

74
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:57,000
an open directory structure so at the

75
00:03:53,850 --> 00:04:00,358
same time that I am getting really into

76
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:03,750
watching stuff on in folk on Io watch a

77
00:04:00,359 --> 00:04:07,319
lot of TV and I'm at home watching TV

78
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:10,709
with my Kodi Media Center and I love how

79
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:13,108
it talks to the TV DB and it displays

80
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:14,730
all kinds of meat metadata about that

81
00:04:13,109 --> 00:04:18,389
the shows that I'm going to watch it

82
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:23,310
shows synopsis and actors and actor BIOS

83
00:04:18,389 --> 00:04:26,700
and all that and so those combined both

84
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:27,450
infocon and the way that Kodi displays

85
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:29,400
that

86
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:35,159
that metadata that's kind of what

87
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:38,280
inspired me to start infocon DB org so

88
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:40,680
infocon DB org i've been selling it as

89
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:43,429
IMDB for hacker cons as of yesterday

90
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:46,860
morning it's live publicly available

91
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:49,620
info con DB org that's a snapshot of the

92
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:53,640
front page as of when I made these

93
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:54,900
slides yesterday so I'm probably losing

94
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:56,490
some of you right now because you're

95
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:58,799
just gonna start browsing it and I'm

96
00:04:56,490 --> 00:05:00,960
fine with that but we want to talk a

97
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:03,750
little bit about what went into making

98
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:09,150
it thus far because this is an ongoing

99
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:11,370
project so while making this this site

100
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:14,429
and this database and this huge amount

101
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:16,980
of data and curating it I realized that

102
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:20,010
a lot of my time was kind of split among

103
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:21,870
four different goals and for these four

104
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:24,090
different goals are all vying for my

105
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:27,480
time they're all competing with each

106
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:29,340
other and only by balancing the four of

107
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:32,760
them am I able to make this site really

108
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:35,940
what I want the four goals are the

109
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:38,010
platform that's the technology behind

110
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:41,190
the website itself making it a good UI

111
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:43,070
making it usable and then also that the

112
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:46,070
admin

113
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:49,050
the site and manage all the other goals

114
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:51,870
appropriately there's coverage getting

115
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:54,230
as many cons as possible so getting the

116
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:56,310
data from every con that's happened

117
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:59,520
turns out there's been a few conferences

118
00:05:56,310 --> 00:06:01,440
in the past couple years the third goal

119
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:03,960
is complete make sure the data is

120
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:05,670
complete make sure that every conference

121
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:08,159
that I have indexed and every

122
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:10,170
presentation at every conference has as

123
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:13,800
many of the data fields populated as

124
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:16,170
possible and the fourth goal is to make

125
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:18,360
it accurate make sure that everything

126
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:19,710
that I am displaying is as accurate and

127
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:22,440
true to what actually happened as

128
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:25,109
possible so going through those goals

129
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:27,870
the platform this is actually the

130
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:29,430
easiest of them right on the a belt page

131
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:31,410
I give a little bit of a description

132
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:34,560
about what technology goes into it it's

133
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:36,990
a simple Gengo web app powered by

134
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:40,320
Postgres on docker hosted by

135
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:41,100
digitalocean the technology behind it is

136
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:44,310
we

137
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:48,330
le straightforward moving on though to

138
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:50,040
coverage so this is again trying to

139
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:51,570
bring in the data from as many

140
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:57,470
conferences as possible

141
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:59,790
all over the conference's eventually so

142
00:06:57,470 --> 00:07:01,260
there's several options depending on how

143
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:03,540
the conference has their data the best

144
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:07,560
option is if the conference has their

145
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:10,020
data in structured data so if the web if

146
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:13,230
the the website of the conference used

147
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:16,440
frapp similar to how to work on this

148
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:19,410
year did and tour camp before it and

149
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:21,270
then another third party option that

150
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:23,940
some conferences have used is called

151
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:27,120
sched and these these options are great

152
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:30,860
because i can just download the the json

153
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:33,210
files ingest it all a matter of seconds

154
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:35,400
unfortunately they're not the most

155
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:39,479
common option that i've been able to do

156
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:41,549
the most common option is web scraping i

157
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:43,860
have to preface this with a little bit

158
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:46,320
of a trigger warning here you may be

159
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:49,830
offended by the next the next point here

160
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:52,980
I am doing web scraping with regular

161
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:54,479
expressions I know that may upset some

162
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:56,970
of you and you'll say why not use

163
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:59,730
something like beautifulsoup and in all

164
00:07:56,970 --> 00:08:01,710
honesty I tried to go that route I'm

165
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:05,430
looking at web pages for conferences

166
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:07,250
that were done in the 90s or earlier all

167
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:10,400
of these things are so horribly

168
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:12,680
inconsistent even within the page that

169
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:15,419
trying to do any kind of a scraping

170
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:18,600
taking into account the HTML markup

171
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:21,240
doomed to fail so actually most of the

172
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:23,070
data in infocon DB right now was scraped

173
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:28,050
with regular expressions off of web

174
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:30,210
pages sorry if that upsets you so then

175
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:32,219
the next problem that we run into is

176
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:35,848
there are plenty of conferences that

177
00:08:32,219 --> 00:08:37,680
don't have archives Def Con is amazing

178
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:41,640
because you can go and you can view the

179
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:43,140
website for DEFCON one well I don't know

180
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:45,600
if DEFCON one had a website but you can

181
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:47,699
go back to DEFCON two three and see the

182
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:50,940
webpage as it existed as they published

183
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:53,520
it then not all conferences have that a

184
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:54,779
lot of them are say a wordpress website

185
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:56,399
where

186
00:08:54,779 --> 00:08:58,620
schedule is the schedule for the year

187
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:02,360
and then after that conference they

188
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:06,600
change schedule and that content is lost

189
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:08,970
a lot of times I've been relying on the

190
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:10,949
Internet Archive but that's still hoping

191
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:13,110
that the Internet Archive spidered that

192
00:09:10,949 --> 00:09:15,839
site at the right time of the year to

193
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:17,639
get that content and in lots of cases

194
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:19,680
that hasn't been the case some of this

195
00:09:17,639 --> 00:09:24,839
content just isn't available on the

196
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:29,309
website anymore and that leads to the

197
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:32,189
third or the next potential I actually

198
00:09:29,309 --> 00:09:35,969
have to credit my wife for this one Def

199
00:09:32,189 --> 00:09:37,920
Con I'm sorry torque on 13 the Internet

200
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:40,110
Archive failed to get any program just

201
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:42,029
any descriptions of any of the talks my

202
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:45,149
wife actually volunteered to manually

203
00:09:42,029 --> 00:09:47,309
transcribe the paper program and that's

204
00:09:45,149 --> 00:09:49,740
how all the descriptions for torque on

205
00:09:47,309 --> 00:09:52,769
13 are in here and that might be an

206
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:54,329
ongoing thread depending on what what

207
00:09:52,769 --> 00:09:59,250
the conference organizers are able to

208
00:09:54,329 --> 00:10:02,609
scrape up from their archives and then

209
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:06,059
in the future especially in the coming

210
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:07,319
months and year hopefully I'll be

211
00:10:06,059 --> 00:10:09,120
reaching out to more conference

212
00:10:07,319 --> 00:10:11,519
organizers and seeing what they have

213
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:14,370
with what they have digital archives of

214
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:17,399
their past stuff maybe working out a way

215
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:19,110
that I can get any structured data that

216
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:21,750
they have I don't care what format it is

217
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:23,579
I can make it work anything is better

218
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:29,250
than writing rag acts to scrape webpages

219
00:10:23,579 --> 00:10:31,620
or typing programs so that's the second

220
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:35,339
goal the third one is complete this is

221
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:40,709
making sure that every data point that

222
00:10:35,339 --> 00:10:43,170
can have a value does so when you're

223
00:10:40,709 --> 00:10:44,399
scraping all this data in mass a lot of

224
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:46,800
things can fall through the cracks

225
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:51,420
I've got back-end scripts that find

226
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:53,399
missing data so one example of that is

227
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:55,139
at the bottom of the front page there's

228
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:58,259
this box saying hey do you want to help

229
00:10:55,139 --> 00:11:00,749
does gurke on 2017 have a conference

230
00:10:58,259 --> 00:11:02,699
YouTube playlist URL and what that is is

231
00:11:00,749 --> 00:11:04,709
every time the main page is loaded it

232
00:11:02,699 --> 00:11:06,329
randomly finds a data point for a

233
00:11:04,709 --> 00:11:08,670
conference that it doesn't have a value

234
00:11:06,329 --> 00:11:12,060
for and asks the user hey

235
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:14,750
can you help me here so that's just the

236
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:17,849
very first example of user interaction

237
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:21,540
hopefully in the future that will expand

238
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:24,030
to to elicit more help from users but in

239
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:25,770
addition to that for completeness I have

240
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:29,550
scripts in the backend that help find

241
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:31,290
scheduled holes so I know when every

242
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:33,630
presentation was I know what room it's

243
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:36,329
in find the holes for me maybe that that

244
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:38,100
presentation just didn't get didn't get

245
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:41,820
scraped properly

246
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:46,020
I have automated scripts for YouTube

247
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:49,680
playlist and info con org matching of

248
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:51,930
videos to presentations so I pointed at

249
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:56,430
a YouTube playlist for a conference and

250
00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:57,989
it uses YouTube DL which most of us use

251
00:11:56,430 --> 00:12:00,089
just for downloading things from YouTube

252
00:11:57,990 --> 00:12:03,060
but it's also handy for getting the

253
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:05,160
metadata from a playlist and an awesome

254
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:09,000
Python library called fuzzy-wuzzy from a

255
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:10,230
geek for fuzzy string matching and it

256
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,110
goes through and figures out which

257
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:16,400
presentations match which videos and

258
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:19,680
does all that automated lis I'm also a

259
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:22,610
automatic automated Li extracting

260
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:25,979
Twitter handles from people one of the

261
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:27,570
safeguards for that is going through and

262
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:29,280
extracting anything that looks like a

263
00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:31,740
Twitter handle but then making sure it's

264
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:34,740
not only unique for that user for that

265
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:36,210
presenter but also pinging Twitter to

266
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:39,870
make sure it's a valid Twitter handle

267
00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:43,410
that kind of stuff so all those speak to

268
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:45,600
completeness but then just filling in a

269
00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:48,170
value for every piece of data doesn't

270
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:51,510
help if we don't also stress accuracy

271
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:54,000
there's several ways to focus on

272
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:55,800
accuracy one thing you'll notice as you

273
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,290
browse the site is for each presenter I

274
00:12:55,800 --> 00:13:01,469
store two fields one for a name and one

275
00:12:58,290 --> 00:13:04,439
for handle an interesting side effect of

276
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:07,410
our community name doesn't have to be a

277
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:09,930
legal name but it's a value that's more

278
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:13,020
used like your name and a handle is more

279
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:15,660
used like your handle my classic example

280
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:18,360
of this is chess hire catalyst is his

281
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:20,160
handle and when asked what his name is

282
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:21,980
he says Richard chesh hire now that's

283
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:23,810
not his legal name and he's

284
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:26,840
upfront about that but that's his name

285
00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:29,270
to the hacker community so there are

286
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:31,280
scripts right now that look at names and

287
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:34,069
try to extract which part is a name

288
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:36,439
versus a handle in all of the many ways

289
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:38,360
that have that hacker cons have credited

290
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:42,340
people whether it be name and then

291
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:45,650
parentheses handle or name slash name -

292
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:48,160
aks every every way that you can imagine

293
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:51,140
it's been done by some conference

294
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:55,040
there's also a lot of work in presenter

295
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:58,430
deduping so every way that a presenters

296
00:13:55,040 --> 00:14:01,760
name can be mangled or presented has

297
00:13:58,430 --> 00:14:05,329
been done my best example of this is

298
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:08,000
Marsha Hoffman from the e FF does a lot

299
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:11,150
of work in the hacker community and this

300
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:15,500
is her list of credits on the page as of

301
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:17,930
yesterday and we see we have almost

302
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:20,540
every variation of number of F's and

303
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:25,579
number of ends in her name even as

304
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:29,599
recent as 2014 so finding these these

305
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:31,750
duplication of data and the error the

306
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:36,920
slight errors that are introduced and

307
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:38,450
coalescing those people future user

308
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:40,430
interaction is going to be a big part of

309
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:43,100
this planned feature for the the

310
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:45,650
hopefully near future is going to be a

311
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:49,220
way of allowing people who are browsing

312
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:51,860
the site to flag inaccurate data I don't

313
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:53,570
think it's going to be a wikipedia model

314
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:55,970
any time soon where anybody can edit

315
00:14:53,570 --> 00:14:57,590
anything but allowing users to say hey

316
00:14:55,970 --> 00:15:00,200
this doesn't look right or this is

317
00:14:57,590 --> 00:15:03,140
obviously a scraping error this person's

318
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:04,760
name shouldn't have HTML in it that's

319
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:06,770
going to be the next step of allowing

320
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:09,590
the users to help make this a better

321
00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:11,870
site so those were the four kind of

322
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:15,730
goals that I was you that I was using to

323
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:17,960
steer my development in this the other

324
00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:20,690
the other interesting thing that I

325
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:22,040
wanted to throw out here and why this is

326
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:24,470
worth me being on stage and not just

327
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:29,650
saying go check out this website there's

328
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:32,360
a couple interesting findings so I

329
00:15:29,650 --> 00:15:34,579
announced on Twitter a few days ago that

330
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:36,429
if anybody was able to guess the most

331
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:39,319
prolific

332
00:15:36,429 --> 00:15:42,709
the the presenter who has had the most

333
00:15:39,319 --> 00:15:44,089
credits to their name I give a free

334
00:15:42,709 --> 00:15:46,569
bottle of booze to whoever could guess

335
00:15:44,089 --> 00:15:49,009
first and surprisingly nobody yet

336
00:15:46,569 --> 00:15:50,509
kind of surprisingly nobody guessed I

337
00:15:49,009 --> 00:15:52,069
kind of put it out there because I

338
00:15:50,509 --> 00:15:53,389
thought it would be difficult for

339
00:15:52,069 --> 00:15:55,488
anybody to guess because you all

340
00:15:53,389 --> 00:15:58,100
everybody thinks of that the presenters

341
00:15:55,489 --> 00:15:59,660
that they see that they remember that

342
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:01,970
are that are active in the hacker

343
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:04,459
community but they forget some people so

344
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:06,170
this is currently the top most prolific

345
00:16:04,459 --> 00:16:10,939
presenters and you see it's actually

346
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:13,610
Kurt Opsahl from the e FF who does at

347
00:16:10,939 --> 00:16:16,129
least one ask the e FF panel every Def

348
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:19,069
Con and sometimes two or three more

349
00:16:16,129 --> 00:16:22,249
presentations every year nobody gets

350
00:16:19,069 --> 00:16:24,979
them but then we see a lot of the common

351
00:16:22,249 --> 00:16:26,689
names that we'd expect now this is one

352
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:29,720
of those things that again this is as of

353
00:16:26,689 --> 00:16:31,309
the the data that I have this is going

354
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:34,759
to change over time and it's displayed

355
00:16:31,309 --> 00:16:38,480
dynamically on the front page another

356
00:16:34,759 --> 00:16:40,970
interesting piece of tidbit trivia the

357
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:43,189
20-plus year Club so I looked at

358
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:44,869
everybody who was in the database who

359
00:16:43,189 --> 00:16:47,599
had more than one presentation and

360
00:16:44,869 --> 00:16:49,489
sorted them by the duration between

361
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:52,100
their first presentation and their last

362
00:16:49,489 --> 00:16:54,379
presentation and we actually have people

363
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:56,629
who are still presenting today who have

364
00:16:54,379 --> 00:16:58,489
been at this for well over 20 years and

365
00:16:56,629 --> 00:17:01,519
I thought I'd just share that list with

366
00:16:58,489 --> 00:17:04,159
you here of course Jeff Moss dark

367
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:06,799
tangent he's been a he's been doing this

368
00:17:04,159 --> 00:17:08,600
for a little while Manuel Goldstein so

369
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:10,359
we start to see a lot of the the people

370
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:13,099
who are actually been active in

371
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:15,109
conference organization at the top Matt

372
00:17:13,099 --> 00:17:18,918
Blais another name that you should all

373
00:17:15,109 --> 00:17:21,349
recognize and then let's see kingpin

374
00:17:18,919 --> 00:17:23,389
Mudge weld pawn space rogue they just

375
00:17:21,349 --> 00:17:27,230
did a panel at DEFCON so we see a lot of

376
00:17:23,388 --> 00:17:29,000
that but so the these was it 12 people

377
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:32,179
have all been at in this active in this

378
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:34,720
community for over 20 years this is

379
00:17:32,179 --> 00:17:37,370
information that you that you can't

380
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:39,380
really get a good grasp of until you

381
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:42,139
start amassing this amount of data and

382
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:48,289
actually being able to pull interesting

383
00:17:42,139 --> 00:17:49,350
statistics out of it so what's next for

384
00:17:48,289 --> 00:17:51,450
info con dB

385
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:54,299
so I'm releasing it today I just made it

386
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:57,419
act I've made it publicly accessible as

387
00:17:54,299 --> 00:17:59,610
of yesterday it's been in active

388
00:17:57,419 --> 00:18:01,160
development for about a year now so

389
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:04,139
what's next

390
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:06,240
so first obviously making sure that it

391
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:08,160
can actually survive all of you hitting

392
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:10,770
it I've been the only one using the site

393
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:12,600
for a while so making sure that you guys

394
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:16,370
don't bring it down will be a good first

395
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:19,918
step so far it seems like it's working

396
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:24,178
one early piece of feedback I had given

397
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:28,880
to me was not just reinforcing the

398
00:18:24,179 --> 00:18:31,770
presenters that are very active not just

399
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:34,710
reinforcing the Rockstar mentality but

400
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:36,750
also be more inviting so one of the next

401
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:38,549
new features is going to be a page

402
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:40,100
highlighting new presenters people are

403
00:18:38,549 --> 00:18:43,799
presenting for the first time this year

404
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:45,570
as a because I mean it doesn't matter if

405
00:18:43,799 --> 00:18:51,299
you're Dan Kaminsky is presenting you

406
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:53,490
know while not fully cognizant or you

407
00:18:51,299 --> 00:18:55,440
know doing your 20th presentation or

408
00:18:53,490 --> 00:18:57,780
you're up here for the very first time

409
00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:01,950
it takes a lot of guts to get up here

410
00:18:57,780 --> 00:19:04,678
and we need to encourage people to share

411
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:06,919
their their wealth of knowledge and and

412
00:19:04,679 --> 00:19:09,059
and be active in this community so

413
00:19:06,919 --> 00:19:11,179
highlighting people who are up here for

414
00:19:09,059 --> 00:19:13,379
the first time

415
00:19:11,179 --> 00:19:15,390
advanced random presentation so those

416
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:18,090
there's a page link on the front page

417
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:20,130
for a random presentation and so one of

418
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:23,449
the upcoming features will be an

419
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:26,159
advanced version of that for instance

420
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:28,320
watching a video at on your lunch break

421
00:19:26,159 --> 00:19:31,200
so you asking this I give me a random

422
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:32,780
presentation with a youtube link done in

423
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:36,419
the past five years

424
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:40,260
under 30 minutes and maybe about this

425
00:19:36,419 --> 00:19:42,120
subject matter tagging is another

426
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:43,919
feature that's going to be a lot of work

427
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:46,590
the beginnings of it are already there

428
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:48,840
you'll see it on some pages but it's not

429
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:51,149
exposed very well yet and it's not the

430
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:54,379
data is not populated yet but being able

431
00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:56,669
to tag subject matter so that we can see

432
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:59,330
so you can actually do a deep dive into

433
00:19:56,669 --> 00:20:01,799
it in this something that interests you

434
00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:03,000
user data error flagging that's kind of

435
00:20:01,799 --> 00:20:05,070
what I was talking about earlier

436
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:08,880
allowing users to help curate this data

437
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:13,560
make it make it accurate and help this

438
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:15,510
to continue to be a good resource API

439
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:18,899
access is something that's high on my

440
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:20,550
list it's kind of speaks to why I did

441
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:23,130
this in the first place

442
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:24,810
but allowing people to access this for

443
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:27,750
whatever cool projects that they have

444
00:20:24,810 --> 00:20:30,240
ideas for I've already seen since I made

445
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:32,670
this public somebody scraping or in

446
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:35,010
crawling the page that isn't a search

447
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:36,780
engine that I recognize so somebody

448
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:39,410
obviously wants to get all this data

449
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:43,379
might as well make it easy for them and

450
00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:46,290
some other ideas about ranking popular

451
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:53,250
presentation some way to allow people to

452
00:20:46,290 --> 00:20:54,840
see that must-see presentation so that's

453
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:56,810
all I've got for you in this

454
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:59,070
presentation but unlike most

455
00:20:56,810 --> 00:21:01,710
presentations up here this isn't the end

456
00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:04,770
of the story for for this project this

457
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:08,100
is just the beginning so I'm releasing

458
00:21:04,770 --> 00:21:10,920
infocon DB org to all of you to the

459
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:13,080
community I want it to be a good

460
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:15,450
resource feel free to drop me any con

461
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:22,500

462
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:26,730
feedback any bugs I can be reached well

463

I can be reached if you go to info Conde

464
00:21:26,730 --> 00:21:31,830
DB go to the about page there's a

465
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:34,800
feedback forum with email and feel free

466
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:40,350
to check it out and get back to me thank

467
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:44,940
you any questions yes

468
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:50,689
it is powered by Postgres so yes a

469
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:50,690
sequel database any questions

470
00:21:54,950 --> 00:22:04,309
yes yeah this is a this is a a project

471
00:22:00,499 --> 00:22:06,499
of love that I've spent a year on I I

472
00:22:04,309 --> 00:22:09,678
don't foresee anybody wanting it I don't

473
00:22:06,499 --> 00:22:12,619
foresee me giving it to anybody much

474
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:15,109
much much to the annoyance probably of

475
00:22:12,619 --> 00:22:16,639
my wife for the amount of time I have

476
00:22:15,109 --> 00:22:18,859
spent on it and the time I will continue

477
00:22:16,639 --> 00:22:29,139
to spend on it but yes this is this is a

478
00:22:18,859 --> 00:22:32,779
project of the communities I think so I

479
00:22:29,139 --> 00:22:36,678
have been focusing mostly on data of

480
00:22:32,779 --> 00:22:39,739
cons that have already happened I don't

481
00:22:36,679 --> 00:22:43,340
want to be the these are the conferences

482
00:22:39,739 --> 00:22:46,070
this year webpage I have seen too many

483
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:49,129
of those come and go it's a hard task to

484
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:53,029
try to be that timely with data I'm

485
00:22:49,129 --> 00:22:55,658
looking more for the archive that said I

486
00:22:53,029 --> 00:22:58,100
did make sure to get this torque on in

487
00:22:55,659 --> 00:22:59,299
before this torque on started because

488
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:00,769
it'd be kind of silly to not be able to

489
00:22:59,299 --> 00:23:03,230
look up this con

490
00:23:00,769 --> 00:23:06,139
but yeah the focus is more on an archive

491
00:23:03,230 --> 00:23:08,389
of the past then make sure you go to

492
00:23:06,139 --> 00:23:12,340
these cons in the future I'm not rolling

493
00:23:08,389 --> 00:23:12,340
it out though yes

494
00:23:16,410 --> 00:23:23,020
yes the question was about open sourcing

495
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:25,000
it it's an idea

496
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:27,700
it's something I've thought of it's less

497
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:30,040
a focus because it's a service but I

498
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:32,020
haven't rolled it out it was more about

499
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:41,530
making it functional to this point at

500
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:43,360
this time in the back yeah that's a good

501
00:23:41,530 --> 00:23:45,100
question he asked what qualifies or

502
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:46,449
disqualifies a conference from making

503
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:49,179
the list

504
00:23:46,450 --> 00:23:51,040
I've largely been focused on the obvious

505
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:53,710
hacker cons and there are so many of

506
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:55,870
them that it's not like I am sitting

507
00:23:53,710 --> 00:24:00,420
around waiting for the next conference

508
00:23:55,870 --> 00:24:03,610
to happen I am at least as of now

509
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:08,940
focusing on security related conferences

510
00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:12,490
hopefully not or less of a focus on the

511
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:15,790
more busy side of things and focusing

512
00:24:12,490 --> 00:24:18,310
more on the hacker side of things that

513
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:21,580
may change in the future though right

514
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:25,060
now it's largely been ad hoc a lot of

515
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:26,470
its going to be who can I most easily

516
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:29,800
get the most bang for my buck in

517
00:24:26,470 --> 00:24:31,390
scraping just because there's 30 years

518
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:36,450
worth of hacker history to try to import

519
00:24:31,390 --> 00:24:36,450
here yes

520
00:24:42,049 --> 00:24:49,440
yeah so I tried to find similar similar

521
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:51,570
sites before starting this trust me I

522
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:53,789
did not want another project on my plate

523
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:56,850
I've got plenty of unfinished projects

524
00:24:53,789 --> 00:24:58,799
already I wasn't able to find any until

525
00:24:56,850 --> 00:25:02,840
a good way through development I found

526
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:06,480
another one it was not easy to find and

527
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:11,459
in my personal opinion I feel that maybe

528
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:14,700
they spent more effort on getting every

529
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:16,919
conference and less effort on the the

530
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:20,460
accuracy and the completeness side of

531
00:25:16,919 --> 00:25:24,570
things so for me it didn't quite meet my

532
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:27,809
priorities that said it it was the only

533
00:25:24,570 --> 00:25:31,080
instance I have found that was trying to

534
00:25:27,809 --> 00:25:33,899
do exactly this there are other sites

535
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:38,189
out there that try to do the database of

536
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:39,960
conferences mostly looking forward and

537
00:25:38,190 --> 00:25:40,650
they unfortunately don't seem to stick

538
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:43,860
around very long

539
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:45,929
I don't know if it's just the the amount

540
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:49,830
of effort to keep them timely that that

541
00:25:45,929 --> 00:25:51,179
kills them or not but I would be more

542
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:59,960
than welcome to talk to anybody who has

543
00:25:51,179 --> 00:25:59,960
other examples of similar things yes

544
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:05,790
and the way these rednecks would be

545
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:09,000
would be accessible to try and post

546
00:26:05,790 --> 00:26:12,139
every document specifying and how true

547
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,140
the Senate report

548
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:18,809
it might be a good idea of going forward

549
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:20,519
ideally hopefully in the future it will

550
00:26:18,809 --> 00:26:23,070
be less about scraping web pages and

551
00:26:20,519 --> 00:26:26,250
more about receiving structured data we

552
00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:29,850
seem to be more aware of that nowadays

553
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:33,000
than we were when you know when Def Con

554
00:26:29,850 --> 00:26:35,850
started then again like I have evidence

555
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:38,250
that Def Con is still hand editing their

556
00:26:35,850 --> 00:26:41,279
program or their their their website for

557
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:45,120
the scheduled spaces and inconsistencies

558
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:48,149
in the markup so it's it's going to be a

559
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:50,370
battle I think for some ultimately I

560
00:26:48,149 --> 00:26:55,010
want this to be a service that I provide

561
00:26:50,370 --> 00:26:57,959
on behalf of the the Presidency's so

562
00:26:55,010 --> 00:27:00,929
hopefully their incentive to incent

563
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:03,000
incentivize to work with me without

564
00:27:00,929 --> 00:27:04,440
impacting what all of the work that they

565
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:15,779
put into actually throwing the

566
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:17,549
conference yeah I will definitely be

567
00:27:15,779 --> 00:27:21,889
doing more of reaching out to the

568
00:27:17,549 --> 00:27:25,139
conference organizers going forward I

569
00:27:21,889 --> 00:27:27,779
see more people piling in getting ready

570
00:27:25,139 --> 00:27:29,760

571
00:27:27,779 --> 00:27:31,470
