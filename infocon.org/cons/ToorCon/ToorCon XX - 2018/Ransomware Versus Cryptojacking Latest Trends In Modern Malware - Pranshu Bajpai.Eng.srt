1
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:13,649
hello everyone I'm excited to introduce

2
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:17,340
pran Shu bajpai he'll be speaking about

3
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:19,470
ransomware vs. crypto jackin latest

4
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:28,020
trends in modern malware please give a

5
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:30,619
hearty round of applause welcome alright

6
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:33,269
let's get started

7
00:00:30,619 --> 00:00:34,170
welcome everybody thank you for being

8
00:00:33,269 --> 00:00:36,659
here

9
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:38,640
to con 20 this is my first time

10
00:00:36,659 --> 00:00:41,040
attending and speaking at torque on and

11
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,150
it happened to be to work on 20 so I'm

12
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,489
very excited about that

13
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:46,080
20 years of to con that's that's a

14
00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:48,120
that's a lot of hard works let's give

15
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:52,519
the organizers around applause right for

16
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:56,430
doing this for 20 years it's awesome

17
00:00:52,519 --> 00:00:58,260
alright so so the topic of discussion

18
00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:02,280
today is you know two of the biggest

19
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:04,530
malware threats in in 2018 ransomware

20
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:06,330
and crypto jackin we we have we've all

21
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:08,040
heard of them and we all know what

22
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:10,619
ransomware do we're very familiar with

23
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:12,719
it and now crypto jacking is rising so

24
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:14,310
these are the two biggest malware

25
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:17,820
threats and so we kind of want to look

26
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:19,189
at the details of how they operate what

27
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:21,779
they're looking for and what

28
00:01:19,189 --> 00:01:25,020
vulnerabilities lie in our systems that

29
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:27,719
they're exploiting so well keeping in in

30
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:29,729
in tune with the theme of torque on this

31
00:01:27,719 --> 00:01:32,820
year we'll look at the trends in terms

32
00:01:29,729 --> 00:01:34,530
of what is here to stay so good trends

33
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:36,270
that we've noticed in ransomware from a

34
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:38,039
ransomware developers perspective that

35
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:40,350
they'll continue because it gives them

36
00:01:38,039 --> 00:01:42,210
certain advantages so that's and then

37
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:45,089
we'll discuss crypto jacking its new

38
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:49,798
where can be expected to go and how can

39
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:52,619
we stop it alright so so the agenda for

40
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:55,020
the talk is we start with a little bit

41
00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:57,119
of fun introduction and we discussed

42
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:59,158
ransomware a little bit key management a

43
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:59,850
particular hybrid key management model

44
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:02,100
and ransomware

45
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:03,689
then we go ahead and look at certain

46
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:05,818
ransomware variants and what kind of

47
00:02:03,689 --> 00:02:07,258
specific characteristics make them

48
00:02:05,819 --> 00:02:09,449
different from a traditional ransomware

49
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:11,700
those characteristics made them trendy

50
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:13,980
and they continue because they're good

51
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:15,238
for ransomware developers and then from

52
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:16,530
that point on we'll move to crypto

53
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:18,010
jacking so the second half of the

54
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:19,659
presentation will be focused on

55
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:21,429
to jacking and this is something new

56
00:02:19,659 --> 00:02:24,640
some of then we'll show it discuss some

57
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:26,049
of the research we did on the on to

58
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,480
crawl the web looking for cryptid

59
00:02:26,049 --> 00:02:30,640
jacking web sites and notice what and

60
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:32,500
discuss what we noticed in terms of

61
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,819
cryptid jacking on the Internet and then

62
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:35,110
we'll conclude the presentation with

63
00:02:33,819 --> 00:02:37,780
kind of a comparison between the two

64
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:40,150
because they are both contenders for the

65
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:41,980
top malware threat but which one is

66
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:45,849
going to win so we'll take a look at

67
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:46,929
that in conclusion all right so a little

68
00:02:45,849 --> 00:02:48,849
bit about us

69
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:50,579
my name is pranchi Bochy I'm a PhD

70
00:02:48,849 --> 00:02:53,078
candidate at Michigan State University

71
00:02:50,579 --> 00:02:55,680
I'm also a security researcher at the

72
00:02:53,079 --> 00:02:57,760
security research group at MSU and

73
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,639
previously I worked used to work as an

74
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:02,590
independent penetration tester that was

75
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:04,090
a lot of fun you know breaking things is

76
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:07,150
always a lot of fun I'm sure everybody

77
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:09,639
here agrees and then I like to speak at

78
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:11,560
conferences just to if if I've done some

79
00:03:09,639 --> 00:03:12,849
work that I believe could be valuable to

80
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:15,190
the community then I like to share it

81
00:03:12,849 --> 00:03:17,679
and sometimes when I'm in the middle of

82
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:19,120
doing something I think I like to think

83
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,220
that I can get some input from the

84
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,019
community to kind of improve my

85
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:25,359
approaches and in that you know in that

86
00:03:23,019 --> 00:03:27,459
sense I like to also share with the with

87
00:03:25,359 --> 00:03:29,230
the community at conferences all the

88
00:03:27,459 --> 00:03:31,480
work that I do I do it with my PhD

89
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:33,340
advisor dr. n-body he has been a

90
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:38,260
professor at Michigan State's Michigan

91
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:40,599
State since 1987 I believe all right so

92
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:44,739
I felt like there's a little bit of a

93
00:03:40,599 --> 00:03:49,599
need to to discuss why we're discussing

94
00:03:44,739 --> 00:03:52,720
ransomware in in 2018 because believe it

95
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:55,000
or not something that it's a very 2017

96
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:57,160
thing right or 2016 thing well the truth

97
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,319
is that ransomware is overshadowed

98
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:03,430
currently by crypto jackin but it's not

99
00:03:59,319 --> 00:04:05,708
really gone and it is slowly developing

100
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:08,709
and you know they're improving improving

101
00:04:05,709 --> 00:04:10,419
ransomware constantly and so we have to

102
00:04:08,709 --> 00:04:12,489
watch out for that but we don't see it

103
00:04:10,419 --> 00:04:14,919
in the muezzin emore I mean we do see it

104
00:04:12,489 --> 00:04:16,870
but it's buried within other security

105
00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:19,750
news and cryptid jacking is kind of all

106
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:21,340
over the place because it's new but this

107
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:22,930
is these are just some of the if you if

108
00:04:21,339 --> 00:04:25,989
you if you look at the news headlines

109
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:27,909
from let's say last week you look at you

110
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:31,030
know you look at how ransomware is

111
00:04:27,909 --> 00:04:34,060
rising specifically targeted ransomware

112
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:37,000
and how they're constantly adapting and

113
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:38,620
improving their approaches and you know

114
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,050
you see new victims all the time like

115
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:42,850
just a few days ago a Canadian town was

116
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:45,880
hit so they're they're constantly going

117
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:48,070
for newer targets we don't know about

118
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:50,080
Sam Sam which is a targeted ransomware

119
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:53,020
attack and so yeah they're definitely

120
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:54,520
improving and they're definitely still

121
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:59,560
here there's definitely alive and

122
00:04:54,520 --> 00:05:01,750
kicking so I want establish what the

123
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:03,940
defining characteristics of a ransomware

124
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:05,770
are and these are very straightforward

125
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:07,750
we all understand it you know infiltrate

126
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:11,109
the computer system or any system any

127
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:15,040
way you can you can there a variety of

128
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:16,720
attack vectors here you can you can use

129
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:18,070
the same old social engineering attacks

130
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:20,830
that they've been using for many years

131
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:22,930
or you know it went with wanna cry we

132
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:24,849
saw it spread like a worm you know

133
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:27,490
exploiting the eternal blue your

134
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:31,090
vulnerability and then we we saw that

135
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:33,610
Sam Sam recently is using weak is

136
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:36,070
abusing weakly secure RDP sessions to

137
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:37,570
get into get into the hosts and once

138
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:39,790
you're in you know you you go ahead and

139
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:42,909
you know execute your malicious

140
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:46,510
functionality so so once you're in you

141
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:48,790
obtain the encryption secret and this is

142
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:50,530
important because the encryption secret

143
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:53,110
or the symmetric key that they will use

144
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:55,869
to encrypt the users files or data needs

145
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:59,380
to needs to be generated for differently

146
00:05:55,870 --> 00:06:00,820
for every victim because if you use the

147
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:03,010
same encryption key to encrypt every

148
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:04,360
victim once one victim gets an

149
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:06,070
encryption key back they can share it

150
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:07,540
with other people and you know before

151
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:08,590
you know it your ransomware campaign is

152
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:10,600
neutralized so they need a new

153
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:12,760
encryption secret for every victim and

154
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:14,020
there comes key management and

155
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:16,360
ransomware which we'll discuss in the

156
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:18,549
next slide but they can either generate

157
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:20,560
this symmetric key or set of symmetric

158
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:22,660
keys whatever their scheme is they can

159
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:25,810
either generate it on the host using the

160
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:28,750
hosts crypto API or they can they would

161
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:30,910
what they used to do was invoke it from

162
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:32,890
let's say a remote site like you know

163
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:36,070
which could be like a command and

164
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:38,169
control server so so you know these are

165
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:40,150
the two approaches that they've

166
00:06:38,170 --> 00:06:42,640
primarily seen there's variations to

167
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:44,979
these approaches but these are basically

168
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:46,270
it to acquire the encryption secret

169
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:47,770
then they go ahead and encrypt the files

170
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:50,080
using the encryption secret or the or

171
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:51,580
the file or the symmetric key and and

172
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:54,250
then they demand Aransas there has to be

173
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:56,620
some sort of a channel or route for the

174
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:58,150
ransom payment to be made you know and

175
00:06:56,620 --> 00:07:01,270
you know usually it's why a Bitcoin or

176
00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:05,169
some other cryptocurrency but how does

177
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:07,479
this work exactly so we have the hybrid

178
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:10,300
encryption model we've studied the

179
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:12,250
evolution of key management and in

180
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:14,650
ransomware and we've discussed it in

181
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:18,400
detail in our paper listed on the slide

182
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:20,580
and and if you look at it over the years

183
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:23,919
since GP code first came out in about

184
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:26,500
2005 or 2006 I believe since then they

185
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:28,750
have changed their key management model

186
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:30,160
significantly what it used to be was

187
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:33,010
they were doing something really dumb

188
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:34,690
which was they just they generated the

189
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:36,700
attacker generated a public/private key

190
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:38,200
pair and they would ship the public key

191
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:40,060
with the ransomware and use the public

192
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:42,190
key to encrypt the data now that is very

193
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:44,920
slow public key public keys were not

194
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:48,730
meant for bulk data encryption symmetric

195
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:51,310
keys are more more of you were more made

196
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:53,110
for for that particular purpose so so

197
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:54,490
that was a little stupid but you know

198
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:57,790
then they had some other stupid

199
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:59,980
variations of that and then started to

200
00:07:57,790 --> 00:08:01,510
evolve and then what we saw was they

201
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:03,220
were trying to import so once the

202
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:05,980
ransomware was in a host then it would

203
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:07,480
call back home to a CNC server let's say

204
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:09,760
and get the set of keys that it means

205
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:11,440
then it brings in the set of keys and

206
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:14,070
then it uses those keys to encrypt the

207
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:17,080
files but the problem there was that

208
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:18,820
security people you know in a network

209
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:21,640
they network administrators they started

210
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:24,550
sharing a list of bad domain names where

211
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:27,310
they know that the CNC servers lie so

212
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:29,530
then you block them at the firewall at

213
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:31,810
the network firewall now the ransomware

214
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:33,909
is in let's say but it's still when it

215
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:35,950
calls back home that call is blocked so

216
00:08:33,909 --> 00:08:37,539
it never acquires the encryption key and

217
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:39,220
because it never acquires the encryption

218
00:08:37,539 --> 00:08:41,799
key cannot go ahead and encrypt the

219
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:44,140
files and then lies dormant so so that

220
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:45,849
wasn't a good model either I believe it

221
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:49,090
was low key that that implemented that

222
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:50,440
model but but what they're using more

223
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:52,420
importantly what they're using now is

224
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:54,700
what we want to discuss is the hybrid

225
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:57,130
encryption scheme and so the hybrid

226
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:58,720
encryption scheme is called a hybrid

227
00:08:57,130 --> 00:09:00,069
scheme because it uses the

228
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,259
of symmetric and asymmetric encryption

229
00:09:00,069 --> 00:09:04,449
which is best for them because in this

230
00:09:02,259 --> 00:09:07,209
particular approach as you can see the

231
00:09:04,449 --> 00:09:10,029
attacker the attacker has the private

232
00:09:07,209 --> 00:09:11,469
key public private public key pair and

233
00:09:10,029 --> 00:09:13,449
keeps the private key safe with them

234
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:15,819
then then public key is shipped with the

235
00:09:13,449 --> 00:09:17,439
ransomware ransomware comes in use the

236
00:09:15,819 --> 00:09:19,509
crypto API on host to generate a

237
00:09:17,439 --> 00:09:22,360
symmetric key the symmetric key is used

238
00:09:19,509 --> 00:09:24,579
for encrypting users files and then

239
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:27,009
encrypt the symmetric key using the

240
00:09:24,579 --> 00:09:28,750
attackers public key and then store it

241
00:09:27,009 --> 00:09:30,730
and now you wipe the unencrypted

242
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:33,160
symmetric key from the system and then

243
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:35,259
you go ahead and demand ransom if the

244
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:37,509
ransom is paid and if you're if you if

245
00:09:35,259 --> 00:09:39,910
you're honest criminals then you're

246
00:09:37,509 --> 00:09:42,279
going to return you're going to ask for

247
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:44,259
this encrypted symmetric key and use

248
00:09:42,279 --> 00:09:45,430
your private key to decrypt the keys and

249
00:09:44,259 --> 00:09:47,259
then send it back to the victim so

250
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:49,239
that's basically how the hybrid

251
00:09:47,259 --> 00:09:52,209
encryption model works the there's

252
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:53,279
variations of this but primarily that's

253
00:09:52,209 --> 00:09:56,680
what they do

254
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:59,410
so with that let's quickly start looking

255
00:09:56,680 --> 00:10:02,800
at the trends in in in modern and modern

256
00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:04,629
ransomware so first things first target

257
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:08,878
ransomware attacks are here and they're

258
00:10:04,629 --> 00:10:12,930
here to stay it makes more sense to to

259
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:14,980
pick your victims carefully because

260
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:16,359
there could be several factors while

261
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:17,680
you're taking your victims one of them

262
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,730
you want one of them you want to make

263
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:21,160
sure that they have deep enough pockets

264
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:23,259
to make a big ransom to meet a big

265
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:24,939
ransom demand like if you encrypt a

266
00:10:23,259 --> 00:10:27,759
bunch of computers belonging to a

267
00:10:24,939 --> 00:10:29,709
network in a large organization then

268
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:32,230
they should have pockets deep enough to

269
00:10:29,709 --> 00:10:34,000
pay you let's say $50,000 or $100,000 or

270
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:37,029
whatever your demand might be so makes

271
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,500
sense that way second the data should be

272
00:10:37,029 --> 00:10:40,930
important enough some organizations have

273
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:42,459
really critical data and and so they are

274
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:44,769
more likely to meet your ransom demand

275
00:10:42,459 --> 00:10:46,239
no matter how big it is so so in that

276
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:49,629
sense you want to choose your victims

277
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:51,610
carefully and and Sam Sam did this and

278
00:10:49,629 --> 00:10:54,189
the way it worked was you know the

279
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:56,680
attack vector was weakly secured RDP

280
00:10:54,189 --> 00:10:59,050
session so you know it will go ahead and

281
00:10:56,680 --> 00:11:02,589
exploit that once they're in they will

282
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:04,240
manually escalate privileges and when

283
00:11:02,589 --> 00:11:05,980
you become let's say an administrator

284
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:08,019
then you kill the a B and then you

285
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:11,050
spread and in fact and then you demand

286
00:11:08,019 --> 00:11:12,610
the ransom now they have made about 6

287
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:15,310
million so far

288
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:16,839
and you know you make six million

289
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:18,849
dollars from your ransomware operation

290
00:11:16,839 --> 00:11:20,560
you take out 1 million dollars for sex

291
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:22,899
drugs and rock and roll and you still

292
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:25,540
have you know 5 million for your next

293
00:11:22,899 --> 00:11:27,399
ransomware campaign as a research budget

294
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:29,260
you know so this is substantial amount

295
00:11:27,399 --> 00:11:30,670
of money that the address shown is one

296
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:36,220
of the Bitcoin addresses that belong to

297
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:37,360
the the Sam Sam ransomware so so that's

298
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:38,800
that's one of the things you know

299
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:41,260
targeted ransomware attacks are here to

300
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:43,089
say now you know adding a minor

301
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:44,439
cryptocurrencies on the rise the second

302
00:11:43,089 --> 00:11:47,019
how the presentation is about that and

303
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:48,790
we'll discuss you know exactly what it

304
00:11:47,019 --> 00:11:50,170
entails but we all know that it's on the

305
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:52,420
rise so why wouldn't they include

306
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:54,250
another secondary you know infection in

307
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:57,519
there you know add add a crypto minor

308
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:59,050
and you know so they are bundling mining

309
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:00,370
routines with the ransomware we saw it a

310
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:02,740
little while ago with black ruby

311
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:06,040
ransomware we're seeing it lately with

312
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:08,709
where ransomware like the blue blackmail

313
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:11,949
virus or the Obama themed virus as it is

314
00:12:08,709 --> 00:12:13,779
called and and and so we're seeing that

315
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:15,250
they are bundling mining mining routines

316
00:12:13,779 --> 00:12:16,839
with the ransomware in this there's a

317
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:19,089
lot of motivation for why they would do

318
00:12:16,839 --> 00:12:20,620
this well first of all it runs in the

319
00:12:19,089 --> 00:12:22,990
background while you're waiting for for

320
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:26,200
ransom you know it's like it will

321
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:27,880
generate some small income for you even

322
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:29,680
if the victim doesn't end up paying you

323
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:31,510
ransom you still end up generating a

324
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:33,099
little bit of something if financially

325
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:35,200
if you're like completely financially

326
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:37,510
motivated so it makes sense and then

327
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:39,070
it's favorable to ransomware developers

328
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:41,230
in the context of developing countries

329
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:43,630
especially because you know you you you

330
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:47,410
take you asked for three hundred dollars

331
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:49,600
of you know after as a ransom demand and

332
00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:51,250
if it's a country like India let's say

333
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:53,380
where the exchange rate is one dollar

334
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:55,630
can was to about seventy Indian rupees

335
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:56,680
then you convert that to rupees and

336
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:58,480
three hundred dollars is a lot of money

337
00:12:56,680 --> 00:13:00,699
so you're not really going to get a lot

338
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:02,560
of people paying you the ransom even

339
00:13:00,699 --> 00:13:04,390
though they don't want to lose their

340
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:06,729
files at times unless it's business

341
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:08,410
critical files and in that case they

342
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:09,370
might end up paying but otherwise you

343
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:10,930
know if it's personal files they'll

344
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:12,610
they'll be like alright I'll deal with

345
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:13,989
the I'll deal with the loss I don't want

346
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:15,490
to pay this kind of money so in that

347
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:17,050
case it makes more sense if you if you

348
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:18,910
can detect the IP address of the host

349
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:20,770
you've infected resolve that to a

350
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:22,689
country and see that say that if this is

351
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:23,890
the list of countries you know it's a

352
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:25,720
developing countries and in that case

353
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:27,519
just just mine in the background

354
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:31,209
you know lie led the ransomware

355
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:33,519
functionality lie dormant so so that's

356
00:13:31,209 --> 00:13:35,500
that that could be a thing in the future

357
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:37,120
we've already seen them resolve the IP

358
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:39,970
addresses to countries but they've

359
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:42,069
usually done it to let's say if it's a

360
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:44,709
if it's the Russian malware then it will

361
00:13:42,069 --> 00:13:47,019
and if it detects the Russian host that

362
00:13:44,709 --> 00:13:48,910
it is infected then it won't encrypt

363
00:13:47,019 --> 00:13:50,379
there could be a bunch of reasons for

364
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:52,180
why they do this maybe it's some sort of

365
00:13:50,379 --> 00:13:53,529
patriotism or maybe it's because the

366
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:55,239
authorities local authorities are more

367
00:13:53,529 --> 00:13:57,790
likely to get to you so we saw it

368
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:59,920
started with some ransomware in Iran as

369
00:13:57,790 --> 00:14:01,930
well where it was detecting Iran's IP

370
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:04,509
and then not executing the malicious

371
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:06,040
functionality so so so it makes sense

372
00:14:04,509 --> 00:14:10,089
for them to do it in case of

373
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:11,050
cryptocurrency mining as well and so

374
00:14:10,089 --> 00:14:12,639
yeah something is better than nothing

375
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:15,128
you at least generate some income and

376
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:17,019
then and another thing we're noticing

377
00:14:15,129 --> 00:14:18,610
with ransomware is the you know they

378
00:14:17,019 --> 00:14:20,889
started using elliptic curve

379
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:23,500
cryptography the Petya ransomware used

380
00:14:20,889 --> 00:14:25,959
it and the infamous Petya ransomware and

381
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:27,310
and the motivation now there's this is

382
00:14:25,959 --> 00:14:29,109
these are just speculations because we

383
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:32,079
don't exactly know why they need to use

384
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:35,319
the elliptic curve cryptography cuz RSA

385
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:36,878
does the job just fine RSA to zero for a

386
00:14:35,319 --> 00:14:38,920
bit encryption is strong enough they

387
00:14:36,879 --> 00:14:41,800
don't really need to use this but it

388
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:43,479
could be better for marketing in the

389
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:45,370
underground economy because underground

390
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:48,639
markets can be competitive just like any

391
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:49,839
other you know business and so so it's

392
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:51,850
better for marketing look at us we're

393
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:53,139
using the new and shiny elliptic curve

394
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:54,579
cryptography as opposed to our

395
00:14:53,139 --> 00:14:56,860
competitors who are using the same ol

396
00:14:54,579 --> 00:14:58,989
RSA you've always heard of so and then

397
00:14:56,860 --> 00:15:02,019
and this is another speculation it's not

398
00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:03,339
as closely scrutinized as RSA is for for

399
00:15:02,019 --> 00:15:05,470
security weaknesses so if you make a

400
00:15:03,339 --> 00:15:07,240
mistake you're more likely to get away

401
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:10,000
with it you know in terms of

402
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:12,339
implementation so so that could be

403
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,069
another reason but but basically I

404
00:15:12,339 --> 00:15:16,870
wanted to discuss the example of Petya

405
00:15:15,069 --> 00:15:19,050
ransomware and see how they implemented

406
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:21,009
the EC IES scheme as it is called the

407
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:23,769
elliptic curve and integration

408
00:15:21,009 --> 00:15:27,850
encryption scheme in in in the

409
00:15:23,769 --> 00:15:28,870
ransomware so so that scp-198 UK when

410
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:30,790
I'm sure there's a better way of saying

411
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:33,009
that but that what you see is that is

412
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:35,740
the curve deployed in petty ransomware

413
00:15:33,009 --> 00:15:38,230
the curve has certain parameters so the

414
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:40,279
domain parameters of a curve is for

415
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:42,350
example the base point which is

416
00:15:40,279 --> 00:15:45,170
just as an example and so the domain

417
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:46,850
parameters and the public key ship with

418
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:49,248
the ransomware and then the secret

419
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:50,540
integers this is the same thing as you

420
00:15:49,249 --> 00:15:53,029
know the public key cryptography you

421
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:54,740
know the secret integer S will be kept

422
00:15:53,029 --> 00:15:57,170
safe with the attacker wanted to quickly

423
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:59,800
discuss how easy is works this is the

424
00:15:57,170 --> 00:16:02,769
only slide with with with math in there

425
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:04,939
it's quite a risk I took right here but

426
00:16:02,769 --> 00:16:06,589
but you know you generate a random

427
00:16:04,939 --> 00:16:08,599
integer T this is a very simplified

428
00:16:06,589 --> 00:16:10,610
version of understanding how elliptic

429
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:12,860
curve cryptography works in the context

430
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:15,230
of ransomware so upon infection you

431
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:17,839
generate a random integer T on the host

432
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:19,610
and that for do it for for doing that

433
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:21,499
you can use the crypt gen random

434
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:25,399
function that is part of the windows

435
00:16:21,499 --> 00:16:26,869
crypto API or the dab u random on Linux

436
00:16:25,399 --> 00:16:28,850
if you're on Linux but anyway you

437
00:16:26,869 --> 00:16:32,420
generate the random integer T and then

438
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:33,949
you get q by combining T with G so G was

439
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:35,209
the base point from the previous slide

440
00:16:33,949 --> 00:16:36,378
if you don't remember that and that's

441
00:16:35,209 --> 00:16:38,689
part of the domain parameters that's

442
00:16:36,379 --> 00:16:40,970
public that's part of the curve so so

443
00:16:38,689 --> 00:16:43,910
then the ransomware combines it to get Q

444
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:45,709
and then once you have Q you you take

445
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:47,329
the T and P combine it perform a hash

446
00:16:45,709 --> 00:16:50,989
bit and you get the H which is the

447
00:16:47,329 --> 00:16:52,429
encryption key so the P over here is is

448
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:53,779
the attackers public key that was

449
00:16:52,429 --> 00:16:55,819
embedded in the ransomware shipped with

450
00:16:53,779 --> 00:16:57,439
it and so now you get the encryption key

451
00:16:55,819 --> 00:16:59,719
now you encrypt using the encryption key

452
00:16:57,439 --> 00:17:01,730
and then you go ahead and it's important

453
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:03,230
to execute this step if they make a

454
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:05,899
mistake then that's why we're there to

455
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:07,789
exploit it and you know making a decrypt

456
00:17:05,898 --> 00:17:11,359
are available on a project like normal

457
00:17:07,789 --> 00:17:12,559
ransom so you purge tnh from house this

458
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:15,139
is important for the ransomware

459
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:17,359
developer to do and then upon receiving

460
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:18,860
payment and then you demand the ransom

461
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:21,948
and then you know if if you receive

462
00:17:18,859 --> 00:17:24,198
payment then what you can do is ask for

463
00:17:21,949 --> 00:17:26,870
Q and because you have that secret

464
00:17:24,199 --> 00:17:28,399
integer and it has this property this

465
00:17:26,869 --> 00:17:29,989
important mathematical property that it

466
00:17:28,398 --> 00:17:32,689
came combined with Q to give the same

467
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:34,880
same result as combining T with the

468
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:36,919
attackers public key gave us so

469
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:38,720
basically they can get the encryption

470
00:17:36,919 --> 00:17:40,250
key back using the secret integer that

471
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:42,320
they that never left them and that they

472
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:44,270
have and so so now they're able to

473
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:45,918
generate the symmetric key back on their

474
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:48,470
system and then they can just send that

475
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:50,090
back to you as your decryption key and

476
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:52,620
then you can you can decrypt your data

477
00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:54,780
so that's that's that's

478
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:57,659
a simplified version of how easy is

479
00:17:54,780 --> 00:18:00,960
works on on a ransomware like you know

480
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:02,820
the Petya ransomware so we may see more

481
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,980
of elliptic curve cryptography as they

482
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:08,309
begin to move away from RSA for whatever

483
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:10,710
reason and all right so then so then we

484
00:18:08,309 --> 00:18:12,480
have purging backups this is this is a

485
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:14,430
trend that started a few years ago and

486
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:16,110
you know and it makes sense for them to

487
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:18,230
do the only leverage that ransomware

488
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:20,699
developers have over their victims is

489
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:23,190
denial of data basically they're they're

490
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:24,929
disallowing you access to your data so

491
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:27,660
if you can get a pack then you know you

492
00:18:24,929 --> 00:18:29,420
know that basically backups are the

493
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:31,530
ultimate defense against ransomware so

494
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:33,540
backups can exist in many forms you can

495
00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:35,610
have it on a mapped network drive or you

496
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:37,678
can you can you know in on a host in

497
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:39,689
terms of windows you know volume shadow

498
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:41,520
copies or you can have if you trust

499
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:43,710
cloud storage providers and with your

500
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,879
critical data then you can upload you

501
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:46,770
know with your sensitive data then you

502
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:49,050
can upload them on cloud providers as

503
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:50,730
well now ransomware are known to

504
00:18:49,050 --> 00:18:53,820
explicitly search for and encrypt

505
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:55,860
Network shares and purge VSS files on

506
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:57,689
hosts and sometimes there are even known

507
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:59,939
to abuse the same clients of crap these

508
00:18:57,690 --> 00:19:03,390
cloud service providers to encrypt files

509
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:05,309
stored on the cloud also if it's a

510
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:07,679
automatic sync up that's happening if

511
00:19:05,309 --> 00:19:10,080
the ransomware ends up encrypting your

512
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:11,640
files and you've got it if you've set it

513
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:14,309
up to automatically sync to the cloud

514
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:17,490
the cloud copies will also get encrypted

515
00:19:14,309 --> 00:19:18,990
but of course you know with I believe

516
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:22,170
onedrive is providing a functionality

517
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:23,940
where it lets you revert back changes

518
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:25,620
for up to a month and so you know you

519
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:28,200
can kind of get your files back from

520
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:30,030
there but but but yeah there so you know

521
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:31,380
if you perform a dynamic analysis of

522
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:32,820
various ransomware and you know this

523
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:34,620
this exists in many ransomware and

524
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:36,149
that's here to stay but if you if you

525
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:37,770
perform a dynamic analysis of let's say

526
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:41,010
for example Sam Sam you'll see that you

527
00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:43,710
know it uses the we are said many XE on

528
00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:46,020
Windows to delete to quietly delete all

529
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:48,420
shadow copies and and that's why it's

530
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:49,830
suggested that you rename we SS admin on

531
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:52,679
windows and there's a little bit of a

532
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:54,720
workaround there so that you know so

533
00:19:52,679 --> 00:19:57,600
that your volume shadow shadow copies

534
00:19:54,720 --> 00:20:00,120
keep on you know producing and syncing

535
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:01,830
but and but but basically you want to

536
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:04,709
rename it because ransomware love to use

537
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:07,139
that to remove to quietly purge all of

538
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:09,629
your shadow copies

539
00:20:07,139 --> 00:20:11,580
and then we're also we've also seen that

540
00:20:09,629 --> 00:20:13,559
they like to explicitly map Network

541
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:15,749
shares and then once they're mapped on

542
00:20:13,559 --> 00:20:17,969
your hosts and they will go in fact that

543
00:20:15,749 --> 00:20:20,249
there and then you know encrypt that as

544
00:20:17,969 --> 00:20:23,419
well so what they use for that is a

545
00:20:20,249 --> 00:20:26,219
standard windows function like w w add

546
00:20:23,419 --> 00:20:29,190
connect W net add connection which is

547
00:20:26,219 --> 00:20:30,539
used to map the network share so we've

548
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:33,809
seen a lot of that during static

549
00:20:30,539 --> 00:20:35,759
analysis as well so then it's the next

550
00:20:33,809 --> 00:20:39,299
trend I wanted to quickly talk about was

551
00:20:35,759 --> 00:20:41,849
it was dropping spyware and and so this

552
00:20:39,299 --> 00:20:44,789
is an example it's an excerpt of code

553
00:20:41,849 --> 00:20:46,589
taken from the RSA ransomware which was

554
00:20:44,789 --> 00:20:50,399
one of a kind' ransomware because it was

555
00:20:46,589 --> 00:20:53,039
based entirely on JavaScript and and so

556
00:20:50,399 --> 00:20:54,899
they can't really do much in terms of

557
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:56,789
hiding their code but they can

558
00:20:54,899 --> 00:20:58,529
definitely do code obfuscation so what

559
00:20:56,789 --> 00:21:01,619
they do is they give the functions

560
00:20:58,529 --> 00:21:03,359
random strings as names and you know so

561
00:21:01,619 --> 00:21:05,089
it's it's really hard to follow they try

562
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:07,769
to jumble things up so it's basically

563
00:21:05,089 --> 00:21:09,629
every bad coding practice that they can

564
00:21:07,769 --> 00:21:11,369
do that they do it in there so that it

565
00:21:09,629 --> 00:21:13,619
makes it hard for you to read the and

566
00:21:11,369 --> 00:21:14,908
analyze the code so some code

567
00:21:13,619 --> 00:21:16,379
obfuscation there as part of this

568
00:21:14,909 --> 00:21:18,599
javascript ransomware but this

569
00:21:16,379 --> 00:21:21,059
particular function is important because

570
00:21:18,599 --> 00:21:23,879
this is the one that drops the the Pony

571
00:21:21,059 --> 00:21:27,719
spyware on on a user's machine once it's

572
00:21:23,879 --> 00:21:30,718
done infecting the machine so so it's

573
00:21:27,719 --> 00:21:33,719
it's a self decrypting code so it'd be

574
00:21:30,719 --> 00:21:36,419
Crips a part of itself in and if you so

575
00:21:33,719 --> 00:21:41,940
so this code in the in the beginning be

576
00:21:36,419 --> 00:21:43,679
Crips to to here and and what what you

577
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:47,070
can see over there is they're trying to

578
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:50,159
put s T dot exe which is the pony pony

579
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:52,379
spyware in your My Documents folder and

580
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:54,239
then execute it from there so that it

581
00:21:52,379 --> 00:21:56,099
it's not not just encrypting your files

582
00:21:54,239 --> 00:21:59,219
but is also stealing your passwords and

583
00:21:56,099 --> 00:22:03,509
in other kinds of information on the

584
00:21:59,219 --> 00:22:05,159
host so now this they wouldn't there's

585
00:22:03,509 --> 00:22:07,589
not a lot of motivation for them to do

586
00:22:05,159 --> 00:22:09,269
it except for the obvious benefit of you

587
00:22:07,589 --> 00:22:12,719
know stealing your personal info as well

588
00:22:09,269 --> 00:22:14,789
but you know it it's it makes us

589
00:22:12,719 --> 00:22:17,249
distrust makes the average victim

590
00:22:14,789 --> 00:22:18,899
distrust ransomware operators and

591
00:22:17,249 --> 00:22:19,350
developers so they're not likely to pay

592
00:22:18,899 --> 00:22:21,719
they know

593
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:22,799
that you know there's they can be

594
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:24,510
trusted they won't just give you your

595
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:27,030
key back but we'll leave some secondary

596
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:28,650
infection in there so they'd really like

597
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:30,960
to make sure that their victims trust

598
00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:32,160
them in in a sense you know but but

599
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:34,169
doing these kind of practices is

600
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:35,400
actually bad for business but then

601
00:22:34,169 --> 00:22:36,809
there's all kind of ransomware

602
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:38,730
developers in the underground industry

603
00:22:36,809 --> 00:22:41,220
and so you know while some of them will

604
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:42,780
avoid doing this some of them will do

605
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:45,240
these kind of things you know adding a

606
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:47,250
minor add dropping spyware and so on so

607
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:49,919
if you perform the dynamic analysis in

608
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:52,260
case of the RA a sample jeaious as shown

609
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:55,440
over here you'll see that it opens

610
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:57,960
WordPad Exe and puts a document in front

611
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:59,309
of you with random text in it and while

612
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:01,559
you're trying to figure out what's going

613
00:22:59,309 --> 00:23:05,700
on in the background it executes and

614
00:23:01,559 --> 00:23:09,059
drops the STD xs-3x see as the pony

615
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:10,710
spyware and and that and then it

616
00:23:09,059 --> 00:23:12,629
executes say it so that now you've got a

617
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:13,200
spyware on your system in addition to

618
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:18,059
the ransomware

619
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:19,650
so the attack vectors you know attack

620
00:23:18,059 --> 00:23:21,658
vectors are constantly evolving they

621
00:23:19,650 --> 00:23:23,730
like to get into the system any way that

622
00:23:21,659 --> 00:23:25,620
they can but but they used to go mostly

623
00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:27,780
for the social engineering attacks where

624
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:29,789
they're you know attacking where they're

625
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:31,440
sending an email to an unsuspecting

626
00:23:29,789 --> 00:23:32,879
victim trying to get them trick them

627
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:37,260
into downloading executing the threat

628
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:38,940
you know reas was re a ransomware was a

629
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:41,940
JavaScript based ransom and I believe a

630
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:44,280
major motivation behind writing a

631
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:45,570
ransomware in JavaScript could be other

632
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:46,770
than the fact that the ransom developer

633
00:23:45,570 --> 00:23:48,480
is very familiar with JavaScript and

634
00:23:46,770 --> 00:23:51,389
wanted to use it could be that they

635
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:54,090
wanted to send an email attachment that

636
00:23:51,390 --> 00:23:56,669
says are a dot you know whatever J s and

637
00:23:54,090 --> 00:23:58,049
the and the an average user is moral is

638
00:23:56,669 --> 00:23:59,940
it's like the thing that you know it's

639
00:23:58,049 --> 00:24:02,010
not an exe it's not DLL looks like I can

640
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:04,530
you know download an executors so you

641
00:24:02,010 --> 00:24:06,960
know to tell them you know off their up

642
00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:09,240
their sense so in in this case you know

643
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:10,740
so so they do try a new social

644
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:12,630
engineering tricks like that over the

645
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:13,980
years and they've tried that but that

646
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:16,860
has been the predominant attack vector

647
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:18,929
but why wanna cry made big news and when

648
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:21,149
it came out and I believed 2015 was

649
00:24:18,929 --> 00:24:23,010
because of the way it spread there was

650
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:25,110
nothing very special about wanna cry

651
00:24:23,010 --> 00:24:28,500
except for it spread like a worm and

652
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:30,959
exploited this vulnerability and and

653
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:32,830
because of that it made major news so

654
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:37,390
they had shifted their attack vector

655
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:39,699
in that case and then in case of Sam Sam

656
00:24:37,390 --> 00:24:41,350
recently in 2018 it's been like I

657
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:44,770
mentioned before it's been exploiting

658
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:47,199
RDP sessions or remote you know remote

659
00:24:44,770 --> 00:24:49,780
connections so so there's more to come

660
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:51,700
and you know as part of the as part of

661
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:53,678
security as part of the security group

662
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:55,270
it's our responsibility to kind of think

663
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:56,679
a step ahead and think about what other

664
00:24:55,270 --> 00:24:59,408
attack vectors they might exploit you

665
00:24:56,679 --> 00:25:03,250
know and try to close them down before

666
00:24:59,409 --> 00:25:03,610
they get attacked so that's something to

667
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:05,799
think about

668
00:25:03,610 --> 00:25:07,479
want to cry we've all seen this pcap of

669
00:25:05,799 --> 00:25:09,370
want to cry I wanted to quickly show it

670
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:10,929
you know as soon as it as soon as you

671
00:25:09,370 --> 00:25:13,299
analyze it you notice that after

672
00:25:10,929 --> 00:25:16,630
infection it starts looking for scanning

673
00:25:13,299 --> 00:25:18,549
for port 445 on different house to see

674
00:25:16,630 --> 00:25:21,039
if it can exploit the SMB vulnerability

675
00:25:18,549 --> 00:25:23,200
and yes that's spreading like a worm

676
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:25,140
alright so so with that we're done with

677
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:27,610
like the first part of the presentation

678
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:29,350
which discusses ransomware and the

679
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:31,178
trends that that's here to stay in

680
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:33,820
ransomware and that we've noticed over

681
00:25:31,179 --> 00:25:35,919
the years but what we want to talk about

682
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:38,320
now is is a new thing of course crypto

683
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:39,490
jackin we all know what what it is but I

684
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:40,990
wanted to go into a little bit of a

685
00:25:39,490 --> 00:25:43,510
detail about how they're how they're

686
00:25:40,990 --> 00:25:44,470
executing this so so one evening me and

687
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:46,720
my advisor we were having a conversation

688
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:48,250
about malware threats and and basically

689
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:50,679
crypto jacking and ransomware and he

690
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:53,320
said well you know if you think about it

691
00:25:50,679 --> 00:25:55,980
Bitcoin made ransomware possible because

692
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:59,379
you know so so I believe the first

693
00:25:55,980 --> 00:26:02,380
ransomware that came out was in 1989 and

694
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:04,690
it was called the AIDS Trojan and it did

695
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:06,250
some kind of jumbling up off files I'm

696
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:09,789
not really sure what it did because it

697
00:26:06,250 --> 00:26:11,830
was awhile ago and and and and what it

698
00:26:09,789 --> 00:26:13,419
did in terms of ransom payment was asked

699
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:15,010
you to make a payment deposit you know

700
00:26:13,419 --> 00:26:16,990
in a peel box in Panama

701
00:26:15,010 --> 00:26:18,429
now that that doesn't you know take you

702
00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:20,289
far and if you're looking to develop

703
00:26:18,429 --> 00:26:22,330
this is and is an underground industry

704
00:26:20,289 --> 00:26:25,059
but with the rise of cryptocurrencies

705
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:27,850
especially with Bitcoin made it easy to

706
00:26:25,059 --> 00:26:30,100
set up an online anonymous mode of

707
00:26:27,850 --> 00:26:32,350
payment and so as so then you know

708
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:34,418
ransomware took off after that so it's

709
00:26:32,350 --> 00:26:35,980
kind of related in the absolute sense it

710
00:26:34,419 --> 00:26:37,659
doesn't have to you know it's not like

711
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:40,750
Bitcoin did make ransomware but you know

712
00:26:37,659 --> 00:26:42,880
if you think about it it did so and then

713
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:45,159
since I thought okay well in that case

714
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:49,539
Manero make crypto jackin because

715
00:26:45,159 --> 00:26:51,190
you know with you you can't infect users

716
00:26:49,539 --> 00:26:53,590
and average users computer with a

717
00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:55,059
cryptid crypto jacking malware and mine

718
00:26:53,590 --> 00:26:57,340
try to mine Bitcoin on there because

719
00:26:55,059 --> 00:26:59,799
Bitcoin requires specialized hardware it

720
00:26:57,340 --> 00:27:02,738
requires mining rigs so it's just not

721
00:26:59,799 --> 00:27:04,059
very feasible unless you're doing it in

722
00:27:02,739 --> 00:27:05,679
really read-only knowledge numbers or

723
00:27:04,059 --> 00:27:07,359
something it's just not feasible to mine

724
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:08,679
Bitcoin in an average users computer an

725
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:11,109
average users computer doesn't have

726
00:27:08,679 --> 00:27:12,700
those you know graphics processing units

727
00:27:11,109 --> 00:27:15,369
and all those you know miners that are

728
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:17,200
required for the hardware that is

729
00:27:15,369 --> 00:27:18,428
required for mining Bitcoin but manera

730
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:21,129
on the other hand the algorithms are

731
00:27:18,429 --> 00:27:23,139
designed for an average users CPU like

732
00:27:21,129 --> 00:27:24,969
an eye-fi or an i7 processor that you

733
00:27:23,139 --> 00:27:28,539
know almost every computer these days

734
00:27:24,970 --> 00:27:31,239
has so so for that you know because of

735
00:27:28,539 --> 00:27:31,749
that one arrow took off and then with

736
00:27:31,239 --> 00:27:34,479
monaro

737
00:27:31,749 --> 00:27:36,039
crypto jacking took off especially the

738
00:27:34,479 --> 00:27:37,539
web-based crypto jacking though some

739
00:27:36,039 --> 00:27:39,190
other factors and they're like coin hype

740
00:27:37,539 --> 00:27:42,279
came into existence and things like that

741
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:45,249
but yeah so cryptid jacking took off

742
00:27:42,279 --> 00:27:46,690
when when era took off alright so you

743
00:27:45,249 --> 00:27:49,299
know a little bit about crypto jacking

744
00:27:46,690 --> 00:27:51,279
it's also known as drive-by mining you

745
00:27:49,299 --> 00:27:53,710
know it's it's it's stealing someone's

746
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:57,399
processing power to mine cryptocurrency

747
00:27:53,710 --> 00:28:00,059
and it's an offshoot of the valuation

748
00:27:57,399 --> 00:28:03,129
rise in valuation of cryptocurrencies

749
00:28:00,059 --> 00:28:05,559
when Bitcoin took off it you know when

750
00:28:03,129 --> 00:28:07,840
it rose it brought some of the other

751
00:28:05,559 --> 00:28:10,259
cryptocurrencies values with it and then

752
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:12,220
you know now we've got crypto jacking

753
00:28:10,259 --> 00:28:14,289
there's a general lack of awareness

754
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:16,179
among the average computer users about

755
00:28:14,289 --> 00:28:17,649
what crypto jacking is so it's part of

756
00:28:16,179 --> 00:28:19,629
some of our efforts we wrote some media

757
00:28:17,649 --> 00:28:22,178
articles to make the make the people

758
00:28:19,629 --> 00:28:24,219
aware about the problem and then we did

759
00:28:22,179 --> 00:28:25,450
a radio interview where the questions

760
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:27,820
that were coming from the average people

761
00:28:25,450 --> 00:28:29,769
it was very clear that it's not always

762
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:31,509
easy for an average computer user to

763
00:28:29,769 --> 00:28:33,700
understand what cryptic jacking is right

764
00:28:31,509 --> 00:28:35,710
away because they have to they started

765
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:38,200
all the way from blockchain asking me

766
00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:42,249
questions about blockchain and that that

767
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:43,330
was not easy to answer so so so they're

768
00:28:42,249 --> 00:28:46,659
there preying on the general lack of

769
00:28:43,330 --> 00:28:48,460
awareness you know and then it's easy to

770
00:28:46,659 --> 00:28:51,279
pull off you don't even have to be

771
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:53,200
really a hacker of any sort to do this

772
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:54,999
because all it all you need to do is

773
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:57,190
have a website with a decent number of

774
00:28:54,999 --> 00:28:58,100
visitors visiting you if you think about

775
00:28:57,190 --> 00:28:59,630
it and

776
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:01,730
you can just include four lines of

777
00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:05,120
JavaScript code in your website's HTML

778
00:29:01,730 --> 00:29:07,700
and then you know you've got you've got

779
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:10,610
a crypto jacking you know a platform

780
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:12,740
ready and and in that that's where coin

781
00:29:10,610 --> 00:29:14,049
hive and crypto loot and coin impend

782
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:16,700
services like that come into the picture

783
00:29:14,049 --> 00:29:17,809
so you don't need specialized hardware

784
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:19,610
anymore that's another thing you know

785
00:29:17,809 --> 00:29:21,649
like I said with Manero there's no need

786
00:29:19,610 --> 00:29:24,918
for specialized hardware and average CPU

787
00:29:21,650 --> 00:29:26,330
is fine so the problem with crypto

788
00:29:24,919 --> 00:29:27,890
jacking again explaining it to the

789
00:29:26,330 --> 00:29:29,270
average user you know what's the what's

790
00:29:27,890 --> 00:29:31,340
the problem so why is it hurting me you

791
00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:33,559
know so other than slowing my computer

792
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:35,840
down and making noise you know that sort

793
00:29:33,559 --> 00:29:38,450
of thing so so the immediate problem is

794
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:40,760
of course you know processing increased

795
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:43,039
processing requires more electrical

796
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:44,629
power so it's more costly you do to do

797
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:46,610
this at an organizational level now the

798
00:29:44,630 --> 00:29:48,530
organization is using a lot of money

799
00:29:46,610 --> 00:29:50,990
because a lot of the employees are

800
00:29:48,530 --> 00:29:53,149
infected their stations are infected

801
00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:55,970
with you know crypto jacking malware or

802
00:29:53,150 --> 00:29:57,140
so you so you lose you know the cost of

803
00:29:55,970 --> 00:29:59,030
electrical power is the immediate

804
00:29:57,140 --> 00:30:02,240
problem long-term concern is

805
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:04,120
electromigration if you use a CPU or you

806
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:06,049
know high heat for a long period of time

807
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:07,639
theoretically electromigration is

808
00:30:06,049 --> 00:30:09,139
possible that damages the CPU but the

809
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:11,750
truth of the matter is that we change

810
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:14,000
laptops and so the recycling time of

811
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:15,919
wrap laptops is so short these days that

812
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:18,110
it's more likely that you'll change the

813
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:20,740
laptop by the time that your CPU burns

814
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:23,360
out except for some extreme cases where

815
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:24,950
where I just heard about this case

816
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:28,850
recently two days ago where someone's

817
00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:32,150
processor caught fire because one of the

818
00:30:28,850 --> 00:30:33,530
clients I offer wasn't their clients so

819
00:30:32,150 --> 00:30:35,830
basically an employee in a corporate

820
00:30:33,530 --> 00:30:39,230
network I had asked for this really

821
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:41,178
really powerful computer and it's for

822
00:30:39,230 --> 00:30:44,230
work apparently but what they were doing

823
00:30:41,179 --> 00:30:48,980
was was mining cryptocurrency on it 24/7

824
00:30:44,230 --> 00:30:51,169
ended up catching fire but that's that's

825
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:52,610
not really that's not really what we're

826
00:30:51,169 --> 00:30:54,260
concerned about because one thing if you

827
00:30:52,610 --> 00:30:56,000
think about it with the next wave of

828
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:57,500
trip to jacking criminals coming into

829
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:00,470
the picture as I'll talk about in later

830
00:30:57,500 --> 00:31:01,820
slides they will be smarter and you know

831
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:03,289
if you're a smart cyber criminal

832
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:06,408
encrypted jacking people you don't want

833
00:31:03,289 --> 00:31:08,299
to kill the cash cow so turning your you

834
00:31:06,409 --> 00:31:10,520
know you know killing the host is not

835
00:31:08,299 --> 00:31:11,690
something of a virus intends to do at

836
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:13,129
least not right away

837
00:31:11,690 --> 00:31:15,410
at least not in the case of cryptid

838
00:31:13,130 --> 00:31:18,670
jacking when a long term you know mining

839
00:31:15,410 --> 00:31:18,670
could give you substantially funded

840
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:25,699
jacking you know there's several types

841
00:31:24,050 --> 00:31:28,430
one from what we have noticed on the

842
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:30,320
internet we've kind of condensed it to

843
00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:33,710
this you know you can install a mining

844
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:35,090
application on host and in that case

845
00:31:33,710 --> 00:31:36,080
there's two ways of doing that

846
00:31:35,090 --> 00:31:37,669
you either trick the user into

847
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:38,960
installing one since the same old social

848
00:31:37,670 --> 00:31:41,090
engineering tactics that I was talking

849
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:43,430
about earlier so either you can you know

850
00:31:41,090 --> 00:31:45,379
have a user download this and execute it

851
00:31:43,430 --> 00:31:47,840
or you can exploit a vulnerability and

852
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:49,700
spread like you know it like the red is

853
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:51,530
wine I minded and it exploited the same

854
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:53,840
internal blue owner ability but instead

855
00:31:51,530 --> 00:31:56,510
of I ran somewhere it was uh it was a

856
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:58,850
mining malware so so so you can do that

857
00:31:56,510 --> 00:32:01,310
as well and now and then the other one

858
00:31:58,850 --> 00:32:02,629
other wave of attacks in terms of crypto

859
00:32:01,310 --> 00:32:04,520
jacking that we've been seeing or the

860
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:05,900
JavaScript based miners and we all know

861
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:08,750
about these ones you know just lure

862
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:10,940
victims to a web page and the web page

863
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:13,640
wants an embedded JavaScript miner so as

864
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:16,310
long as the victim or the visitor stays

865
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:18,530
on the web page it keeps on mining we've

866
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:20,480
also seen instances where if you try to

867
00:32:18,530 --> 00:32:22,600
close the page it actually doesn't let

868
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:26,720
you close it it actually pops a window

869
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:30,409
in the Indus and hides it behind the

870
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:32,600
time on the taskbar and in a way that

871
00:32:30,410 --> 00:32:34,010
you can barely see it so the window is

872
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:36,469
small and it's kind of open and you

873
00:32:34,010 --> 00:32:38,000
think that it's not but it the point of

874
00:32:36,470 --> 00:32:41,770
keeping the window open is that it keeps

875
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:45,020
mining so so we've seen them do this and

876
00:32:41,770 --> 00:32:46,850
and then they inject mining another way

877
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:48,320
to do it is to inject mining scripts

878
00:32:46,850 --> 00:32:49,820
into ad networks and we've seen several

879
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:51,830
examples of this where legitimate

880
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:56,870
websites even government websites are

881
00:32:51,830 --> 00:32:59,840
serving ads to their visitors hundreds

882
00:32:56,870 --> 00:33:01,550
of thousands of visitors and and the ads

883
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:04,100
are infected with the crypto jacking

884
00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:06,649
scripts and so you know they they're all

885
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:08,419
unwillingly participating in this crypto

886
00:33:06,650 --> 00:33:11,420
jacking campaign so we've seen a lot of

887
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:14,000
examples of that as well so so those are

888
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:15,890
the two you know rough roughly there's

889
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:18,590
the two ways of doing the the crypto

890
00:33:15,890 --> 00:33:20,750
jacking attacks so with that we kind of

891
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:22,340
want to move forward and discuss the the

892
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:24,110
crypto jacking on the web some of the

893
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:24,990
some of the preliminary analysis that

894
00:33:24,110 --> 00:33:29,370
we've done

895
00:33:24,990 --> 00:33:31,440
- I identify what's going on and and an

896
00:33:29,370 --> 00:33:35,489
example of a JavaScript based mining

897
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:38,550
script is look something like this so

898
00:33:35,490 --> 00:33:41,640
both of them are examples of coin hive

899
00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:43,889
scripts embedded in in you know in a web

900
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:45,900
page that that we visited and they are

901
00:33:43,890 --> 00:33:47,430
not notifying so cryptocurrency mining

902
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:50,220
in itself as we all know is not

903
00:33:47,430 --> 00:33:52,050
inherently bad or you know illegal it's

904
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:54,030
if they ask for your permission like in

905
00:33:52,050 --> 00:33:55,260
the case of salon you know if they ask

906
00:33:54,030 --> 00:33:57,030
for your permission and you say I don't

907
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:58,440
want to see the ads in fact what I want

908
00:33:57,030 --> 00:33:59,850
to do is I'll let you mine for a little

909
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:02,190
bit but just don't show me the ads and

910
00:33:59,850 --> 00:34:04,290
so if you agree to that as a user then

911
00:34:02,190 --> 00:34:06,450
that's fine you know but in these cases

912
00:34:04,290 --> 00:34:07,920
they were not doing that they were there

913
00:34:06,450 --> 00:34:10,080
was no notification given to the user so

914
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:11,970
then it becomes scripted jacking and so

915
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:14,219
these were two examples where you know

916
00:34:11,969 --> 00:34:16,529
all they need to do is just import the

917
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:20,730
coin high script that the j/s script and

918
00:34:16,530 --> 00:34:24,000
and then in the next set of commands or

919
00:34:20,730 --> 00:34:26,730
basically to initiate the the mining

920
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:29,060
activity and the long string that you

921
00:34:26,730 --> 00:34:32,340
see in the in the boxes those strings

922
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:35,190
correspond to where to make the make the

923
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:36,960
payments so you know who who should the

924
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:38,220
proceeds of the crypto jacking or the

925
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:40,440
cryptocurrency mining go to of course

926
00:34:38,219 --> 00:34:42,060
that's the attackers address and and so

927
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:43,679
your computer does the mining and you

928
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:46,560
know they get the profit so the idea is

929
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:47,909
clear so that's another example of a

930
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:49,679
JavaScript based mine strip except

931
00:34:47,909 --> 00:34:51,690
except for in this case it's crypto loot

932
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:54,449
it's not coin hive I wanted to put that

933
00:34:51,690 --> 00:34:57,210
on there because it's coin has become

934
00:34:54,449 --> 00:34:59,640
almost synonymous with JavaScript based

935
00:34:57,210 --> 00:35:01,320
mining on the web and it is the most

936
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:03,470
predominant one use but there's other

937
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:06,180
options available like crypto loot and

938
00:35:03,470 --> 00:35:07,649
coin imp and so on there's a bunch of

939
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:09,240
them available the point is that when

940
00:35:07,650 --> 00:35:10,560
we're doing research we don't just want

941
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:12,569
to be looking for coin hype there's

942
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:15,810
other things as well so that's why I

943
00:35:12,570 --> 00:35:17,310
wanted to show this example as well now

944
00:35:15,810 --> 00:35:19,680
impact on system resources this is a

945
00:35:17,310 --> 00:35:22,049
small simple study done by us which

946
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:24,600
where we just reloaded and this is a

947
00:35:22,050 --> 00:35:27,810
this is the before and after shot of

948
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:30,029
resources on a Kali Linux box and and

949
00:35:27,810 --> 00:35:32,310
you know as before you know the course

950
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:34,830
were Bailey barely doing anything but

951
00:35:32,310 --> 00:35:37,170
and the temperature was down and then

952
00:35:34,830 --> 00:35:38,279
after we opened this web page on Firefox

953
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:40,980
which was

954
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:42,990
which was a crypto jacking webpage the

955
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:45,120
resource consumption shot up to hundred

956
00:35:42,990 --> 00:35:46,410
percent right away all four courts are

957
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:48,180
being used to full capacity the

958
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:50,549
temperature is rising this screenshot

959
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:52,560
was taken immediately after it and so

960
00:35:50,550 --> 00:35:53,910
well then within a few seconds the

961
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:56,660
temperature started rising right away

962
00:35:53,910 --> 00:35:59,549
and if you look at the processes of the

963
00:35:56,660 --> 00:36:01,920
CPU or CPU is where you utilize all four

964
00:35:59,550 --> 00:36:03,030
cores and then and then the process if

965
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:05,940
you look at the processes the web

966
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:07,920
content over there with PID three seven

967
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:10,890
one nine it's taking ninety seven point

968
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:12,390
five percent of CPU which you know if

969
00:36:10,890 --> 00:36:14,490
you think about it that's not smart at

970
00:36:12,390 --> 00:36:16,290
them to do because it's easier to notice

971
00:36:14,490 --> 00:36:17,850
something like this as opposed to if

972
00:36:16,290 --> 00:36:20,130
they were only mining forty percent but

973
00:36:17,850 --> 00:36:22,259
would go long that would go long-term so

974
00:36:20,130 --> 00:36:23,670
that's what our concern is right now is

975
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:25,440
that they will get smarter because

976
00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:27,360
they're doing trial and failure right

977
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:30,090
now trial and error what time they'll

978
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:32,670
get smarter and then you know they will

979
00:36:30,090 --> 00:36:34,860
only blowed your CPU so that you know it

980
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:37,200
doesn't you know make a lot of noise you

981
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:38,820
know it doesn't lag so that it's it's

982
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:41,160
more of a chance for them to keep mining

983
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:44,670
for long term so so that's a real

984
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:46,770
concern so so crypto jacking on the

985
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:49,320
internet preliminary analysis now this

986
00:36:46,770 --> 00:36:51,930
is there's some complications and doing

987
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:54,660
this study that I will discuss basically

988
00:36:51,930 --> 00:36:56,460
we want to crawl the web looking for

989
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:58,890
unauthorized coin hide miners that was

990
00:36:56,460 --> 00:37:01,830
our goal how do we do this now you know

991
00:36:58,890 --> 00:37:04,170
looking mass crawling the the web with

992
00:37:01,830 --> 00:37:05,730
so many different kind of web sites and

993
00:37:04,170 --> 00:37:07,260
web domains that's not easy and we're

994
00:37:05,730 --> 00:37:08,880
not just trying to look at the URL or

995
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:11,100
something we're looking at the source

996
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:13,500
code at the web page to determine if

997
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:15,120
there's a if there's a coin hive or some

998
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:17,550
other kind of cryptocurrency mining

999
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:19,350
script on there if we do recognize the

1000
00:37:17,550 --> 00:37:21,330
presence of one which is not very easy

1001
00:37:19,350 --> 00:37:22,650
to do if even if you do that then we

1002
00:37:21,330 --> 00:37:25,980
have to make sure that it's not a

1003
00:37:22,650 --> 00:37:28,290
legitimate website which is asking for

1004
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:30,000
permission but it is actually cryptid

1005
00:37:28,290 --> 00:37:32,759
jacking so it's covertly mining so

1006
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:34,110
that's another another tricky part so so

1007
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:35,550
for crawling the web instead of writing

1008
00:37:34,110 --> 00:37:37,380
our own - right now we're there some

1009
00:37:35,550 --> 00:37:40,140
services already available like

1010
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:42,240
public.www is a service that lets you

1011
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:44,580
it's it's the search engine for source

1012
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:46,049
code of websites so that's exactly what

1013
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:48,299
we need we want to look at the source

1014
00:37:46,050 --> 00:37:49,920
code of websites to see if there's any

1015
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:51,569
embedded miners on there so that's one

1016
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:54,509
way to do it and then Nordy data

1017
00:37:51,569 --> 00:37:56,819
census aiyo they they provide similar

1018
00:37:54,509 --> 00:37:59,519
functionality so that's where we we

1019
00:37:56,819 --> 00:38:01,199
looked and so how do we determine the

1020
00:37:59,519 --> 00:38:04,169
unauthorized part that's very tricky

1021
00:38:01,199 --> 00:38:07,739
because and that's what slows down the

1022
00:38:04,170 --> 00:38:09,180
pace of this research because once you

1023
00:38:07,739 --> 00:38:11,190
identify there let's say so many

1024
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:13,430
webpages on the Internet are are

1025
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:16,079
deploying these crypto jackin a

1026
00:38:13,430 --> 00:38:17,819
cryptocurrency miners how do you

1027
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:20,039
determine that they are not asking for

1028
00:38:17,819 --> 00:38:23,130
permission without manually looking at

1029
00:38:20,039 --> 00:38:24,779
the webpage and and and seeing if they

1030
00:38:23,130 --> 00:38:26,880
if they some somewhere through the

1031
00:38:24,779 --> 00:38:28,729
notice saying that you know oh by the

1032
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:31,859
way if you're here we're mining you know

1033
00:38:28,729 --> 00:38:35,279
so so that's that makes it a manual

1034
00:38:31,859 --> 00:38:36,660
process which makes it slow so how do we

1035
00:38:35,279 --> 00:38:39,509
validate the results that's another big

1036
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:41,399
question some websites are now

1037
00:38:39,509 --> 00:38:43,199
unavailable so so when they were cached

1038
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:44,880
by these services that you know and they

1039
00:38:43,199 --> 00:38:46,259
gave us a list of which domains are

1040
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:48,779
having the you know have employed these

1041
00:38:46,259 --> 00:38:50,880
scripts now the websites are down and

1042
00:38:48,779 --> 00:38:53,579
unavailable because these tend to be you

1043
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:54,869
know shady web sites in the first place

1044
00:38:53,579 --> 00:38:56,549
and now they're unavailable so you know

1045
00:38:54,869 --> 00:38:58,049
and then some web sites have not clean

1046
00:38:56,549 --> 00:39:00,150
the source code so now if you go if you

1047
00:38:58,049 --> 00:39:01,559
go there they're the source code doesn't

1048
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:03,059
really show any scripts so maybe they

1049
00:39:01,559 --> 00:39:04,469
were unwillingly participating in this

1050
00:39:03,059 --> 00:39:07,079
cryptid jacking and so they have now

1051
00:39:04,469 --> 00:39:09,029
removed removed the mining scripts so

1052
00:39:07,079 --> 00:39:12,119
another big question is how do we get

1053
00:39:09,029 --> 00:39:14,940
around code obfuscation so an example of

1054
00:39:12,119 --> 00:39:16,920
code obfuscation is is this aware so

1055
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:19,529
this is this was the continuation it's

1056
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:21,809
an excerpt from the from the HTML of the

1057
00:39:19,529 --> 00:39:24,029
of the web page and if you look at that

1058
00:39:21,809 --> 00:39:25,410
part right there that's that's an

1059
00:39:24,029 --> 00:39:26,880
obfuscation in the form of the

1060
00:39:25,410 --> 00:39:30,299
traditional you know Java JavaScript

1061
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:34,709
eval function so they packed the actual

1062
00:39:30,299 --> 00:39:36,630
coin hive mining script code into into

1063
00:39:34,709 --> 00:39:39,299
the the eval part right there so if you

1064
00:39:36,630 --> 00:39:42,209
look at it this was the office case in

1065
00:39:39,299 --> 00:39:44,279
part in the first box and this was what

1066
00:39:42,209 --> 00:39:45,749
was part of the although of the web site

1067
00:39:44,279 --> 00:39:48,690
now the problem is that if you're using

1068
00:39:45,749 --> 00:39:50,788
a crawler to crawl looking for let's say

1069
00:39:48,690 --> 00:39:52,349
coin hymenaeus in quotes

1070
00:39:50,789 --> 00:39:56,009
exactly as days or something like that

1071
00:39:52,349 --> 00:39:57,599
then because this that particular string

1072
00:39:56,009 --> 00:39:59,579
would not be found in the source code

1073
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:01,109
because of the obfuscation done here

1074
00:39:59,579 --> 00:40:03,809
then you're going to miss out on this

1075
00:40:01,109 --> 00:40:05,380
particular kind of office keishon in

1076
00:40:03,809 --> 00:40:09,970
your analysis so

1077
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:12,070
and that second box is what it if you D

1078
00:40:09,970 --> 00:40:13,870
office cated then that is what it

1079
00:40:12,070 --> 00:40:15,550
actually is it's the same ol thing that

1080
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:19,540
we've seen before it's just a coin hi

1081
00:40:15,550 --> 00:40:22,270
minor so that makes it more tricky all

1082
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:24,400
right now this you know I just wanted to

1083
00:40:22,270 --> 00:40:27,040
put this that's a typical example of a

1084
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:29,140
website mining I I censored it and then

1085
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:32,800
I censored it again for for the sake of

1086
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:34,870
our sanity you know so if you if you

1087
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:37,600
really look at this at the picture in my

1088
00:40:34,870 --> 00:40:39,520
file in my and on in my on my box it's

1089
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:42,880
like you know poopy girls censored

1090
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:44,410
underscore censored again you know so so

1091
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:46,300
that's a typical example of websites

1092
00:40:44,410 --> 00:40:46,960
that that that's doing this on the on

1093
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:48,760
the Internet

1094
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:50,530
and I'll discuss why streaming content

1095
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:54,280
is such a good platform for them to do

1096
00:40:50,530 --> 00:40:56,590
this but you know you know looking at

1097
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:58,690
this website you know forgive me for for

1098
00:40:56,590 --> 00:41:01,150
you know questioning the no doubt

1099
00:40:58,690 --> 00:41:03,280
pristine reputation of who P Girls but I

1100
00:41:01,150 --> 00:41:05,230
think they're crypto jackin their

1101
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:07,960
visitors you know because I didn't see

1102
00:41:05,230 --> 00:41:11,350
any notice about you know mining and you

1103
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:13,540
know so so we identified because of our

1104
00:41:11,350 --> 00:41:15,910
crawl that we did actually because of

1105
00:41:13,540 --> 00:41:18,070
this crawl the results we got from these

1106
00:41:15,910 --> 00:41:20,140
crawling services we wrote some Curie's

1107
00:41:18,070 --> 00:41:21,450
to see where the coin hive and coin imp

1108
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:23,859
and crypto loot and all of these

1109
00:41:21,450 --> 00:41:25,930
javascript based - or hidden we identify

1110
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:27,850
212 websites that's all that's not a lot

1111
00:41:25,930 --> 00:41:29,859
of a lot of websites compared to how

1112
00:41:27,850 --> 00:41:32,049
many there really are but like I said

1113
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:34,060
the process is slow and so that's why if

1114
00:41:32,050 --> 00:41:36,880
you've got any ideas and how we can you

1115
00:41:34,060 --> 00:41:39,009
know I you know I make it faster than I

1116
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:41,350
would love to hear but right now we've

1117
00:41:39,010 --> 00:41:44,440
identified 212 websites that are

1118
00:41:41,350 --> 00:41:46,089
involved in crypto jacking and we want

1119
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:47,230
to resolve these websites to categories

1120
00:41:46,090 --> 00:41:48,790
because you want to see what kind of

1121
00:41:47,230 --> 00:41:51,910
websites are doing this what's what's

1122
00:41:48,790 --> 00:41:53,380
the trend here right so early are these

1123
00:41:51,910 --> 00:41:55,060
pornography websites that are basically

1124
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:56,380
involved in this or are these malicious

1125
00:41:55,060 --> 00:41:57,880
websites they're also serving other

1126
00:41:56,380 --> 00:42:00,430
malicious content or they involved in

1127
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:02,500
piracy distributing pirated software and

1128
00:42:00,430 --> 00:42:03,790
games so but how do we do this we can't

1129
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:05,710
just look at each domain and try to

1130
00:42:03,790 --> 00:42:07,210
understand what's about so we use the 40

1131
00:42:05,710 --> 00:42:10,330
guard web categories for this forty

1132
00:42:07,210 --> 00:42:14,410
guard provides you a way to resolve a

1133
00:42:10,330 --> 00:42:17,259
domain name to to to what kind of

1134
00:42:14,410 --> 00:42:19,060
website it is because they do it so as a

1135
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:20,830
as a network administrator you

1136
00:42:19,060 --> 00:42:22,420
block people from going to let's say

1137
00:42:20,830 --> 00:42:24,310
pornographic websites on your network

1138
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:27,310
and so that's the purpose of it and so

1139
00:42:24,310 --> 00:42:29,350
so basically we use the forty guard to

1140
00:42:27,310 --> 00:42:31,600
resolve these two categories we wrote a

1141
00:42:29,350 --> 00:42:33,640
simple Python script it with any kind of

1142
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:36,160
web scraping you want to be nice if

1143
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:38,589
you're doing something like this and so

1144
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:40,540
you you make it sleep for an amount of

1145
00:42:38,590 --> 00:42:42,580
time so that you don't overwhelm their

1146
00:42:40,540 --> 00:42:43,810
server with a lot of requests and if

1147
00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:45,819
you're making a lot of requests in our

1148
00:42:43,810 --> 00:42:47,680
case we didn't make a lot of requests

1149
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:48,850
but if you're making a lot of quit then

1150
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:50,859
it just makes sense for you to just buy

1151
00:42:48,850 --> 00:42:52,150
the API so it just play nice if you're

1152
00:42:50,860 --> 00:42:54,850
if you're doing the web scraping and

1153
00:42:52,150 --> 00:42:56,440
then from 40 garde we got it resolved

1154
00:42:54,850 --> 00:42:58,150
two categories writing a simple script

1155
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:59,740
and we notice that you know before the

1156
00:42:58,150 --> 00:43:01,090
guard came up with these so according to

1157
00:42:59,740 --> 00:43:02,589
the websites we identified that were

1158
00:43:01,090 --> 00:43:04,600
involved encrypted jacking it came up

1159
00:43:02,590 --> 00:43:06,040
with these were the kind of websites

1160
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:07,779
that were that were involved in their

1161
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:09,640
malicious websites were number one so

1162
00:43:07,780 --> 00:43:11,680
they're already involved in other kinds

1163
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:13,480
of you know drive-by attacks and then

1164
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:14,830
streaming media and download is right up

1165
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:18,100
there and pornography is right up there

1166
00:43:14,830 --> 00:43:19,810
so so that's that's part of the analysis

1167
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:21,430
and then if you look at the geographic

1168
00:43:19,810 --> 00:43:23,590
distribution based on where the IP

1169
00:43:21,430 --> 00:43:26,109
addresses are lie they're there all over

1170
00:43:23,590 --> 00:43:29,980
Europe and some in us we noticed some in

1171
00:43:26,110 --> 00:43:31,780
Russia and and and so on again this

1172
00:43:29,980 --> 00:43:34,540
needs to be more we need more data

1173
00:43:31,780 --> 00:43:36,970
because the process is slow we need to

1174
00:43:34,540 --> 00:43:38,470
we need more data to get more results

1175
00:43:36,970 --> 00:43:39,669
about the statistics that we're

1176
00:43:38,470 --> 00:43:42,250
interested in knowing about these

1177
00:43:39,670 --> 00:43:43,840
cryptid jacking web sites because then

1178
00:43:42,250 --> 00:43:45,640
we can warn users about where not to go

1179
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:48,130
what not to do and that's and so on so

1180
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:50,470
so so some of the things that we saw

1181
00:43:48,130 --> 00:43:52,330
right away after this analysis was as we

1182
00:43:50,470 --> 00:43:53,859
expected crypt jacking web sites are

1183
00:43:52,330 --> 00:43:54,790
involved in other dubious practices you

1184
00:43:53,860 --> 00:43:56,890
know they're already distributing

1185
00:43:54,790 --> 00:43:58,360
malware or legal videos like you know

1186
00:43:56,890 --> 00:43:59,950
come watch Game of Thrones latest

1187
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:01,690
episode you know nasty quality and that

1188
00:43:59,950 --> 00:44:03,850
sort of thing and then they're also

1189
00:44:01,690 --> 00:44:06,250
distributed malware and and these things

1190
00:44:03,850 --> 00:44:08,380
now streaming media websites make them

1191
00:44:06,250 --> 00:44:09,700
ideal for cryptocurrency mining and I

1192
00:44:08,380 --> 00:44:12,010
don't mean things like Netflix or

1193
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:13,569
YouTube I mean more of like where can i

1194
00:44:12,010 --> 00:44:15,940
watch Game of Thrones or something like

1195
00:44:13,570 --> 00:44:18,040
that online for free we're gonna watch

1196
00:44:15,940 --> 00:44:19,810
free pornographic content in HD quality

1197
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:22,660
if someone is showing you freak

1198
00:44:19,810 --> 00:44:24,340
pornographic content in 4k quality you

1199
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:27,250
need to get really suspicious about that

1200
00:44:24,340 --> 00:44:28,450
website and and so streaming media

1201
00:44:27,250 --> 00:44:31,750
websites provide a good opportunity

1202
00:44:28,450 --> 00:44:32,470
because when the when the visitors visit

1203
00:44:31,750 --> 00:44:34,720
there

1204
00:44:32,470 --> 00:44:36,459
they they stayed there for a long period

1205
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:39,879
of time while they're watching the video

1206
00:44:36,460 --> 00:44:42,430
and and all that time gives more money

1207
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:44,050
to the crypto jackin people because you

1208
00:44:42,430 --> 00:44:47,890
know you're equipped in Jackie for them

1209
00:44:44,050 --> 00:44:49,330
in the background so so and and if your

1210
00:44:47,890 --> 00:44:51,129
fans go off or something you're going to

1211
00:44:49,330 --> 00:44:53,710
think that oh it's because of the HD

1212
00:44:51,130 --> 00:44:55,750
quality video maybe so so yeah that they

1213
00:44:53,710 --> 00:44:58,750
provide a good opportunity so you it so

1214
00:44:55,750 --> 00:45:02,109
users need to be really wary of of going

1215
00:44:58,750 --> 00:45:06,130
to these these streaming media websites

1216
00:45:02,109 --> 00:45:07,810
that serve illegal content so with that

1217
00:45:06,130 --> 00:45:10,510
moving on to IOC crypto jackin real

1218
00:45:07,810 --> 00:45:12,040
quick why do why I would see Krypton

1219
00:45:10,510 --> 00:45:15,369
jackin well the real question is not why

1220
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:18,190
it's why not okay so there's there's

1221
00:45:15,369 --> 00:45:19,690
only two relevant factors here for that

1222
00:45:18,190 --> 00:45:22,450
they will consider as cyber criminals

1223
00:45:19,690 --> 00:45:24,820
before IOT crypto jacking one of them is

1224
00:45:22,450 --> 00:45:27,759
gaining initial entry is it is it

1225
00:45:24,820 --> 00:45:29,530
difficult to get in so IOT devices we

1226
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:31,570
just had another talk on IIT devices or

1227
00:45:29,530 --> 00:45:32,770
earlier today which you know as devices

1228
00:45:31,570 --> 00:45:33,880
are more vulnerable they don't have the

1229
00:45:32,770 --> 00:45:35,140
same kind of protection that your

1230
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:36,849
average computer does in terms of

1231
00:45:35,140 --> 00:45:39,129
antivirus solutions and intrusion

1232
00:45:36,849 --> 00:45:40,300
detection systems and so on so there you

1233
00:45:39,130 --> 00:45:42,670
could argue that they're more vulnerable

1234
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:44,170
plus people let the defaults on their

1235
00:45:42,670 --> 00:45:46,780
we've seen the case of moriah botnet and

1236
00:45:44,170 --> 00:45:48,310
whatnot so so we know that they can be

1237
00:45:46,780 --> 00:45:49,720
more vulnerable and computer systems the

1238
00:45:48,310 --> 00:45:52,119
second thing that they're concerned

1239
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:54,609
about is will it make me money and if

1240
00:45:52,119 --> 00:45:55,540
it's worth it they will do it so what's

1241
00:45:54,609 --> 00:45:58,000
the profit potential

1242
00:45:55,540 --> 00:46:01,779
so do IOT devices today have enough

1243
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:03,580
computation power well that's that's a

1244
00:46:01,780 --> 00:46:06,490
very difficult question to answer just

1245
00:46:03,580 --> 00:46:08,470
because of how different IOT devices can

1246
00:46:06,490 --> 00:46:10,149
be from each other so you know there's

1247
00:46:08,470 --> 00:46:11,740
all kinds of variations for what kind of

1248
00:46:10,150 --> 00:46:13,300
processors they have what we're talking

1249
00:46:11,740 --> 00:46:15,220
about so that's that's the difficult

1250
00:46:13,300 --> 00:46:17,290
question to answer but will will attempt

1251
00:46:15,220 --> 00:46:18,939
it so so so do this as part of the

1252
00:46:17,290 --> 00:46:21,160
preliminary analysis we just took a look

1253
00:46:18,940 --> 00:46:23,589
around the room and whatever IOT device

1254
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:25,750
was available so for for for for

1255
00:46:23,589 --> 00:46:27,520
reference purposes I put in an average

1256
00:46:25,750 --> 00:46:31,750
users i7 processor up there that gives

1257
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:34,450
you a hash rate of 150 on the coin hive

1258
00:46:31,750 --> 00:46:35,770
comm if you go and test what the hash

1259
00:46:34,450 --> 00:46:38,169
rate your computer can produce then

1260
00:46:35,770 --> 00:46:40,359
that's what it gave us as so that's used

1261
00:46:38,170 --> 00:46:42,339
that as a reference point then on the

1262
00:46:40,359 --> 00:46:45,470
Amazon firestick TV that I had it gave

1263
00:46:42,339 --> 00:46:47,270
me a hash rate of 5 on my phone

1264
00:46:45,470 --> 00:46:50,089
you know galaxy s 9 I had a hash rate of

1265
00:46:47,270 --> 00:46:52,730
25 so that that's not that bad and then

1266
00:46:50,089 --> 00:46:54,890
on my Galaxy gear s3 SmartWatch it's

1267
00:46:52,730 --> 00:46:57,770
point 4 and that's what the what the

1268
00:46:54,890 --> 00:46:59,569
what the snapshot is from so the and

1269
00:46:57,770 --> 00:47:01,700
then we're not even considering those

1270
00:46:59,569 --> 00:47:03,859
the routers that have good processors

1271
00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:06,109
we're not even considering the cameras

1272
00:47:03,859 --> 00:47:07,880
that have good processors and then we're

1273
00:47:06,109 --> 00:47:11,000
not considering a lot of other IOT

1274
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:12,800
devices where so I think the answer to

1275
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:15,140
this is that it definitely is worth it

1276
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:16,609
for them if they can get into the right

1277
00:47:15,140 --> 00:47:18,410
kind of devices and they'll find a way

1278
00:47:16,609 --> 00:47:21,348
into those devices one or the other so

1279
00:47:18,410 --> 00:47:23,240
what we need to do is proactively start

1280
00:47:21,349 --> 00:47:24,680
protecting our IOT devices better

1281
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:29,629
because crypto jacking is going to hit

1282
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:31,549
them pretty soon so so and and and how

1283
00:47:29,630 --> 00:47:32,810
much money can they make now this again

1284
00:47:31,550 --> 00:47:34,430
is a very difficult question to answer

1285
00:47:32,810 --> 00:47:36,619
not only because of how much how much

1286
00:47:34,430 --> 00:47:39,740
there's variations and processing power

1287
00:47:36,619 --> 00:47:42,280
of IOT devices but also because the

1288
00:47:39,740 --> 00:47:46,040
valuation for crypto currency changes

1289
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:48,470
violently over time so this is just you

1290
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:50,690
know so with the evaluation of Manero

1291
00:47:48,470 --> 00:47:52,430
you know it stayed flat you know for

1292
00:47:50,690 --> 00:47:54,410
many years and then it shot up of course

1293
00:47:52,430 --> 00:47:56,839
with Bitcoin and then it started falling

1294
00:47:54,410 --> 00:47:58,790
down again as Bitcoin kind of dope down

1295
00:47:56,839 --> 00:48:03,230
and then right now it's about it's about

1296
00:47:58,790 --> 00:48:06,079
$100 or so a little over $100 and and so

1297
00:48:03,230 --> 00:48:07,880
the real concern right now for us to

1298
00:48:06,079 --> 00:48:09,710
think about for the future in terms of

1299
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:11,420
crypto jacking is cleverer crypto

1300
00:48:09,710 --> 00:48:12,980
jacking attacks not the ones that are

1301
00:48:11,420 --> 00:48:14,869
using hundred percent of your CPU so

1302
00:48:12,980 --> 00:48:16,730
they you can train your users trying to

1303
00:48:14,869 --> 00:48:18,829
try to see if your if your computer's

1304
00:48:16,730 --> 00:48:21,560
lagging and you know making the the the

1305
00:48:18,829 --> 00:48:23,060
CPU fan is making a lot of noise that's

1306
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:24,710
not that's not a real concern the

1307
00:48:23,060 --> 00:48:28,759
cleverer ones are going to stay there

1308
00:48:24,710 --> 00:48:31,579
for a long term mining only using 40 30%

1309
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:33,920
of your CPU and go undetected and then

1310
00:48:31,579 --> 00:48:35,329
you know improve so you know and then

1311
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:37,190
improve the tack vector just like any

1312
00:48:35,329 --> 00:48:38,869
other thread malware you know and like

1313
00:48:37,190 --> 00:48:40,160
any other malware like ransomware

1314
00:48:38,869 --> 00:48:42,770
whatever they'll improve the attack

1315
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:44,450
vectors and then they'll do stealthy

1316
00:48:42,770 --> 00:48:46,609
mining it was using only part of the CPU

1317
00:48:44,450 --> 00:48:48,649
and then we can expect to see Google

1318
00:48:46,609 --> 00:48:50,720
Play and App Store apps that mine in the

1319
00:48:48,650 --> 00:48:54,920
background so doing crypto jacking or

1320
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:57,109
their because you know the the process

1321
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:58,609
of vetting these apps you know there's

1322
00:48:57,109 --> 00:48:59,060
this there's a lot to be desired there

1323
00:48:58,609 --> 00:49:01,130
and

1324
00:48:59,060 --> 00:49:03,020
and so they will make their way in and

1325
00:49:01,130 --> 00:49:05,090
when they make your cpu hot while you're

1326
00:49:03,020 --> 00:49:06,380
playing a game on your phone you're

1327
00:49:05,090 --> 00:49:08,210
going to think that it's probably

1328
00:49:06,380 --> 00:49:10,220
because of you know shitty programming

1329
00:49:08,210 --> 00:49:12,380
in the game but could be mining in the

1330
00:49:10,220 --> 00:49:13,970
background and with with with the latest

1331
00:49:12,380 --> 00:49:17,240
smartphones it makes sense for them to

1332
00:49:13,970 --> 00:49:18,799
do that so so we're definitely concerned

1333
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:21,140
about that now protection against crypto

1334
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:22,880
jacking is is the standard these are the

1335
00:49:21,140 --> 00:49:24,500
standard things that people can do that

1336
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:25,700
we can tell people to do you know update

1337
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:27,740
your computer systems you know use

1338
00:49:25,700 --> 00:49:30,830
antivirus solutions actually while

1339
00:49:27,740 --> 00:49:32,359
making this presentation the this power

1340
00:49:30,830 --> 00:49:34,340
these PowerPoint slides were deleted

1341
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:36,500
twice by my antivirus solution because I

1342
00:49:34,340 --> 00:49:38,690
put the JavaScript code in there and so

1343
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:40,990
that's good that the the latest

1344
00:49:38,690 --> 00:49:44,660
antivirus solutions they're detecting

1345
00:49:40,990 --> 00:49:46,310
those lines of code as malware which is

1346
00:49:44,660 --> 00:49:47,930
basically and then said it's Java you

1347
00:49:46,310 --> 00:49:49,340
know Jaya start minor routine so you

1348
00:49:47,930 --> 00:49:52,250
know deleted my files had to recover

1349
00:49:49,340 --> 00:49:54,830
them but you know so antivirus solutions

1350
00:49:52,250 --> 00:49:56,780
are recognizing them and then we don't

1351
00:49:54,830 --> 00:49:58,970
despair user awareness it's not easier

1352
00:49:56,780 --> 00:50:00,680
on you know explaining cryptid jacking

1353
00:49:58,970 --> 00:50:02,120
to the average user monitoring system

1354
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:04,549
resources your average user wouldn't do

1355
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:06,109
this but you know it's a good way to

1356
00:50:04,550 --> 00:50:07,730
look at what's going on in your computer

1357
00:50:06,110 --> 00:50:09,740
and then install browser extension that

1358
00:50:07,730 --> 00:50:11,240
specifically block mining scripts if you

1359
00:50:09,740 --> 00:50:12,649
want to go the next level then use no

1360
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:14,359
script now nothing works on the internet

1361
00:50:12,650 --> 00:50:15,740
and anymore but at least they can't

1362
00:50:14,360 --> 00:50:18,830
execute JavaScript on your computer

1363
00:50:15,740 --> 00:50:21,169
right so so that's good alright so in

1364
00:50:18,830 --> 00:50:24,350
conclusion you know ransomware versus

1365
00:50:21,170 --> 00:50:25,820
cryptid jacking well you know they're

1366
00:50:24,350 --> 00:50:27,920
they're both here to stay

1367
00:50:25,820 --> 00:50:29,960
there ransomware is not going anywhere

1368
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:32,690
right now at least they're both they're

1369
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:34,490
both here to say ransomware is more

1370
00:50:32,690 --> 00:50:36,350
intricate in terms of the crypto API

1371
00:50:34,490 --> 00:50:37,850
function all the key management I was

1372
00:50:36,350 --> 00:50:41,150
talking about earlier so it makes it a

1373
00:50:37,850 --> 00:50:42,470
little harder to do that but cryptid

1374
00:50:41,150 --> 00:50:43,730
jacking on the other hand is relatively

1375
00:50:42,470 --> 00:50:46,490
straightforward once you make your way

1376
00:50:43,730 --> 00:50:48,050
in just start mining right no ransom

1377
00:50:46,490 --> 00:50:49,370
guarantees after infection the user

1378
00:50:48,050 --> 00:50:50,930
could just format their computer and

1379
00:50:49,370 --> 00:50:52,759
start from from new they don't care

1380
00:50:50,930 --> 00:50:55,430
about losing their files but crypto

1381
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:56,780
jacking a cryptic rip you did some of

1382
00:50:55,430 --> 00:50:58,279
the currency that you've generated some

1383
00:50:56,780 --> 00:51:00,620
value that you've generated it's not

1384
00:50:58,280 --> 00:51:02,840
going anywhere so you know ransomware is

1385
00:51:00,620 --> 00:51:04,970
known to the average user it's been many

1386
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:05,960
years it's a known threat people are

1387
00:51:04,970 --> 00:51:08,660
aware about it

1388
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:11,270
cryptid jacking is still very new noisy

1389
00:51:08,660 --> 00:51:11,930
ransom notes as opposed to court long

1390
00:51:11,270 --> 00:51:14,509
term mind

1391
00:51:11,930 --> 00:51:16,190
and then ransomware is always dependent

1392
00:51:14,509 --> 00:51:17,749
so most of the ransomware that we see

1393
00:51:16,190 --> 00:51:19,369
they either work for you know the mostly

1394
00:51:17,749 --> 00:51:21,769
they work for Windows but then some go

1395
00:51:19,369 --> 00:51:23,660
for Apple and then but but crypto

1396
00:51:21,769 --> 00:51:25,999
jacking especially the one on the web

1397
00:51:23,660 --> 00:51:27,140
doesn't matter what what as long as

1398
00:51:25,999 --> 00:51:29,569
you've got a browser doesn't matter what

1399
00:51:27,140 --> 00:51:31,129
kind of device you're coming from or if

1400
00:51:29,569 --> 00:51:33,769
it's a apple or Windows computer you

1401
00:51:31,130 --> 00:51:35,269
still are crypto jacking so so that's

1402
00:51:33,769 --> 00:51:37,038
that's another big difference and with

1403
00:51:35,269 --> 00:51:38,660
that you know what I present today is

1404
00:51:37,039 --> 00:51:40,400
it's part of what I'm working on and

1405
00:51:38,660 --> 00:51:42,920
part of what I'm doing but if you've got

1406
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:45,049
an idea for how to improve upon some of

1407
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:47,690
these results or how to make the

1408
00:51:45,049 --> 00:51:50,569
processes more efficient and faster you

1409
00:51:47,690 --> 00:51:53,089
know I would be I would be glad to hear

1410
00:51:50,569 --> 00:51:54,619
those ideas and with that you know thank

1411
00:51:53,089 --> 00:51:55,390
you very much and we conclude the

1412
00:51:54,619 --> 00:52:03,770
presentation

1413
00:51:55,390 --> 00:52:03,770
[Applause]
