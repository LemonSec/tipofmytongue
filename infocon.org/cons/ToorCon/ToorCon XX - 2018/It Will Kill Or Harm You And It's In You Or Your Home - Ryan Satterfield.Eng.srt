1
00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:05,619
just to keep you awake we wanted to give

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:08,590
you a very light very simple topic

3
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:13,150
something you would see like on HGTV on

4
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:16,750
those lines it will kill or harm you and

5
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:19,210
it's in you that you right there it's in

6
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:21,880
you don't worry got it we got an off

7
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:23,560
switch it's in you or your home with

8
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:31,479
Ryan Satterfield give Ryan a warm

9
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:34,870
welcome because he's dangerous and that

10
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:36,160
assets could kill you but I'm not HGTV

11
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:37,209
that would be cool even though that's

12
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:41,919
sort of sucky Channel

13
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:46,030
okay so today I'm talking about what

14
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:48,550
they just said and one of the issues I'm

15
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:51,160
discussing is concerning because it's

16
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:53,769
capable of killing more people than

17
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:56,769
several mass shootings combined by a

18
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:59,559
push of a button this is factual and

19
00:00:56,770 --> 00:01:01,239
based off a situation I was in and I

20
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:03,459
hate it and no I don't have slides

21
00:01:01,239 --> 00:01:05,679
because I didn't feel like making them

22
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:09,520
because I was working on trying to make

23
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:13,090
this great I'm hoping that by talk about

24
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:16,570
these issues today people want seek

25
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:19,140
action research more and protect against

26
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:22,089
these issues when developing systems and

27
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:25,210
fix these issues to prevent travesties

28
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:25,780
if they are deployed now what am I

29
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:28,479
talking about

30
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:30,970
I mean what heck am i up here right I'm

31
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:35,170
talking about how easy it is to hack or

32
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:37,750
access electric grids devices in your

33
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:41,110
chest like medical devices and light

34
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:43,770
bulbs that can literally explode things

35
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:46,149
that are connected to the Internet so

36
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:46,630
why am i qualified to talk about any of

37
00:01:46,149 --> 00:01:48,610
this

38
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:52,420
anyone could talk about anything right

39
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:54,460
well I've legally hacked threat modeled

40
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:57,640
or accessed the majority of what I'm

41
00:01:54,460 --> 00:02:01,809
discussing here today including the

42
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:05,380
device that was in my chest which I am

43
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:07,509
going to be discussing and I'm running a

44
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:10,989
conference only accepting talks that

45
00:02:07,509 --> 00:02:13,590
harm kill or assault the user excluding

46
00:02:10,989 --> 00:02:17,459
monetary damage called critical con

47
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:19,319
and we're accepting talks and I'm also a

48
00:02:17,459 --> 00:02:23,760
member of the Calvary so now there are

49
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:26,760
no zero days that aren't already public

50
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:29,010
and public on I mean when I say public I

51
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:30,569
mean the hacker community probably

52
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:36,120
doesn't know but the medical community

53
00:02:30,569 --> 00:02:40,640
does know so it's probably new to you so

54
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:43,050
a while back I'm I just want to know how

55
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:46,170
safe is the world's critical

56
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:49,980
infrastructure small and unfortunately

57
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:52,290
in under 60 seconds I found a link into

58
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:54,988
an airports infrastructure and this is a

59
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:59,569
scattered system but I find that very

60
00:02:54,989 --> 00:03:04,080
interesting and so I kept looking and

61
00:02:59,569 --> 00:03:09,209
what I found was equally fascinating

62
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:10,380
terrifying and oh no report this i'll be

63
00:03:09,209 --> 00:03:12,890
killed because that's how this

64
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:19,560
government handles these types of issues

65
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:21,208
so I asked I accessed legally another

66
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:24,720
country's electric grid

67
00:03:21,209 --> 00:03:26,519
I say access to not hacked to

68
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:30,180
distinguish the difference of being able

69
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:32,370
to get administrator powers over an

70
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:34,829
electric grid for a large swath of a

71
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:37,319
country by simply using dual cache of

72
00:03:34,829 --> 00:03:40,140
all things come on crying out loud that

73
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:43,319
means that and but doing that it gave me

74
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:47,630
their admin side and ability shut down

75
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:51,358
power for large person in the country

76
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:53,519
what I did was not hack in my opinion

77
00:03:51,359 --> 00:03:58,319
and not buy most of our opinions and

78
00:03:53,519 --> 00:04:00,870
that is troubling that the the that's

79
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:04,589
troubling now since I was on Google's

80
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:06,780
property and not their property the

81
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:08,400
entity they'll be trouble was Google not

82
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:11,489
meet us viewing the thing that Google

83
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:16,560
took it's very nuanced but that's how la

84
00:04:11,489 --> 00:04:20,910
is so the amount of data you could

85
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:24,510
access at a time has now dropped by half

86
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:26,000
a billion search results because I works

87
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:28,820
with Google and

88
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:32,210
law enforcement to on this issue and

89
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:34,400
I'll expand further on that now back to

90
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:36,590
electric grid the am inside was like

91
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:38,000
looking at the 1990s seriously like

92
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:40,099
flashback mode

93
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,410
maybe if we brought up a layer of wine

94
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:43,700
from the 1999 it look like that but

95
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:47,540
flowin probably looked better

96
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:49,490
hey add the site head letter scrolling

97
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:52,070
on top of the page telling you where you

98
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:54,020
were and below had nice little squares

99
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:56,450
of the names of areas that covered a

100
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:58,520
very wide area of the population

101
00:04:56,450 --> 00:05:00,620
followed by a nice little button that

102
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:04,820
said shut down for each one in the name

103
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:07,640
of the area cities and everything those

104
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:09,620
are lovely and for an adman that sounds

105
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:12,200
nice if you're an administrator you want

106
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:14,000
things to be straightforward but whoever

107
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:17,630
did this didn't think about their threat

108
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:20,150
model the threat was every hacker in the

109
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:22,120
world and their security to deal with

110
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:24,859
all those hackers was to kill them

111
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:27,530
literally kill them they're their threat

112
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:29,480
model was only only worked for the

113
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:33,229
hackers within their country and the

114
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:35,570
promise of death based on the hackers in

115
00:05:33,229 --> 00:05:37,520
that country and what I know I have to

116
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:39,919
say that policy is probably working very

117
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:43,549
well and its policies on all government

118
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:45,080
websites of said country because none of

119
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:47,720
those hackers in that country

120
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:50,300
they aren't protecting constat and they

121
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:55,700
aren't talking about that's these type

122
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:58,700
of issues now hackers from that country

123
00:05:55,700 --> 00:06:02,719
are talking about more trivial issues

124
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:04,280
that don't bother their governments but

125
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,560
what I say to the governments of the

126
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:08,150
world is you need to be bothered a

127
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:12,860
little of something endangers your

128
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:14,810
populations freakin life so so what if

129
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:17,479
we find it if we tell you you need to

130
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:21,350
fix it because someone else can come

131
00:06:17,479 --> 00:06:22,419
along and kill everyone if the issue was

132
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:26,360
you'll be killed

133
00:06:22,419 --> 00:06:30,740
so stop threatening and kill us and try

134
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:32,720
to protect your people now how are I

135
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:34,610
told you that this country had it in

136
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,710
their fine print they even put in their

137
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:38,090
headers they put the tape took the time

138
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:40,128
to put it in their headers if they'll

139
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:41,839
kill you rather than fix

140
00:06:40,129 --> 00:06:46,189
then try and fix their issues that's

141
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:51,669
just lovely um so it wasn't incentivized

142
00:06:46,189 --> 00:06:54,559
to contact this country at all rather I

143
00:06:51,669 --> 00:06:56,539
sort of I sort of think being alive is

144
00:06:54,559 --> 00:06:59,809
interesting I've been I've been

145
00:06:56,539 --> 00:07:02,149
temporarily dead a few times that was

146
00:06:59,809 --> 00:07:04,429
really boring so being a wife is too

147
00:07:02,149 --> 00:07:06,169
interesting to try to contact the

148
00:07:04,429 --> 00:07:09,888
country it's gonna kill me

149
00:07:06,169 --> 00:07:12,619
so I contacted with all that combined I

150
00:07:09,889 --> 00:07:14,059
talked to the FBI about it since I was i

151
00:07:12,619 --> 00:07:19,399
working with them on another scatter

152
00:07:14,059 --> 00:07:21,379
issue so it took nope if she contacts

153
00:07:19,399 --> 00:07:23,179
our law enforcement you think they could

154
00:07:21,379 --> 00:07:26,029
talk to the other country get fixed real

155
00:07:23,179 --> 00:07:30,138
quick right well since this is a close

156
00:07:26,029 --> 00:07:32,149
ally it took six months to fix this

157
00:07:30,139 --> 00:07:36,409
issue and during that time anyone could

158
00:07:32,149 --> 00:07:38,509
access their grid but so got fixed

159
00:07:36,409 --> 00:07:42,110
that's the positive side some things

160
00:07:38,509 --> 00:07:44,659
never get fixed now

161
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:47,409
how is being able to shut down a large

162
00:07:44,659 --> 00:07:50,509
loss of power of a country a

163
00:07:47,409 --> 00:07:53,229
life-or-death scenario that's a good

164
00:07:50,509 --> 00:07:56,269
question I mean it has to be asked any

165
00:07:53,229 --> 00:07:59,050
former system to direct traffic was shut

166
00:07:56,269 --> 00:08:01,429
down which would lead to car accidents

167
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:03,979
further let's look at this country's an

168
00:08:01,429 --> 00:08:06,979
ability to have the majority of their

169
00:08:03,979 --> 00:08:08,959
hospitals have generators so shutting

170
00:08:06,979 --> 00:08:11,748
down their power for a long period of

171
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:14,569
time might result in death for those on

172
00:08:11,749 --> 00:08:16,399
the a life-support in certain areas even

173
00:08:14,569 --> 00:08:18,259
a short period of time is enough to

174
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:21,789
cause chaos at the hospitals not be able

175
00:08:18,259 --> 00:08:24,019
to triage properly resulting in death

176
00:08:21,789 --> 00:08:25,909
death in a grant and the click of a

177
00:08:24,019 --> 00:08:28,189
button is no longer a joke for the

178
00:08:25,909 --> 00:08:31,339
tabloids like it wasn't 1999 then for

179
00:08:28,189 --> 00:08:33,620
The Inquirer it's rather a real life if

180
00:08:31,339 --> 00:08:36,588
I got the paper run I'm sorry but it's

181
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:39,639
rather a real life issue now and we have

182
00:08:36,589 --> 00:08:43,440
to update our threat models due to this

183
00:08:39,639 --> 00:08:46,509
now how do researchers

184
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,509
[Music]

185
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:54,260
how do researchers find this information

186
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:56,420
well I'm the way I've got a lead on it

187
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:57,920
was a now-defunct site called strange

188
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:59,329
gotta love to help look at this

189
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:02,510
information and then I wrote my own

190
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:03,950
personal guide for information but I'm

191
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:07,880
not allowed to share the information

192
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:12,709
today unfortunately I'm pologize for

193
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:15,680
that because it's cata so it's critical

194
00:09:12,709 --> 00:09:17,859
infrastructure talked and told them to

195
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:21,589
discuss that part of it unfortunately

196
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:23,500
now if you run into issues like this be

197
00:09:21,589 --> 00:09:25,430
careful in how you report these issues

198
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:29,540
because they'd you break the law to

199
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:31,489
access these systems if so I went to law

200
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:33,920
enforcement nor do I encourage you to

201
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:37,010
break the law or anyone else in this

202
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:39,620
room or anyone on the watching us in

203
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:42,019
YouTube this is something I had to think

204
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:44,000
through and rationalize we print to our

205
00:09:42,019 --> 00:09:45,920
law enforcement and Plus senses are

206
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,010
handling another issue like a buck I

207
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:51,589
said I had an easy private contact and

208
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:55,040
getting things to the government is a

209
00:09:51,589 --> 00:09:57,350
blogger and a half without having

210
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:59,719
friends your points of contacts are you

211
00:09:57,350 --> 00:10:03,680
yourself having a point of contact if

212
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:05,959
you believe what you found is worth the

213
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:09,170
potential jail time even if you broke

214
00:10:05,959 --> 00:10:12,020
the law then make your decision and live

215
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:13,610
with it and simply doing threat modeling

216
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:16,579
from my point of view on how to live

217
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:18,920
your life but you ultimately decide how

218
00:10:16,579 --> 00:10:20,449
you should live your life no one else

219
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:23,810
can tell you how to do how to live your

220
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:25,790
life now I can say that instances like

221
00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:27,709
this coordination and cooperation with

222
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:29,899
law enforcement that is if you have the

223
00:10:27,709 --> 00:10:32,899
proper channels is more powerful and

224
00:10:29,899 --> 00:10:38,660
safely slow the issues and any blog post

225
00:10:32,899 --> 00:10:44,149
ever will be so now let's move on to I

226
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:46,490
call abnormal weaponry I had a device

227
00:10:44,149 --> 00:10:47,060
called a vagus nerve stimulator in my

228
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:49,310
chest

229
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:51,709
that's connect that was connected to my

230
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:52,239
brain you guys can see this wire right

231
00:10:51,709 --> 00:10:55,430
here

232
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:57,199
it's an RF transmitter that connects to

233
00:10:55,430 --> 00:11:00,179
my brain

234
00:10:57,199 --> 00:11:04,378
well I had that device removed a few

235
00:11:00,179 --> 00:11:06,329
months ago that device had some problems

236
00:11:04,379 --> 00:11:08,699
and but it wasn't in our connected and

237
00:11:06,329 --> 00:11:11,968
sense that most think IOT devices are

238
00:11:08,699 --> 00:11:14,909
nor are the newer models rather it was

239
00:11:11,969 --> 00:11:17,549
is only supposed to be accessible by a

240
00:11:14,909 --> 00:11:20,459
couple feet of the user and you can make

241
00:11:17,549 --> 00:11:22,949
the device send electricity to the brain

242
00:11:20,459 --> 00:11:26,848
when you aren't expecting it if there's

243
00:11:22,949 --> 00:11:28,919
enough magnet magnetic energy it took a

244
00:11:26,849 --> 00:11:31,979
fit the gas magnet didn't activate it

245
00:11:28,919 --> 00:11:34,399
and just reboot reboot reboot no

246
00:11:31,979 --> 00:11:39,929
authentication in place just magnets

247
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:42,119
which is pretty weak but that's that's

248
00:11:39,929 --> 00:11:46,079
the major issue because did they have it

249
00:11:42,119 --> 00:11:48,029
as a little problem so this device is

250
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:50,179
actually in my opinion pretty secure but

251
00:11:48,029 --> 00:11:53,279
let's go on to the other problems in it

252
00:11:50,179 --> 00:11:54,929
it's accessible via radio frequencies

253
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:58,109
and they have something called a wand

254
00:11:54,929 --> 00:12:00,869
updates the software deactivates it

255
00:11:58,109 --> 00:12:03,259
changed the voltages etc which requires

256
00:12:00,869 --> 00:12:06,659
access and near your chest

257
00:12:03,259 --> 00:12:09,149
if you're using their system so sure if

258
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:11,879
you're if you're within a couple of feet

259
00:12:09,149 --> 00:12:15,059
of someone it sons chest you could turn

260
00:12:11,879 --> 00:12:16,649
the device off and sending them their

261
00:12:15,059 --> 00:12:19,289
desert electricity through the vagal

262
00:12:16,649 --> 00:12:21,989
nerve more often they're supposed to get

263
00:12:19,289 --> 00:12:23,968
but that's extremely close unless you're

264
00:12:21,989 --> 00:12:26,339
doing something really crazy that you

265
00:12:23,969 --> 00:12:28,529
can send it further away and for hackers

266
00:12:26,339 --> 00:12:31,889
were crazy we probably could find a way

267
00:12:28,529 --> 00:12:35,069
to do that this device can send more

268
00:12:31,889 --> 00:12:36,539
electricity than is meant and to and I

269
00:12:35,069 --> 00:12:39,089
know that but not hacking it rather

270
00:12:36,539 --> 00:12:42,449
strong commands appear to have gotten

271
00:12:39,089 --> 00:12:45,059
overridden when my lovely insurance

272
00:12:42,449 --> 00:12:48,149
company which I do appreciate but I

273
00:12:45,059 --> 00:12:50,459
appreciate for this necessary placing my

274
00:12:48,149 --> 00:12:53,489
batteries in my chest

275
00:12:50,459 --> 00:12:55,319
wasn't worth paying for the device

276
00:12:53,489 --> 00:12:57,719
didn't know how to handle the unexpected

277
00:12:55,319 --> 00:12:59,608
amount of energy from the batteries

278
00:12:57,719 --> 00:13:02,789
which shows how well the company plans

279
00:12:59,609 --> 00:13:04,469
your unexpected input do then peppermint

280
00:13:02,789 --> 00:13:06,779
electricity the device seems to have

281
00:13:04,469 --> 00:13:08,639
potentially triggered some commands and

282
00:13:06,779 --> 00:13:10,990
the system that probably left over from

283
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:12,520
the bugging and took the company

284
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:15,370
extended period of time to figure out

285
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:17,230
how to fully shut it down since there

286
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:19,209
appear to no longer be a cap on how much

287
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:21,520
electricity we put into my brain every

288
00:13:19,209 --> 00:13:24,339
five minutes I stopped breathing every

289
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:27,100
five minutes when it was programmed to

290
00:13:24,339 --> 00:13:30,300
turn on if I didn't have a 50 Gauss

291
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:33,339
magnet taped to my chest

292
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:35,849
that is when battery replacement is very

293
00:13:33,339 --> 00:13:40,000
important when building devices and

294
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:41,770
because an battery and a long lasting

295
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,589
battery so those don't have to be

296
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:46,060
replaced because that's an important

297
00:13:44,589 --> 00:13:52,480
step to protect people

298
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:54,939
I can seize devices going crazy now you

299
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:56,680
need to have a system in place that if

300
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:58,480
it isn't life critical meaning you will

301
00:13:56,680 --> 00:14:01,660
die if it turns off to deactivate

302
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:03,430
something if it is left critical you

303
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:07,660
need a way to one the patient's far

304
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:09,849
before shutdown will occur and you need

305
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:11,230
to explicitly be clear with insurance

306
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:14,589
companies of the batteries will be

307
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:16,480
replaced number that a simple

308
00:14:14,589 --> 00:14:18,220
unauthorized access hack that's been

309
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:22,120
done to all the patients and doctors in

310
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:24,070
medical field for nearly 20 years is a

311
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:25,390
little frightening but not that

312
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:27,730
frightening because it would cost about

313
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:31,810
a million dollars to do it you need

314
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:35,500
about almost three Tesla the strength of

315
00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:37,329
three Tesla's to be able to fry this RF

316
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:39,910
transmitter coil because until recently

317
00:14:37,329 --> 00:14:42,569
they did not do shielding in this coil

318
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:46,209
and this coil is connected to my brain

319
00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:51,459
so if you fry the vagal nerve I'm just

320
00:14:46,209 --> 00:14:53,529
like this but still alive so you can

321
00:14:51,459 --> 00:14:55,239
really you can really kill you can

322
00:14:53,529 --> 00:14:59,470
really kill someone I'm finally messed

323
00:14:55,240 --> 00:15:01,120
them up this way now if all of this

324
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:02,740
comes aside I still think this is one

325
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:05,560
save as' devices out there

326
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:07,870
our former vice president I believe it

327
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:10,060
was Cheney had to have his pacemaker

328
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:12,970
modified to avoid attacks that would

329
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:14,829
have killed him one person wrote about

330
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:17,709
how they had to have a medical device

331
00:15:14,829 --> 00:15:19,510
put in them the has Wi-Fi and they now

332
00:15:17,709 --> 00:15:21,689
fear for their wife but they did because

333
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:24,200
it was the only thing to save their life

334
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:28,430
you know what stood out to me

335
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:30,380
was when they had installed the doctors

336
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:32,719
didn't have a section of the problems

337
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:35,450
cybersecurity wise which they should

338
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:38,150
have rather they only found out about

339
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:39,620
the issues afters in them and after is

340
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:42,140
installed and there's the thing they can

341
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:45,190
do about it unless have uninstalled and

342
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:49,760
then they died because they rely on the

343
00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:52,640
pacemaker now if a popular brand of

344
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:55,280
pacemaker was attacked five remote code

345
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:57,740
execution if it was make it potentially

346
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:59,600
have people dropping dead which we all

347
00:15:57,740 --> 00:16:02,510
know but it's unfortunate because it's

348
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:05,510
easier than that as hacker news notes

349
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:09,760
you can simply kill some patients and

350
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:09,760
hospitals through their infusion pump

351
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:18,610
which a certain Brandt is alt and the

352
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:20,990
certs which is an on the DHS muscles no

353
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:23,960
handles internet security issues and

354
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:28,120
they send out a warning about this pump

355
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:33,080
because people could be killed by it by

356
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:35,360
overdosing and other issues so that's

357
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:38,240
just lovely we need to think about what

358
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:39,950
we're building folks so don't fear

359
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,480
though some doctors are actually

360
00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:44,090
starting to care about protecting your

361
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:46,070
health from every angle but the most

362
00:16:44,090 --> 00:16:48,920
important part to them is being able to

363
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:51,440
save your life from an on internet

364
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:55,189
security threat or as they might say

365
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:58,430
cyber security threat both have to be

366
00:16:55,190 --> 00:16:59,870
adaptable hospitals have to be hospitals

367
00:16:58,430 --> 00:17:01,219
are very vulnerable because in ever

368
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:03,770
since of the word they have to be able

369
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:06,530
to do their job and every second counts

370
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:11,420
but they also need security

371
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:14,270
so someone remotely can't kill their

372
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:18,320
patients it's a delicate balance that

373
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:21,230
needs to be fixed and hopefully we can

374
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:24,829
hopefully some hospitals will start

375
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:27,740
working in unison with researchers to

376
00:17:24,829 --> 00:17:30,889
fix the devices while and or just get

377
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:33,490
them fixed from deployment and then they

378
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:34,730
can focus on what they need to focus on

379
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:38,929
so

380
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:42,049
I found it to be our duty to try educate

381
00:17:38,929 --> 00:17:48,740
others on what needs to be done now

382
00:17:42,049 --> 00:17:52,490
let's switch off to IOT devices mmm a

383
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:55,970
company hired me to hack an IOT device

384
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:59,720
I thought the crossed my mind was since

385
00:17:55,970 --> 00:18:02,179
this is sold widely to the masses what

386
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:05,720
twisted thing could some crazy hacker do

387
00:18:02,179 --> 00:18:08,240
with it well I thought it wouldn't

388
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:10,460
accept more voltage to the light bulb

389
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:13,520
and then the lipo was supposed to output

390
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:14,540
right right we wouldn't do that right no

391
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:16,850
no wrong

392
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:18,200
my co-author which I forgot to ask

393
00:18:16,850 --> 00:18:20,899
permission to say his name so I can't

394
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:23,900
say it my co-author and I ran the attack

395
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:25,760
as proposed within safe confines of

396
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:29,090
metal box and the glass shattered

397
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:31,520
everywhere from the light bulb light

398
00:18:29,090 --> 00:18:33,830
bulbs are by people's beds they're there

399
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:36,980
everywhere in your home those type of

400
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:41,899
attacks are not acceptable by any means

401
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:44,299
of imagination now if you're willing to

402
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:48,410
offer a location for more hazardous

403
00:18:44,299 --> 00:18:50,179
absurd testing things catching on fire

404
00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:53,450
inside let me know because there's some

405
00:18:50,179 --> 00:18:55,610
stuff I want to completely blow up to

406
00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:58,490
make or try blowed up to prove or

407
00:18:55,610 --> 00:19:02,689
disprove how safe it is to - and let

408
00:18:58,490 --> 00:19:04,419
everyone know my twitter handle from a

409
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:07,700
company is planning to do that - i

410
00:19:04,419 --> 00:19:13,370
underscore am underscore Ryan underscore

411
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:15,080
s so I did say in the description I was

412
00:19:13,370 --> 00:19:18,080
going to talk about a way to blind

413
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:23,720
people and make them vomit I'm going to

414
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:26,120
talk about that slightly because but I

415
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:28,929
can't I'm not going to see how since

416
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:28,928
it's not patched

417
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:38,090
there are certain frequencies people

418
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:40,760
consider to be brown notes but what if

419
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:44,480
you could modify those frequencies and

420
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:49,129
put coding them so you're sending code

421
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:50,080
over audio there's programs out there to

422
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:53,180
do that

423
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:55,280
now what happens if you change that

424
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:57,490
frequency to be pretty high so it's

425
00:19:55,280 --> 00:20:01,330
almost outside the human hearing range

426
00:19:57,490 --> 00:20:05,390
it's almost near Sonic

427
00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:08,210
ultrasonic ultrasonic well then I had

428
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:11,660
put myself as a guinea pig and I started

429
00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:13,610
going temporarily blind vomiting and had

430
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:18,380
a migraine for a day every single time I

431
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:22,699
did it you I was but something like that

432
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:26,270
that got broadcasted over say an ad on

433
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:30,290
the radio or got upload maliciously to a

434
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:32,960
popular podcast could be very dangerous

435
00:20:30,290 --> 00:20:35,240
to people driving I want talk more on

436
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:37,970
this issue but until there's a fix or

437
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:40,100
something I can't now I'm opening the

438
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:42,140
floor to any questions or criticism and

439
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:44,120
I really appreciate everyone being here

440
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:47,720
and if you want to submit any talks to

441
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:51,679
critical con please do so it's critical

442
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:55,509
con com any question
