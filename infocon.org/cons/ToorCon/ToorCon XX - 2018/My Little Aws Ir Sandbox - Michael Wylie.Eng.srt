1
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:13,410
all right next up we have my little AWS

2
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:20,580
I our sandbox by Michael Wiley please

3
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:33,780
welcome Michael thank you very much

4
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:36,030
I'm not getting the slides awesome okay

5
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:36,420
a couple mil your faces from ten minutes

6
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:40,379
ago

7
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:41,670
that's good thank you so about me again

8
00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:43,410
for those who weren't in here I'm the

9
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:45,120
director of cyber security services at

10
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:47,218
Richie made technology solutions

11
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,750
recently joined their team to help them

12
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:50,910
build up their information security best

13
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:54,930
practices and you a whole plethora of

14
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:58,468
cloud security cyber security GRC etc

15
00:00:54,930 --> 00:01:00,180
and so I built this talk because we've

16
00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:02,280
internally built our own little IR

17
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:03,629
sandboxes and and there's a lot involved

18
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:05,700
with that and so I'll kind of explain

19
00:01:03,629 --> 00:01:07,110
how we did it and what we do here but a

20
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:08,790
couple statistics I always like to start

21
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:11,640
my slides with what's the point of the

22
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:13,080
talk and so I think ninety two point

23
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:15,210
four percent of malware being delivered

24
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:17,340
via email is one of the key pieces of

25
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:19,619
why we we start building our sand boxes

26
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:21,390
out we get a lot of cases where there's

27
00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:22,680
different malware or phishing attempts

28
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:24,290
that come in and we needed something to

29
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:26,070
quickly test these things out

30
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:27,450
seventy-five percent of businesses hit

31
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:29,548
by ransomware we're running endpoint

32
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:32,670
protection so even with your EDR

33
00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:34,229
solution silence carbon black McAfee

34
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:36,479
whatever you have in your environment we

35
00:01:34,229 --> 00:01:38,908
still saw the need to be able to test

36
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:40,470
things that got past that and the

37
00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:43,619
average cost for ransomware instance was

38
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:45,149
133 K in 2017 obviously there was

39
00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:47,430
something with a lot more Atlanta that

40
00:01:45,149 --> 00:01:48,810
ended up spending 2.6 million dollars or

41
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:51,869
more in their incident response

42
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:54,000
situations there was the giant shipping

43
00:01:51,869 --> 00:01:55,500
companies that spent billions of dollars

44
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,850
and their ransomware incidence and then

45
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:58,320
there's a small businesses that probably

46
00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:00,419
spend a couple thousand dollars in those

47
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:02,520
cases but we're seeing a lot of money

48
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:03,869
around these malicious files and things

49
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:06,119
that get passed the endpoint protection

50
00:02:03,869 --> 00:02:07,950
and so it's always great to just double

51
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:09,690
check before you go ahead and open a a

52
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:11,220
Word document or PDF so in these

53
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:12,690
situations where there's something

54
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:13,950
suspicious going on we

55
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:16,290
an area that we could quickly and

56
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:18,480
expensively test this out and so if we

57
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:21,390
look at what's being delivered into

58
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:23,579
mailboxes we can see that Microsoft

59
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:25,980
Office documents and archives like zip

60
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:27,960
files make up a big portion of that and

61
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:29,100
then a lot of PDF files as well and

62
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,300
there's a couple different techniques

63
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:32,790
that that we're seeing that I don't have

64
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:35,520
time to go into detail on right now but

65
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:37,350
I talked some about this on Friday and

66
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:41,220
two more about how phishing attempts are

67
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:42,720
getting past different email gateways so

68
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:44,220
when we get some of these files or

69
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,859
whether it's fishing or whatever it is

70
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:47,880
it's a little malicious we wanted it to

71
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:49,950
be able to solve some of these problems

72
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:52,290
so we wanted a safe place to detonate

73
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:53,700
malware avoid spreading the worm to

74
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:55,109
other systems so if something got

75
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:58,200
infected we didn't want to go and spread

76
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:59,880
out we possibly examine email links and

77
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:01,560
their attachments so if we saw some type

78
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:02,970
of link and it looked legitimate but we

79
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:05,520
really want to investigate it without

80
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:07,140
detonating it on an endpoint to validate

81
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:09,720
documents for phishing attempts there's

82
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:12,059
a lot of scenarios that the Mail's look

83
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:14,130
legitimate and they they bypass security

84
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:15,660
gateways they bypass the end-user or

85
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:16,769
maybe there was something that was a

86
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:17,549
little fishy and that's why they want to

87
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:19,110
take a look at it

88
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:20,610
we want to learn about your enemy and

89
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:22,290
their tactics so even if you do see

90
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:24,360
something and it had grammatical errors

91
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:25,980
and there was pixelated graphics and

92
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:27,840
you're pretty Kavya it's pretty obvious

93
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:29,579
that it's not legitimate you still may

94
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,920
want to learn about the your enemy or

95
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:34,200
who's targeting you or maybe it's just a

96
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:36,359
mass distribution of this this malware

97
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:38,220
or a phishing attempt I'm going to look

98
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:41,070
at that and say well why did it get past

99
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:43,940
my email gateway why did it get past my

100
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:46,350
dns protection why did it get past my

101
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:47,910
inbox from my endpoint protection all

102
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:49,799
these tools and this layer defense that

103
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:51,570
I have it still got to the end user and

104
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:53,160
it's in their inbox so how can we adjust

105
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:55,170
our security to strategy and our

106
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:57,359
controls to better protect against this

107
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:59,609
next time because if Sally and HR got

108
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,780
this email we it's gonna come in next

109
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:01,950
time and someone else is gonna get it

110
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:03,450
and someone else is gonna get in someone

111
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:05,310
else gonna get it unless we do something

112
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:07,589
and I think that was a an old approach

113
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:08,940
of let's go look at the IP address or

114
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:10,650
the email address won't block it and be

115
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:12,239
done with it and so a lot of junior

116
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:14,400
people now I have to coach on this and

117
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:15,840
say that's an old strategy and there's a

118
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,700
lot of flaws with out it might block

119
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,440
them from sending another email but they

120
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:21,149
probably didn't send it to Sally in HR

121
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,530
wait for 24 hours then they're gonna

122
00:04:21,149 --> 00:04:25,710
send it to Bob and accounts receivable

123
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:26,190
and so on it's probably they send to

124
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:27,900
everyone

125
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:29,460
at the same time and they're gonna try

126
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:30,750
that technique again and someone else is

127
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:32,430
going to reuse their techniques it's

128
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:34,020
going to be an ongoing thing so you

129
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:34,980
can't just block an IP address or an

130
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:36,630
email address we have to go a little

131
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:39,200
further than that and look at the actual

132
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:41,190
technique tactic and procedure the TTP's

133
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:42,630
you might want to prove your cutie

134
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:44,340
controls as I said after you find out

135
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:46,440
why they're bypassing all your other

136
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:48,210
controls you may build security

137
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:49,410
awareness programs around it so when we

138
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:51,840
get new malware we're seeing new

139
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:53,370
techniques each month we may say here's

140
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,260
a new technique they're using so one

141
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:58,050
common one we're seeing in the mortgage

142
00:04:55,260 --> 00:05:01,200
industry the mortgage lenders is that

143
00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:03,330
they are there people are spoofing

144
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:04,620
escrow officers and if you've ever

145
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:06,330
bought a house or been involved with

146
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:08,970
that you can see the escrow officers are

147
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:10,409
very involved in the transaction and so

148
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:13,980
they're trying to spoof the escrow

149
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:15,630
officer with a DocuSign a signature and

150
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:17,610
that's the most popular tool out there

151
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:19,380
for these mortgage lenders so they say

152
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:20,790
click on this link or here's the the

153
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:22,770
secured document you have to click on

154
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:24,930
this ends up being a PDF and they say

155
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:27,240
for security reasons we've encrypted it

156
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:28,830
and put a password on it and so that

157
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:30,930
also bypasses the endpoint protection

158
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:33,840
and email gateways and other stuff

159
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:35,970
because it's a not only a encrypted or

160
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:37,289
compressed file it needs a password and

161
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:39,270
so then they'll put the password either

162
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:41,220
in plain text or they'll put it in an

163
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:43,289
image that the email gate we can't even

164
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:44,700
see that so they're bypassing a lot of

165
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:45,720
stuff in those cases so we may want to

166
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:47,729
build a security awareness program

167
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:50,310
around this or our own phishing campaign

168
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:52,140
around this and maybe you can go fish or

169
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:53,310
fish me or some other tool and you can

170
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:54,719
test your users to make sure that

171
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:56,880
they're actually doing what you you

172
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,410
recommend and then you could demonstrate

173
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:00,060
malicious activity so when you're trying

174
00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:02,100
to get executive buy-in you're trying to

175
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:03,600
sell something you know to the

176
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:05,060
executives and get them to pay for it

177
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,320
you can show them some of these

178
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:10,530
different techniques or how ransomware

179
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:11,790
works in a isolated environment that's

180
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:15,000
not going to impact the rest of your

181
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:16,919
users here and then so traditional

182
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,870
sandbox is you can go out there and I'm

183
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:20,159
not inventing a new sandbox at all by

184
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:21,540
any means I'm actually taking a lot of

185
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,680
pieces from many other security

186
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:24,870
professionals out there and kind of

187
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:26,880
blending it so there's hybrid analysis

188
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:29,070
there's malware which has been down for

189
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:30,390
I don't know how long but it's still up

190
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:32,490
there it was a good one when it was up

191
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:35,400
and cuckoo it's a little bit difficult

192
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:37,050
to set up you could use VMware virtual

193
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:38,580
box that's generally recommendation but

194
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:39,260
what we're seeing a lot of is that good

195
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:41,120
malware

196
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:44,120
especially targeted stuff with a PT's

197
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:45,650
they are bypassing a lot of these

198
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:47,540
malware or they're doing some security

199
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:50,179
checks to see are you running a virtual

200
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:51,470
environment and if you are they're not

201
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:53,120
going to detonate the malware so it

202
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:55,220
looks like it's legitimate then you go

203
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:57,200
run it on an actual bare-bones system

204
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:59,240
and it detonates because it's looking at

205
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:01,310
the whether it's the VMware a MAC

206
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:02,990
address or the NIC cards or VMware tools

207
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:05,150
it's doing a lot of different checks to

208
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:08,180
see if you're trying to reverse engineer

209
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:09,320
the malware Remnick sfrom sans and

210
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:11,660
there's a bunch of other traditional

211
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:13,219
ones out there but some of the concerns

212
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:14,180
that I had with with these sand boxes

213
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:16,040
when some of my team pitched the

214
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:17,900
different solutions was they're complex

215
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:19,130
to set up and configure cucu I spent

216
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:21,560
hours on and couldn't get it to work

217
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:23,450
properly the way I wanted it to somebody

218
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:27,200
else's tools published by nearest

219
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:29,930
community so virustotal hybrid analysis

220
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:31,310
if you upload a document there it is

221
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:32,960
available for the community and there's

222
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:34,940
a premium version you can pay for and I

223
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:36,500
think there's an opt-out there but other

224
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:38,240
tools that you may use as well as

225
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:40,550
directly going to some of these sites

226
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:42,380
you upload a document it's there for the

227
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:44,120
community to look at and to analyze and

228
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:45,800
those situations could you imagine a

229
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:47,570
proprietary document that looks fishy

230
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,830
and so you upload it and all of a sudden

231
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:50,900
you're leaking that out to the whole

232
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:53,180
world also some of these tools if you're

233
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:55,159
publishing a binary of the document now

234
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:56,930
the bad guys and the malware creators

235
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:58,610
know that the signatures in mouth and

236
00:07:56,930 --> 00:08:00,590
virustotal and they need to now morph it

237
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:02,420
and adjust it so it can continue to work

238
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:03,979
so you're basically telling them I found

239
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:05,960
your stuff I think it's suspicious

240
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:08,000
and I'm posting it out there to get

241
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:10,030
analysis on and now they say got it now

242
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,890
I'm going to rewrite my techniques here

243
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:15,320
and then there so I needed something

244
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:17,450
that had dynamic analysis as well as

245
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:18,950
some static analysis because I don't

246
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:21,349
fully trust automated tools

247
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:22,969
I think AI and machine learning is an

248
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:24,320
awesome field to study I just don't

249
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:26,060
think it's doing what a lot of people

250
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:28,550
are advertising it has and we still need

251
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:29,930
that human eye to say this is legitimate

252
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:31,550
or it's bad and there's a lot of

253
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:34,250
variables that a machine can't quite do

254
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:37,970
yet and so how does need to advance

255
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:39,909
malware that had or I was trying to get

256
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:42,500
around some of the anti reverse

257
00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:43,819
engineering techniques so sometimes

258
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:46,190
these pieces of malware that I'm

259
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:48,440
collecting they look for internet access

260
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:49,430
so if I have an isolated virtual machine

261
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:51,770
that's disconnected from the network

262
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:53,000
it's a it goes out to the DNS check if

263
00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:54,199
it fails it's going to say I'm

264
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,310
not gonna do anything I'm not letting

265
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,360
you look at this I know I'm not

266
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:58,280
connected to the Internet

267
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:00,560
other times the lookers I mentioned a

268
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:02,870
VMware Knicks the MAC address so look

269
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:04,609
for the tools that you install there's

270
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:05,840
if there's a number of files that are

271
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:08,120
missing from desktops so if you just

272
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:10,070
create a virtual machine Vennela Windows

273
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:12,050
XP or Windows 7 or Windows 10 or

274
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:14,660
whatever you're using and you have no

275
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:16,250
files on the desktop or documents or no

276
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:18,110
favorites nothing there they're checking

277
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:20,420
those and if it's less than a certain

278
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:22,100
number a threshold the malware will not

279
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:24,050
detonate it says I know I'm in a virtual

280
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:25,790
machine it's not reasonable for someone

281
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:27,530
to have a machine that has no files on

282
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:29,360
it if it's an actual user there's gonna

283
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:31,120
be a desktop with a thousand things on

284
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:33,230
it so they look for that as well

285
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:36,140
sometimes they'll also look for tools

286
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:37,670
like Wireshark it'll look in C programs

287
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:39,860
Wireshark and look for the Wireshark

288
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:41,089
shark Exe file so I needed a lot of

289
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:43,250
different techniques that I can kind of

290
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:44,750
bypass this or make sure that the pieces

291
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:48,320
of malware won't kind of detect that I

292
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:50,480
was trying to detect them so my my our

293
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:52,130
sandbox requirements in this case I want

294
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,690
it to be easy to setup and teardown for

295
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:55,400
the rest of my team so I didn't have to

296
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:57,560
have this complex KooKoo setup

297
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:59,180
I needed to be low cost so I could spin

298
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:00,680
it up quickly and if I want to make

299
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:02,900
changes it wasn't gonna cost a lot of

300
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:04,670
money and I could get even internal

301
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:06,500
teams from some of our clients to use I

302
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:07,610
needed it to be isolated obviously I

303
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:09,110
didn't want to go out and detonate

304
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:10,760
malware and have it spread if I didn't

305
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:12,230
know what it did and it need to be

306
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:14,600
accessible from anywhere a lot of times

307
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:16,130
I'm in San Diego or Los Angeles or

308
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:17,839
Canada and I'm traveling and visiting

309
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:19,100
different clients and if I get a case I

310
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:20,810
have to look at some malware I don't

311
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:21,980
want to have to say sorry I have to wait

312
00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:23,930
till I get back to my office in Los

313
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:25,160
Angeles in 40 days and then I'll take a

314
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:26,060
look at your malware by then it's going

315
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:29,420
to be all over the place

316
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:30,680
I need those static dynamic tools the

317
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:32,089
ability to share it with junior members

318
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:33,589
of my team so some of the newer guys

319
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:35,600
that don't have quite the skillset that

320
00:10:33,589 --> 00:10:38,180
I do I wanted to be easy enough for them

321
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,560
to launch it quickly analyze malware and

322
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:41,239
they could always send me reports to

323
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:42,709
look a little bit further but they could

324
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:44,900
detonate the malware or the phishing

325
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:46,280
attempts in this isolated box and then

326
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:48,410
would be able to respond quickly so I

327
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:50,780
couldn't have two three four hours or 40

328
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:52,510
days before I was able to get my reports

329
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:55,040
I need to make my decisions very quickly

330
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:56,360
so here's some of the tools I'll leave

331
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:58,069
this up for a little bit if anyone wants

332
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:59,900
a picture and I can publish the slides

333
00:10:58,070 --> 00:11:01,550
later but here's some of the tools I

334
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:03,500
picked there's there's a lot out there

335
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:05,780
but this is a collection that that I

336
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:06,840
find really good and I'm using a Windows

337
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:08,310
box because I

338
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:10,650
assuming that my targets are mostly

339
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:12,030
going to be windows and I want to have

340
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:14,550
these tools on there so I couldn't use

341
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:17,189
certain things that are Linux or UNIX

342
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:19,469
based only so Wireshark obviously for

343
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:20,640
the full packet capture and this is one

344
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:23,880
that's going to change in the near

345
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:26,160
future it's there but I'm also concerned

346
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:27,930
that it will be caught by some malware

347
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,010
and they won't detonate and I am

348
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:31,170
experimenting currently one of the

349
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:33,840
future versions for this talk I want to

350
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:37,050
have this in AWS which it is right now

351
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:38,760
but I want to do inline packet capture

352
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:40,589
it's a little bit difficult maybe guys

353
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:42,630
because I can't go put a wiretap or a

354
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:44,550
packet squirrel between there because

355
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:45,780
it's an Amazon's data center so I'm

356
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:47,729
experimenting with some different ways

357
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:49,650
of using IP tables to funnel data

358
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:51,540
through a Linux box and then go to my

359
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:54,000
Windows and I can still do full packet

360
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:55,910
capture in line without impacting the

361
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,130
device that I'm actually working on I

362
00:11:55,910 --> 00:12:00,719
use process Explorer because Windows

363
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:02,010
you know Explorer isn't isn't good

364
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,180
enough and looking at the process there

365
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:05,310
I get a little more detailed process

366
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:06,870
Explorer process monitor sometimes I'll

367
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:08,550
pull up it gives me file system

368
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:10,380
monitoring as well as registry

369
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:11,819
monitoring but for registries I really

370
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:13,710
like red shot and what that will do is

371
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:16,350
it'll take a snapshot of the registry I

372
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:18,030
launch my malware I take another shot of

373
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:19,620
the registry and it compares and

374
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:22,050
contrasts the two versions it'll show me

375
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:24,510
registry keys added deleted modified

376
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:26,189
it's a huge list of file but at least

377
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:29,610
you have any change that's been done to

378
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:32,370
the registry I also really like and this

379
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:35,070
is a recent addition to my my sandbox is

380
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:36,870
log MD and so log empty they call it the

381
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:38,910
malicious file and discovery tool and

382
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:41,100
really what it does is Windows does not

383
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:42,900
log enough by default and so what it'll

384
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:46,410
do is it gives you recommendations based

385
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:49,079
off of CIS best practices the windows

386
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:52,260
logging cheat sheet the US government

387
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:54,270
base lines as well as the Australian

388
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:56,010
cyber security defence force their best

389
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:58,230
practices and then what your computer

390
00:12:56,010 --> 00:12:59,550
set for so my first launch of that it'll

391
00:12:58,230 --> 00:13:01,440
give me just what I should be logging

392
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:02,910
compared to what I am logging because

393
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,100
Windows won't even tell me if I failed

394
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:06,480
to log in correctly right by default so

395
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:08,640
I have to turn all these logs on the

396
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,810
advanced logging retention PowerShell

397
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:12,000
logging all those things have turned on

398
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:14,189
so that's my checklist once I get that

399
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,360
set up then it'll also query different

400
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:18,000
information for me so it'll give me a

401
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:19,590
lot more data on login attempts or

402
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,080
PowerShell scripts run and

403
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:24,120
rate logging tool I need a disassembler

404
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:27,510
so I can look at some binaries and find

405
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:29,130
out what they're doing trid is a file

406
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:31,890
identifier I normally just use file

407
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:33,120
inside of Linux the command but since

408
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:34,380
we're running Windows I need something

409
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:37,890
that's gonna try and identify the type

410
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:39,630
of file upx it's a common Packer for

411
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:41,330
malware and so it'll help me unpack it

412
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:43,920
if it's packed with upx

413
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:45,270
I can use different memory dump tools

414
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,770
I'm experimenting with this at the

415
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:48,590
moment over the next couple of months to

416
00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:51,390
figure out better options for this

417
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:52,980
strings one of my favorite tools on

418
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:55,199
there you can get strings for Windows as

419
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:56,880
part of sysinternals it'll scan a file

420
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:59,150
and tell you any strings that are inside

421
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:01,740
this and I've I've found at least for

422
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:03,150
zero day vulnerabilities and tax off

423
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:06,240
we're just using strings it's one of my

424
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:08,550
favorite tools out there PE Viewer it

425
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:09,630
looks at executable files and analyzes

426
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:11,910
them for you there's quite a few of

427
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:14,250
those resource hacker it'll try and look

428
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:15,900
for dll's or other libraries that the

429
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:20,070
malware the file in question might be

430
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:22,500
calling we've got PDF ID so in certain

431
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:23,760
cases where you have a PDF file it's

432
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:25,320
going to parse through that because the

433
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,610
tool strings doesn't do a great job

434
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:29,400
there's a lot of things that are

435
00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:31,200
compressed and inflated and and etc and

436
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:33,810
so that's a better tool than strings for

437
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:35,730
if it's a PDF file file analyzer it'll

438
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:37,680
look at the executable information P

439
00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:39,690
studio is another executable tool

440
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:41,640
dependency Walker that's a great one

441
00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:43,500
that's gonna look for DLL calls and if

442
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:45,780
if it's a piece of tool that says it's

443
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:47,820
like a game but yeah it's all of a

444
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:50,010
sudden requesting registry changes and

445
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:51,300
other libraries that are unusual that's

446
00:14:50,010 --> 00:14:52,770
going to give you an ID and say this

447
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:54,060
deal out shouldn't be being called by a

448
00:14:52,770 --> 00:14:56,579
game it makes no sense

449
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:59,040
a couple other P tools at the bottom

450
00:14:56,580 --> 00:15:00,510
there some additional tools that a lot

451
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:02,790
of people that write these blogs for

452
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:04,740
malware analysis don't call out but I'd

453
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:05,849
say I install Chrome and Firefox a lot

454
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:07,950
of times I don't want to have just IE

455
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:09,780
this is one check that a lot of malware

456
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:12,210
will do and say just do they have other

457
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:13,500
browsers installed there they're making

458
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:14,760
an assumption that most people aren't

459
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:16,710
just going to have internet explorer and

460
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:18,470
so if you just haven't an explorer they

461
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:21,420
might say this isn't a real computer

462
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:22,740
silence protect an optics carbon block

463
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:24,599
has been out there but the thing I like

464
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:26,970
about silence protect and optics is that

465
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:29,460
there's cyber force there are a company

466
00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:32,430
in Irvine I think and they will sell you

467
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:33,180
five one or five user licenses so I put

468
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:34,650
this in my Sam

469
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:36,569
so I don't have a hundred endpoints I

470
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:39,000
just want one license I throw it up in

471
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:40,470
Amazon on my ec2 instance and I could do

472
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,390
my analysis without buying a hundred

473
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:43,710
endpoints from carbon block and I put it

474
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:45,630
in learning mode so it's not blocking

475
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:46,740
anything it's just analyzing stuff and

476
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:49,050
it gives me a little more input of

477
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:50,790
something maybe I missed Adobe Reader

478
00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:52,650
another check that malware will do to

479
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:54,630
see if you are if you are a legitimate

480
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:56,910
box Microsoft Office this is one I

481
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:59,700
forgot in version one of my sandbox and

482
00:15:56,910 --> 00:16:01,589
then I opened up a someone at a PE mail

483
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:02,940
and I tried to open the office document

484
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:04,950
I thought oh that makes sense I need

485
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:06,900
word right so you have to have office

486
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:08,490
suite on there multiple files and

487
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:10,590
folders in the users profiles and

488
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:11,880
mentioned documents all kinds of stuff

489
00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:12,990
you could put fake files in there they

490
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:14,820
just have to have content in your

491
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:16,500
profile and then you can rename your

492
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:18,810
analysis tool so don't leave it default

493
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:20,910
you can change the executable name so it

494
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:23,969
doesn't look like that if you ever seen

495
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:25,560
talks where they say change mini cats to

496
00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:27,750
mimi dogs it's the same type of concept

497
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:29,670
you're just modifying the the hash

498
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:30,930
and/or the name of the file so it

499
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:32,969
doesn't get picked up by some of these

500
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:35,520
pieces of malware a bunch of online

501
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:37,410
tools for shortcuts I I don't just have

502
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:40,140
all the devices on or all the tools on

503
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:42,750
my system I will use get file hash to

504
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:44,850
grab the the hash of this the file in

505
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:46,680
question I then put it to virustotal in

506
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:48,990
this case I'm not giving them the binary

507
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:50,729
or the actual file instead I'm giving

508
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:52,560
them the hash the fingerprint of the

509
00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:54,330
file and seeing if it's been found

510
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,439
before and in this case I'm not sharing

511
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:57,600
more information with the malware

512
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:59,640
creator or the community than I need to

513
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:01,260
I'm all for sharing with the community

514
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:02,160
but I don't want more information to get

515
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:05,099
out there that doesn't need to

516
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:06,300
especially in my analysis phase a bunch

517
00:17:05,099 --> 00:17:08,760
of other tools out there you can do who

518
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:10,349
is history you can look for black lists

519
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:12,569
the other one at the bottom which I

520
00:17:10,349 --> 00:17:14,790
really enjoy cloud shark oops

521
00:17:12,569 --> 00:17:16,530
cloud shark and packet total you can

522
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:18,240
take your peak apps upload it and it'll

523
00:17:16,530 --> 00:17:20,879
do a quick analysis for you to look for

524
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:22,890
malicious traffic or URLs and as I

525
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:24,600
mentioned logging you absolutely have to

526
00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:27,000
have logging on there there's not enough

527
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:28,980
logging done by default inside of

528
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,670
Windows so you've got to turn that on

529
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:34,350
log empty as I mentioned or the windows

530
00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:35,970
log checklist those are great places to

531
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:37,560
go and you could take a look at that

532
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:39,390
even the cia's benchmarks you could

533
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:41,310
start there it's just not enough I would

534
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:44,190
absolutely say what log MD will give you

535
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:46,370
a lot more information to log so you log

536
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:48,559
use window or log MD

537
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:50,719
run it the first time with a - one and

538
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:52,730
it'll go ahead and give you your weather

539
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:54,050
and your compliance and which different

540
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:55,880
standards you're in compliance with or

541
00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:57,889
out of compliance with and so I love

542
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:59,809
this at this part it'll tell me my

543
00:17:57,890 --> 00:18:01,490
computer if I'm doing successful or

544
00:17:59,809 --> 00:18:03,350
failed Logging's or if I'm not logging

545
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:05,890
at all and it'll compare me to the

546
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:08,929
different baselines of cis the US

547
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:10,130
government is it's a compliance baseline

548
00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:13,700
or something like that

549
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:15,110
the Australian cyber defense security or

550
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:16,760
whatever they are it'll give me all of

551
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:18,649
those and then the windows logging cheat

552
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:20,000
sheet it'll just show me all of them the

553
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:21,410
different logs of what I'm doing it or

554
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,910
not but you want all these Logging's

555
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:25,429
turned on if you're looking at malware

556
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:27,140
or suspicious activity so what I do is

557
00:18:25,429 --> 00:18:28,940
I've created and you can absolutely take

558
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:31,010
this home or to your office and you can

559
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:33,350
start doing this set up an AWS account

560
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:34,370
you set up an isolated V PC you don't

561
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:37,129
want to be doing this in your production

562
00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:38,719
network you then create ec2 instance

563
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:40,220
with at least four gigs of RAM you're

564
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,750
paying by the hour so you can even do

565
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:43,850
more than that but I found four gigs is

566
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:45,710
pretty adequate and it's legitimate a

567
00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:47,629
lot of you systems still have four gigs

568
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:50,030
or eight gigs of RAM so it's enough to

569
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:52,340
pass the malware checks install tools

570
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:53,720
and logging fake files create shortcuts

571
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:57,020
make it look like legitimate user

572
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:58,610
profile I set the background to red

573
00:18:57,020 --> 00:19:01,190
because when I'm doing Remote Desktop

574
00:18:58,610 --> 00:19:03,080
into this system and I'm it might be a

575
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:05,270
production system or a client system I

576
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:07,280
want an absolute indication I'm on the

577
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:09,200
right box and if it's got the default

578
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:10,670
blue background I might be installing

579
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:12,500
malware on a production server not

580
00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:13,970
paying attention so I put that red

581
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:16,850
background make it very clear of the

582
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:18,860
system that I'm on and then I create an

583
00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:21,199
image for it so I can use it again in

584
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:22,790
a.m. I deploy the instance and one thing

585
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,260
you do when you use Wireshark or

586
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:25,670
whatever analysis tools you have to

587
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:29,059
exclude

588
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:31,190
port 3389 otherwise Wireshark just tons

589
00:19:29,059 --> 00:19:33,200
of stuff from your own login session to

590
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:34,880
it so this is essentially when it comes

591
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:37,160
down to what my box looks like with all

592
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:39,290
my tools I started adding a whole lot

593
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:41,270
more documents on the desktop and the

594
00:19:39,290 --> 00:19:43,340
profile since then but I have other tax

595
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:44,360
software maybe QuickBooks whatever you

596
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:46,100
can think of to make it look more

597
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:49,550
legitimate and a bunch of stuff on there

598
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:50,780
that it's not just a vanilla box so the

599
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:52,520
future things I'm going to work on for

600
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:53,899
the next iteration in future talks and

601
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:56,270
you can check out the the Richie made

602
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:57,320
tech blog and I'll have definitely

603
00:19:56,270 --> 00:19:59,910
something on this within the next

604
00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:01,590
probably 30 days or so maybe 60 and

605
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:03,870
want to add additional tools to it I

606
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:05,639
really want inline packet capture so I

607
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:07,889
don't have that running on my system I

608
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:09,300
don't want the malware or the fishing to

609
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:11,790
look and see that the devices on

610
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:13,649
promiscuous mode so I want to remove

611
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:16,200
Wireshark and then I also want to have

612
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:17,910
these peak apps fed into sericata or bro

613
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:19,710
with an elk stack so I'm doing off

614
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:21,780
system logging because the malware could

615
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:23,430
be corrupting my logs deleting my logs

616
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:24,899
messing with those so I want to get

617
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:27,240
those logs off and running it through

618
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:28,560
some type of tool that's looking for

619
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:31,080
signatures that's maybe taking stuff

620
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:32,639
from mitre or our TTP es or whatever

621
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:34,679
they are and that way I have a second

622
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:35,910
thing that's looking at my my logs my

623
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:38,040
peak apps to see if there's any

624
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:44,330
malicious activity so that's all I have

625
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:46,800
for this week on questions or outside a

626
00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:49,879
couple questions probably got three

627
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:49,879
minutes for questions if anyone has any

628
00:20:50,330 --> 00:21:11,490
in the back I happen to be on a system

629
00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:12,720
that's in line so the traffic's going

630
00:21:11,490 --> 00:21:16,460
through there and then passing through

631
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:16,460
or how do how is it going to work in AWS

632
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:24,450
okay absolutely I'd love to get it off

633
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:26,670
the ec2 instance I just feel like it's

634
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:28,800
way too obvious that wire sharks on

635
00:21:26,670 --> 00:21:30,720
there and that it's doing this putting

636
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:32,310
the NIC and promiscuous mode and I just

637
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:34,710
I feel like that's a red flag to anyone

638
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:39,600
writing malware absolutely thank you

639
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:40,470
either questions alright well I'll be

640
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:42,629
around in the hall if you have any

641
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:43,580
questions enjoy to work on thank you for

642
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:52,979
your time

643
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:52,978
[Applause]
