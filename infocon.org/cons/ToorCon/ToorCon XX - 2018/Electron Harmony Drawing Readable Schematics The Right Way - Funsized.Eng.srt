1
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:09,540
all right next up we have a longtime

2
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:11,190
friend of the community fun-sized giving

3
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:12,928
a talk on electronic harmony drawing

4
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:21,960
better circuit schematics please give

5
00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:26,070
him a warm welcome thank you so this

6
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:30,539
talk is basically what I have been doing

7
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:32,159
for the past two years so what I want to

8
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:35,640
talk about today is how you can draw

9
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:37,290
better circuit schematics so the

10
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:40,890
majority of time when you see these

11
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:43,290
schematics online they are if you look

12
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:46,620
at Arduino Raspberry Pi any of the major

13
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:48,300
open source tools the schematics are

14
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:50,160
available you can look at them they're

15
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:52,828
completely open but they're often

16
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:55,110
difficult to decipher so what I want to

17
00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:58,680
do today is present a better way of

18
00:00:55,110 --> 00:01:01,079
doing that so why should this community

19
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:03,480
care about a better way of drawing

20
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:06,119
schematics one is because they're the

21
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:11,100
lifeblood of hardware design and reverse

22
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:14,310
engineering so it's it's where the

23
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:15,990
project starts and the less confusion

24
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:19,830
and issues that you have in that

25
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:21,929
schematic the less issues you will have

26
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:24,229
down the line with PCB design with

27
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:27,119
debugging and then finally with

28
00:01:24,229 --> 00:01:33,450
communicating what you've done to other

29
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:35,880
people in the community why am i up here

30
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:38,040
why am I talking about this because I am

31
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:40,770
an electrical engineer by day this is my

32
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:42,299
job hopefully I'm not terrible at my job

33
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:46,170
although it's possible you can judge

34
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:48,500
after this talk so I work for a company

35
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:53,579
where we do really high reliability

36
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:56,549
electronics they are things that cannot

37
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:59,669
fail and we go to great lengths to make

38
00:01:56,549 --> 00:02:04,350
sure that those boards and boxes that

39
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:06,780
they go in are incredibly well built to

40
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:08,038
to not have any of the issues when

41
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:09,449
you're working in large teams and

42
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:12,599
rapidly developing those types of

43
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:13,410
schematics you can't have confusing

44
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:15,149
schematics

45
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:17,100
so I spent a lot of time throughout my

46
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:19,050
day reviewing other people's schematics

47
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:22,890
and improving my schematic so that

48
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:24,420
they're more easily understood also the

49
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:28,679
way that I'm gonna present to you is

50
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:30,329
very much my way of doing things so if

51
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:32,850
you think that you have a better idea

52
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:35,010
for how to communicate those ideas or

53
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:38,010
you have a very specific way that you

54
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:39,660
like to do things it's do that don't

55
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:42,390
follow my way but I just want to give

56
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:46,049
you some ideas on the best way to build

57
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:48,600
some of those schematics so what is the

58
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:50,280
purpose of a schematic for those of you

59
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,690
who are new to hardware design or maybe

60
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:55,800
you've been doing this for a while a

61
00:02:51,690 --> 00:03:01,230
schematic is the drawing of the

62
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:03,210
electrical idea it is specifically to

63
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:05,630
communicate that idea and it's a show

64
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:08,640
circuit flow and to show the data path

65
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:10,710
the most important takeaway from this

66
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:14,279
presentation that you can have is that a

67
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:19,890
schematic is not the layout so a layout

68
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:22,350
is the copper design that you give to

69
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:23,970
the board manufacturer and that board

70
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:26,430
manufacturer will take that copper

71
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:28,770
design and etch it out or mill it out

72
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:30,720
and that's what becomes your PCB that's

73
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:32,340
a really important component but that's

74
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:36,330
not what schematics are for schematics

75
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:39,360
are for the designers and the designers

76
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:43,410
are trying to communicate a circuit idea

77
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:45,390
not a copper layout sometimes those are

78
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:47,609
the same person right so where I work I

79
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:50,010
do schematics and then I actually hand

80
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:51,600
those schematics off to a CAD designer

81
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:55,440
and then that CAD designer translates

82
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:57,720
that circuit idea into the copper files

83
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:59,910
that we send off to the board house a

84
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:03,000
lot of that is because they spend all

85
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:07,590
day every day using the CAD tools that

86
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:09,300
we have to to build those boards they're

87
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:12,420
really fast at it they're much better at

88
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:14,280
it than I could be if I spend if I if I

89
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:16,048
didn't spend 40 hours a week working on

90
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:18,269
it but what that means is that it's

91
00:04:16,048 --> 00:04:20,478
incredibly crucial for me to take that

92
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:23,849
idea and communicate it clearly because

93
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:26,909
oftentimes either the CAD guys are not

94
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:27,360
engineers or if if my idea is poorly

95
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:29,069
Commun

96
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:32,669
kated they're not gonna know what i was

97
00:04:29,069 --> 00:04:34,830
trying to accomplish so a schematic is

98
00:04:32,669 --> 00:04:36,150
not a layout so let's dig into what is a

99
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:39,409
schematic and what are some of the best

100
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:43,919
practices for how that should work so

101
00:04:39,409 --> 00:04:46,949
some basic rules a schematics laid out

102
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:49,318
on a sheet personally I really like 11

103
00:04:46,949 --> 00:04:51,659
by 17 most people are switching towards

104
00:04:49,319 --> 00:04:53,069
eight and a half on that by 11 inches on

105
00:04:51,659 --> 00:04:55,860
their scale these things don't matter

106
00:04:53,069 --> 00:04:58,560
what does matter is that as you're

107
00:04:55,860 --> 00:05:03,330
flowing from left to right you want your

108
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:05,340
inputs and your outputs of your idea to

109
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:09,599
to have a logical pattern in the same

110
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:14,938
way that we read sentences or translate

111
00:05:09,599 --> 00:05:17,938
texts right so sometimes you have inputs

112
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:20,129
that are both inputs and outputs then

113
00:05:17,939 --> 00:05:22,949
what do you do then you want to start

114
00:05:20,129 --> 00:05:24,810
grouping them by function so if these

115
00:05:22,949 --> 00:05:26,159
rules seem really abstract don't worry

116
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:27,960
I'm gonna get two pretty pictures in a

117
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:30,688
little bit I just want to quickly go

118
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:31,948
over some of the rules we're gonna talk

119
00:05:30,689 --> 00:05:34,680
about them and then I'm actually gonna

120
00:05:31,949 --> 00:05:40,409
go through an example of a schematic

121
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:44,930
that I've redone so discrete inputs

122
00:05:40,409 --> 00:05:48,270
would be things like sensors buttons

123
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:49,770
oscillators crystals those are things

124
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:54,539
that only have one purpose they are

125
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:58,289
flowing either power or data into the

126
00:05:54,539 --> 00:06:02,580
rest of your circuit outputs this is

127
00:05:58,289 --> 00:06:05,969
things like screen outputs one-way data

128
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:07,710
buses those types LEDs right that's that

129
00:06:05,969 --> 00:06:09,689
is an output so those you want on the

130
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:13,500
right side of your schematic I keep

131
00:06:09,689 --> 00:06:14,610
gesturing to my right and left so I'm

132
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:18,240
sorry you're just gonna have to conform

133
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:21,479
to my standard now so then

134
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:22,710
bi-directional things are most

135
00:06:21,479 --> 00:06:27,300
communication protocols are

136
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:30,359
bi-directional so I to see SPI you know

137
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:32,819
Ethernet all of those you can't nail

138
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:34,560
down a single signal - yes this only

139
00:06:32,819 --> 00:06:38,279
flows one direction so then you have to

140
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:39,960
go to what is the intent of that pin so

141
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:42,509
if I have

142
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:44,729
an Arduino board that reads in an

143
00:06:42,509 --> 00:06:48,449
Ethernet packet and spits out that

144
00:06:44,729 --> 00:06:50,490
status on an LED my input are the

145
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:52,139
ethernet pins even though the Arduino

146
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:54,600
could be communicating with a computer

147
00:06:52,139 --> 00:06:56,009
that's bi-directional but that will go

148
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:57,449
on the left side of my schematic and

149
00:06:56,009 --> 00:07:02,570
then on the right side of my schematic

150
00:06:57,449 --> 00:07:05,039
the output is the LED so one

151
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:10,889
particularly irksome thing for

152
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:15,240
electrical engineers is when microphones

153
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:19,169
fall know is when grounds are not drawn

154
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:23,970
down it guys it really hurts me please

155
00:07:19,169 --> 00:07:27,330
don't do it so when we're communicating

156
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:30,389
voltages inside of a schematic you want

157
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:33,479
this to make sense so current flows from

158
00:07:30,389 --> 00:07:35,849
high voltage to low voltage right so if

159
00:07:33,479 --> 00:07:37,409
you have a high voltage source and a

160
00:07:35,849 --> 00:07:38,909
ground the high voltage source to go up

161
00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:40,530
high the ground should go on the bottom

162
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:43,080
that schematic you should always draw

163
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:44,520
things in the direction of the voltage

164
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:47,310
as they're descending and I actually

165
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:52,320
have some particularly well drawn

166
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:56,820
examples of this so conversely if you

167
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:59,430
have a pulldown resistor so if sometimes

168
00:07:56,820 --> 00:08:02,250
in a circuit you want the ability to win

169
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:03,630
a pin on an integrated circuit is not

170
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:06,320
being used you want to make sure that it

171
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:07,560
sits well grounded so you use a pulldown

172
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:10,050
pull-downs

173
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:11,190
should always go down because you're

174
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:13,289
trying to communicate it's just a

175
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:15,240
resistor right but it has a very

176
00:08:13,289 --> 00:08:19,349
fundamental task inside of a schematic

177
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:21,120
so make sure that your pull downs go

178
00:08:19,349 --> 00:08:23,699
down make sure conversely that your pull

179
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:26,669
ups go up and you want your voltage pins

180
00:08:23,699 --> 00:08:27,419
to also go up I've seen grounds drawn

181
00:08:26,669 --> 00:08:29,310
sideways

182
00:08:27,419 --> 00:08:32,338
I've seen voltage pins drawn sideways

183
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:37,760
I've seen grounds drawn up and down on

184
00:08:32,339 --> 00:08:40,279
the same pin don't do it don't do it

185
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:43,708
another thing that's really important is

186
00:08:40,279 --> 00:08:46,380
I'm going to show you an example of a

187
00:08:43,708 --> 00:08:48,869
single page schematic that I expand it

188
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:52,050
out to a multi-page schematic the reason

189
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:53,310
this is really important is because when

190
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:57,650
you try to cram every

191
00:08:53,310 --> 00:09:00,660
to one page it becomes unreadable so

192
00:08:57,650 --> 00:09:03,449
when you have signals that go between

193
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:05,880
pages if you don't label where those

194
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:09,330
signals are going you're gonna get lost

195
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:11,670
very quickly so not only do you want to

196
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:15,270
label all of your nets that's the word

197
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:18,990
for when a signal runs off of the page

198
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:21,120
and goes onto another page and you want

199
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:24,300
to make sure that any place that net is

200
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:27,270
used is numbered right next to where

201
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:28,709
that net runs off most CAD tools will do

202
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:30,750
this for you if you configure them

203
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:33,230
properly but I've seen so many

204
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:35,760
schematics where the line just ends I

205
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:39,600
don't know where that goes that doesn't

206
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:42,600
help me so always put page numbers at

207
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:44,730
the end of your nets and then this

208
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:47,190
should kind of go without saying but

209
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:49,200
please be consistent in how you name

210
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:51,210
things and how you use symbols because

211
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,550
you would be amazed at how clearly you

212
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:56,610
can communicate something if the format

213
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:58,020
stays inside of those traditional like I

214
00:09:56,610 --> 00:10:00,270
always use this symbol for a resistor

215
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:01,650
then if you use a different symbol it

216
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:07,680
means something different it doesn't

217
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:09,449
just confuse your audience so the other

218
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:12,420
thing is you want to clearly label your

219
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:14,460
nets with function so in a lot of CAD

220
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:17,160
tools you have a certain number of

221
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:19,230
characters that you can use to describe

222
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:24,360
the net you don't have to get crazy you

223
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:26,610
don't have to say Ethernet for red box

224
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:27,780
to that's too long of a name and it's

225
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:29,700
not helpful and you're not gonna want to

226
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:32,310
type that over and over but if you say

227
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:35,520
eath - that's incredibly more

228
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:37,560
descriptive than a variable name that is

229
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:40,110
either random characters or random

230
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:42,359
numbers so in the same way that you need

231
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:44,630
good variables in software you need good

232
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:49,350
variables in your schematic design and

233
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:52,560
then this this one is another one of

234
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:56,130
those soul-crushing things please orient

235
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:58,650
your nets so that they all face normally

236
00:10:56,130 --> 00:11:01,770
they're not 90 degrees off they're not

237
00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:04,020
upside-down yes I understand that maybe

238
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:05,339
you're trying to if you have a line that

239
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:06,750
goes up and down and you want to put a

240
00:11:05,339 --> 00:11:09,000
net there it's tempting

241
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:11,610
to angle it like that you shouldn't have

242
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,500
to do this with your schematic when

243
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:17,670
you're writing it out and then you want

244
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:19,470
to differentiate between bypass caps and

245
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:21,810
filter caps kind of by the same reason

246
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:24,180
so when I'm looking at a schematic and

247
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:26,069
I'm tilting my head to try to figure out

248
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:27,630
what your capacitor is doing that means

249
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:30,090
that you haven't been consistent with

250
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:31,590
how you've been using them so for a lot

251
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:35,040
of integrated circuits you need a

252
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:37,980
certain amount of capacitance to keep

253
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:40,290
filtered noise out you are essentially

254
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:42,540
using those as a buffer for when you

255
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:44,280
have a noisy power signal or start-up

256
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:46,050
conditions that are causing your current

257
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:49,290
to fluctuate those are called bypass

258
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:51,839
capacitors bypass capacitors should

259
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:52,920
always be drawn down similar to grounds

260
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:56,430
because what you're doing is you're

261
00:11:52,920 --> 00:12:00,030
using that to pull the AC ripple in your

262
00:11:56,430 --> 00:12:04,109
circuit hopefully to zero or within some

263
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:06,120
acceptable tolerance but then if you

264
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:07,860
have a bunch of capacitors that are for

265
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:10,260
filtration it doesn't make as much sense

266
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:11,700
to draw them down unless your schematic

267
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:13,170
is drawn in such a way where it makes a

268
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:15,210
lot of sense and we'll see an example of

269
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:17,969
this when I pull up the schematic that

270
00:12:15,210 --> 00:12:20,280
I've read done and then sort of alluding

271
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:24,050
back to the last thing that I spoke

272
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:27,660
about don't crowd your pages too much

273
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:29,579
when you're having trouble fitting

274
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:30,990
everything onto a single page it means

275
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:35,750
that everyone else is gonna have trouble

276
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:39,510
reading what you squeezed in there so

277
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:42,300
another thing that I see on almost every

278
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:44,250
open-source Hardware project is they

279
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:46,949
want to draw their integrated circuits

280
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:48,360
the exact same way that it's laid out on

281
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:52,140
the page I excuse me

282
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:54,300
the way that it's laid out pin wise in

283
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:56,010
the real world and I understand where

284
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:58,740
you're coming from which is you want to

285
00:12:56,010 --> 00:13:03,900
be able to see like here's an IC it's

286
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:06,570
got 20 pins v per side and you you would

287
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:08,579
expect to see those pins in order around

288
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:12,060
your square right but this is goes back

289
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:13,560
to a schematic is not a layout so if we

290
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:15,329
follow the rules that we spoke about

291
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:18,030
earlier and the convention of flowing

292
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:20,640
your voltages down you'd put your power

293
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:23,100
pins on top you put your ground pins

294
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:24,720
bottom and then you'd have your input

295
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:27,630
pins on the left and your output pins on

296
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:30,540
the right so we can see here with my my

297
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:33,300
highly professional drawing that the

298
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:35,760
five volt is on top if I have multiple

299
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:38,640
voltages I put them all on top and I

300
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:40,590
draw the label for those things at

301
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:43,050
Heights respective to their voltages if

302
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:47,370
I have multiple grounds inside of a

303
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:49,620
circuit you are gonna either draw those

304
00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:50,910
grounds at different levels or much

305
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:54,180
better is you should use the

306
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:55,650
conventional nomenclature for varying

307
00:13:54,180 --> 00:14:00,630
types of grounds and we'll cover that in

308
00:13:55,650 --> 00:14:02,430
just a little bit okay so I covered a

309
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:04,080
bunch of rules so what I wanted to do is

310
00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:08,849
an audience exercise I'm gonna need some

311
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:10,980
participation from you this is the

312
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:12,360
Arduino rev3 I know on the screen that

313
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:15,240
it's super itty bitty if you bear with

314
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:17,010
me for a moment I'm gonna zoom in and

315
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:18,720
what I'd like to do so on the Left I

316
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:22,470
have the rules that we just talked about

317
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:24,210
and I would really like it if people in

318
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:26,790
the audience would call out things that

319
00:14:24,210 --> 00:14:31,350
are wrong with this schematic my goal is

320
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:33,540
not to make fun of Arduino they are an

321
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:34,890
excellent product that gets people into

322
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:37,920
the circuitry and I'm all about that I

323
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:40,710
think that's very exciting but this is

324
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:43,310
not the way to do schematics and it the

325
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:46,200
further that I got into this schematic

326
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:50,660
the more it hurt me so let's take a look

327
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:50,660
here so let's start maybe at the top

328
00:14:55,790 --> 00:15:08,540
so does anybody see anything that could

329
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:09,740
be improved maybe okay so the one of the

330
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:12,469
things pointed out is what's with the

331
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:18,830
nets on the top left so there's some

332
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:20,810
pins and they're labeled and they don't

333
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:23,360
go anywhere they don't go to an IC

334
00:15:20,810 --> 00:15:25,430
there's a number there that doesn't I

335
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:27,770
genuinely do not know what those are

336
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:29,930
supposed to go to now I'm this is some

337
00:15:27,770 --> 00:15:32,180
sort of bypass capacitor because of its

338
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:33,530
size and because it's attached between

339
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:36,410
three volt and ground

340
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:37,579
excuse me five volt and ground but it

341
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:38,780
doesn't tell me what I need

342
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:43,250
how about anything anything else what

343
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:45,850
else do you see yeah so the text is is

344
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:48,200
sideways it's going up it's confusing

345
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:50,690
let's step down so that's that's just

346
00:15:48,200 --> 00:16:02,480
the power section let's take a look at

347
00:15:50,690 --> 00:16:07,040
this USB microcontroller that's as close

348
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:09,470
as we're gonna get folks so there's

349
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:14,990
there's some grounds buried and drawn

350
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:19,900
down in here there are what else we got

351
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:22,520
going on can't can you can you read this

352
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:24,709
now some of that is because of the text

353
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:26,180
or the the size of the image but that's

354
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:27,380
not really the core root of the problem

355
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:30,140
here the core root of the problem is

356
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:31,790
that they jammed their entire schematic

357
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:37,130
onto one page and you can't see what's

358
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:38,599
going on so um for brevity I made some

359
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:41,230
of my own red lines and I just want to

360
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:41,230
show you what those look like

361
00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:48,680
so there's more red on this page then

362
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:52,310
there is schematic and on this is I'm I

363
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:54,349
may be slightly OCD about these things

364
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:57,250
but the company that I work at I'm

365
00:16:54,350 --> 00:17:00,860
considered to be somewhat lackadaisical

366
00:16:57,250 --> 00:17:02,810
the my team if they if they spent more

367
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:06,220
than five minutes on this could find at

368
00:17:02,810 --> 00:17:06,220
least 20 more problems

369
00:17:08,628 --> 00:17:15,299
four-way junctions exactly this okay so

370
00:17:13,378 --> 00:17:17,608
this is I'm so glad that the younger

371
00:17:15,299 --> 00:17:19,980
members of the audience are know what

372
00:17:17,608 --> 00:17:26,759
they're talking about so let's dive into

373
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:27,539
this a little bit so the pin numbers are

374
00:17:26,759 --> 00:17:28,950
there twice

375
00:17:27,539 --> 00:17:33,450
it doesn't clearly communicate what's

376
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:37,220
going on in in the middle I actually

377
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:41,789
have a laser pointer that I can use so

378
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:43,739
over on here there are three circles I

379
00:17:41,789 --> 00:17:46,590
have no idea what their circles are

380
00:17:43,739 --> 00:17:47,730
they're probably mounting holes it's not

381
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:48,959
labeled I don't know

382
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:55,799
they could be transports to another

383
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:58,739
dimension in here is these are voltage

384
00:17:55,799 --> 00:18:00,090
transformers they they take it from a

385
00:17:58,739 --> 00:18:03,989
higher voltage to a lower voltage

386
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:06,090
they're not in order according to this

387
00:18:03,989 --> 00:18:08,309
schematic the way it works is it steps

388
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:11,158
from VN which is generally somewhere

389
00:18:08,309 --> 00:18:17,299
around 12 volt to 3.3 volt back down to

390
00:18:11,159 --> 00:18:22,759
5 volt and then it jumps back out to VN

391
00:18:17,299 --> 00:18:26,100
so then they've got their their power

392
00:18:22,759 --> 00:18:31,980
pins buried in there very hard to see

393
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:34,168
very hard to read here they have they're

394
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:38,809
using a whole bunch of pins that are

395
00:18:34,169 --> 00:18:43,769
unlabeled they are crowding up the box

396
00:18:38,809 --> 00:18:46,830
you can't like right in this area that's

397
00:18:43,769 --> 00:18:48,539
where the power is I can't if ice looked

398
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:53,070
at this circuit I would immediately be

399
00:18:48,539 --> 00:18:54,239
lost it took me longer than 20 minutes

400
00:18:53,070 --> 00:19:02,850
to really sit down and figure out what

401
00:18:54,239 --> 00:19:06,389
they were trying to do with this so here

402
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:08,070
they have unnecessary jogs here is what

403
00:19:06,389 --> 00:19:10,080
the young gentleman in the front was

404
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:12,418
talking about it's a 4-way so this is

405
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:15,899
something that we really like to avoid

406
00:19:12,419 --> 00:19:18,260
in schematics is when you have two lines

407
00:19:15,899 --> 00:19:19,820
and they cross and they

408
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:21,530
you don't ever want that to be a

409
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:24,379
four-way intersection and the reason for

410
00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:25,910
that is because we're gonna we're

411
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:28,429
following a nomenclature here which is

412
00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:32,679
now the standard nomenclature of win at

413
00:19:28,429 --> 00:19:35,900
race win at race crosses another trace

414
00:19:32,679 --> 00:19:40,370
it doesn't jump over that was a nineteen

415
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:43,130
sixties style jump it's bad it makes it

416
00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:45,678
hard to read so now when two lines cross

417
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:46,910
they just cross if they connect if there

418
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:48,890
is an electrical connection at that

419
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:52,520
point you have a dot so the way you get

420
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:54,260
around having four ways is you turn them

421
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:55,639
into three ways that are right next to

422
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:58,100
one another I'm gonna show an example of

423
00:19:55,640 --> 00:20:02,410
this in just a second okay

424
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:06,559
so here's what I did I redid it in a

425
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:09,290
tool agnostic setting so I didn't want

426
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:11,178
people to say oh well because he did

427
00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:13,220
that in Eagle or because he did that in

428
00:20:11,179 --> 00:20:14,990
pads that's why it was so easy I

429
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:16,940
actually did this in the most irritating

430
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:22,460
software known to mankind which is Visio

431
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:29,990
so we're gonna zoom in and take a look

432
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:31,730
at this what I did is this is where

433
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:34,840
power comes into the circuit so this is

434
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:37,660
page one of my circuit

435
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:40,939
there's the barrel adapter

436
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:43,370
there's the voltage regulator and oh

437
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:48,080
look I labeled what each functionality

438
00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:50,989
does with a text box we're gonna come

439
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:54,350
over here we now can see I've got my

440
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:58,240
five volt rail and my 3.3 rail I didn't

441
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:58,240
have to dig for this it's really obvious

442
00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:05,330
and more importantly the grounds are all

443
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:06,439
at exactly the same height which is one

444
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:10,418
of those things where you don't have to

445
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:12,110
do it but it does make me twitchy so

446
00:21:10,419 --> 00:21:16,400
things that are good about this

447
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:18,500
schematic there's no four ways these are

448
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,660
all three ways here's an example of

449
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:23,510
where you can break a four way into two

450
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:27,559
three ways where you just put them right

451
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:29,780
next to each other you'll notice that my

452
00:21:27,559 --> 00:21:31,700
VN is drawn the highest and then five

453
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:32,809
volt and then three three volt when you

454
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:34,940
look at this you can immediately tell

455
00:21:32,809 --> 00:21:39,110
what voltages those are just by looking

456
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:41,809
at the heights down below I have another

457
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:44,240
grouping so these were sort of the the

458
00:21:41,809 --> 00:21:45,889
weird little addendum circuits that they

459
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:47,630
have they're not necessarily core

460
00:21:45,889 --> 00:21:50,389
functionality but the very first one if

461
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:53,720
you take a look it's five volt USB and

462
00:21:50,389 --> 00:21:55,729
then it's a VN power selector so it's a

463
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:57,470
comparator that's figuring out whether

464
00:21:55,730 --> 00:22:00,580
or not you have the device plugged into

465
00:21:57,470 --> 00:22:02,990
five volt this is completely

466
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:06,049
unintelligible in the previous schematic

467
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:11,539
here you can tell immediately that this

468
00:22:06,049 --> 00:22:13,580
is a comparator and it is feeding into a

469
00:22:11,539 --> 00:22:16,399
gate that will allow current to flow I

470
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:19,939
made a mistake here I have a net that

471
00:22:16,399 --> 00:22:23,350
goes off page and I don't number it this

472
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:26,870
is fixed on the next page I believe but

473
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:28,879
you know please if you catch stuff I

474
00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:30,439
want you to practice with me so if you

475
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:35,090
see errors in my schematics call

476
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:37,870
mountain will read mine them so that's

477
00:22:35,090 --> 00:22:39,980
page one of my schematic all I did was

478
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:41,239
redraw it in a clean way and I didn't

479
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:43,010
cram anything together and you can

480
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:49,880
immediately tell how much more visually

481
00:22:43,010 --> 00:23:00,649
pleasing and flowing that is okay so

482
00:22:49,880 --> 00:23:04,370
this is the eye sees redrawn you can see

483
00:23:00,649 --> 00:23:07,039
here 5 volt comes in there's a bike pass

484
00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:09,469
capacitor there's some reverse voltage

485
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:12,049
protection there's a pull-up for the

486
00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:18,039
reset pin there are some power LEDs like

487
00:23:12,049 --> 00:23:23,360
it's it's much much more readable and

488
00:23:18,039 --> 00:23:25,610
I've got my my VCC and my a VDC tied up

489
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:28,158
top they're tied together so this means

490
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:30,769
that my analog reference is always gonna

491
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:32,539
be the same as my VCC which is pretty

492
00:23:30,769 --> 00:23:37,100
standard but here I can actually tell

493
00:23:32,539 --> 00:23:39,710
rather than having to guess just just

494
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:40,879
look at how clean this oscillator is I'm

495
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:43,460
really proud of this in case you

496
00:23:40,879 --> 00:23:47,019
couldn't tell um you can tell exactly

497
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:47,019
what's going on with this oscillator

498
00:23:48,370 --> 00:23:52,729
notice how clean my pins are they come

499
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:56,679
out in the right direction

500
00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:59,299
there's no jogs because I expanded my

501
00:23:56,679 --> 00:24:00,500
square for my I see I didn't have to

502
00:23:59,299 --> 00:24:02,418
cram it everything really tight and you

503
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:08,720
can actually tell what each pin is doing

504
00:24:02,419 --> 00:24:10,700
I have nets here that go just to the

505
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:14,330
other side of the page all it does is go

506
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:16,220
from here to here but it meant that I

507
00:24:14,330 --> 00:24:18,408
didn't have to draw stuff down and under

508
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:19,639
my ground because these are signal lines

509
00:24:18,409 --> 00:24:23,169
and they're definitely not lower than

510
00:24:19,639 --> 00:24:23,168
ground and then they come back up

511
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:37,879
okay so I want to give you a

512
00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:42,380
side-by-side comparison exhibit a does

513
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:44,690
this one look more readable with a

514
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:46,880
little bit of practice you will be able

515
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:50,470
to just look at this and know inherently

516
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:52,880
what that chip is doing this is the USB

517
00:24:50,470 --> 00:24:55,460
right here that was contained here

518
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:57,230
before I like there are there are nets

519
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:59,750
in this area that I don't know what they

520
00:24:57,230 --> 00:25:00,679
go to here I know exactly where

521
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:06,340
everything's going and how it's

522
00:25:00,679 --> 00:25:09,980
formatted same thing on the other side

523
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:11,840
it once you clean up those those power

524
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:14,000
pins and your oscillators and your

525
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:19,790
communication pins it all flows really

526
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:23,240
nicely okay one last little tidbit when

527
00:25:19,790 --> 00:25:25,820
you have an IC that has a bunch of pins

528
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:29,360
that you're not using you want to make

529
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:34,550
sure that you list those as spares on

530
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:35,840
the last page so this is really just

531
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:38,090
demonstrating there was you know there

532
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:41,899
was some number of spares for the first

533
00:25:38,090 --> 00:25:42,949
atmega chip and now when I'm redoing my

534
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:44,600
schematic that's like oh I need that

535
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:46,400
additional functionality I can just jump

536
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:50,149
to the last page and look at exactly why

537
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:57,290
I need that or you know what pins are

538
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:58,790
left available to me so that's it

539
00:25:57,290 --> 00:26:01,370
thank you very much for listening to me

540
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:03,500
rant I hope that you had fun I hope that

541
00:26:01,370 --> 00:26:05,149
you learned some things today are there

542
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:14,840
any questions about schematic design

543
00:26:05,150 --> 00:26:18,020
before I go so it's if you are either

544
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:20,689
copying your schematics or you are like

545
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:22,340
on a copy machine or even it's just an

546
00:26:20,690 --> 00:26:24,350
image you don't have access to the

547
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:26,080
original schematic and your your copying

548
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:28,699
pasting that a PNG and you get

549
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:31,129
artifacting that artifacting when it's

550
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:32,960
across a point like that can actually

551
00:26:31,130 --> 00:26:35,179
build up and it begins to look like an

552
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:37,460
electrical connection and so it's a it's

553
00:26:35,179 --> 00:26:39,440
a way of very safely making sure that

554
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:40,610
not only are you clearly communicating

555
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,350
when there is and when there is not

556
00:26:40,610 --> 00:26:42,969
across but also you don't get

557
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:46,270
artifacting

558
00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:48,100
from later all right thanks everyone if

559
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:50,350
you want to get a hold of me the slides

560
00:26:48,100 --> 00:27:04,570
will be available and that's my contact

561
00:26:50,350 --> 00:27:12,158
info thank you very much I really like

562
00:27:04,570 --> 00:27:19,840
ikat it's that's kilo India that's

563
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:21,309
Charlie Alpha Delta Eagle is no longer a

564
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:23,639
community favorite but it's still very

565
00:27:21,309 --> 00:27:23,639
popular

566
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:28,260
pretty much anything is better than

567
00:27:25,870 --> 00:27:28,260
physio
