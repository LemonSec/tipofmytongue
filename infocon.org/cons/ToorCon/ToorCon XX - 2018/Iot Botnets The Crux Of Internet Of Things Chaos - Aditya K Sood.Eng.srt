1
00:00:01,670 --> 00:00:09,690
hello hello hi good afternoon I am happy

2
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:12,838
to introduce Adi Sood who's going to be

3
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:14,820
speaking on IOT botnets the crux of

4
00:00:12,839 --> 00:00:25,380
Internet of Things chaos please give a

5
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:27,240
warm torque on welcome to Adi first of

6
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:29,220
all welcome everyone and thanks for

7
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:31,139
taking time to attend this job I think

8
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:33,210
for the next 40 to 45 minutes hopefully

9
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:35,640
we're gonna have a good topic in a hand

10
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:36,780
to discus and let's get it started so

11
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:39,000
today we're gonna talk about in the

12
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:40,560
context trough IOT botnets and we're

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,760
gonna delve into you know a couple of

14
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:44,130
the botanist said we have analyzed

15
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:46,379
earlier techniques tactics exploration

16
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:47,730
mechanisms and then we have a few videos

17
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:49,290
down the lane try to give you a feel

18
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:52,230
that what you are talking about is

19
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:55,680
really happening so little background on

20
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:57,599
mind just try to get you understand you

21
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:00,150
know what I belong what I do as a part

22
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,710
of my research so I drafted a book

23
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:03,600
called structure cyber attacks called

24
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:06,390
published in Chinese as well but just

25
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,579
just like you know idealistic approach

26
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:11,490
of you know how to go after analyze the

27
00:01:08,579 --> 00:01:13,649
cyber attacks and everything so I mean

28
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:14,880
only a little disclaimer and the idea

29
00:01:13,649 --> 00:01:18,090
behind this like all the research that

30
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:20,460
we gonna talk and this or we're gonna

31
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:21,240
present during the course of this

32
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:23,009
timeline

33
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:24,390
it's nothing relates to the unemploy and

34
00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:26,460
the reason for that is because this is a

35
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:28,320
kind of walk that is being done your

36
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:29,759
free time as a motivation to share

37
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:33,178
intelligence with the security to such

38
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:36,469
community and stuff like that so the one

39
00:01:33,179 --> 00:01:39,090
I get it associated with the employers

40
00:01:36,469 --> 00:01:41,818
so let's get into it so this is a

41
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:44,159
realistic picture of our II World these

42
00:01:41,819 --> 00:01:45,749
dis days so what that means is like you

43
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:48,060
know more of that these end devices are

44
00:01:45,749 --> 00:01:49,679
interconnected in nature and we'll take

45
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:51,389
a deep dive into later on as well the

46
00:01:49,679 --> 00:01:53,689
idea behind is that you know data

47
00:01:51,389 --> 00:01:56,189
movement is happening at a rapid pace

48
00:01:53,689 --> 00:01:58,408
the devices that have increased signal

49
00:01:56,189 --> 00:02:00,208
is significantly exponential data

50
00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:02,130
processing storage movement is

51
00:02:00,209 --> 00:02:03,840
exponential these days and the reason

52
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:05,789
behind that is that with a revolution

53
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,979
call him a mobile revolution in the last

54
00:02:05,789 --> 00:02:08,729
couple of years you know more and more

55
00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:10,289
devices

56
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:12,840
you know exist and they are

57
00:02:10,289 --> 00:02:14,670
interconnected one internet different

58
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:16,040
protocols Bluetooth and all that

59
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:18,569
there's an interconnectivity somewhere

60
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:20,400
that means that you know attack surface

61
00:02:18,569 --> 00:02:22,349
is getting enlarged and that is a more

62
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:26,340
important part where the adversary's or

63
00:02:22,349 --> 00:02:29,730
nefarious actors are going after and

64
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:31,260
only a little bit this research layout

65
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:33,450
here which actually gives you a glimpse

66
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:35,519
how it looks like it's a couple of years

67
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:37,619
back we're talking about in 2000 and all

68
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:40,050
that you know we just talked about like

69
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:42,030
point five billion of devices while now

70
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:44,640
within a last 10 or 20 years we are

71
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:47,670
talking about close to 50 billion which

72
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:50,069
is gonna be by 2020 so you can expect

73
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:52,980
that how much or how much the number has

74
00:02:50,069 --> 00:02:55,260
increased tremendously which means that

75
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:59,488
these devices are interconnected so as

76
00:02:55,260 --> 00:03:01,649
the attack surface is increased and for

77
00:02:59,489 --> 00:03:03,360
people like you know adversary's are

78
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:05,580
sitting on the internet believe in just

79
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,080
pawning the systems and all that it is a

80
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:10,110
kind of launch pad that you want to go

81
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:12,090
after right more devices easy to form

82
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:14,700
botnets easy to go after the large

83
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:16,350
section of the people on the internet

84
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:18,720
and then perform you know sort of

85
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:19,769
nefarious operations but that actually

86
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,390
is a picture that's where we're gonna

87
00:03:19,769 --> 00:03:23,040
draft you know when we try to talk about

88
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:25,500
threat models and all that we want to

89
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:27,179
see that with the passage of time what

90
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:32,010
has been changed what has been increased

91
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:33,930
and moving farther forward so let's

92
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:37,078
little bit talk about Internet of Things

93
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:38,579
right in a different terminology

94
00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:41,040
sometimes we call this Internet of

95
00:03:38,579 --> 00:03:42,630
Things some people call is i t+ o T

96
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:44,190
depending on the things I think but

97
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:47,340
there is not enough clarity on that part

98
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:48,930
like it's just generic outline there

99
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:50,730
Internet of Things everything is

100
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:53,130
comprised into it because these things

101
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:54,450
have interfaces that are connected on

102
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:57,420
the Internet and they are communicating

103
00:03:54,450 --> 00:04:00,869
between each other but again we live in

104
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:03,328
this world and all of that and just a

105
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:05,819
few minutes later we're gonna just get

106
00:04:03,329 --> 00:04:07,590
about a taxonomy so that we can dissect

107
00:04:05,819 --> 00:04:09,089
it accordingly because we need to go

108
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:10,799
after architecture we need to go after

109
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:13,560
either device type or we need to go

110
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:16,048
after exploitation scenarios so let's

111
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:17,850
get it started so this is a couple of

112
00:04:16,048 --> 00:04:19,649
snapshot I took it from the media

113
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:23,190
outlets to give you the reality of the

114
00:04:19,649 --> 00:04:25,739
IOT space right security is nothing is

115
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:27,690
not new but the question is are we

116
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:28,720
really doing it that's the question that

117
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:30,070
is in front of

118
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,840
so you look at a couple of these news

119
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:33,760
articles they talk about different IOT

120
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,590
botnets that came to exist and these was

121
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:38,140
a mere I won there was the first one the

122
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:39,940
major one but then there is a Reaper IOT

123
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:43,120
bots you know Jencks pod and all that

124
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:45,370
what it interprets is threats are real

125
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:47,050
you know attackers are really going

126
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:49,000
after these devices right whether it's

127
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:50,080
routers or switches whether it's the

128
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,510
kind of you know audio video

129
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:55,180
conferencing systems all of those kind

130
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:58,120
of any smart device use a refrigerator

131
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:59,830
you know is like you know other systems

132
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:01,690
that are connected on the internet that

133
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:04,240
is a potential target for the ayah you

134
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:08,050
know attackers to go after but the

135
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:09,760
tracks are real so before moving further

136
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:12,130
I think is really important to

137
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:14,320
understand the taxonomy here and why it

138
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:15,880
is important because the way malicious

139
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,830
code is written they have to come up

140
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:20,530
after certain kind of stringencies which

141
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:22,390
mean that you want to drive a code which

142
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:24,070
work on all sort of platforms and

143
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:26,140
because when they run or when the

144
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:28,150
conduct broad base attack the challenge

145
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:29,800
there is they really want to go after a

146
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:32,289
scenario where they just you know

147
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:34,180
distribute the code let it run and there

148
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:35,770
should not be any kind of constraints by

149
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:38,410
going after different device types and

150
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:39,880
all that so looking into their stripe

151
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:41,560
you know you can build like different

152
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:44,560
kind of taxonomy either it can be a

153
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:46,840
based on device type you can be having a

154
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,160
code drafted based on architecture or

155
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:49,599
different characteristics and

156
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,280
functionality right you know you

157
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,620
compromise certain set of devices what

158
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:55,840
you are going to use for those devices

159
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:57,730
for network communication are sort of

160
00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:00,159
things like that but what we have seen

161
00:05:57,730 --> 00:06:02,100
recently apart most of the malware

162
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,330
authors they are really gonna go after

163
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:06,760
architecture specific old rather than

164
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:07,750
some sort of device type because what

165
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:09,460
they're doing is like they want to

166
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:11,710
really go after underlying you bedded

167
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:14,169
firmware whether it's an X x86 platform

168
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:16,690
or any kind of platform and that makes

169
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:19,180
them easier to draft the code and rutan

170
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:20,710
on a continuously period of time if they

171
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:22,150
go off the standard device type okay

172
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:24,219
this is only gonna go after like

173
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:26,530
standard kind of Cisco switches or I can

174
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:28,630
hawai routers and all that those kind of

175
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:30,549
attacks also persist but when they

176
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:32,140
really need to go after millions of

177
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:35,200
devices they have to make a code which

178
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:36,729
is kind of not device dependent like

179
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:39,700
device type dependent but morally or

180
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:41,469
more on the functionality stipe or you

181
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:43,179
know architecture type

182
00:06:41,469 --> 00:06:46,119
so let's just go through a little bit of

183
00:06:43,179 --> 00:06:47,859
the IOT IOT botnet attack model the very

184
00:06:46,119 --> 00:06:50,409
simple thing is that okay distribute the

185
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:52,089
code when I say about in the earlier

186
00:06:50,409 --> 00:06:53,438
text sauna me we discuss about you know

187
00:06:52,089 --> 00:06:55,749
they don't gonna have to device die but

188
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:57,129
most off like architecture type so you

189
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:59,469
can see that they have switches they can

190
00:06:57,129 --> 00:07:01,569
be having a video cameras stuff like

191
00:06:59,469 --> 00:07:03,069
that a different set of routers the

192
00:07:01,569 --> 00:07:05,499
caution is that distribute the code get

193
00:07:03,069 --> 00:07:06,879
this system compromised build the botnet

194
00:07:05,499 --> 00:07:09,339
and then start launching the attacks

195
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:11,529
they want to do one of the easiest

196
00:07:09,339 --> 00:07:12,789
interpretation of the way IOT botnets

197
00:07:11,529 --> 00:07:15,009
are build is like you know the

198
00:07:12,789 --> 00:07:18,579
compromised devices are used for

199
00:07:15,009 --> 00:07:20,199
triggering chain attacks as well what I

200
00:07:18,579 --> 00:07:22,029
mean by that is that you know once we

201
00:07:20,199 --> 00:07:24,039
have a set of hundred or 200 kind of

202
00:07:22,029 --> 00:07:25,899
compromised devices they can launch an

203
00:07:24,039 --> 00:07:28,839
attack and try to build or formulate

204
00:07:25,899 --> 00:07:30,519
wood BOTS into it because by launching

205
00:07:28,839 --> 00:07:33,009
telnet scans stuff like that and we're

206
00:07:30,519 --> 00:07:36,550
gonna show it in a demo down the line as

207
00:07:33,009 --> 00:07:38,379
well but considering like this turn any

208
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:39,759
threat modeling anyone who wants to do

209
00:07:38,379 --> 00:07:41,469
in the field of security I think

210
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:43,689
taxonomy is the most important part to

211
00:07:41,469 --> 00:07:45,639
go after because they exactly gives you

212
00:07:43,689 --> 00:07:48,129
the idea how are you really going to

213
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:50,919
dissect a one specific space in the

214
00:07:48,129 --> 00:07:52,839
security so we talked about IOT taxonomy

215
00:07:50,919 --> 00:07:54,849
we held it a little bit you know going

216
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:57,099
through the IOT botnet attack model and

217
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:59,498
all that let's just take a quick look on

218
00:07:57,099 --> 00:08:00,909
to how compromised IOT devices are being

219
00:07:59,499 --> 00:08:02,379
used of course building botnets

220
00:08:00,909 --> 00:08:04,659
launching distributed denial of service

221
00:08:02,379 --> 00:08:06,309
attacks we've been talking about you

222
00:08:04,659 --> 00:08:09,639
know Bitcoin mining these days as well

223
00:08:06,309 --> 00:08:10,899
they are used for mining as well one of

224
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:13,179
the interesting scenario where they

225
00:08:10,899 --> 00:08:14,979
build a stealthy attack flow is to you

226
00:08:13,179 --> 00:08:18,609
transform your routers transform your IT

227
00:08:14,979 --> 00:08:20,378
devices into a stealthy proxy which

228
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:22,059
means that okay they have socks you can

229
00:08:20,379 --> 00:08:25,269
set up a reverse proxy once you go

230
00:08:22,059 --> 00:08:26,349
through it you can get it done and then

231
00:08:25,269 --> 00:08:28,300
it is of course mining cryptocurrency

232
00:08:26,349 --> 00:08:30,308
and several other kind of you know

233
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:31,680
nefarious operations that they love to

234
00:08:30,309 --> 00:08:34,240
perform because

235
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:36,188
devices don't belong to them they have

236
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,568
the power they have everything up they

237
00:08:36,188 --> 00:08:39,250
want to perform certain activities on

238
00:08:37,568 --> 00:08:43,389
the internet that result in financial

239
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:45,339
gains or maybe for fun purposes but that

240
00:08:43,389 --> 00:08:47,500
is the idea of you know how the taxonomy

241
00:08:45,339 --> 00:08:49,089
I already bought an attack model and how

242
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:52,959
it looks like to be a compromised IOT

243
00:08:49,089 --> 00:08:54,760
devices now before moving further you

244
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:57,280
know the way we have drafted

245
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:58,930
going after the stock is you know based

246
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:00,520
on reverse engineering that we performed

247
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:01,329
you know analyze the code samples and

248
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:03,370
stuff like that

249
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:05,320
we have pick up the code samples where

250
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:07,720
that particular technique is implemented

251
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:09,400
and we're just gonna discuss that

252
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:11,560
technique look again the code and some

253
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:14,020
of stuff like that the idea behind this

254
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:15,939
layout is because we want to see hey we

255
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:17,610
have analyzed the real set of code the

256
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:21,340
techniques that we're gonna discuss is

257
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:24,760
really exist in the wild so let's take a

258
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:26,290
look at it the first one is that so

259
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:28,569
we're gonna connect the dots as well

260
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:30,670
which we discussed earlier so in the IOT

261
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:32,350
taxonomy part net exon we talked about

262
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:34,770
okay they want to go after or formulate

263
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:36,280
a call code which is basically

264
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:38,380
architecture-specific

265
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:40,600
which means that they have to do the

266
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:42,340
cross-platform compilation without that

267
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:44,320
it's really hard because you can have a

268
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:46,540
code on x86 but it's not gonna run might

269
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:48,580
be on the MEPS architecture so they need

270
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:50,949
some kind of you know harness the power

271
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:52,590
of you know open source projects you

272
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:55,480
know build it and then do the

273
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:57,010
cross-platform compilation and couple of

274
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:58,900
the Mira variants we're gonna talk about

275
00:09:57,010 --> 00:10:00,760
a little later as well so you can look

276
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:02,620
at this one code snippets what they're

277
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:05,050
trying to do is like we are going to

278
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:06,130
different architectures and stuff like

279
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:08,109
that and they are building the

280
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:11,740
boundaries using that whether it's arm

281
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:13,960
whether it's x86 MIPS spar PowerPC or

282
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:15,640
whatever it is right and then they have

283
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:17,140
a separate code how they gonna fetch the

284
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:19,689
payloads and bins and all that but

285
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:22,960
cross-platform compilation compilation

286
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:26,380
is a very important aspect for you know

287
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:27,580
malware authors disease let's take a

288
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:29,290
look further into different

289
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:30,940
functionality we call as like you know

290
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:33,370
distributed denial-of-service functions

291
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:34,870
of course once you build the botnets you

292
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:37,410
really wanna launch some set of attacks

293
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:39,820
right because as these are bought

294
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:41,439
formulating a botnet of course

295
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:43,750
distributed denial of service attacks

296
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:45,820
gonna be there and when we analyze there

297
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:48,280
can be multiple though DDoS attack can

298
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:50,380
be at a layer 3 or 4 which is TCP UDP or

299
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:54,370
IP layer and then they can be at the TCP

300
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:56,050
layer 7 which is HTTP layer so they can

301
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:57,910
go after like you know send flooding

302
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:59,439
different kind of set but they have this

303
00:10:57,910 --> 00:11:00,640
built in functionality and this code

304
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,830
actually tells that how they actually

305
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:05,050
fought the process and then they can

306
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:06,520
have it in a chain reaction trigger you

307
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:08,709
know give the guidance to the different

308
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:11,260
bots there and trigger the attack

309
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:12,910
on our dedicated target but this is

310
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:14,860
their you know they are actually going

311
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:16,990
after this kind of functionality DDoS is

312
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:20,320
not nothing new but the important part

313
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:21,910
is that is still persist and that's why

314
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,290
whatever the new botnet that are being

315
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:26,500
formed they still have this

316
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:27,910
functionality taking a little deeper

317
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:29,620
looking into kind of different kind of

318
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:31,839
denial of service attack various you

319
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:33,730
know there can be TCP attack UDP you

320
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:35,380
know that's a talk about either it can

321
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:36,970
be other layer three or four or can be

322
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:40,500
at the layer seven of the tcp/ip model

323
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:42,850
but it works pretty well right you know

324
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:45,220
basically attackers they just simply

325
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:47,020
compromised the system and this is gonna

326
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:48,580
go after because they can harness the

327
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:52,120
power of that system and do whatever

328
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:54,370
they want to do on the internet but this

329
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:56,620
is like this is kind of like a de-facto

330
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:59,050
standard most of the botnets whether it

331
00:11:56,620 --> 00:12:04,120
belongs to IOT or it belongs to any kind

332
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:07,599
of different sphere now let's go further

333
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:09,520
and talk about bot kill what I mean what

334
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,140
this technique is all about you know we

335
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:13,120
always talk about you know fights going

336
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:15,730
on and all that but you know there are

337
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:17,320
bot Wars also exists in the space where

338
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:19,510
different adversary's form different

339
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:21,640
botnets right and they want to make sure

340
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:24,250
that their control is much more than the

341
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:26,020
other person which means that they have

342
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:27,100
to draft a code in such a way let's say

343
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:28,779
they install it owner one of the

344
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:30,580
compromised system they have to actually

345
00:12:28,779 --> 00:12:33,070
scan through the listed processes or

346
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:34,240
some other artifacts on the system to

347
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:36,400
make sure that this particular

348
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:39,430
compromised devices doesn't belong to

349
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:41,650
any other botnet if it does just go

350
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:44,410
ahead trigger the commands kill it make

351
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:46,600
it yours which means that these guys are

352
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:49,060
performing Wars as well right and this

353
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:50,500
technique actually we use just doing so

354
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:53,800
they are actually scanning and some of

355
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:55,900
the you know binary checks and all that

356
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:58,240
and then they found that okay this

357
00:12:55,900 --> 00:13:00,189
compromised device does it belong to me

358
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:03,670
but I found an artifacts that is from

359
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:05,740
different botnet kill those things make

360
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:08,640
you know either reboot or form other set

361
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:11,050
of functionalities to control that

362
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:11,920
compromised system and make it a part of

363
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:13,510
your own botnet

364
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:16,300
so BOTS kill is in a very important

365
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:17,560
feature even like you know the way of

366
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:20,349
malicious code is designed in the

367
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:22,329
underground community another

368
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:22,570
interesting technique they actually used

369
00:13:22,329 --> 00:13:24,459
to

370
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:26,710
after is a kill all functionality right

371
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:28,450
sometimes okay they are going after you

372
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:30,400
know they are scanning the processes

373
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:32,260
looking into different indicators in the

374
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:34,780
system but then they found that there is

375
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:36,189
no way to actually kill that infection

376
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:37,930
so what they can also do is like you

377
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:40,240
just simply go ahead kill the standard

378
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:42,310
processes reboot the system and try to

379
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:44,440
see if they can you know others other

380
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:46,869
bought that is sitting somewhere can we

381
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:49,630
scan it get it back into that system and

382
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:51,400
that make it a part of it but again this

383
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:52,630
is a kind of very interesting technique

384
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:54,370
as well just go ahead and kill

385
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:55,990
everything up get a complete control and

386
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:58,480
then from there on let's just roll the

387
00:13:55,990 --> 00:14:01,330
infections in different way but that's

388
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,740
the way it is being done but these are

389
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:06,010
the kind of standard functionalities

390
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:09,760
that these bots and inherent malicious

391
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:12,250
code has built in of course moving

392
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:13,960
forward reverse shell very much

393
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:15,490
important because some sometimes what

394
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:16,840
happened you know we have a network

395
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:18,340
parameter devices

396
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:20,170
you know lined up you know and there's

397
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:22,660
ingress egress filtering is going on

398
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:24,550
ports might get closed and all that so

399
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:26,709
attackers or adversary's they don't know

400
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:28,599
lose the control right so what they come

401
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:30,670
up with a different technique I mean you

402
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:32,670
know this is also a technique that is

403
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:35,349
being opted by different botnets as well

404
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:37,089
it's just like implement a reverse shell

405
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:39,010
why either socks proxy or some other

406
00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:40,240
kind of thing what it means is it

407
00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:41,500
actually helps them to bypass the

408
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,810
scenario because the connection is

409
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:46,090
initiated by a reverse shell rather than

410
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:47,650
a direct connection from in to external

411
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:49,120
to internal which is you know with the

412
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:53,740
firewalls and other natural parameter

413
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:55,090
devices is not possible but this code

414
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:57,460
actually states that you know some of

415
00:14:55,090 --> 00:14:58,630
the barniz you know basically IOT board

416
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:59,410
they also come up with this kind of

417
00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:01,510
functionality

418
00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:03,219
you know trigger a reverse shell so that

419
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:05,260
the attackers still have a control over

420
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:07,150
that and whatever the updates they want

421
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:12,250
to perform and things like that is can

422
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:13,840
go ahead and do it now now we are trying

423
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:15,580
to look into a little bit of different

424
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:18,310
you know functionalities from the

425
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:19,810
perspective of how the you know when

426
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:22,030
they are writing this malicious code and

427
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:25,150
all that you know you sometimes people

428
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:28,660
there is no fun of reinventing the wheel

429
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:30,280
right and that's why from this part of

430
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:32,260
analogy it comes up like you know

431
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:33,970
adversary's they actually draft a code

432
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:36,130
and actually harness the power of open

433
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:37,450
source packages as well maybe we have

434
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:39,430
seen like they were directly picking

435
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:41,680
that you know roba package directly from

436
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:44,469
the github embedded run the scripts and

437
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:46,660
perform the function functionality so

438
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:48,250
what we have seen earlier or even it

439
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:50,589
right now couple of these standard

440
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:52,780
packages that are open source one with

441
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:55,540
the you know smaller size compressed

442
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:58,120
ones are being used heavily busybox

443
00:15:55,540 --> 00:16:01,630
heavily used because it's gonna give you

444
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:03,250
the portable binary you know power where

445
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:05,170
you can actually simply call busy box

446
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:08,950
and then you know run different set of

447
00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:11,229
commands but it's being heavily used so

448
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:13,330
busy box package open source one you

449
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:15,250
know you get the compiled binary call it

450
00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:17,680
call functions trigger it in the form

451
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:20,440
where and then actually run different

452
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:22,300
things another one interesting software

453
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:26,050
package is a drop your ssh right it's a

454
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:29,800
very you know custom very compact you

455
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:32,229
know ssh client server binary right and

456
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:34,000
again the idea again this part is that

457
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:36,940
somewhere some part of i'm where they

458
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,260
want to open an sss port or some kind of

459
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:39,820
those activity basically they have to

460
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:41,830
perform a remote administration at the

461
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:43,210
end of the day with that they really

462
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:45,010
need some kind of you know remote access

463
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:47,020
protocol to be in place either it can be

464
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:50,110
talent or they really want to say that

465
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:52,480
hey I need SSH access into that so they

466
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:54,520
really harness the power of this package

467
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:57,220
as well so we take a look at down the

468
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:59,890
line in our video demonstration but

469
00:16:57,220 --> 00:17:01,300
these things these packages are really

470
00:16:59,890 --> 00:17:03,819
really important from their point of

471
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:05,859
view because just call them directly

472
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:07,330
enhance the functionality of the bot and

473
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:10,349
perform whatever the operations they

474
00:17:07,329 --> 00:17:12,970
want to in an unauthorized fashion

475
00:17:10,349 --> 00:17:14,469
another interesting scenario so we're

476
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:17,020
gonna connect the dot back to the our

477
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:19,569
IOT botnet economy where we talked about

478
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:21,240
okay whenever they want to draft a code

479
00:17:19,569 --> 00:17:23,500
they actually want to go after

480
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:26,020
architecture-specific code before which

481
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:28,270
they have to do the cross-platform

482
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:30,639
compilation right but how they can do it

483
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:33,160
still the answer is the open source

484
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:35,650
packages that are available nonetheless

485
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:37,510
these packages are not bad they are you

486
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:39,520
know design for some specific set of

487
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:41,830
functionalities but again is the you

488
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:43,840
know it's the way that our cyber world

489
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:46,090
works some of the good things can be

490
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:48,399
abused in a different way to perform you

491
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:49,030
know unwanted operations so with the a

492
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,830
barrage

493
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:52,270
Linux and all that the way is his being

494
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:54,580
designed you can still compile the

495
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:57,220
boundary in a cross-platform way and

496
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:59,110
then just call the binary you know call

497
00:17:57,220 --> 00:18:00,700
the functions compile it and then you

498
00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:02,350
have the binary available you can run it

499
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:03,820
and run it on any architecture it will

500
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:06,850
pick up the artifacts from that system

501
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:08,379
and it won't stop and it will install

502
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:12,070
that's way how the malicious code is

503
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:13,600
being done because sometimes the way

504
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:15,340
botnets are performed they might not

505
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,719
gonna go after targeted attacks like

506
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:18,370
when we talk about targeted attacks

507
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,770
earlier we're going after you know

508
00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:23,320
people going after specific organization

509
00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:25,180
or some kind of a different set of

510
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:26,679
people's right but when the broad base

511
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:28,900
attacks are there you know they want to

512
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:31,000
go after thousands of routers you know

513
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:32,680
millions of IOT devices this is one I

514
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:36,040
run it on the blind write whatever comes

515
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:39,220
in forms the botnet go after and do the

516
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:41,320
you know unauthorized operations but

517
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:43,540
three packages apart from standard Linux

518
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:45,580
utilities like W GATT girl and all that

519
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:47,080
you know these three packages drop your

520
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:49,720
SSH client busybox

521
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:53,080
and the aboriginal Linux one heavily use

522
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:54,730
these days and if you even in search you

523
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:56,679
know surf the internet within the last

524
00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:58,810
week and all that try to look into the

525
00:18:56,680 --> 00:19:03,400
news in the IOT space all people are

526
00:18:58,810 --> 00:19:06,429
calling about that and then further

527
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:08,020
right of course we know malicious code

528
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:09,160
is written in such a way you know people

529
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:11,110
want to have some kind of obvious

530
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:13,180
occasion on an encryption in place right

531
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:15,760
so if you perform reverse engineering it

532
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:17,890
just a bit hard to you know dissect the

533
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:19,990
code maybe it's just not in a kind of

534
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:21,760
advanced level after encryption that

535
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:23,680
these malware authors deploy in the

536
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:25,330
malicious code but again at the end of

537
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:27,340
the way they're some kind of things they

538
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:29,260
still deploy with respect to obvious

539
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:30,899
creation so while we analyzing the code

540
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:33,250
and all that

541
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:35,620
after pen testing certain servers where

542
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:36,970
we are able to get that code and you can

543
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:38,919
clearly see that this code actually

544
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:41,860
states layer they are using the you know

545
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:44,050
czar obvious keishon and all that might

546
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:46,120
not be that advanced but still it served

547
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:48,159
the purpose to some extent but they

548
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:52,449
definitely deploy data encryption and

549
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:55,210
obvious creation strategies as well now

550
00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:57,730
moving forward is like a device

551
00:19:55,210 --> 00:20:00,030
architecture detection we talked about

552
00:19:57,730 --> 00:20:02,820
okay we you compile the code in across

553
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:05,039
sorry cause cross-platform

554
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:06,809
we but before that when this like

555
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:08,970
Aboriginal was there and they found out

556
00:20:06,809 --> 00:20:11,070
that hey we can use this package to do

557
00:20:08,970 --> 00:20:12,630
this kind of functionality earlier they

558
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:14,759
still have some kind of embedded code in

559
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:16,710
place which means that before the

560
00:20:14,759 --> 00:20:18,179
standard code the malicious code the

561
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:19,470
payload actually going to run on the

562
00:20:18,179 --> 00:20:22,110
system they're gonna want to detect the

563
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:23,519
architecture again the idea is that they

564
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:25,769
don't wanna actually get detected and

565
00:20:23,519 --> 00:20:28,139
things like that so k if is x86 pick up

566
00:20:25,769 --> 00:20:31,019
the x86 called that code or use the W

567
00:20:28,139 --> 00:20:33,418
get to fetch on the x86 code download it

568
00:20:31,019 --> 00:20:33,990
run it and get it in fact it and things

569
00:20:33,419 --> 00:20:37,230
like that

570
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:39,509
but of course with the passage of time

571
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:41,159
you know things are getting enhanced

572
00:20:39,509 --> 00:20:45,240
more and more new techniques are coming

573
00:20:41,159 --> 00:20:47,070
up but this was a part of policy as well

574
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:50,850
the way they design the malicious code

575
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:52,189
earlier just try to give you a quick

576
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:54,719
feel of it

577
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:56,159
after analyzing couple of this IOT BOTS

578
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,769
and all that you know and ban your

579
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:59,970
strings so this is a couple of standard

580
00:20:57,769 --> 00:21:02,460
telnet and battery username and

581
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:05,129
passwords these guys love to go after

582
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:06,600
like you know telnet and let's stand

583
00:21:05,129 --> 00:21:08,309
their devices they pick it from like the

584
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:10,740
default passwords and all that build up

585
00:21:08,309 --> 00:21:12,149
the strings it can be either embedded in

586
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:14,639
the binary itself or it can be a

587
00:21:12,149 --> 00:21:17,008
separate file which they call and then

588
00:21:14,639 --> 00:21:18,539
you know trigger things beginning at the

589
00:21:17,009 --> 00:21:20,490
end of the day the important part in

590
00:21:18,539 --> 00:21:22,500
this context is that you know look at

591
00:21:20,490 --> 00:21:24,360
the way IOT bots are formed the

592
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:25,860
malicious boundaries so much into it

593
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:28,258
right different techniques we talked

594
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:30,330
about Gil Bok Gil bot we talked about

595
00:21:28,259 --> 00:21:32,909
you know they have a device architecture

596
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:35,340
detection code you know DDoS code and

597
00:21:32,909 --> 00:21:36,570
things like that again then it's because

598
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:39,209
they have to do the scanning they have

599
00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:42,689
to build bigger botnets so they actually

600
00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:45,330
have to go after other BOTS basically

601
00:21:42,690 --> 00:21:48,389
other systems on the internet so that it

602
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:49,620
can be a part of the primary bond so now

603
00:21:48,389 --> 00:21:50,908
let's take a look at it what I was

604
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:54,389
talking about here like how they gonna

605
00:21:50,909 --> 00:21:55,769
fetch the binaries and all that so lujah

606
00:21:54,389 --> 00:21:57,750
if you look at this particular code

607
00:21:55,769 --> 00:21:59,879
right it's a basically standard bash

608
00:21:57,750 --> 00:22:02,399
scripts that are being placed on that

609
00:21:59,879 --> 00:22:04,889
compromised devices allow it to run they

610
00:22:02,399 --> 00:22:06,389
can simply go here go after the you know

611
00:22:04,889 --> 00:22:08,729
remote domain which is being controlled

612
00:22:06,389 --> 00:22:09,870
by the attacker and what I mean by that

613
00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:11,760
is like you know attacker has a full

614
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:14,010
control they can deploy any code change

615
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:16,740
or I tree I trade the code as per his

616
00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:18,660
convenience so you just run that back

617
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:20,809
script on that system it's gonna fetch

618
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:22,950
the payloads from the remote location

619
00:22:20,809 --> 00:22:27,030
you can see that scan it's gonna change

620
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:28,500
the mood make it executable and tied

621
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:30,149
back to the architecture where there's

622
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:31,980
some EPS architecture and all that and

623
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:33,000
then clean it right away as well because

624
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:35,910
they don't want to have any kind of

625
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:38,700
leftover fodder there once they actually

626
00:22:35,910 --> 00:22:40,170
execute the code and this was the light

627
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:42,690
the thing that we really found out you

628
00:22:40,170 --> 00:22:44,880
know on the internet and all that or you

629
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:46,320
when you try to test certain domains and

630
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:49,350
all that you get some access to certain

631
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:51,840
code as well similarly on this benchmark

632
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:54,240
if you look at the another code little

633
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:56,550
bit differently but you can look at how

634
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:58,320
the how they actually constructed the

635
00:22:56,550 --> 00:23:00,120
resource the payload right the payload

636
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:03,750
is basically a simple I tration of the

637
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:06,540
three of a bed characters cubot and all

638
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:08,429
that so we talked about we're gonna look

639
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:10,020
a link down the lane as well so we

640
00:23:08,429 --> 00:23:11,460
analyzed Murray board but there was a

641
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:13,860
cue board as well with different

642
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:15,059
functionalities but you can clearly see

643
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:16,620
how they are actually you know

644
00:23:15,059 --> 00:23:19,559
structuring the payloads the naming

645
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:22,770
convention and all that you don't make

646
00:23:19,559 --> 00:23:24,360
it executable then go after delete it

647
00:23:22,770 --> 00:23:27,000
right away so that there will be no

648
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:28,469
choices on the system and ideas that you

649
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,480
can clearly see the way they were going

650
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:31,710
after they want the infections but they

651
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,970
don't want to have any traces on the

652
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:35,400
system as well you know if somebody

653
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:38,040
comes in and find that if we connect the

654
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:41,130
dot these kind of things also help the

655
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:42,678
advance attackers to actually beat the

656
00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:44,610
kill bot feature as well because

657
00:23:42,679 --> 00:23:46,500
sometimes they want to look at certain

658
00:23:44,610 --> 00:23:48,300
you know standard indicators which might

659
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:50,670
not be there because after the execution

660
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:52,559
they have removed it so it's a kind of

661
00:23:50,670 --> 00:23:54,570
arms race which we always used to call

662
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:57,990
right you know somebody has to get it

663
00:23:54,570 --> 00:24:01,889
done somebody's behind but it's an arms

664
00:23:57,990 --> 00:24:04,260
race at the end of the day let's take a

665
00:24:01,890 --> 00:24:07,020
look at all things so we discuss about

666
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:08,790
kill all functionality earlier but they

667
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:11,010
can also implement that functionality in

668
00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:12,809
the form of scripts as well so you can

669
00:24:11,010 --> 00:24:14,250
clear this is a simple bash script you

670
00:24:12,809 --> 00:24:15,809
know performing cert kind of you know

671
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:18,059
process operation may be scanning

672
00:24:15,809 --> 00:24:20,190
through the process list performing some

673
00:24:18,059 --> 00:24:22,290
kind of operations to make sure that no

674
00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:24,179
traces are there if they don't find any

675
00:24:22,290 --> 00:24:26,610
traces go after and kill it or one a

676
00:24:24,179 --> 00:24:28,410
clean system I was rebooted and because

677
00:24:26,610 --> 00:24:30,959
I have a multiple BOTS running it

678
00:24:28,410 --> 00:24:33,870
differently and this was a part of

679
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:35,970
Borden and I can rescan it reboot it and

680
00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:37,469
then I can get it access to that device

681
00:24:35,970 --> 00:24:39,830
again so these kind of different

682
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:42,510
functionalities keep on persisting and

683
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:44,279
that's the way they are able to build

684
00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:46,500
botnets and they are still able to go

685
00:24:44,279 --> 00:24:48,779
after building botnets every day despite

686
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:54,059
we think we have done enough in security

687
00:24:48,779 --> 00:24:56,309
but exactly that's not the case so again

688
00:24:54,059 --> 00:24:58,830
another variant of the same kill all

689
00:24:56,309 --> 00:25:00,779
functionality you can clearly sees how

690
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:02,908
the bash script is being called and all

691
00:25:00,779 --> 00:25:05,669
that and they are actually on the left

692
00:25:02,909 --> 00:25:08,640
side going after sent OS ss daemon and

693
00:25:05,669 --> 00:25:11,700
then performing some logic do you know

694
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:13,500
to make sure the infections awry so the

695
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:14,880
whole purpose of showing you the code

696
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:17,940
during the course of this presentation

697
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:20,250
is to make sure that we're just not only

698
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:21,929
talking about the techniques but exactly

699
00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:24,270
we have analyzed that in detail and

700
00:25:21,929 --> 00:25:27,539
there are there are standard evidences

701
00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:29,460
have a label which actually prove that

702
00:25:27,539 --> 00:25:33,080
these techniques are real and they are

703
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:36,230
exist in the real world so let's take a

704
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:39,120
little bit deep dive into the next part

705
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:41,309
so we're gonna you know refresh what we

706
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:43,350
have gone through in the last couple of

707
00:25:41,309 --> 00:25:46,289
slides and then we'll a little bit into

708
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:49,168
the real-world examples try to show you

709
00:25:46,289 --> 00:25:50,010
that you know the stuff exists and how

710
00:25:49,169 --> 00:25:52,500
bad it is

711
00:25:50,010 --> 00:25:54,210
even from the Incident Response point of

712
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:55,590
view whether you're doing security

713
00:25:54,210 --> 00:25:58,220
assessment of certain devices and all

714
00:25:55,590 --> 00:26:00,449
that how these attacks do look like

715
00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:02,640
differently when you're analyzing at the

716
00:26:00,450 --> 00:26:05,610
network level all your analyzing on the

717
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:06,960
low-level debug code and all that so

718
00:26:05,610 --> 00:26:09,059
wanna start with you know we there's

719
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:10,559
certain variants came to exist like you

720
00:26:09,059 --> 00:26:13,020
know a few years back but Mira was the

721
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:15,710
most important one which actually sets

722
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:17,760
the baseline to build more IOT BOTS

723
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:19,789
somehow the source code got leaked

724
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:22,860
earlier and the people picking that code

725
00:26:19,789 --> 00:26:24,840
again if we connect the door nobody

726
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:26,908
wants to reinvent the wheel just

727
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:28,620
transform it in into add more code and

728
00:26:26,909 --> 00:26:31,890
write you know kind of deploy mode sees

729
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:34,529
like C code Python code and all that

730
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:37,320
shall script just enhance it and just go

731
00:26:34,529 --> 00:26:41,190
ahead and and deploy it and we'll take a

732
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:43,770
look into that as well so just to

733
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:44,850
reiterate what we have gone through when

734
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:46,860
I go through the acts

735
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:49,080
and flow model here you know the idea is

736
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:51,479
to compromise the device go ahead

737
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:54,000
fetch the malicious payload of course

738
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:55,590
obtain system privileges by exploiting a

739
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,690
vulnerability performing some privilege

740
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:59,730
escalation on the system of course

741
00:26:57,690 --> 00:27:01,560
launch attacks I mean you got comm

742
00:26:59,730 --> 00:27:04,830
system got compromised they have to

743
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:06,990
launch attacks and expand the botnet and

744
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:08,610
at the end of the day once you expand

745
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:10,200
your botnet whether you want to use it

746
00:27:08,610 --> 00:27:12,479
for financial gains whether you want to

747
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:13,950
use it for some different purposes like

748
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:16,020
in the underground cyber community they

749
00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:17,430
can rent this botnet out to performs you

750
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:19,680
know different set of attacks you know

751
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:21,840
triggered some fishing different kind of

752
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:25,170
things they can perform and this is like

753
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:28,470
renting a botnet as well but we got a we

754
00:27:25,170 --> 00:27:31,170
got like a kind of bit of easy feel that

755
00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:33,140
how the execution flow model works but

756
00:27:31,170 --> 00:27:36,360
the next that we want to go after is

757
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:37,530
some of the real-world examples there

758
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:39,270
will be some screenshots where these

759
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:41,850
screenshots are taken when we perform

760
00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:43,980
the security assessments and how we get

761
00:27:41,850 --> 00:27:45,389
in excess to those domains we download

762
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:46,080
the malware and there's some different

763
00:27:45,390 --> 00:27:48,450
analysis

764
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:50,760
try to get a feel of it so different

765
00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:52,410
techniques were operate because if you

766
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:54,090
really want to go after analyzing a

767
00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:55,470
malware it's just not only a one

768
00:27:54,090 --> 00:27:57,209
technique that you have to go after like

769
00:27:55,470 --> 00:27:59,220
whether it's a static analysis dynamic

770
00:27:57,210 --> 00:28:01,500
analysis or you have to perform some

771
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:03,420
kind of you know security assessment of

772
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:04,410
the remote domains of course

773
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:08,460
intelligence-gathering

774
00:28:04,410 --> 00:28:09,930
you have to perform but it's a I always

775
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:11,130
call this as a multi-threading approach

776
00:28:09,930 --> 00:28:13,230
right do you have to have different

777
00:28:11,130 --> 00:28:15,680
analytical threads that has to be there

778
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:18,270
to come up with a standard strong

779
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:23,000
scenario so let's take a look the first

780
00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:25,889
one so if you look at this you know

781
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:27,120
slide here right so you can see that

782
00:28:25,890 --> 00:28:29,400
we're talking about here there's like

783
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:31,439
the variant call as a bleed Street of

784
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:34,350
course different architectures there's

785
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:37,380
an arm one arm five you know mips x86

786
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:39,060
and all that the question is how you get

787
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:41,250
used to it you know how you actually get

788
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:42,750
an access to this particular it means

789
00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:44,850
that many with different ways you can go

790
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:47,010
after you know some people these days

791
00:28:44,850 --> 00:28:48,629
you know I mean it was a technique known

792
00:28:47,010 --> 00:28:51,300
earlier they deploy honey ports as well

793
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:53,700
but they fetching but there are other

794
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:56,430
ways we can go after as you know find

795
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:56,820
these things out you know when you bend

796
00:28:56,430 --> 00:28:58,710
test

797
00:28:56,820 --> 00:29:00,090
you know remote CNC servers

798
00:28:58,710 --> 00:29:01,710
so you got some indicators from there

799
00:29:00,090 --> 00:29:04,529
you try to connect the dots go after a

800
00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:07,620
different remote domains you know get ID

801
00:29:04,529 --> 00:29:09,000
off it but apart from that the question

802
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:11,010
is that so you got the Nexus to the

803
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,690
domain which is hosting providing a

804
00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:14,700
directory listing of this different

805
00:29:12,690 --> 00:29:16,230
boundaries and if you can see that you

806
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:17,520
know once you run the file command and

807
00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:19,980
things like that you get a feel of it

808
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:23,340
which architect sure it belongs to and

809
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:24,450
it's all an executable because I did

810
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:26,428
really do want to go too too much into

811
00:29:24,450 --> 00:29:28,350
reverse engineering during the course of

812
00:29:26,429 --> 00:29:30,330
this talk so we did like basic checks

813
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:32,879
and all that to actually give you a feel

814
00:29:30,330 --> 00:29:34,918
that you know those are the infected

815
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:37,710
ones so so if you look at the strength

816
00:29:34,919 --> 00:29:40,320
check right the one that I have not

817
00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:41,880
shown here is uh I have basically

818
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:43,500
highlighted in red it's just like a

819
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:46,289
hard-coded IP address and that arm

820
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:48,059
bindery right so when that bond is going

821
00:29:46,289 --> 00:29:49,350
to execute in the compromised system is

822
00:29:48,059 --> 00:29:51,990
going to go to the attacker control

823
00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:54,449
domain fetch it from here and then get

824
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:56,880
all the malicious packages payloads dump

825
00:29:54,450 --> 00:29:58,169
on it install it and run on the

826
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:01,020
compromised device so while you perform

827
00:29:58,169 --> 00:30:02,010
analysis you get the access to that you

828
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:03,899
know at least you come to know about

829
00:30:02,010 --> 00:30:06,090
that IP address then you can start your

830
00:30:03,899 --> 00:30:09,389
assessment on that IP address you know

831
00:30:06,090 --> 00:30:11,820
from different sphere just enhancing the

832
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:16,110
same scenario with a latest example the

833
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:19,439
get Mira variant it is actually a attack

834
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:21,000
that is going on right now somehow I was

835
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:23,309
doing some research last night so we

836
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:25,950
came across this thing I don't want to

837
00:30:23,309 --> 00:30:28,470
show it in real time but it is this

838
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:29,580
attack is right now going in going on so

839
00:30:28,470 --> 00:30:31,980
you can see that once you get an access

840
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:34,289
to a again the directory listing but

841
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:36,450
there are different binary and you can

842
00:30:34,289 --> 00:30:38,850
clearly see there is one call as apache2

843
00:30:36,450 --> 00:30:41,490
as well which is gain a binary but then

844
00:30:38,850 --> 00:30:43,168
you can say there's a in fact idx t

845
00:30:41,490 --> 00:30:45,059
files all infections and sort of things

846
00:30:43,169 --> 00:30:47,820
like that which actually is a contains

847
00:30:45,059 --> 00:30:50,460
the racket of compromised iot devices or

848
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:54,960
the like agate devices they are going to

849
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:56,669
scan so you dump about you tube and then

850
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:57,899
you know you perform analysis little bit

851
00:30:56,669 --> 00:31:00,510
on strings and try to get an initial

852
00:30:57,899 --> 00:31:02,219
feel kind of stuff like that and then

853
00:31:00,510 --> 00:31:03,600
you do a little bit check on the

854
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:05,190
background with some intelligence feed

855
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:09,939
you get a feel of that okay this is a

856
00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:12,340
you know GAF ed murrow variant

857
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:14,590
and it has an embedded their shell

858
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:16,780
script and I want to show you that as a

859
00:31:14,590 --> 00:31:18,070
part of the demonstration so we're gonna

860
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:21,040
look at a very quick demo is a very

861
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:23,110
basic check we didn't know going to talk

862
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:24,850
about you know how we get the binaries

863
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:27,729
and stuff like that we had the binaries

864
00:31:24,850 --> 00:31:30,159
we want to show that how the things that

865
00:31:27,730 --> 00:31:33,300
look like when those are embedded in and

866
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:35,740
just let's take a look at the video

867
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:37,030
so we dumped the binaries from there the

868
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:39,190
three binaries we were talking about

869
00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:40,780
just try to run the file check it's

870
00:31:39,190 --> 00:31:43,330
gonna give you how it's being compiled

871
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:45,490
and all that but I was like weird am

872
00:31:43,330 --> 00:31:49,270
interested in Apache too because when

873
00:31:45,490 --> 00:31:51,130
the Experian a tak happened earlier it

874
00:31:49,270 --> 00:31:52,210
was a struts world ability so we would

875
00:31:51,130 --> 00:31:53,980
just want to check if they are building

876
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:55,990
the Apache binary is it just a

877
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:57,370
legitimate stuffs exploit or is just

878
00:31:55,990 --> 00:32:00,240
like kind of they're using this

879
00:31:57,370 --> 00:32:02,979
terminology to bypass certain scenarios

880
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:05,050
so you just simply run the strings try

881
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:07,180
to get little bit indicators so you see

882
00:32:05,050 --> 00:32:08,889
that I'm bad you see code is there we

883
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:10,630
were not interested in too much into it

884
00:32:08,890 --> 00:32:13,990
what we are looking for were is the

885
00:32:10,630 --> 00:32:17,920
embedded bash script into it okay we got

886
00:32:13,990 --> 00:32:20,160
access there's a firmware one keep on

887
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:20,160
scrolling

888
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:29,889
so there is started giving him some good

889
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:31,870
you know strengths here which we're

890
00:32:29,890 --> 00:32:34,270
going to look at you know ping pong my

891
00:32:31,870 --> 00:32:35,800
IP scanner stuff like that and now there

892
00:32:34,270 --> 00:32:37,480
is start supple you can see that couple

893
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:42,090
the embed your username passwords here

894
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:45,310
and then the show so somehow I have not

895
00:32:42,090 --> 00:32:47,260
actually I have actually let the IP

896
00:32:45,310 --> 00:32:49,030
address to stay there if you want to

897
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:51,820
perform some stuff down the lane you can

898
00:32:49,030 --> 00:32:53,530
go ahead and do it as well but the one I

899
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:55,030
delve into more reverse-engineering

900
00:32:53,530 --> 00:32:57,490
where you load the stuff into Ida Pro

901
00:32:55,030 --> 00:32:59,530
and do a static code but it gives you

902
00:32:57,490 --> 00:33:02,320
enough to believe that you know this

903
00:32:59,530 --> 00:33:03,970
Apache 2 binary is a problematic one and

904
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:08,710
how you really need to go to go after

905
00:33:03,970 --> 00:33:10,870
and perform next set of analysis so now

906
00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:12,460
we're just stacking connecting the dots

907
00:33:10,870 --> 00:33:14,830
back again we're checking the drop beer

908
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:17,530
binary it is there we checking W get it

909
00:33:14,830 --> 00:33:20,340
is there and things like that so these

910
00:33:17,530 --> 00:33:22,420
are like a quick and dirty analysis yeah

911
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:24,699
sometimes you have to go a little bit

912
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:26,470
more deeper into it but at the end of

913
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:28,570
the day wants to get these indicators

914
00:33:26,470 --> 00:33:31,150
you try to connect them go after their

915
00:33:28,570 --> 00:33:34,720
bigger sphere and then go after you know

916
00:33:31,150 --> 00:33:37,450
how what are kind of other compromised

917
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:40,900
devices that are somewhere attached to

918
00:33:37,450 --> 00:33:46,090
this kind of scenario let's move little

919
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:48,640
bit further so in this particular

920
00:33:46,090 --> 00:33:53,500
screenshot it is one of the audio video

921
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:56,410
conferencing devices like a kind of very

922
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:58,240
big company so we were testing certain

923
00:33:56,410 --> 00:34:00,280
things we got and somehow we got an

924
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:02,440
access to their debug interface and

925
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:03,970
things like that but this actually shows

926
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:06,790
that when you have to perform analyses

927
00:34:03,970 --> 00:34:08,800
at that level what kind of stuff you

928
00:34:06,790 --> 00:34:10,870
have to go through right so you get a

929
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:12,700
lot of these you know memory addresses

930
00:34:10,870 --> 00:34:14,980
coming in you know kind of modular calls

931
00:34:12,699 --> 00:34:18,520
are being called functions are being you

932
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:20,199
know called and then because anytime in

933
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:22,659
that device a single function is being

934
00:34:20,199 --> 00:34:25,359
performed the debug logs are throwing a

935
00:34:22,659 --> 00:34:27,399
lot of garbage stuff into it but you

936
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:29,530
have to actually extract the ones that

937
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:31,540
you want in this particular screenshot I

938
00:34:29,530 --> 00:34:33,640
have a demo as well to prove this

939
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:35,620
artifact this actually show that

940
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:36,399
whenever something is happening on that

941
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:38,078
device there is a

942
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:40,449
dublicate calls are being issued the

943
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:42,309
shell scripts are being run and at the

944
00:34:40,449 --> 00:34:44,739
back end it's fetching something kind of

945
00:34:42,309 --> 00:34:46,450
bad things like a bad pollutes and it's

946
00:34:44,739 --> 00:34:48,609
getting installed and things like that

947
00:34:46,449 --> 00:34:50,589
so you extract somehow you are able to

948
00:34:48,609 --> 00:34:52,328
extract the payload you can still run it

949
00:34:50,589 --> 00:34:54,369
by third party service try to get a feel

950
00:34:52,329 --> 00:34:56,260
of it whether it's unknown one or ously

951
00:34:54,369 --> 00:34:59,079
the variant of the already existing one

952
00:34:56,260 --> 00:35:01,299
so you get a feel of it like this is

953
00:34:59,079 --> 00:35:02,859
still a malicious one the shell scripts

954
00:35:01,299 --> 00:35:06,160
the kind of palos they are fetching or

955
00:35:02,859 --> 00:35:10,509
malicious so we found different variants

956
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:13,868
of mirai as well but these variants like

957
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:16,210
were targeting a very well-known audio

958
00:35:13,869 --> 00:35:18,730
video conferencing systems let's take a

959
00:35:16,210 --> 00:35:20,319
look so if you look at this particular

960
00:35:18,730 --> 00:35:25,000
screenshot right we are talking about

961
00:35:20,319 --> 00:35:26,170
that in our keyboard here from the top

962
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:29,039
if you look there are like three

963
00:35:26,170 --> 00:35:31,990
commands are being actually issued right

964
00:35:29,039 --> 00:35:34,839
start it from the session is registered

965
00:35:31,990 --> 00:35:38,049
and they actually gonna go after you

966
00:35:34,839 --> 00:35:39,339
know default enable system and these are

967
00:35:38,049 --> 00:35:41,740
some of the commands they run in an

968
00:35:39,339 --> 00:35:42,759
iterative way hierarchical way to get to

969
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:44,200
perform some kind of privilege

970
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:46,270
escalation or to get a control or

971
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:48,129
certain set of boundaries by calling

972
00:35:46,270 --> 00:35:50,440
these commands and then they actually go

973
00:35:48,130 --> 00:35:52,859
into shell mode with the SS command and

974
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:56,559
then their inherent code starts

975
00:35:52,859 --> 00:35:58,808
triggering up the scenario so if you

976
00:35:56,559 --> 00:36:00,309
look at the bin busy box one again the

977
00:35:58,809 --> 00:36:02,079
open source package it is calling the

978
00:36:00,309 --> 00:36:03,460
NRG payload here and they're gonna

979
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:07,119
perform some different kind of things

980
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:09,010
and if we really look back with that

981
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:10,809
topic we discussed no need to reinvent

982
00:36:09,010 --> 00:36:12,520
the wheel so they still use them in I

983
00:36:10,809 --> 00:36:14,559
could but the variant is a little bit

984
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:15,700
different the standards are the same but

985
00:36:14,559 --> 00:36:17,559
they're performing different set of

986
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:20,410
functionalities let's take a look at the

987
00:36:17,559 --> 00:36:23,770
another variant this one is a cult bot

988
00:36:20,410 --> 00:36:27,690
right similar scenario similar things

989
00:36:23,770 --> 00:36:29,640
found on some another deployment of the

990
00:36:27,690 --> 00:36:32,049
compromised audio video conferencing

991
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:35,170
system there was a you know available on

992
00:36:32,049 --> 00:36:38,500
the internet in this particular scenario

993
00:36:35,170 --> 00:36:40,980
variant they treat it as a cult one but

994
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:43,720
whole scenario going into the mode

995
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:47,549
enabling system shell is the same as

996
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:49,810
Mirai that's going to another variant

997
00:36:47,549 --> 00:36:53,170
the sauropod

998
00:36:49,810 --> 00:36:54,460
again the scenario is the same but the

999
00:36:53,170 --> 00:36:55,630
payload is little bit different so they

1000
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:57,400
might want to perform certain of

1001
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:59,920
different activities which are not in

1002
00:36:57,400 --> 00:37:01,330
line with the marijuana and we just came

1003
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:03,250
to know like you know the person who

1004
00:37:01,330 --> 00:37:05,350
drafted this code I think it's in the

1005
00:37:03,250 --> 00:37:07,630
media I think the guy has been you know

1006
00:37:05,350 --> 00:37:10,600
somebody's been prosecuted one or the

1007
00:37:07,630 --> 00:37:13,050
other way by the legal authorities been

1008
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:16,270
custody but the caution here is that

1009
00:37:13,050 --> 00:37:18,610
source code is there I don't need to

1010
00:37:16,270 --> 00:37:22,090
reinvent it and they are not doing it

1011
00:37:18,610 --> 00:37:24,400
exactly now we are extending their to

1012
00:37:22,090 --> 00:37:25,600
expect to the next level and what are we

1013
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:27,850
going to talk about right now is a

1014
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:30,220
brute-force scenario so there was a

1015
00:37:27,850 --> 00:37:31,990
compromise device it triggered up

1016
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:34,509
different kind of variants now what

1017
00:37:31,990 --> 00:37:36,609
exactly it is supposed to do it is

1018
00:37:34,510 --> 00:37:40,270
supposed to launch brute-force attacks

1019
00:37:36,610 --> 00:37:41,230
and if you can clearly see again there's

1020
00:37:40,270 --> 00:37:43,330
a lot of debug locks

1021
00:37:41,230 --> 00:37:44,770
how will you figure it out when you're

1022
00:37:43,330 --> 00:37:46,900
doing research because sometimes you are

1023
00:37:44,770 --> 00:37:48,700
not on the same network sometimes you

1024
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:50,680
might be on the same network but when

1025
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:52,299
you access to these kind of debug

1026
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:54,129
interfaces and all that how you'll

1027
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:55,690
figure it out so you have to find

1028
00:37:54,130 --> 00:37:57,940
indicators so you have to look for the

1029
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:58,600
artifacts and when we're we doing the

1030
00:37:57,940 --> 00:38:01,170
research

1031
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:04,509
looking into it and you can clearly see

1032
00:38:01,170 --> 00:38:07,840
which modules which is called as an ABC

1033
00:38:04,510 --> 00:38:10,750
it's a video controller audio/video

1034
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:13,240
thingy and they have certain kind of

1035
00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:16,750
functions embedded in and they have like

1036
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:20,560
a telnet function in itself as well they

1037
00:38:16,750 --> 00:38:21,940
call that function once I have actually

1038
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:23,710
so if you look at the top there is quite

1039
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:25,930
a tan that underscore kind the register

1040
00:38:23,710 --> 00:38:27,700
of the telnet session and they start

1041
00:38:25,930 --> 00:38:29,799
reiterating with the embedded username

1042
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:31,629
or password and start initiating telnet

1043
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:33,580
connections or brute-force attack or

1044
00:38:31,630 --> 00:38:35,590
password cracking attempt from that

1045
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:38,970
compromised system and it will keep on

1046
00:38:35,590 --> 00:38:41,560
going on for a long period of time and

1047
00:38:38,970 --> 00:38:43,330
so but when you were analyzing as a part

1048
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:45,100
of researcher you were analyzing into it

1049
00:38:43,330 --> 00:38:47,020
trying to figure it out how will you

1050
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:49,990
come to know that these things are there

1051
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:51,490
again it's a multi trading if like we

1052
00:38:49,990 --> 00:38:53,740
used to have multi-threading environment

1053
00:38:51,490 --> 00:38:56,319
but even with the analysis you have to

1054
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:59,649
look into bigger sphere you just cannot

1055
00:38:56,320 --> 00:39:02,200
beat the bush for just few artifacts but

1056
00:38:59,650 --> 00:39:03,580
this is a reality eventually when we do

1057
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:06,549
a little background research

1058
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:09,610
one is done it was using the root and

1059
00:39:06,550 --> 00:39:13,060
the anko password right we do B again

1060
00:39:09,610 --> 00:39:15,640
and you find that the ankle password was

1061
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:20,020
like some kind of use for some UNIX

1062
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:23,140
system so it means they know the bills

1063
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:24,759
that's this list but looking at some of

1064
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:25,480
the default system they are available on

1065
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:27,130
the Internet

1066
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:29,970
they're gonna go after UNIX system in

1067
00:39:27,130 --> 00:39:32,670
all so you keep on connecting the things

1068
00:39:29,970 --> 00:39:35,140
analysis will start giving you different

1069
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:36,910
scenarios and then from there onwards

1070
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:40,420
you can you know launch your analysis to

1071
00:39:36,910 --> 00:39:42,310
the next level it doesn't make sense if

1072
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:43,720
we don't see the video in real time

1073
00:39:42,310 --> 00:39:45,400
I won't say real time but I have

1074
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:48,129
embedded video and try to give you a

1075
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:50,650
feel how it looks like when you are

1076
00:39:48,130 --> 00:39:52,900
performing analysis and let's just take

1077
00:39:50,650 --> 00:39:55,000
a look at it so I have to you know I

1078
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:57,550
just remove certain art effects from

1079
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:59,800
here but it actually gives you a good

1080
00:39:57,550 --> 00:40:01,660
view so three minutes video but this is

1081
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:04,060
how it looks like when you get an access

1082
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:06,819
to the interface how fast the attack is

1083
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:08,080
moving and things like that so there's a

1084
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:10,060
lot of other things are happening in

1085
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:13,930
that compromised device but you can

1086
00:40:10,060 --> 00:40:17,259
clearly see those basically indicators

1087
00:40:13,930 --> 00:40:21,310
start popping up right this one is

1088
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:23,320
showing some kind of Maori variant okay

1089
00:40:21,310 --> 00:40:24,820
that's fine we're still seeing that okay

1090
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:26,410
the compromise device is performing

1091
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:31,210
certain kind of activity without any

1092
00:40:26,410 --> 00:40:38,520
interaction let's just take just keep on

1093
00:40:31,210 --> 00:40:43,740
going on now if you look at right now I

1094
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:43,740
will highlight it a few seconds here so

1095
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:48,940
there so it creates that telnet session

1096
00:40:47,110 --> 00:40:50,530
because the talent is redirecting to the

1097
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:52,540
pseudo terminal it's created a telnet

1098
00:40:50,530 --> 00:40:54,220
session and it start launching the

1099
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:55,750
brute-force attack or password cracking

1100
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:58,149
attempts it is going from the real-time

1101
00:40:55,750 --> 00:41:01,410
system we are just sitting back we are

1102
00:40:58,150 --> 00:41:04,240
analyzing the system looking into it and

1103
00:41:01,410 --> 00:41:07,870
you can clearly see is keep on

1104
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:11,129
triggering the attack again there is a

1105
00:41:07,870 --> 00:41:11,130
sport login and all that

1106
00:41:12,570 --> 00:41:18,340
and the telnet sessions are keep on

1107
00:41:15,730 --> 00:41:20,380
getting created next set of username

1108
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:20,980
password is being tried it sleeps for a

1109
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:23,050
few minutes

1110
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:25,600
trigger it again and things like that

1111
00:41:23,050 --> 00:41:28,090
but this is all a kind of compromised

1112
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:30,009
audio video conferencing system no

1113
00:41:28,090 --> 00:41:31,630
interaction nothing is just going on the

1114
00:41:30,010 --> 00:41:35,610
fly as soon as it connects back to the

1115
00:41:31,630 --> 00:41:35,610
internet and it is going after

1116
00:41:42,690 --> 00:41:49,190
so it halted because the sleep function

1117
00:41:45,750 --> 00:41:52,290
triggered in now it's picking up again

1118
00:41:49,190 --> 00:41:54,060
so you can imagine this is just a one

1119
00:41:52,290 --> 00:41:54,960
compromised system you can imagine if

1120
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:56,340
you have a thousands of these

1121
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:58,470
compromised systems as they're going

1122
00:41:56,340 --> 00:41:59,910
after the similar scenario that's how

1123
00:41:58,470 --> 00:42:01,560
they actually build bigger botnets

1124
00:41:59,910 --> 00:42:04,020
because it's just going in a distributed

1125
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:05,370
fashion they have the IP list where they

1126
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:08,130
want to create a tunnel that they want

1127
00:42:05,370 --> 00:42:09,630
to check the you know baseline their

1128
00:42:08,130 --> 00:42:10,740
whether they have weak security

1129
00:42:09,630 --> 00:42:13,230
configuration or not

1130
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:18,450
somehow it started showing the traces or

1131
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:20,460
mirai as well yeah so this is a tag they

1132
00:42:18,450 --> 00:42:22,319
will actually show in real-time that

1133
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:23,760
actually these kind of things exist but

1134
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:29,040
when you have to perform analysis you

1135
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:31,950
have to look into various scenarios so

1136
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:34,259
so we we started with the you know why

1137
00:42:31,950 --> 00:42:36,419
IOT how what IOT you know how it looks

1138
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:39,420
like we went through the you know

1139
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:42,210
taxonomy the botnet execution so model

1140
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:43,770
we went through different techniques by

1141
00:42:42,210 --> 00:42:45,030
looking at the source code destroyers

1142
00:42:43,770 --> 00:42:48,480
then we look into the real world

1143
00:42:45,030 --> 00:42:50,250
examples gone through to one of the

1144
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:52,560
basic video demonstration of apache to

1145
00:42:50,250 --> 00:42:54,180
how one label that binary was looked

1146
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:56,910
into one of the audio video conferencing

1147
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:58,980
system but then when you still have to

1148
00:42:56,910 --> 00:43:02,069
perform empirical analysis you still

1149
00:42:58,980 --> 00:43:03,390
have to go and pick a few samples all

1150
00:43:02,070 --> 00:43:05,700
the techniques that we have gone through

1151
00:43:03,390 --> 00:43:08,730
we have to map those techniques back to

1152
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:10,470
the different coyote botnets because we

1153
00:43:08,730 --> 00:43:14,670
want to get a bigger picture a bigger

1154
00:43:10,470 --> 00:43:16,439
matrix try to see how the evolvement the

1155
00:43:14,670 --> 00:43:19,500
bots are evolving with the passage of

1156
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:22,710
time and we did conductor one study

1157
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:24,780
which we call as empirical analysis we

1158
00:43:22,710 --> 00:43:29,310
try to pick up the you know the bots

1159
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:32,520
that were like the first ones that came

1160
00:43:29,310 --> 00:43:34,200
to exist that actually got a bigger

1161
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:37,040
attention we went to like head you may

1162
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:40,980
perceive I amnesia breaker one Mirai

1163
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:43,350
Linux IRC I'd ran all that but again the

1164
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:46,830
caution at the part that we want our

1165
00:43:43,350 --> 00:43:48,420
obtain from this research is we have a

1166
00:43:46,830 --> 00:43:50,430
techniques we want to look into CNC

1167
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:52,880
architecture communication protocol you

1168
00:43:50,430 --> 00:43:55,350
know infection strategies persistence

1169
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:56,640
denial of service capabilities different

1170
00:43:55,350 --> 00:43:58,410
kind of features and

1171
00:43:56,640 --> 00:44:01,230
how it maps back to the different set of

1172
00:43:58,410 --> 00:44:03,450
BOTS right then it actually gives you a

1173
00:44:01,230 --> 00:44:05,309
view and when you're building algorithms

1174
00:44:03,450 --> 00:44:07,828
for detecting these kind of scenarios

1175
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:10,500
you need this kind of intelligence it

1176
00:44:07,829 --> 00:44:11,880
starts from your simple analysis when

1177
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:13,500
testing certain domain get some

1178
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:15,660
artifacts testing some real-world

1179
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:18,510
scenarios and then actually building

1180
00:44:15,660 --> 00:44:20,609
this kind of research layout at the end

1181
00:44:18,510 --> 00:44:22,289
of that a to get a solid intelligence

1182
00:44:20,609 --> 00:44:23,910
that can be fitted back to your

1183
00:44:22,289 --> 00:44:26,369
automated detection and prevention

1184
00:44:23,910 --> 00:44:27,509
solutions it makes sense because let's

1185
00:44:26,369 --> 00:44:29,609
say if you want to write a signature

1186
00:44:27,510 --> 00:44:31,740
it's just an old technique of drafting

1187
00:44:29,609 --> 00:44:33,869
signature but you still know you know

1188
00:44:31,740 --> 00:44:36,029
what this particular one of the variant

1189
00:44:33,869 --> 00:44:38,190
okay that technique is not gonna be good

1190
00:44:36,029 --> 00:44:40,950
at the network level sort of things like

1191
00:44:38,190 --> 00:44:44,339
that and some of the things which other

1192
00:44:40,950 --> 00:44:45,990
researchers have walked on with simple

1193
00:44:44,339 --> 00:44:49,769
IOT botnet signatures you can clearly

1194
00:44:45,990 --> 00:44:51,779
see they pick it from it's just some of

1195
00:44:49,769 --> 00:44:53,970
the yarra rules and all that you know

1196
00:44:51,779 --> 00:44:56,279
get the strings put it in you know get

1197
00:44:53,970 --> 00:44:59,430
through the binary check whether this

1198
00:44:56,279 --> 00:45:01,589
not there or not but the question again

1199
00:44:59,430 --> 00:45:04,078
there we are as a researchers we need to

1200
00:45:01,589 --> 00:45:06,690
ask is you know keep on sharing with the

1201
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:10,410
community at the end of the day but then

1202
00:45:06,690 --> 00:45:12,390
on the contrary it just not only have

1203
00:45:10,410 --> 00:45:14,578
one thing that you have to go after it's

1204
00:45:12,390 --> 00:45:16,950
just not only that okay you find a one

1205
00:45:14,579 --> 00:45:18,839
compromise system you perform the

1206
00:45:16,950 --> 00:45:20,578
analysis you share with the community we

1207
00:45:18,839 --> 00:45:22,650
need a bigger picture as well we need to

1208
00:45:20,579 --> 00:45:25,140
build security solutions so the

1209
00:45:22,650 --> 00:45:26,910
intelligence need to be fielded in that

1210
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:28,129
way we talk about data mining machine

1211
00:45:26,910 --> 00:45:30,359
learning natural language processing

1212
00:45:28,130 --> 00:45:32,009
artificial intelligence but again at the

1213
00:45:30,359 --> 00:45:34,460
end of the day you have to mind data and

1214
00:45:32,009 --> 00:45:37,440
for data you have to have sampling

1215
00:45:34,460 --> 00:45:39,480
performed on a bigger sets to make sure

1216
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:45,569
that whatever you been concluding out of

1217
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:47,369
it is good so that being said started

1218
00:45:45,569 --> 00:45:50,759
with the Internet of Things we came back

1219
00:45:47,369 --> 00:45:51,930
to the same scenario here the one thing

1220
00:45:50,759 --> 00:45:53,670
that I want to highlight is the Internet

1221
00:45:51,930 --> 00:45:55,230
of Things scenario is that I think maybe

1222
00:45:53,670 --> 00:45:57,059
we have many companies out there they

1223
00:45:55,230 --> 00:45:58,380
talk about IOT security and all that I

1224
00:45:57,059 --> 00:46:01,980
think the bigger part that we are

1225
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:04,019
missing is the texana me why when we

1226
00:46:01,980 --> 00:46:05,759
talk about IOT is it IT + OT

1227
00:46:04,019 --> 00:46:08,038
is it information technology or

1228
00:46:05,759 --> 00:46:10,200
operational technology is it Internet of

1229
00:46:08,039 --> 00:46:11,460
Things what what it is all about

1230
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:14,879
so we have to take it out of the

1231
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:16,260
marketing scenarios okay I know in

1232
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:17,700
cybersecurity well after two or three

1233
00:46:16,260 --> 00:46:20,670
years you need to come with a different

1234
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:22,919
marketing terminology but we need a

1235
00:46:20,670 --> 00:46:25,589
varied Eric a set of Internet of Things

1236
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:27,420
taxonomy categorizing into enterprise

1237
00:46:25,589 --> 00:46:32,130
IOT you are categorizing into an

1238
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:33,960
end-user scenario where they use the IOT

1239
00:46:32,130 --> 00:46:35,369
devices so some of the things are there

1240
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:37,019
because if you really want to nurture

1241
00:46:35,369 --> 00:46:39,809
and build strong security solution

1242
00:46:37,019 --> 00:46:42,209
taxonomies very much desired you cannot

1243
00:46:39,809 --> 00:46:44,309
just put up a one standard solution and

1244
00:46:42,210 --> 00:46:45,990
write it run for things where we come

1245
00:46:44,309 --> 00:46:47,730
out okay there is a router it is an IOT

1246
00:46:45,990 --> 00:46:50,038
all you are running is a white listing

1247
00:46:47,730 --> 00:46:52,200
on the top of it so that's how you can't

1248
00:46:50,039 --> 00:46:57,089
defeat the way bottners are being

1249
00:46:52,200 --> 00:47:02,419
deployed and designed so they being sir

1250
00:46:57,089 --> 00:47:02,420
we still have three minutes questions

1251
00:47:23,380 --> 00:47:28,150
so again it depends on the so I'm gonna

1252
00:47:26,530 --> 00:47:29,830
repeat your question again so that

1253
00:47:28,150 --> 00:47:31,900
everybody knows about it so I think he's

1254
00:47:29,830 --> 00:47:33,970
asking have we seen any kind of advanced

1255
00:47:31,900 --> 00:47:35,650
botnets where they actually go after

1256
00:47:33,970 --> 00:47:37,419
when we talk about payloads they go

1257
00:47:35,650 --> 00:47:41,110
after root gets deployed it in which are

1258
00:47:37,420 --> 00:47:43,750
undetected in nature right so I think

1259
00:47:41,110 --> 00:47:46,360
I'll start it in the context of when we

1260
00:47:43,750 --> 00:47:47,830
perform experimental analysis right idea

1261
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:49,930
is that you know we look at the volumes

1262
00:47:47,830 --> 00:47:51,819
of attacks right we can still say that

1263
00:47:49,930 --> 00:47:53,470
in this world that antivirus is dead but

1264
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:55,780
still at the end of the day malware keep

1265
00:47:53,470 --> 00:47:57,609
on coming and things like that the

1266
00:47:55,780 --> 00:47:58,990
traces that we have seen looking at the

1267
00:47:57,610 --> 00:48:01,390
architecture because an X based

1268
00:47:58,990 --> 00:48:03,609
architecture and all that most of the

1269
00:48:01,390 --> 00:48:05,830
that thing that is a little bit derived

1270
00:48:03,610 --> 00:48:07,690
towards the volume level right so the

1271
00:48:05,830 --> 00:48:09,040
volume that we are seeing with that kind

1272
00:48:07,690 --> 00:48:11,710
of mirror variant and all that is the

1273
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:13,630
techniques but on the contrary the

1274
00:48:11,710 --> 00:48:16,360
question is how many security solutions

1275
00:48:13,630 --> 00:48:19,510
are being deployed to detect risk in

1276
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:22,060
these kind of devices like routers who

1277
00:48:19,510 --> 00:48:24,220
check you know you have exposed and

1278
00:48:22,060 --> 00:48:27,190
things like that and at the end of the

1279
00:48:24,220 --> 00:48:29,140
day right I'm not and like totally

1280
00:48:27,190 --> 00:48:31,060
indicating the fact that there was not

1281
00:48:29,140 --> 00:48:33,160
be those kind of rootkits but the volume

1282
00:48:31,060 --> 00:48:34,960
is not that high so when we derive

1283
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:36,759
analysis build solutions will go after

1284
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:39,160
where you can detect something on the

1285
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:42,760
fly rather than just waiting for those

1286
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:44,529
scenarios and Linux rootkits we have

1287
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:45,940
like you know tools like earlier rootkit

1288
00:48:44,530 --> 00:48:47,770
hunter and all that you know what

1289
00:48:45,940 --> 00:48:49,630
sockets and all that was a behavior file

1290
00:48:47,770 --> 00:48:52,509
integrity monitoring and all that but

1291
00:48:49,630 --> 00:48:54,220
Gainey the end of the day it will

1292
00:48:52,510 --> 00:48:56,320
eventually come and the volume will

1293
00:48:54,220 --> 00:48:58,959
increase as soon as the advanced

1294
00:48:56,320 --> 00:49:00,100
security solutions come to play because

1295
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:01,330
if you don't have advanced query

1296
00:49:00,100 --> 00:49:03,400
solution they are getting the work done

1297
00:49:01,330 --> 00:49:05,200
with the same period of like same set of

1298
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:07,540
code and why they really need to go

1299
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:09,520
after building advanced rootkit code and

1300
00:49:07,540 --> 00:49:12,040
all that but there will be some samples

1301
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:14,470
down there which are undetected will be

1302
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:16,840
running in the wild that's what we

1303
00:49:14,470 --> 00:49:19,620
really need to find it out hope of

1304
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:19,620
answer the question

1305
00:49:37,220 --> 00:49:40,828
not exactly so if I'm getting your

1306
00:49:39,630 --> 00:49:42,630
question right is like if we have like

1307
00:49:40,829 --> 00:49:44,910
additional set of packages install like

1308
00:49:42,630 --> 00:49:46,440
GCC and all that which might make it

1309
00:49:44,910 --> 00:49:50,490
difficult for the malware authors to

1310
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:52,319
deploy the code yeah yeah

1311
00:49:50,490 --> 00:49:54,270
so know exactly these are the couple of

1312
00:49:52,319 --> 00:49:57,480
open source packages that we discussed

1313
00:49:54,270 --> 00:49:58,680
here but eventually the one thing that

1314
00:49:57,480 --> 00:50:00,140
we have analyzed during the course of

1315
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:02,700
this research is that they are already

1316
00:50:00,140 --> 00:50:06,299
also utilizing those binaries as well

1317
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:07,319
for their own purposes right that's why

1318
00:50:06,300 --> 00:50:09,150
if you look at this some of the

1319
00:50:07,319 --> 00:50:10,710
precompiled binaries and all that it's

1320
00:50:09,150 --> 00:50:13,770
not a necessity they're always using W

1321
00:50:10,710 --> 00:50:15,030
get or FTP and TFTP and all that they

1322
00:50:13,770 --> 00:50:16,349
are using like these kind of standard

1323
00:50:15,030 --> 00:50:18,720
curl boundaries as well because the

1324
00:50:16,349 --> 00:50:20,460
question there is they want that thing

1325
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:22,169
package to be available on the

1326
00:50:20,460 --> 00:50:24,540
compromised device and you can still use

1327
00:50:22,170 --> 00:50:26,460
to fetch the payloads on the fly so

1328
00:50:24,540 --> 00:50:28,380
those are the things that are there I

1329
00:50:26,460 --> 00:50:31,680
don't see the question again boils down

1330
00:50:28,380 --> 00:50:33,349
to the one part all these devices how

1331
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:36,509
many square exclusion are placed to

1332
00:50:33,349 --> 00:50:40,230
prevent infections in audio video

1333
00:50:36,510 --> 00:50:41,339
conferencing systems that's the question

1334
00:50:40,230 --> 00:50:43,500
that we really need are these kind of

1335
00:50:41,339 --> 00:50:44,759
i/o devices and not enough all they're

1336
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:46,650
relying is on a signature based

1337
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:49,079
whitelisting and all that you know if it

1338
00:50:46,650 --> 00:50:51,180
hits on a malicious IP stop it

1339
00:50:49,079 --> 00:50:56,549
but I think this DS this problem is

1340
00:50:51,180 --> 00:50:57,779
going way beyond that right now I mean

1341
00:50:56,549 --> 00:50:59,220
I'll be around if you have any more

1342
00:50:57,780 --> 00:51:02,390
question thanks everyone for attending

1343
00:50:59,220 --> 00:51:04,450
this talk appreciate

1344
00:51:02,390 --> 00:51:04,450
you
