1
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:14,849
all right so you guys having a good time

2
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:16,800
so far good well we're actually half the

3
00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:18,570
way through Sunday right now will

4
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,699
actually be switching formats after this

5
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:22,830
talk and start going into the half hour

6
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:26,519
talks that are a little bit shorter

7
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:27,930
obviously and a bit more fast-paced so I

8
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:29,519
think this is the last of our our talks

9
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:32,159
that got here and we have Michael Wiley

10
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:34,260
here speaking on you're not alone in

11
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:43,349
your hotel room so please welcome him to

12
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:46,230
the torque on stage all right so I just

13
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:48,030
found out about ten minutes ago that the

14
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:49,529
title of these this talk is a little bit

15
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:52,320
creepy so maybe I should have thought

16
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:54,059
about that but I thought around the the

17
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,920
privacy concerns that we had around Def

18
00:00:54,059 --> 00:00:58,680
Con about a month or so ago this would

19
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:01,020
be an interesting topic to talk on so

20
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:02,760
I'm Michael Wiley and recently the

21
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:04,799
director of cyber security services at

22
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:06,929
Richie made technology solutions up

23
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:08,280
until now for last about 12 years I've

24
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:10,830
run my own consulting firm in Los

25
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:13,500
Angeles and it's a bit of a change now

26
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:14,939
too to be an employee and work for

27
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,259
someone else but so far it's been

28
00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:19,710
awesome and have more canonic a lot of

29
00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:22,560
great projects this talk is I had some

30
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:24,658
legal input on it so as the the DEF CON

31
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,420
concerns came round and people and

32
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:29,820
security going into rooms I got the

33
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:32,579
input of Dan Nelson and so he's an

34
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:33,869
attorney in Colorado and so he helped

35
00:01:32,579 --> 00:01:36,059
with a couple of these slides and I'll

36
00:01:33,869 --> 00:01:37,500
call that out and I put his contact

37
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:38,880
information towards the end you can

38
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:40,680
absolutely reach out to him if you want

39
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,689
more information since I'm obviously not

40
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:43,799
an attorney I think he's a pretty

41
00:01:42,689 --> 00:01:45,809
interesting attorney to talk to

42
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:47,700
especially in this space because he's

43
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:49,530
one of a few attorneys that I have come

44
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:52,140
across that understands privacy and

45
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:54,750
information security so I know Marc rash

46
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:57,030
is one of them that's out there and he

47
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:59,369
makes a lot of blog posts and content

48
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:01,049
around privacy in cybersecurity but then

49
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:02,939
Dan's probably one the only attorneys I

50
00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:04,950
know of that has certified ethical

51
00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:07,889
hacker and a couple other security

52
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:09,660
related certifications so about reaching

53
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:11,068
my technology solutions they've been

54
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:12,000
around for about 30 years but there are

55
00:02:11,068 --> 00:02:13,799
cyber security information security

56
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,300
programs come up with just a lot

57
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,580
you're so and that's why they brought me

58
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:19,950
on board to help develop that and bring

59
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:21,450
it up to speed some of the disclaimer

60
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:23,130
they obviously made me do this in the

61
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:25,019
past I wouldn't have to but now we've

62
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:27,299
got this on here that the information

63
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:29,370
contained herein is a general nature and

64
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:30,600
based on the guidance is that is subject

65
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:31,920
to change the information is not

66
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:33,989
intended to provide legal or the

67
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:35,459
professional services and it's provided

68
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:37,140
solely for educational purposes the

69
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:38,970
information provided should not be used

70
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:41,970
as a substitute professional legal

71
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:44,130
advice future changes in law regulation

72
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:45,780
may supersede some or all the topics in

73
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:47,370
this article and that's what I did find

74
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:49,800
was a lot of the content that we found

75
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:51,600
case law and other laws that came out

76
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:53,940
there's either not a whole lot out there

77
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:55,769
quite yet around this talk or they do

78
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:57,840
change or they differ from state to

79
00:02:55,770 --> 00:03:00,900
state so we're first going to talk about

80
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:02,490
some recent privacy concerns then we're

81
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:04,110
going to go into the host the hotels

82
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:06,180
right to enter your room if you're

83
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:08,190
staying there the law enforcement right

84
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:09,690
to enter your room gambling with some

85
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:11,310
free Wi-Fi in the hotel we'll just

86
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:13,590
briefly talk about that cuz I'm sure you

87
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:15,750
all are experts in that area and then

88
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:18,000
detecting intruders in physical access

89
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:20,130
to your hotel rooms or Airbnb s then

90
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,440
detecting cameras that might be present

91
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:24,540
in your room or more specifically your

92
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:27,209
Airbnb room and then some counter

93
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:28,620
surveillance techniques so this is where

94
00:03:27,209 --> 00:03:30,900
that the talk really kind of came to

95
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:32,220
light was I actually didn't attend Def

96
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:34,230
Con this year I had a bunch of business

97
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:37,350
trips lined up but I was at b-sides Las

98
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:39,000
Vegas gave a talk there and all of a

99
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:41,730
sudden I start seeing all aside from the

100
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,320
storm that hit Vegas the day I left this

101
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:45,149
was all over Twitter and that people

102
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:47,160
were saying warning Caesar staff is

103
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:49,680
performing random security checks and

104
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:51,660
they were in certain cases coming in

105
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,100
unannounced other cases they were coming

106
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:54,840
in with some announcement but they were

107
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:58,049
being a little aggressive with their

108
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:59,970
security checks and so I've got a couple

109
00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:02,700
different tweets that I saw that got

110
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:04,109
retweeted a lot on Twitter but a lot of

111
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:05,910
different situations I think one of the

112
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:07,500
more scary ones was the female was in

113
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:09,150
her room and she was in the middle of

114
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:12,510
changing and security came into their

115
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:14,430
room she claims without knocking so I

116
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:15,690
first looked to the actual policy at

117
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:17,608
that well these hotels have to have

118
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:18,959
policies on what they can and can't do

119
00:04:17,608 --> 00:04:22,380
coming into your room so we should start

120
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:23,640
there and with Caesars Entertainment it

121
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:25,469
was most interesting since they were in

122
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:27,539
the light and we had these tweets about

123
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:29,640
their their privacy and entering

124
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:31,500
their guests rooms but they say we do

125
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:33,780
not comment publicly on security related

126
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:35,370
policies and procedures and so that was

127
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:37,349
one email that came out from one of

128
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:39,840
their spokespersons and that was in

129
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:41,600
November of the year before I'm sure now

130
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,830
that there was a big stink about their

131
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,630
entering rooms they've come a little a

132
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:47,159
little more transparent with what their

133
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:49,200
policies are but initially they said

134
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:52,290
we're not going to comment on this after

135
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:53,820
the the big shooting in Vegas MGM was a

136
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:55,530
little bit more transparent with what

137
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:58,320
they were gonna do in their policies and

138
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:59,969
they essentially said that all MGM

139
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,800
resort properties follow health and

140
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:03,900
welfare checks operating procedures that

141
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:06,120
stipulate welfare checks be to be

142
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:07,620
performed after two consecutive days

143
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:09,900
where do not disturb signs have been

144
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:11,940
displayed on the door and guests have

145
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:13,890
not interacted in person or by phone

146
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:16,200
with housekeeping so a lot of these

147
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:17,669
policies come around I'm seeing we all

148
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:19,320
are pretty familiar with what happened

149
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:21,510
in Vegas and the big shooting and so

150
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:23,400
they're trying to get more eyes and ears

151
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:25,080
in the room and if you don't want

152
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:26,340
housekeeping in there then they're okay

153
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,359
with that but they want to check on the

154
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:29,729
room and make sure there's not a

155
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,350
stockpile of ammunition or explosives

156
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:33,180
and if you think about how big some of

157
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:35,790
these hotels are especially in Las Vegas

158
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:37,050
sometimes we look like 3,000 rooms and

159
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:38,550
if you think few people in those rooms

160
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:40,530
it's a large target for some type of

161
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:41,730
terror attack so on one side it's

162
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:43,919
understandable that they would have some

163
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:46,410
type of security to protect you myself

164
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:47,910
our family that's visiting Las Vegas and

165
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:49,350
trying to have a good time but there has

166
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:51,960
to be some type of balance between the

167
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:54,960
the privacy of the guests as well as the

168
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:56,489
safety of them Hilton had a policy

169
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,739
actually quite a long time ago and says

170
00:05:56,490 --> 00:06:00,540
we understand respect our guests privacy

171
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:03,330
the hotel reserves right to visually

172
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:04,830
inspect all rooms every 24 hours to

173
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:06,090
ensure well-being of our guests and

174
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:07,560
confirm the condition of the room

175
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:08,969
understandable they have a lot of money

176
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:11,730
in these hotels as well they don't want

177
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:13,320
them damaged Disney had one for a while

178
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:15,540
for quite some time they made a little

179
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:17,820
bit of a change after the October

180
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:19,710
shooting the hotel on staff reserved the

181
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:21,480
right to enter your room for any purpose

182
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:23,580
including but not limited to performing

183
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:25,500
maintenance repairs checks on the safety

184
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:27,840
and security of our guests and property

185
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:29,610
and after the October event what they

186
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:31,369
did they took out that do not disturb

187
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:33,570
signs and they replaced them with

188
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:35,340
something that said like no cleaning

189
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:36,690
service or no maid service needed so

190
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:38,520
that way it wasn't giving a false

191
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:41,000
impression that by putting that sign up

192
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:42,590
do not disturb or do not enter

193
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,240
that wasn't going to always be the case

194
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:46,849
you're really just saying I'm I'm

195
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:49,190
basically declining the housekeeping

196
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:50,420
service in my room so those are the

197
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:51,560
policies that they have for but I

198
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:53,450
thought that's great that they have the

199
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:55,340
policy but what if you get your your

200
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:57,320
room checking card or your contract and

201
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:59,299
you cross those things out is that legal

202
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:00,590
what about the law enforcement can they

203
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:01,670
either slette law enforcement come in

204
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:02,690
because they see you have a soldering

205
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:05,330
iron in your room and they don't know

206
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:07,790
what that is so this is these are the

207
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:09,229
slides that Dan contributed to and gave

208
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:10,670
me some insight on so he wrote these

209
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:11,920
next few slides and unfortunately he

210
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:14,510
couldn't join me here today

211
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:15,950
so the Fourth Amendment protects guest

212
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:19,030
rooms from unreasonable search and

213
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:22,400
seizure and this is for law enforcement

214
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:25,010
only this is not apply to the hotel and

215
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:26,750
the security staff as well but the sole

216
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:28,610
on but this sole applies to government

217
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:30,020
agencies such as the police and even

218
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:31,940
then there are some exceptions such as

219
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:33,740
an emergency so if they see there was

220
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:35,360
one case where there's blood outside the

221
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:37,310
hotel room and they heard a big crash of

222
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,860
glass and in those cases they were

223
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:41,150
allowed to enter the room because they

224
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:43,850
thought there was some type of bodily

225
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:46,609
harm in that case also the guests can

226
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:47,870
consent so if your husband or wife or

227
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:49,490
someone else in the room and they

228
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:51,530
consent to the police to enter they can

229
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:53,210
come in without a warrant the fourth

230
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:56,179
minute also protects guests against

231
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:57,349
registration information so one specific

232
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:59,990
case I thought was interesting in my

233
00:07:57,350 --> 00:08:02,090
hometown of Los Angeles was the city

234
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:02,960
came in and said well you the police are

235
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:04,460
allowed to come in and look at

236
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,870
registration information and there was

237
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:08,090
another hotel that I think it was

238
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:10,250
somewhere around San Diego that it was a

239
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:12,440
motel 6 and the police for the ice was

240
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:13,430
asking for information on guests and

241
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:15,200
trying to correlate that with

242
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:17,330
immigration information so there was two

243
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:19,310
notable cases but I like the one in Los

244
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:21,140
Angeles since it's my hometown and they

245
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:22,970
ultimately after it went up to Circuit

246
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:25,310
appellate courts they came out and said

247
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:27,229
that the even though the Los Angeles

248
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:28,970
says that police can go in there and get

249
00:08:27,229 --> 00:08:30,680
registration information that if the

250
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:32,089
hotel does not want to provide it they

251
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:35,719
don't have to give it out and it is

252
00:08:32,089 --> 00:08:37,250
protected by the Fourth Amendment so now

253
00:08:35,719 --> 00:08:39,020
the hotels right and this is really what

254
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:40,490
the the talks around what about Caesars

255
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:42,559
Palace and entering some of the guests

256
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:44,300
room even though they were there they

257
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:46,160
said hey we don't want someone coming in

258
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:48,500
I saw one person posted a sign on their

259
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:50,930
door and they said I do not give consent

260
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:53,150
to have anyone search my room so I

261
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:54,560
thought well does that is that valid can

262
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:55,819
you supersede the conch

263
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:58,130
that you sign when you check into the

264
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:59,990
room and so the fourth minute is not

265
00:08:58,130 --> 00:09:01,760
generally apply to hotels and

266
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:03,980
non-government actors so there's no need

267
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:07,069
for a warrant even if you tell them I do

268
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:08,540
not consent to you entering my room it's

269
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:11,000
generally a state law since there's not

270
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:12,650
a whole lot about this for a business in

271
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,600
the contract between the business and

272
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:16,279
someone coming in to stay less than 30

273
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:17,540
days so it's generally goes down to the

274
00:09:16,279 --> 00:09:19,130
state law and as I mentioned this is

275
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:21,709
gonna vary by every state that you go to

276
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:23,960
and the most interesting thing that I

277
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:25,670
think Dan brought up is that the primary

278
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:27,080
difference between a landlord and tenant

279
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:28,640
and I've got a couple rental properties

280
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:31,430
so I'm familiar with California and Los

281
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:33,410
Angeles laws on that and you've got a

282
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:35,810
lot different or different set of laws

283
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:37,459
when you have longer than 30-day leases

284
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:39,619
and so that's going to be a landlord and

285
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:41,120
tenant or a tenancy but if you're

286
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:43,040
staying less than 30 days in a hotel

287
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:45,230
room you're generally considered it's a

288
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:47,300
lessor lessee relationship and there's a

289
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:49,520
lessee relationship so essentially it's

290
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:50,870
similar to a parking garage if you go

291
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:52,670
into a parking garage and you get that

292
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:54,380
little ticket and it has a little

293
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:55,579
contract on the back of the ticket that

294
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:58,460
says they're not responsible for damage

295
00:09:55,580 --> 00:10:00,589
you can stay for less than 24 hours you

296
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:02,030
know this is the rate this is etc all

297
00:10:00,589 --> 00:10:04,580
that stuff that's generally going to be

298
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:06,500
a lessor lessee relationship as well and

299
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:08,000
you can't supersede that contract by

300
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:09,410
writing in your own piece of the

301
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,420
contract or putting something on the

302
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:13,339
door after the fact saying that I don't

303
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:15,140
agree to a search in that case and so

304
00:10:13,339 --> 00:10:17,960
you have a lot less rights when it's a

305
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:20,089
lessor and lessee relationship so

306
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:22,550
tenants actually have a property

307
00:10:20,089 --> 00:10:25,490
interest in the premises but it's a lot

308
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:26,930
less I'm sorry the tenants have a higher

309
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:28,040
degree of property interest which means

310
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:30,500
they have more rights to the property

311
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:32,120
then if you will have a license to

312
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:36,560
basically stay at the property like this

313
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:38,150
hotel and so it's hard to to claim that

314
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:40,099
you're a tenant if you do stay less than

315
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:41,660
30 days and so you're saying if you stay

316
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:42,950
more than 30 days like it's an extended

317
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:45,410
stay and you're there for two months

318
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:46,730
unless they make you recheck in and I

319
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:48,949
know a lot of places will do this even

320
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:50,450
for a car if you're renting a car every

321
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:52,070
two weeks you have to go back in and

322
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:54,050
refine the license because they don't

323
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:57,980
want it to be a tenant relationship they

324
00:10:54,050 --> 00:11:00,020
want to keep it as a licensee so is this

325
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:01,490
me for you so you as the the license or

326
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:03,110
note or the sorry the license where's

327
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:04,550
the hotel will generally have the right

328
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:06,860
to enter your room for legitimate

329
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:08,380
reasons and I think they're pretty broad

330
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:10,210
and vague and so in this case

331
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:12,460
they can pretty much claim anything and

332
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:14,710
come into your your premises there so

333
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:16,330
cleaning maintenance guess so they keep

334
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:17,920
it's a the safety of someone next to you

335
00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:19,600
if they heard things going on in your

336
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:21,219
room and it sounded like a gun loading

337
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,720
well they can just come in because they

338
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:24,340
assume that or they're trying to protect

339
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:27,460
the safety of the guests next to you as

340
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:29,200
well the hotel may be back may back this

341
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:30,490
up with language in the the License

342
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,770
Agreement so when you check into the

343
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:35,560
hotel it may be directly on the actual

344
00:11:32,770 --> 00:11:37,090
contract it could also be referencing a

345
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:38,140
link somewhere else so sometimes when

346
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:39,970
you sign one of those end-user

347
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:41,740
agreements it says for more information

348
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:42,940
go visit their website which is kind of

349
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:46,000
ridiculous when you're checking in with

350
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:47,740
a long line and such language is not

351
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,450
essential to the hotel's right to enter

352
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:50,950
so they don't even have to fully call it

353
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:53,500
out they have a right being the the

354
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:55,990
building owner so some do's and don'ts

355
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:57,490
from Dan the attorney lock your room

356
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:59,140
from the inside when you're present

357
00:11:57,490 --> 00:12:00,370
right so if you're inside there it's a

358
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:02,439
little bit harder for them to come in

359
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:04,480
and do those security checks there's

360
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:05,530
obviously the locks on the doors but I

361
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,910
know people that have actually come to

362
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:09,160
this conference to given talks about

363
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:11,110
bypassing locks and obviously the keys

364
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:13,209
have are the the hotel has keys to

365
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:14,980
everything so you can obviously use the

366
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:16,210
locks on the hotel door but there's a

367
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:18,120
couple of techniques I'll give you that

368
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:19,690
you can use your own locks or little

369
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:21,760
techniques that you can basically

370
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:24,850
barricade yourself in for a legitimate

371
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:26,890
reason if you have the if your personal

372
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:29,140
items that you don't want searched and

373
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:30,910
looked at the recommendation from Dan

374
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:32,560
was put that in a suitcase with a lock

375
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:34,930
it's generally a lot more difficult for

376
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:36,819
the hotels to claim safety concerns to

377
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:38,410
going into your items in that case they

378
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:40,660
may need to bring in law enforcement and

379
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:41,980
have a warrant in those cases so

380
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:43,630
anything you don't want them to look at

381
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:46,330
when you leave the room lock it in the

382
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:48,040
suitcase don't do anything illegal

383
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:50,020
obviously an attorney's he's gonna put

384
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:51,730
that in there and if you do something

385
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:56,439
illegal then probably contact him and he

386
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:57,880
can represent you so essentially there

387
00:12:56,440 --> 00:13:00,730
was a couple of things in Vegas that

388
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:02,590
were happening as far as some of the the

389
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:03,820
guests were having soldering irons and I

390
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:05,350
get that the soldering irons aren't

391
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:07,780
illegal and they may not be a safety

392
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:09,100
concern or security concern but you also

393
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:11,470
have to think about it from the hotel's

394
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:13,240
perspective and if you have someone

395
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:15,370
that's that some assuming is low-paid

396
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:17,800
coming in to clean a room or even maybe

397
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:19,270
a security guard that's in high school

398
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:21,400
or maybe college and they're trying

399
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:22,030
that's an intermediary job they come in

400
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,530
they see

401
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:26,260
tires all over the place circuit boards

402
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:27,760
and a soldering iron we understand what

403
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:30,280
that that's probably is it might be just

404
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:32,290
a badge but in their eyes after the

405
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:34,089
October shooting that's a big concern

406
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:35,920
for them all these wires and electrical

407
00:13:34,090 --> 00:13:37,420
things out there so just to save

408
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,349
yourself if you have those items you may

409
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:40,300
just want to put them away

410
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:41,800
or tuck them in and they the hotel

411
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:43,180
probably doesn't have a right to go

412
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:44,920
through your things especially if it's

413
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:47,189
locked up so that just gets you out of

414
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:49,120
that that whole predicament altogether

415
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:51,460
Romero you're gonna touch a whole lot on

416
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:53,860
the the gambling with Wi-Fi I mean Wi-Fi

417
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:55,600
anywhere we just want to be careful with

418
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:57,040
what we're using and what we're doing

419
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,960
obviously the wall of sheep at Def Con

420
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,370
there's tons of clear text data going

421
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:02,530
across sometimes you don't even know

422
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:04,300
what your computer or your mobile device

423
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:07,329
is doing so it might be best to use a

424
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:08,439
VPN or a hotspot from your phone the

425
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:09,430
other interesting thing I do want to

426
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:11,860
mention before moving on to the next

427
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:13,810
slide is that law enforcement can

428
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:16,360
request permission to tap the hotel's

429
00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:19,119
Wi-Fi or their their internet in general

430
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:20,680
and long as the hotel agrees in those

431
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:22,900
situations they don't need a warrant and

432
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:25,420
so I have talked with FBI agents and

433
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:27,220
certain cases when they were doing child

434
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:28,870
pornography cases they've gone to hotel

435
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:31,120
and say we suspect there's someone here

436
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:32,320
can we tap in your network and not only

437
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,250
do they let them tap in the network they

438
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,080
basically gave them usernames and

439
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:36,310
passwords to everything whatever they

440
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:37,570
wanted they didn't want to get involved

441
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:39,010
they just said go ahead and our IT

442
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:40,810
closet you can do whatever you want

443
00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:41,980
you're the FBI so even if they don't

444
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:43,630
have a warrant they still might be able

445
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:45,480
to come in with the consent of the hotel

446
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:47,800
and monitor what you're doing

447
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:49,600
so in detecting intruders if you're in

448
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:51,219
the room or even if you leave the room

449
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,600
you might want to know if someone has

450
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:54,130
been in there or they've come into your

451
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:56,680
room so a couple different options you

452
00:14:54,130 --> 00:14:58,330
can buy these portable door alarms on

453
00:14:56,680 --> 00:15:00,900
Amazon for under $20

454
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:03,460
and they they detects a motion or

455
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:06,400
vibration on the door so if someone ends

456
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:08,410
up knocking really hard or messing with

457
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:10,270
the handle or opening the door it'll

458
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:11,589
sound an alarm this would work if you're

459
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:12,699
in the bathroom or you just want to know

460
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:14,410
when someone's trying to get into your

461
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:15,760
room but if you leave you're probably

462
00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:18,699
not going to know if that thing went off

463
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:20,590
or not the interesting one is audio and

464
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:24,670
video recording and there was a tweet

465
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:26,970
that went out as far as the on Twitter

466
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:29,829
for the Caesar Caesar entertainment

467
00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:31,930
circumstance and in those cases someone

468
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:33,730
from I think we're con we had a video

469
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:35,260
recorder in their room and there's a

470
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:35,830
little debate from privacy people of

471
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:37,450
whether or not

472
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:40,030
they should actually release the audio

473
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:41,740
recording because Las Vegas or Nevada is

474
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:45,069
a two-party consent state and so that

475
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:47,890
audio recording may have been violating

476
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:49,120
state and/or federal wiretapping laws so

477
00:15:47,890 --> 00:15:51,370
there's a little concern about releasing

478
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,600
some of those things but the consensus

479
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:54,040
from Dan and I'm sure he's gonna have

480
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:56,110
all kinds of disclaimer saying this but

481
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:57,670
when we talked on the phone last week he

482
00:15:56,110 --> 00:15:59,500
was saying well if you have a sign and

483
00:15:57,670 --> 00:16:01,209
you bring a sign that says this run

484
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,890
we're doing audio and video recording

485
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:05,350
and it's very visible and it's right in

486
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:07,390
the front of the door it may be complied

487
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:08,650
consent by them entering in and starting

488
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:10,600
to move around and talking it's almost

489
00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:12,730
like when you call Verizon or Dell or

490
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:14,290
anyone any tech support and they say by

491
00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:16,120
continuing the call we're gonna be

492
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:18,400
recording it for security or monitoring

493
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:20,320
purposes and by staying on the phone

494
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:22,480
call you are essentially consenting to

495
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:23,680
that so he said that that could be it

496
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,120
would be kind of a two different

497
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:27,010
principles that you're butting up

498
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:29,320
together and there's not enough laws or

499
00:16:27,010 --> 00:16:31,240
case law regarding this that that hasn't

500
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:33,100
been tried and tested but that may be an

501
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:34,600
option to have that with a visible sign

502
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:36,160
saying you are doing audio and video

503
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:38,050
recording in your room the other

504
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:42,089
interesting one is something is in paper

505
00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:42,089
or my favorite let me pull this out

506
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:54,710
well I thought it had it visible there

507
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:56,780
but those little do not disturb signs

508
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:57,380
that they've now replaced with no maid

509
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:59,209
service

510
00:16:57,380 --> 00:17:00,890
if those you hang them on the door and

511
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:02,540
sometimes when you quickly close that

512
00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:03,110
door they get stuck in the door jamb a

513
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:05,089
little bit

514
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:07,069
well I purposely sometimes actually do

515
00:17:05,089 --> 00:17:09,139
that so when I close that I'm sticking

516
00:17:07,069 --> 00:17:10,849
it in slightly and that way if someone

517
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:13,370
else has entered my room even with that

518
00:17:10,849 --> 00:17:14,990
signs on then it's no longer to be stuck

519
00:17:13,369 --> 00:17:17,030
in that door jamb assuming they didn't

520
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:18,230
swing it too hard but it maybe just give

521
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:21,079
me some indication that there has been

522
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:22,370
an intruder in my trunk um you can also

523
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:23,839
take a picture when leaving your room

524
00:17:22,369 --> 00:17:25,159
this is a great one to see not if

525
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:26,510
someone's come in but if they've messed

526
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:28,760
with your things or they've touched your

527
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:31,400
stuff you can take a photo with your

528
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:33,230
phone there's also some apps out there

529
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:35,540
from I think it was an ex-navy seal guy

530
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:37,190
and he lets you take a picture upload it

531
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:38,960
and then you come back take a picture

532
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:40,670
again and it'll show you certain items

533
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:43,640
that have been moved or misplaced from

534
00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:45,200
your original picture so detecting

535
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:48,970
cameras I think this applies more for an

536
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:51,500
Airbnb situation I'm an Airbnb situation

537
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:53,300
there's been many cases where people

538
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:54,800
have found hidden cameras in their room

539
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:56,750
and I often are concerned about that

540
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:59,149
when I go to an Airbnb travel with my

541
00:17:56,750 --> 00:18:00,620
wife I don't know the person's house

542
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:02,510
there's stuff all over the place it's

543
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:04,790
not like a hotel that has reputation it

544
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:07,100
could be some owner that wants to spy in

545
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:09,080
the bedroom or the bathrooms and so it

546
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:11,060
is a little bit of a concern to me so

547
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:12,949
you can inspect private areas so

548
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:14,629
bathroom bedrooms you can look around a

549
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:16,280
lot of these different items now these

550
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:18,350
hidden cameras are so small you can see

551
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:21,260
the little holes here even a cell phone

552
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:22,639
charger or a power adapter and there

553
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:26,390
could be a hidden camera sitting inside

554
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:28,250
there you can look for cables commercial

555
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:30,050
tools that can help you so there's one

556
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:31,730
on Amazon for a little bit less than 300

557
00:18:30,050 --> 00:18:34,490
dollars it's going to go around and look

558
00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:35,900
for electrical and other frequencies and

559
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:37,700
it'll be able to tell you if there's

560
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:39,050
something in the area the commercial

561
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:41,450
tools that really will find all

562
00:18:39,050 --> 00:18:42,740
spectrums of wireless and electrical

563
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:44,600
frequency are going to be a couple

564
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:46,340
thousand dollars but you can get away

565
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:49,040
with detecting most of the different

566
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:50,360
frequencies for less than $300 the other

567
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:52,100
thing could use is your phone's camera

568
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:54,229
so if they're not buying special spy

569
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:56,629
equipment and they've got IR sensors on

570
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:58,820
the the liar lights on the cameras you

571
00:18:56,630 --> 00:19:00,890
can go around and just basically pull up

572
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:02,510
your your cell phone camera and you can

573
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:03,990
look around with it and if they use

574
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:05,309
infrared lighting you

575
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:07,050
be able to see a little bit of a glow

576
00:19:05,309 --> 00:19:09,809
there and that might detect some of the

577
00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:12,120
cameras in those situations Airbnb has a

578
00:19:09,809 --> 00:19:13,530
policy as well that host must disclose

579
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:15,510
cameras but obviously that's not always

580
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:17,520
going to be the case you're prohibited

581
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:19,290
regardless of disclosing it to have it

582
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:21,809
in bathrooms bedrooms and other private

583
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:23,730
places and then they also prohibit you

584
00:19:21,809 --> 00:19:25,440
from doing counter surveillance so you

585
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:27,270
as a guest if you go in there you're

586
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,590
staying there like the hotel situation

587
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:30,120
where I said you might be able to get

588
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:32,459
away with having an audio and video

589
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:35,370
recording with a sign they say unless

590
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:36,960
the third party consents to being audio

591
00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:40,459
or video recorded you as the guest

592
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:42,690
cannot have a camera doing the recording

593
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:46,080
so what else can you do here before I

594
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:47,820
end basic visual detection of light

595
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:49,678
smoke detectors other things that if

596
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:51,629
possible hidden cameras you go on Amazon

597
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:54,179
and eBay look for hidden cameras and you

598
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:56,309
can look for those type of items you can

599
00:19:54,179 --> 00:19:59,010
use your cellphone look for infrared you

600
00:19:56,309 --> 00:20:00,690
can use different the I think this is

601
00:19:59,010 --> 00:20:02,280
the MAC Q anti-spy hidden camera

602
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:04,920
detector that's the one for under $300

603
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:06,720
if you are familiar with different tools

604
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:08,520
or you have Kali Linux running once you

605
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:10,080
get on the wireless network you can use

606
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:12,570
something like an map to do a network

607
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:14,399
sweep I like net discover because it's

608
00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:16,800
gonna do an ARP request and so if they

609
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:18,870
have ICMP disabled on any devices like a

610
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:20,040
hidden camera this is going to go and

611
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:22,139
look on ARP and there's not a whole lot

612
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:24,000
of protections to protect against ARP so

613
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:25,110
unless they segment their network you're

614
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,960
probably gonna be able to see that and

615
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:29,550
if it's an Airbnb situation the less

616
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:30,990
they are someone in this room they're

617
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:32,309
probably not going to set up the network

618
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:34,050
where it's isolated and have different

619
00:20:32,309 --> 00:20:35,190
network for that and it's all hidden but

620
00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:38,250
even if it's hidden you can go out and

621
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:40,080
use something like insider eye an SSID

622
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:40,920
er and you can look for hidden wireless

623
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:43,169
networks as well

624
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:45,570
there's an awesome tool that came out on

625
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:47,850
github it's called dropkick and so if

626
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:50,040
you run this on a network in an Airbnb

627
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:52,649
situation it's supposed to go look for

628
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:55,260
certain models popular models of cameras

629
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:56,730
and then it'll go ahead and actually do

630
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:58,110
a denial of service on them and try and

631
00:20:56,730 --> 00:21:00,690
get them off the network if it finds it

632
00:20:58,110 --> 00:21:03,030
few apps you can get spy hidden camera

633
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:05,160
detector for iOS hidden camera detector

634
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:06,178
for Android net analyzer there's a whole

635
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:09,330
lot out there but those were a couple

636
00:21:06,179 --> 00:21:10,770
popular ones and then one piece I want

637
00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:12,260
to go back in and point out now they

638
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:15,929
have a couple more seconds on this is

639
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:17,660
the other piece that you can do is this

640
00:21:15,929 --> 00:21:20,630
is the my actual hotel room

641
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:22,550
here at the Westin and this big piece at

642
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:24,530
the top of the door you can wrap

643
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:26,270
something like a rope or a belt around

644
00:21:24,530 --> 00:21:28,460
and it'll prevent someone from getting

645
00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:30,320
in so even if they have the key or they

646
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:32,030
have bypass tools to go ahead and open

647
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:34,310
up that little slider or the whatever

648
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:35,990
type of tool they have there if you put

649
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:37,280
something around that top piece there

650
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:39,020
that's supposed to have the door slowly

651
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:41,060
closed a lot of times you can actually

652
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:42,889
stop someone from getting in or most of

653
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:44,780
the way in in those cases if you don't

654
00:21:42,890 --> 00:21:46,070
have those do not disturb signs you can

655
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:47,570
go ahead and put just a piece of paper

656
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:49,250
on the door jamb and obviously if it

657
00:21:47,570 --> 00:21:50,570
fell out or it's somewhere on the ground

658
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:52,580
you know someone's coming into your room

659
00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:53,750
and then I thought this one was pretty

660
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:55,159
creative as well because I want to have

661
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:56,660
something that if you forgot your tools

662
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:58,580
at home you might want to still do

663
00:21:56,660 --> 00:22:01,460
intrusion detection or lock your door

664
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:03,710
you can use a fork from the hotel lobby

665
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:06,140
if they have a restaurant or you can go

666
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:07,730
to some other place and buy a fork if

667
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:09,860
you've really forgot all your tools here

668
00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:13,010
and you can cut the fork in half or you

669
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:15,169
can bend it and break it you put the you

670
00:22:13,010 --> 00:22:17,060
bend the tips of the end of the fork it

671
00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:20,000
goes into the actual part that the the

672
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:21,860
lock goes into and then you've got the

673
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,110
the long piece of the fork going across

674
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:25,639
the door jamb and it'll prevent someone

675
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:27,290
from opening the door and it's pretty

676
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:28,940
sturdy at that case I've tried this once

677
00:22:27,290 --> 00:22:30,170
so a couple different techniques you can

678
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:31,760
buy a couple of products to protect

679
00:22:30,170 --> 00:22:34,700
yourself or you can even use some free

680
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:36,290
tools to protect yourself obviously not

681
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:38,600
barricade yourself in a bad situation

682
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:40,490
but if there was security pounding on

683
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:42,260
your door not identifying themselves and

684
00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:43,760
you were concerned for your own safety

685
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:45,379
until the police got there you could

686
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:47,720
barricade yourself in and protect

687
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:49,190
yourself so that's it for my slide they

688
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:51,200
said it was the last of the the hour

689
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:54,440
talks but this was at least in my

690
00:22:51,200 --> 00:23:00,940
schedule a 20-minute one and I'm avail

691
00:22:54,440 --> 00:23:00,940
for any questions yes

692
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:10,590
yeah from my understanding they would

693
00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:13,830
need more of a warrant for that

694
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:15,419
situation but there's also they there's

695
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:17,639
certain situations they could evict you

696
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:20,370
very easily since you are not a tenant

697
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:22,260
but your your lessee and so they may be

698
00:23:20,370 --> 00:23:24,959
able to say we Vic did you now we can go

699
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:26,190
into those but generally things are when

700
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:28,410
they're locked they don't have the right

701
00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:29,940
to go into those things again generally

702
00:23:28,410 --> 00:23:31,560
there's a lot of like what ifs and a lot

703
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:33,600
of this hasn't been tested out or a lot

704
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:35,429
of cases that have been around this but

705
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:41,750
the general consensus is if it's locked

706
00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:41,750
they don't have the right what's that

707
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:46,200
with like the hotel safe versus if you

708
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:47,220
brought your own safe in I wouldn't know

709
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:49,350
on that one that would be a question for

710
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:55,320
for Dan on where the the line is drawn

711
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:57,810
on those pieces yeah and they do they do

712
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:59,909
have certain keys a lot of times though

713
00:23:57,810 --> 00:24:02,760
I've actually lost my key where I forgot

714
00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:05,550
the code for it or my wife likes to put

715
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:07,410
certain codes but she doesn't use the

716
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:10,050
u.s. way of doing the year in the month

717
00:24:07,410 --> 00:24:11,460
and the date and so it's backwards and I

718
00:24:10,050 --> 00:24:13,050
locked ourselves out of that thing and

719
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:14,880
so I have had though tell trying to come

720
00:24:13,050 --> 00:24:17,159
in and it's not as easy as I thought

721
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:18,900
in some situations when they've went to

722
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:20,190
go open it up for us they have to get a

723
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:21,990
specialist or they say oh we have to

724
00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:24,090
call the safe guy to come in and it's

725
00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:25,590
been anywhere from 30 minutes to a

726
00:24:24,090 --> 00:24:32,300
couple of hours for them to unlock the

727
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:32,300
safe for us any other questions

728
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:35,389
yes

729
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:05,149
yeah I mean that's the difficult part

730
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:06,950
with a in Airbnb situation is that the

731
00:25:05,150 --> 00:25:08,720
really the people you go to you could

732
00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:11,390
potentially try and call the police and

733
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:13,130
say they're spying on you but really the

734
00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:14,870
the place to go is going to be Airbnb

735
00:25:13,130 --> 00:25:16,430
and it's going to kind of be up to how

736
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:18,800
they're gonna handle that situation so

737
00:25:16,430 --> 00:25:21,410
their policy that I read on the camera

738
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:23,960
said that the disclosure of the cameras

739
00:25:21,410 --> 00:25:25,970
even outside the property need to be in

740
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:27,380
the listing so when you actually look

741
00:25:25,970 --> 00:25:28,730
and you're interested in before you even

742
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:30,080
click go ahead and buy and then maybe

743
00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:31,850
they email it to you in the background

744
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:34,280
it has to be on the the page that

745
00:25:31,850 --> 00:25:37,580
they're actually advertising so in those

746
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:39,290
cases yeah but that's it I've got

747
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:40,730
another talk coming up interested and

748
00:25:39,290 --> 00:25:42,740
then otherwise after both these I'll be

749
00:25:40,730 --> 00:25:44,030
around in the lobby and we can we can go

750
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:46,270
ahead and talk after that thank you very

751
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:46,270
much

752
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:53,460
