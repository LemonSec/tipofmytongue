1
00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:08,300
to this topic is fantastic as it just

2
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:10,400
says it all in its title today we're

3
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:12,349
going to talk about ridiculous router by

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:21,080
with gene Eric so please give gene a

5
00:00:12,349 --> 00:00:25,090
warm welcome thank you guys can you hear

6
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:27,709
me okay cool you be quiet

7
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:29,750
alright so the whole point of this

8
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:31,070
particular talk is to go over open word

9
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:33,230
and some of the things that maybe you

10
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:35,150
didn't know that it could do things have

11
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:38,419
changed a lot over the past few years

12
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:40,070
and I've been playing with it quite a

13
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:41,510
bit to see some of the really awesome

14
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:43,190
crap you can do with the current

15
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:50,239
hardware and current software that Scott

16
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:52,820
so Who am I I'm a hacker I'm also really

17
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:54,440
cheap so I like to play with things like

18
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:56,060
open work where you don't spend a lot of

19
00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:01,579
money to get some really badass features

20
00:00:56,060 --> 00:01:03,770
so my inspiration from this as actually

21
00:01:01,579 --> 00:01:06,829
over the course of many years so when I

22
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:08,149
started out all this open work stuff was

23
00:01:06,829 --> 00:01:09,740
kind of new there were other competing

24
00:01:08,149 --> 00:01:11,749
projects with DD word and things like

25
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:13,850
that and it was kind of a pain in the

26
00:01:11,749 --> 00:01:15,469
ass to get the software on your router

27
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:17,658
and there were only a few routers that

28
00:01:15,469 --> 00:01:19,399
you could actually use but there was a

29
00:01:17,659 --> 00:01:21,770
great book that was put out back then by

30
00:01:19,399 --> 00:01:26,209
Paul a story and Larry Pesci and a few

31
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:28,189
other ghost contributors it's still kind

32
00:01:26,209 --> 00:01:31,999
of useful for doing embedded device in

33
00:01:28,189 --> 00:01:33,589
IOT security analysis so you might be

34
00:01:31,999 --> 00:01:37,339
interested in it but it is definitely

35
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:43,880
dated so the other point of inspiration

36
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:46,549
so this is from torque on 7 in 2005 this

37
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:48,979
is qui-gon and sis men giving their talk

38
00:01:46,549 --> 00:01:51,109
about how they solve the problems that

39
00:01:48,979 --> 00:01:53,539
open where it was having at the time and

40
00:01:51,109 --> 00:01:56,509
they put out this awesome distribution

41
00:01:53,539 --> 00:01:58,639
called fair use' for doing security

42
00:01:56,509 --> 00:02:01,029
analysis and just generally having more

43
00:01:58,639 --> 00:02:04,068
tools to play with on that environment

44
00:02:01,029 --> 00:02:06,408
it was a little rough to use because

45
00:02:04,069 --> 00:02:07,759
they only had like one version of the

46
00:02:06,409 --> 00:02:11,870
router that they supported but that was

47
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:13,819
the time you had different CPUs and

48
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:15,520
socks and things that you were using for

49
00:02:13,819 --> 00:02:17,380
different router versions

50
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,360
so it was really hard to maintain back

51
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:22,030
then not a lot of knowledge everything

52
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:24,880
was still pretty black box but these

53
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:27,670
guys kicked butt and they helped me way

54
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:30,180
back then and you know that they

55
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:35,109
contributed to the stock just from

56
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:37,960
teaching me all right so why bring up an

57
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:39,880
old topic like open work well doesn't

58
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:41,680
everybody know about it maybe not so

59
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:43,540
much anymore because people don't really

60
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,450
talk about it as much

61
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:48,190
everybody's got a home router now I

62
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:49,510
can't think of anybody that doesn't even

63
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:53,230
if you don't have broadband you'd

64
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:54,750
probably still have a router so I think

65
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:57,549
it's a good topic to bring back

66
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:59,560
especially for new people and people

67
00:02:57,550 --> 00:03:01,780
that may have forgotten and the world's

68
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:04,180
changed quite a bit since since the last

69
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:05,950
time I heard anything about open work so

70
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:07,600
I thought maybe we should have a new

71
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:11,410
chat about it there's way way cooler

72
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:12,700
stuff going on and you might not know

73
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:14,740
some of the things you can do with it

74
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:17,019
but the thing that I like to underline

75
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:20,380
is there's enterprise features on here

76
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:22,510
people are buying similar gear that does

77
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:26,079
the same thing and spending way way way

78
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:27,820
more money for less support so in my

79
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,980
mind maybe you should actually consider

80
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:33,549
it for some enterprise uses because it

81
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:35,350
does a lot of stuff so hardware this is

82
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:39,490
my hardware so this is what I actually

83
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:41,500
use for this stuff and you can see that

84
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:45,430
it's just a normal router

85
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:51,190
it's got detachable antennas it's 802 11

86
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:53,080
C AC but there's points for buying this

87
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:55,710
particular one for me where it's got

88
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:59,860
good specs it's not out of production

89
00:03:55,710 --> 00:04:04,210
it's cheap as well supported Wi-Fi chips

90
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:05,530
in the sock they're not the best Wi-Fi

91
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:09,490
you can possibly get but it's pretty

92
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:11,680
darn good it's got USB 3 support that

93
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:13,150
was really big thing for me there's a

94
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,530
lot of bandwidth that you can use it

95
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:16,750
means you got a lot of opportunities to

96
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:19,930
expand on it and you can really easily

97
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:21,370
add a serial port to this thing to have

98
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:22,810
an actual serial console which is

99
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:25,900
important when you have an open work

100
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:27,440
device things go wrong you mess up one

101
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:31,010
configuration

102
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:32,570
everything goes out the window or in my

103
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:35,000
case for one of the routers that I had

104
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:38,630
you plug in a USB device and suddenly

105
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:43,490
the thing doesn't boot mmm it's good to

106
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:45,800
have a console so the competition so

107
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:50,870
this is a SonicWALL device that is also

108
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:53,600
very similar to that wrt that I just

109
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:55,280
showed you but it's a commercial device

110
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:59,960
meant for enterprise meant for

111
00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:02,000
entry-level enterprise equipment this

112
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:04,909
particular one's got almost the same

113
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,700
specs it's an it's an attitude 11ac

114
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:13,720
thing it's got removable antennas it's

115
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:17,659
got a USB port it's a lot more expensive

116
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:21,110
575 was a check that I did yesterday for

117
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:22,430
this hardware on Amazon and if you want

118
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:24,500
updates for the thing you got to have a

119
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:26,120
license otherwise you don't get updates

120
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:27,890
and it's closed source so there's

121
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:31,010
nothing you can do about it

122
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:33,550
it's nothing you can really add to it it

123
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:36,650
does have a CLI it's not well documented

124
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:37,940
but you kind of hosed if you want it to

125
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:39,799
do more than what the company has

126
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:44,060
decided you should do or in a different

127
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:48,530
way this is just a little side-by-side

128
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:51,530
comparison of these two devices the wrt

129
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:55,099
device way faster cpu they've got the

130
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:59,109
same number of Ethernet ports USB 3 on

131
00:05:55,100 --> 00:06:02,180
the wrt one USB 2 on the other one

132
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:04,340
console port on the enterprise device no

133
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:07,700
console port out of the box on the wrt

134
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:11,390
but you can add it really easy there's

135
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:13,580
more RAM on the enterprise device but

136
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:17,450
it's already a lot for what you're

137
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:20,030
asking for 512 for a router is actually

138
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:21,890
a stupidly large amount of RAM unless

139
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:24,500
you're doing some really odd stuff with

140
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:28,430
it and there's also a bit more storage

141
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:31,550
like double on the wrt device so a point

142
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:34,640
of note the enterprise device has a USB

143
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:36,560
port but it's also almost useless you

144
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:40,419
can only use it for a few things that

145
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:42,100
the company deems like ideal like there

146
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:45,190
some diagnostic thing that you can use

147
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:47,290
it for you can plug in a few cellular

148
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:49,600
modems into the USB but that's kind of a

149
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:51,880
you can't use it for external storage so

150
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:54,430
if you want to offshoot all of your logs

151
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:56,680
from this router into an external

152
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:59,260
storage device so you don't kill your

153
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:59,710
router you can't do it it's not an

154
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:04,420
option

155
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:07,870
so I actually modified my device to have

156
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:11,140
a serial port on it and you can kind of

157
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:12,700
see it in this picture all those cords

158
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:15,039
hanging out of the back I did a pretty

159
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:18,310
clean job installing it because it was

160
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:21,690
so easy to do but you can see I've got a

161
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:25,030
little adapter for the db9 to go to rj45

162
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:28,480
so it's basically like an enterprise

163
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:31,690
console on the thing you can also see in

164
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:34,240
this picture I've hung off an extra USB

165
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:36,190
Ethernet adapter and I have that on

166
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:38,020
there actually for load balancing it

167
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:41,860
allows me to do some cool stuff there

168
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:43,840
with Lac P and things like that so you

169
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:45,760
can actually get some really badass

170
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:48,130
stuff from the fact that this has got a

171
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:52,420
USB device on it and it's well traveled

172
00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:55,750
at this point in open work so what can

173
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:57,280
you do with this well you can do all the

174
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:59,440
traditional router tasks that you could

175
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:02,020
do with the enterprise device it runs

176
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:03,520
routing protocols all the ones that you

177
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:06,190
could possibly want to do it can do that

178
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:08,409
so your discovery of routes not a big

179
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:14,590
deal you can actually set that up

180
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:18,730
it's got DHCP it's got DNS DNS caching

181
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:21,460
and its own supplier of DNS on the

182
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:23,860
device with DNS mask that's included by

183
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:26,500
default and set up as part of the DHCP

184
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:28,000
structure you can run multiple networks

185
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:29,770
on the thing you're not locked into just

186
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,210
one subnet you can tell it all about

187
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:33,579
what kind of network you want to have

188
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:36,100
and supports VLANs right out of the box

189
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:37,840
and most of the on-board switching

190
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:41,710
equipment that is actually part of the

191
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:44,830
hardware includes support for doing VLAN

192
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:48,820
tagging or not so you can have untagged

193
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:50,650
VLANs untagged ports in different VLANs

194
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:52,000
or you can have tagged ports and

195
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:53,650
multiple VLANs

196
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,510
you can have multiple VLANs on a single

197
00:08:53,650 --> 00:09:01,079
port all of that stuff is supported so

198
00:08:57,510 --> 00:09:03,670
the more advanced stuff that you can got

199
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:05,680
so you can do load balancing with the

200
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:07,900
thing like I said Lac P is supported I

201
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:12,729
actually use it with Cisco gear I have a

202
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:15,100
Lac P balance of two cords into my Cisco

203
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:16,540
switch and they're just very happy

204
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:19,630
together

205
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:22,360
do VLAN trunking with 802 dot1q again I

206
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:23,530
do that with my Cisco switch it's a good

207
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:25,000
thing to have when you're talking about

208
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:26,709
enterprise network then you can have

209
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,930
multiple routes you can have isolation

210
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:31,330
and you can just do a whole lot more

211
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:34,810
stuff if you can get encapsulation to

212
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:36,730
the switch you know 2.1 X it can be a

213
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:37,839
client on the wired stuff and it's got a

214
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:40,720
bunch of other things that can do it

215
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:43,270
with 802 One X and wireless I haven't

216
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:46,000
found a way yet to do it and wired so I

217
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:54,040
don't know how you would really make

218
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:56,770
that do that by itself as an 802 dot 1x

219
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:58,959
provider it can run free radius but

220
00:09:56,770 --> 00:10:01,660
you'd probably want to have the 802 One

221
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:03,040
X management actually on your external

222
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:05,230
like Cisco switch or whatever is

223
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:07,150
downstream from there because I don't

224
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:10,270
think the switch that's on board is

225
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:11,680
gonna be able to do that active failover

226
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:13,870
there are ways that you can actually set

227
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:16,150
it up so that you can have multiple wrt

228
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:18,850
devices that are actively communicating

229
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:21,790
with each other with the virtual IP so

230
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:23,650
that if one of them dies or reboots or I

231
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:26,860
don't know you change the configuration

232
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:28,150
that causes a reboot that's okay there's

233
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:30,250
another one that's still waiting to go

234
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:35,760
which is an enterprise feature you kind

235
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:37,810
of have to have in the real world so

236
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:39,130
there's lots and lots and lots of

237
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:42,760
wireless stuff that you can do with this

238
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:46,360
thing it's got basically any capability

239
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:48,520
that you can imagine from a hostapd and

240
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:52,450
one of the things that that includes is

241
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:55,750
80 megahertz bandwidth for a single

242
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:57,400
channel in 802 dot 11ac which is really

243
00:10:55,750 --> 00:11:01,150
cool when you're talking about streaming

244
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:03,850
big stuff right so you don't have to

245
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:05,079
have as much overhead of all the

246
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:07,120
wireless crap to get your

247
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:12,190
there it's kind of similar to jumbo

248
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:14,710
frames like a layer 1 layer 2 world 802

249
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:19,300
dot 1x on the Wi-Fi like I mentioned so

250
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:21,930
you can do wpa2 enterprise with PKI from

251
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:25,569
this little thing so you can have

252
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:28,060
basically a big boy access point

253
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:30,730
controller that's doing some crazy off

254
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:32,140
for you you can have multiple Wi-Fi

255
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:34,210
networks so you can have more than one

256
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:38,230
SSID you can have different Nessus IDs

257
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:39,930
for the 2.4 and 2.5 on this device you

258
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:42,940
can have different ones for each VLAN

259
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:45,430
your options are endless so again that's

260
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:46,480
a bigger feature for people that are

261
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:48,489
actually trying to use this in an

262
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:51,040
enterprise context that's something they

263
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:52,810
might need I do this myself I have a

264
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:55,180
guest network and I have a secure

265
00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:58,180
network guest network is wpa2 with

266
00:11:55,180 --> 00:12:00,520
password and the secure network is PKI

267
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:04,209
they are on separate VLANs and they

268
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:06,970
can't write to each other so that's a

269
00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:10,090
thing that I think everybody should look

270
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:13,750
into but I'm a bit crazy when it comes

271
00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:17,920
to security you can set dynamic VLANs

272
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:20,200
with the radius in 802 dot 1x so if you

273
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:22,540
see a particular certificate presented

274
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:25,510
to you you know that user needs to be on

275
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:29,260
VLAN block so you can have multiple

276
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:34,060
VLANs on the enterprise on the

277
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:36,670
enterprise wpa2 off one of the things

278
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:39,250
that I found recently that I thought was

279
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:42,250
just awesome is the ability to do cap

280
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:45,610
lap with this thing so if you've never

281
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:47,110
heard of that it's basically the idea of

282
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:50,080
you've got lightweight access points all

283
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:52,420
over your network that you can roam from

284
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:53,860
one to the other smoothly because they

285
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:55,569
all have the same configuration and

286
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:58,990
they're sharing some data back to the

287
00:12:55,570 --> 00:13:01,510
main controller cap WAP is the open

288
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:04,570
version of LWOP that's ctrl G I'm

289
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:06,220
actually put together but it took

290
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:10,000
forever for me to actually find an

291
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:13,360
implementation that works the ac21

292
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:16,180
actually has its own like web interface

293
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:19,239
that you can also load on this device so

294
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:22,478
you can turn the radio that's on the

295
00:13:19,239 --> 00:13:25,359
into a client to the capital app server

296
00:13:22,479 --> 00:13:26,709
and then add more access points from

297
00:13:25,359 --> 00:13:28,749
there so you've got a single point where

298
00:13:26,709 --> 00:13:31,029
you're managing all your SSIDs all your

299
00:13:28,749 --> 00:13:32,470
credentials and you can also do

300
00:13:31,029 --> 00:13:34,569
monitoring of your clients and things

301
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:39,009
like that from a central point with cap

302
00:13:34,569 --> 00:13:41,878
black mesh networks are supported you

303
00:13:39,009 --> 00:13:45,459
can do bridging over wireless with the

304
00:13:41,879 --> 00:13:47,289
WDS for adder which basically means you

305
00:13:45,459 --> 00:13:50,199
can have a bunch of devices behind

306
00:13:47,289 --> 00:13:51,910
another Wi-Fi bridge and it doesn't care

307
00:13:50,199 --> 00:13:53,738
it'll authenticate and everybody will be

308
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:56,999
happy your clients won't know they're on

309
00:13:53,739 --> 00:13:59,729
Wi-Fi it's a good feature to have

310
00:13:56,999 --> 00:14:04,869
so other stuff that you can do with this

311
00:13:59,729 --> 00:14:09,369
you can run a VPN on it I do you can run

312
00:14:04,869 --> 00:14:13,720
it as an IPSec or Open VPN I do IPSec

313
00:14:09,369 --> 00:14:15,369
with IP to for TLS which is means that

314
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:18,329
you have to have a certain so does the

315
00:14:15,369 --> 00:14:20,589
server works great

316
00:14:18,329 --> 00:14:22,919
you can run attack tools from the thing

317
00:14:20,589 --> 00:14:26,669
so there are a bunch of projects that do

318
00:14:22,919 --> 00:14:29,739
building a drones from wrt devices

319
00:14:26,669 --> 00:14:31,720
there's an old example actually in the

320
00:14:29,739 --> 00:14:36,669
ultimate hacking guide of doing a kismet

321
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:38,529
drone from a wrt device there are a

322
00:14:36,669 --> 00:14:40,720
bunch of commercial hacking appliances

323
00:14:38,529 --> 00:14:41,999
this is a good example of one but there

324
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:48,159
are others

325
00:14:41,999 --> 00:14:50,350
rogue EAP detection IDs and UPnP I know

326
00:14:48,159 --> 00:14:51,309
it sounds like a stupid thing to do on

327
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:54,699
these routers but if you're actually

328
00:14:51,309 --> 00:15:01,238
using it in your home gaming it's it's a

329
00:14:54,699 --> 00:15:03,069
thing you're gonna want so so you can

330
00:15:01,239 --> 00:15:04,329
actually use this thing to do all kinds

331
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:06,819
of things on your network you can run a

332
00:15:04,329 --> 00:15:09,128
phone system from it you can use it as

333
00:15:06,819 --> 00:15:11,829
your Active Directory system kind of

334
00:15:09,129 --> 00:15:13,569
sort of almost you can do captive

335
00:15:11,829 --> 00:15:16,089
portals whether they're for your own

336
00:15:13,569 --> 00:15:19,169
authentication or for a paid service

337
00:15:16,089 --> 00:15:21,339
like with Sputnik or what-have-you

338
00:15:19,169 --> 00:15:22,839
you can set it up to do centralized

339
00:15:21,339 --> 00:15:25,479
logging on your network which is a

340
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:27,249
really cool thing to have starts eating

341
00:15:25,479 --> 00:15:28,869
up the processor power a little bit but

342
00:15:27,249 --> 00:15:30,819
you can do it

343
00:15:28,869 --> 00:15:31,759
and you can use it as your single point

344
00:15:30,819 --> 00:15:33,949
of

345
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:36,889
Identity Management if you really want

346
00:15:33,949 --> 00:15:38,809
it to again you starting to add on

347
00:15:36,889 --> 00:15:42,470
features that are gonna tax this little

348
00:15:38,809 --> 00:15:43,608
device but you can do it other things

349
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:45,649
you might want to know about it

350
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:47,359
installations stupid easy with this

351
00:15:45,649 --> 00:15:50,209
particular device you literally just

352
00:15:47,359 --> 00:15:52,489
download the firmware and apply it

353
00:15:50,209 --> 00:15:54,378
through the normal UI and most of the

354
00:15:52,489 --> 00:15:57,559
time that's how it works now you don't

355
00:15:54,379 --> 00:16:00,769
have to fight to get this thing on your

356
00:15:57,559 --> 00:16:03,169
device to even play with it it's

357
00:16:00,769 --> 00:16:04,790
actively developed they have a lot of

358
00:16:03,169 --> 00:16:08,089
stuff around CI CD they have nightly

359
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:10,910
builds so when things change you can

360
00:16:08,089 --> 00:16:13,399
just get the nightly copy of your router

361
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:17,600
firmware if you want to it comes with a

362
00:16:13,399 --> 00:16:19,309
GUI doesn't sound great for you know

363
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,350
more advanced people but if you're just

364
00:16:19,309 --> 00:16:22,639
trying to get started it's a fantastic

365
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:24,859
thing to have to know you just load this

366
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:26,779
firmware on it still got the features

367
00:16:24,859 --> 00:16:28,369
that your old router had before you blew

368
00:16:26,779 --> 00:16:30,769
away the firmware it's got a pretty GUI

369
00:16:28,369 --> 00:16:32,449
that you can probably understand and you

370
00:16:30,769 --> 00:16:36,410
can SSH into the thing and throw

371
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:38,748
commands at it that way so where do we

372
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:40,368
want to leave off with well things have

373
00:16:38,749 --> 00:16:42,799
changed quite a bit since the days of

374
00:16:40,369 --> 00:16:45,529
qui-gon and sis men with fair use' it's

375
00:16:42,799 --> 00:16:47,029
not like that anymore they worked really

376
00:16:45,529 --> 00:16:49,339
hard to get their stuff working and now

377
00:16:47,029 --> 00:16:50,959
you don't have to work that hard so I'm

378
00:16:49,339 --> 00:16:55,699
encouraging everybody to actually just

379
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:57,709
go do this package management it has

380
00:16:55,699 --> 00:17:03,769
package management and its really stupid

381
00:16:57,709 --> 00:17:05,928
easy to use so use it install a console

382
00:17:03,769 --> 00:17:07,250
port you're gonna want it you might want

383
00:17:05,929 --> 00:17:08,899
to learn something about JTAG in case

384
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:12,289
you're doing something more advanced and

385
00:17:08,898 --> 00:17:15,829
blow up your device bus pirate still

386
00:17:12,289 --> 00:17:17,658
your friend they have a fantastic SDK

387
00:17:15,829 --> 00:17:19,609
for this thing and I've actually made

388
00:17:17,659 --> 00:17:22,880
docker images there are existing docker

389
00:17:19,609 --> 00:17:24,740
images for the thing but I felt needed a

390
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:26,179
little more so I have some of my own I'm

391
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:29,289
gonna be posting those up they're not up

392
00:17:26,179 --> 00:17:31,370
yet but I've been using it at home

393
00:17:29,289 --> 00:17:33,620
because I had to build some kernel

394
00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:35,989
modules to make that external USB thing

395
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:38,590
actually work but I was able to do that

396
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:38,590
it was really easy

397
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:47,170
you can find older enterprise level

398
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:49,930
switches pretty easy they're cheap if

399
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:53,740
you look around I got mine for 10 bucks

400
00:17:49,930 --> 00:17:55,540
you can't beat that with a stick I don't

401
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:59,070
think I could buy anything at the store

402
00:17:55,540 --> 00:18:03,610
even like home user grade for 10 bucks

403
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:05,110
so the list of hardware is just up there

404
00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:06,610
so everything and its mother is

405
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:07,990
supported you might have to learn a

406
00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:09,330
little bit about what hardware's

407
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:14,080
actually inside that piece of plastic

408
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:16,929
but it's probably supported so ya get

409
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:19,000
rid of the OEM firmware it's gonna fail

410
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:21,610
you at some point in its life and open

411
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:25,320
word is actively developed so if you can

412
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:28,120
use it I highly recommend that you do

413
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:30,070
there's constantly new routers coming

414
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:32,830
out that have a lot more power than the

415
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:34,210
one that I'm using but I like stability

416
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:36,939
which is one of the other reasons that I

417
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:39,370
chose the one that I have it's well

418
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:42,940
known how to interact with that thing

419
00:18:39,370 --> 00:18:45,219
and yeah it's it's known not to really

420
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:46,570
crash very often and I've been living

421
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:51,700
happily with the thing it doesn't ever

422
00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:55,030
reboot itself USB as I said I use it for

423
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:56,860
an external adapter it's something that

424
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:58,030
you're gonna want to have so here's a

425
00:18:56,860 --> 00:19:01,570
few places you can go to find more

426
00:18:58,030 --> 00:19:03,220
information go look up your own hardware

427
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:05,649
if you got a router at home which you

428
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:09,640
probably do and see if it's supported it

429
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:11,770
probably is you can find information on

430
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:14,620
the embedded device here and you can

431
00:19:11,770 --> 00:19:18,310
find docker images for building open

432
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:21,060
word projects at that site alright

433
00:19:18,310 --> 00:19:21,060
that's it

434
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:29,999
[Applause]
