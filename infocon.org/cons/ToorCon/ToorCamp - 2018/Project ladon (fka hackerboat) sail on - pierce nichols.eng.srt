1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:05,609
hello everybody so without further ado

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:08,639
we have Pierce Nichols here to talk

3
00:00:05,609 --> 00:00:10,530
about the laydown project and and this

4
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:16,350
fine contraption over here so please

5
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:19,590
give them a warm welcome thank you hi

6
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:21,390
folks Jeremy and I have been and some

7
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:23,039
other folks who are unable to make it

8
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:28,170
have been working on building

9
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:31,740
ocean-going sailing robots so our long

10
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:33,719
term goal is to build a sailing robot

11
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:34,559
capable of sailing around the world all

12
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:37,440
on its own

13
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:40,828
totally autonomously since that's kind

14
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:42,620
of a big a big lift in the shorter term

15
00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:44,040
we're working on completing the

16
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:45,780
microtransaction jh

17
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:48,329
and what that is is that's a

18
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:49,940
transatlantic sailing race for

19
00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:53,309
autonomous boats

20
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:56,370
speaking of autonomous that has been

21
00:00:53,309 --> 00:00:59,370
held every year since 2010 no one is

22
00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:03,089
finished yet the maximum size of boat is

23
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:05,880
8 feet which means is pretty cheap to to

24
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:07,770
get out there and compete in it there's

25
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:09,839
a boat in the water right now from a

26
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:11,399
Norwegian outfit that I think probably

27
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,890
is a fairly good chance of being the

28
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:19,049
first to finish west to east

29
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:23,070
we'll see how they do so prehistory on

30
00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:25,920
all this back in 2011 three Hansen knew

31
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:28,710
probably some of you know proved Prost

32
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,869
after after midnight at hagreb rod labs

33
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:33,630
that wouldn't it be cool if we built the

34
00:01:30,869 --> 00:01:36,420
first autonomous boat just to travel all

35
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:39,479
the way around the world no one done it

36
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:42,259
then still nobody's done today

37
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:46,140
so a bunch of folks including Jeremy and

38
00:01:42,259 --> 00:01:49,590
some other folks who are not here worked

39
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:52,799
on planning various parts of that but

40
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:57,350
then we but that original effort didn't

41
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:57,350
get much past the the paper boat stage

42
00:01:58,729 --> 00:02:05,310
back in 2014 we decided that we really

43
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:07,350
wanted to get something out for what was

44
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:11,860
then the third tour camp out in Neah Bay

45
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:14,870
and we went out we bought the cheapest

46
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:18,440
to place fiberglass kayak we could find

47
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:22,730
on find on Craigslist and boy was it

48
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:25,160
cheap and rightly so we brought it out

49
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:27,890
to tour camp it was not really ready for

50
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:34,239
primetime and we tried launching it into

51
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:37,160
the surf and it promptly rolled over so

52
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:40,730
well that was a little depressing after

53
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:43,220
that in 2015 we fix the things that were

54
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:45,470
obviously wrong you know we've made the

55
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:48,980
battery attachment better we improved

56
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:52,280
the way the the way the hatch covers

57
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:54,109
were attached added external status

58
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:57,410
lights basically everything that was

59
00:02:54,110 --> 00:03:02,180
annoying or really brode went poorly

60
00:02:57,410 --> 00:03:06,019
when we tried it at tour camp 3 we we

61
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:08,900
fixed that we also made some changes to

62
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:12,110
the software so it was hopefully work a

63
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:15,319
little bit better we brought it out to

64
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:19,040
tour camp 2016 and while it was stable

65
00:03:15,319 --> 00:03:25,070
that time it didn't actually do very

66
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:30,290
much 2016-2017 we got the software all

67
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:33,500
fixed up got it to navigate to waypoints

68
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:36,140
got it to report its position and status

69
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:40,010
up to the cloud we had some steering

70
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:43,220
issues with it but what eventually put

71
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:44,750
that that boat in mothballs was the fact

72
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:49,819
that both the motor and the battery died

73
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:52,880
I have a couple of maps of where we

74
00:03:49,819 --> 00:03:56,000
actually went testing it around around

75
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:58,340
Elliott Bay right outside of Seattle the

76
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,190
one with all the the blue arrows this

77
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:03,260
guy is when we finally had it out like

78
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:05,269
navigating two waypoints on its own and

79
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:08,899
all that the reason the reason all the

80
00:04:05,269 --> 00:04:10,700
paths are curved is because we had a

81
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:13,850
problem in the code with calculating the

82
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:18,048
magnetic deviation so it followed curved

83
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:21,469
paths to its target that was that was

84
00:04:18,048 --> 00:04:23,020
the trip our test on which we killed the

85
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:29,360
motor in the battery

86
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:31,219
so we put we put that up on this we hang

87
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:33,800
it from the roof of hacker bot labs and

88
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:38,450
it's been there for probably a year and

89
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:39,590
a half now in the middle of that they

90
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:41,120
started building this sailing

91
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:43,340
demonstrator which is the boat that we

92
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:46,310
actually have on stage here and this is

93
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:49,520
pictures of it when we we started

94
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:52,070
putting it together it's all laser-cut

95
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:54,590
plywood it's the simplest possible

96
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:57,980
design of a boat that you might actually

97
00:04:54,590 --> 00:05:00,919
be able to sail somewhere the the bow is

98
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:04,690
plumb the stern is plumb the sides are

99
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:07,420
plumb and they're just two circular arcs

100
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:10,070
nothing complicated

101
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:11,600
the only internal structure other than

102
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:15,409
some bulkheads to give it some stiffness

103
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:18,050
is places where the mast pivots go which

104
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:20,360
is the you can sort of see the cases for

105
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:23,720
them here and then the daggerboard case

106
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:25,820
here just the keel fits through and then

107
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:28,730
you know here's the hull after we got it

108
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:30,230
all painted and fitted out and other

109
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:37,400
than discussed in the paint it looks

110
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:38,780
pretty much the same on stage here so I

111
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:40,549
don't have any pictures of the first set

112
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:42,049
of sails we tried to build for this

113
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:45,080
because they really didn't work very

114
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:46,280
well well at all that is better way to

115
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:49,250
put it

116
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:51,890
and you can see here what the wing sail

117
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:54,710
looks like without its skin on it's got

118
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:57,890
that kind of egg-crate structure that

119
00:05:54,710 --> 00:06:01,849
Jeff talked about that his boat is built

120
00:05:57,890 --> 00:06:04,610
with again all laser-cut plywood and 3d

121
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:08,030
printed style 3d printed fittings for

122
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:12,650
the tip through the tail booms and all

123
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:15,049
that stuff and then you can see the

124
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:17,840
completed one after we got it glued on

125
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:20,260
coated with epoxy got all the sort of

126
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:23,950
low points filled in with epoxy putty

127
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:27,349
when we clamped it we just used some

128
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:30,890
some straight pieces of wood with big

129
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:33,979
foam pads under them across you know

130
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:36,469
just sort of just clamp the skin on to

131
00:06:33,979 --> 00:06:37,940
it a head reason to cut into

132
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:40,280
wings you can see where I covered it

133
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:43,250
over with silver tape recently to

134
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:44,690
install some sensors and I discovered

135
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:47,350
that the internal fillets which of

136
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:50,320
course we did we've done entirely blind

137
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:52,400
right we just sort of gooped on some

138
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:55,640
epoxy with fillers and crossed our

139
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:57,020
fingers that it actually all got into

140
00:06:55,640 --> 00:07:02,750
exactly where it's supposed to be and

141
00:06:57,020 --> 00:07:05,659
it's a really strong structure so the

142
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:08,240
two other really important parts of the

143
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:10,430
boat are the keel which is that big blue

144
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:12,350
thing you can see down there our first

145
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:16,400
cut at a keel was way under sized

146
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:19,070
so this is so the boat you know if keels

147
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:20,539
not big enough the boat rolls over which

148
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:23,990
is of course what it did when we put it

149
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:27,200
in the water that way so we made this

150
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:31,310
larger keel it's a steel tube filled

151
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:32,990
with lead shot and it's got again 3d

152
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:36,590
printed end caps to give it a sort of

153
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:40,280
nicer hydrodynamic shape the other beast

154
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:42,020
here is the brain box for this so it has

155
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:44,929
a BeagleBone blue is sort of the main

156
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:47,810
brain that has a compass and IMU on it

157
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:51,470
which is uh you know tells us which way

158
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:53,270
the boat's pointing you know and more

159
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:57,229
sort of very Makery off-the-shelf stuff

160
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:59,859
we have a Adafruit GPS there RC receiver

161
00:07:57,229 --> 00:08:02,419
so we have some manual override on it

162
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:05,150
cell modem so it can talk to the rest of

163
00:08:02,419 --> 00:08:08,240
the world and then a daisy AIS receiver

164
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:10,130
so so we don't have to have any

165
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,840
unpleasant conversations with a Coast

166
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:17,990
Guard about getting too close to a ferry

167
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:21,380
and this boat we've actually sailed in

168
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:27,169
Green Lake so we've also dry sailed it

169
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:31,640
on a on a pivot so you can see the Green

170
00:08:27,169 --> 00:08:33,860
Lake we have it on a nice tether the

171
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:37,699
nice thing about the tether is that it

172
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:39,650
meant that we couldn't sail it so we had

173
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:41,960
to go swim after it or rent a boat to go

174
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:44,390
after it we could just haul it back when

175
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:47,839
we didn't quite have quite have our

176
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:48,819
sailing dialed in and the other one of

177
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:52,630
these is

178
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:55,060
attached to a pivot for Seattle

179
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:57,250
mini-maker faire last year we got a big

180
00:08:55,060 --> 00:09:00,010
fan put it in front of a pivot put a

181
00:08:57,250 --> 00:09:02,260
random walk on the on the tails and it

182
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:03,910
sort of sailed itself around it's a

183
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:06,700
great visual demonstration of how the

184
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:08,860
sailing works these tails that it has on

185
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:11,680
it were the original 3d printed tails

186
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:13,620
and they were too small so we replaced

187
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:16,089
them with what you had seen out which is

188
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:16,840
you know I keep saying laser-cut

189
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:18,730
such-and-such

190
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:22,630
this boat would not be possible without

191
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:24,730
a laser cutter some laser cut balsa with

192
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:27,430
this absolute thinnest lightest

193
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:30,910
fibreglass surfacing veil that we could

194
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:34,390
find over it and even that you know it's

195
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:35,980
barely there fiberglass made the the

196
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:38,710
balsa wood so strong that you can't

197
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:40,690
break it anymore which is good because

198
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:43,530
I'm always afraid that I'm gonna break

199
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:47,440
these tails when I'm handling the sails

200
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:51,760
so let's talk about how the sailing

201
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:56,640
works so as you can probably see these

202
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:58,750
wing sails are free to rotate the

203
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:00,910
position of the sail relative to the

204
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:03,460
wind is controlled by the tail so it

205
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:05,709
works it's pretty much analogous to the

206
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:07,930
horizontal stabilizer on an airplane in

207
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:14,200
that it sets the angle of attack of the

208
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:16,209
sail so if you of course there are two

209
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:18,160
of them and the reason that we have two

210
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:21,780
of them is that it means we can delete

211
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:24,910
the rudder any anyone who's done any

212
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:29,530
offshore sailing is probably familiar

213
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:30,310
with rudder failures also if look at one

214
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:33,550
of the nice things about the

215
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:35,589
microtransaction jh is that all the

216
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:37,329
competitors are on a mailing list and

217
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:41,020
they talk about why the boats didn't

218
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:43,750
work and probably more than any other

219
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:46,800
singer single class of failures other

220
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:51,670
than getting tangled in fishing gear is

221
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:57,219
is braking rudders so we designed that

222
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:58,449
failure mode out and the way we designed

223
00:10:57,220 --> 00:11:00,450
it out is that we have the two wing

224
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:02,320
sails so we can set the sails

225
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:05,620
differentially

226
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:08,500
right and if you set them at slightly

227
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:11,050
different angles you get a torque around

228
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:12,639
the center of the boat right which is

229
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:14,859
you know just what a rudder gives you

230
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:17,079
right an ability to apply a torque to

231
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:21,930
the Senate a torque to the boat and that

232
00:11:17,079 --> 00:11:25,839
lets you turn however you want to so

233
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:28,449
this is our demo boat and here's our

234
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:34,000
micro Transat configuration

235
00:11:28,449 --> 00:11:36,160
it's 2.4 meters long about 8 feet it's

236
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,670
made with a bunch of slotted together

237
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:42,009
transverse and longitudinal bulkheads

238
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:44,439
that make it very very strong and then

239
00:11:42,009 --> 00:11:48,810
the reason it is pink is because this is

240
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:52,569
just router cut pink slabs of pink foam

241
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:55,920
all glued together sand it to a nice

242
00:11:52,569 --> 00:11:59,079
fair surface and then glassed over and

243
00:11:55,920 --> 00:12:02,469
then you can see our keel hanging down

244
00:11:59,079 --> 00:12:05,170
below which is again a you know a Steve

245
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:07,660
just like this boat a big steel plate

246
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:15,310
with a steel tube welded to the bottom

247
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:18,339
and filled up with lead shot so the main

248
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:20,380
computer for this is Beagle bone blue

249
00:12:18,339 --> 00:12:21,519
again because it's basically a can of

250
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:25,779
robot right

251
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:28,569
it's a Linux computer it's got Wi-Fi on

252
00:12:25,779 --> 00:12:29,920
board it's got I am you on board so we

253
00:12:28,569 --> 00:12:32,680
know where we're going and we can talk

254
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:36,160
to the rest of the boat the wings have

255
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:38,680
Arduino mkr1000 s in them that's again

256
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:41,860
actually the same as this boat the nice

257
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:44,109
thing about the mkr1000 versus another

258
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:46,870
microcontroller with Wi-Fi like the ESP

259
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:49,449
32 is that it's significantly lower

260
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:53,069
power which considering we're powering

261
00:12:49,449 --> 00:12:53,069
the whole thing with solar panels and

262
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:04,630
embattled this configuration with the

263
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:07,029
tails controlling the sails is that our

264
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:12,000
actuator power draws also is really low

265
00:13:07,029 --> 00:13:14,290
only a couple of watts per sale so

266
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,670
talked a little bit about what sensors

267
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:17,770
we have on it

268
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:20,860
so the BeagleBone blue as I said has an

269
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:22,810
IMU so that gives us a compass direction

270
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:25,680
and also it gives us the pitch in the

271
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:27,939
role of the boat as we're sailing along

272
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:30,790
that'll let us say among other things

273
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:32,710
estimate sea state when the boats out in

274
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:35,589
the middle of the ocean you know if it's

275
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:37,930
due if it's doing a lot of this the

276
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:41,140
weather it's probably kind of rough it

277
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:42,310
also has a temperature sensor which is

278
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:45,130
nice for figuring out what the weather

279
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:48,099
is and barometric pressure which also

280
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:51,040
gives us some read on what the ambient

281
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:53,590
weather is beyond that in the main hull

282
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:56,800
we have of course GPS for location

283
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:59,110
because really what what else would we

284
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:02,439
use everything else is much more

285
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:03,610
complicated and expensive and also as a

286
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:06,190
receiver for the automatic

287
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:09,880
identification system and what this is

288
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:11,970
is every large ship over I think the

289
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:16,060
legal requirement is three hundred tons

290
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:19,540
has to broadcast every minute or so its

291
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:21,339
current location speed and course and

292
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:23,650
that means that we can stay far away

293
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:25,780
from fishing vessels we could stay away

294
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:29,319
from cargo vessels when we're in the

295
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:30,490
sound we can stay away from ferries you

296
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:32,050
know not just because they're going

297
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:34,300
pretty fast and they run us right over

298
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:36,219
but because I think sailing an unmanned

299
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:39,400
vessel near to one would would cause

300
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:44,590
some uncomfortable discussions with the

301
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:46,510
Coast Guard then on each sale we have

302
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:48,970
another IMU that measures the

303
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:52,270
orientation of the sail and since we all

304
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:54,010
know that we know the current tail

305
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:56,680
command and the orientation of the sail

306
00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:59,050
we can estimate the wind which is

307
00:14:56,680 --> 00:15:05,800
important to being able to sail the boat

308
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:07,719
where we want it to go so I've broken

309
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:09,280
communications into two different

310
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:11,200
categories

311
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:13,930
there's the inshore communication which

312
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:17,830
is us testing in the sound and that's

313
00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:19,120
the an RC receiver which is just the

314
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:21,640
manual override

315
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:23,440
you know we we're pushing it off the

316
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:26,110
dock we want to sail it off the dock by

317
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:28,240
hand we use that and then it has a cell

318
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:28,830
modem so it can just hit the internet

319
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:32,220
and say

320
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:34,770
hey I'm from wherever I am then when we

321
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:37,440
get to offshore we're looking at rock

322
00:15:34,770 --> 00:15:39,990
block for an Iridium satellite

323
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:42,750
connection nice thing about the rock

324
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:45,810
block is it's relative it's cheap for

325
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:49,190
satellite connections which means it's

326
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:51,229
about $300 worth of hardware cost and

327
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:55,470
something like a quarter of a kilobyte

328
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:57,990
quarter per kilobyte for for bandwidth

329
00:15:55,470 --> 00:16:01,340
cost and we'll probably also put a spot

330
00:15:57,990 --> 00:16:06,630
tracker on board just as a backup GPS of

331
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:08,790
location also inexpensive hardware okay

332
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:11,160
so I would talk about how we're gonna

333
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:12,839
power this thing now my favorite part of

334
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:15,630
the power system is that we're going to

335
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:19,020
power the sails by molding inflexible

336
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:20,730
solar panels I actually have one of the

337
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:22,410
solar panels down in my camp down by the

338
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:27,570
maker stage if you want to come see it I

339
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:29,459
got it from a we bought it off a Chinese

340
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:33,450
outfit called glory solar and it's like

341
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:37,050
18 watts and like so so it's pretty

342
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:40,620
efficient a pretty efficient panel we

343
00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:42,959
have one on each side and I looked at it

344
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:45,990
figured the easiest way to do this was

345
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:48,750
to use each panel to charge its own

346
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:51,570
string of batteries and then we just

347
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:53,630
choose the highest voltage which gets us

348
00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:58,020
a little redundancy on the power system

349
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:59,850
the main computer uses it's probably

350
00:16:58,020 --> 00:17:03,449
gonna end up being too but we originally

351
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:06,180
planned for for solar panels of exactly

352
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:08,970
the same kind mounted on the deck same

353
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:15,780
kind of you know one string per solar

354
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:18,290
panel charging so now I'm going to talk

355
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:22,170
about software for a while because

356
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:24,560
honestly any robot is a big pile of

357
00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:27,810
software with some appropriate Hardware

358
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:31,440
wrapped around it you know like bunny

359
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:34,320
said that the hardware very much governs

360
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:36,210
what the software can do so you start

361
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:38,520
with what the software needs to do and

362
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:39,930
then wrap the hardware around it to

363
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:41,500
figure out what that needs to you know

364
00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:44,440
what that needs to be

365
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:47,760
now that's ideal right now the software

366
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:50,409
is running way behind the hardware so

367
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:53,950
it's built around something called musai

368
00:17:50,409 --> 00:17:57,070
VP which is a it's kind of a middleware

369
00:17:53,950 --> 00:18:02,020
for roba for sailing or not sailing for

370
00:17:57,070 --> 00:18:03,580
maritime robots it's most of the

371
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:09,340
development is out of the University of

372
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:09,730
Oxford and MIT the real advantage of it

373
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:12,668
for us

374
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:13,059
is that it has a lot of modules off the

375
00:18:12,669 --> 00:18:15,730
shelf

376
00:18:13,059 --> 00:18:17,860
that do things like marine obstacle

377
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:21,490
avoidance and marine collision

378
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:23,918
regulations and you know how to do how

379
00:18:21,490 --> 00:18:26,110
to run or set away points things like

380
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:28,870
that it plays well with the Beagle bone

381
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:30,908
blue which when I tried to install Ross

382
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:35,469
on the Beagle bone blew it didn't work

383
00:18:30,909 --> 00:18:37,840
very well but Luce first time it also

384
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:39,549
has a lot of built-in mechanisms for

385
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:42,250
getting the bandwidth of status

386
00:18:39,549 --> 00:18:44,168
reporting down because again most of the

387
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:46,659
people who are using this are on low

388
00:18:44,169 --> 00:18:51,370
bandwidth or expensive bandwidth kind of

389
00:18:46,659 --> 00:18:53,140
links most of the custom software we're

390
00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:56,469
having to build for it is either

391
00:18:53,140 --> 00:19:01,150
configuration specific or specific to

392
00:18:56,470 --> 00:19:03,490
our to our particular hardware the sail

393
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:07,720
controllers no one's ported mu star do

394
00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:09,039
we know yet so we have a Arduino rest

395
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:15,370
interface on them

396
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:17,140
which is reasonably easy to use so so

397
00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:21,340
this is a software configuration which

398
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:23,980
is just say lit under manual control so

399
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:27,820
green stuff is communications RC

400
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:29,500
receiver we wrote a module that speaks

401
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:32,799
something called SBUs which is what the

402
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:35,380
RC receiver speaks and then we have you

403
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:40,030
know a mixer internally for that and

404
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:42,760
then we have this module PA rest which

405
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:46,360
goes and talks to the two sails which I

406
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:49,270
put in red because they're actuators so

407
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:51,639
that's the minimal take it under RC

408
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:55,049
control and go sail it you know go sail

409
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:55,049
it around the base right

410
00:19:55,290 --> 00:20:05,110
now to build up on that we want to add

411
00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:07,150
some GPS and AIS inputs which is the PGP

412
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:10,990
SD what that does that takes the output

413
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:15,940
of GPS D which is software package that

414
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:19,480
parses GPS and parses AIS and it makes

415
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:21,970
that available so we can log it P logger

416
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:25,600
which is here it's paler because that's

417
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:29,020
an off-the-shelf one then can log all

418
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:32,230
that stuff and then we also built in

419
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:34,210
interface that lets it talk to the

420
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:37,150
Adafruit IO service I don't know any of

421
00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:39,700
you familiar with that basically it's a

422
00:20:37,150 --> 00:20:42,700
cloud-based you know hey write some data

423
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:45,370
right and they have they have some nice

424
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:47,010
dashboard tools it's kind of limited but

425
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:49,570
it's good enough for what we're doing

426
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:53,140
it's also relatively cheap and easy to

427
00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:54,879
use and it's it's kind of one more thing

428
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:59,620
we don't need to need to mess around

429
00:20:54,880 --> 00:21:01,570
with nice thing about doing it this

430
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:04,050
modular way is we could just keep

431
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:07,330
learning on modules to do more and more

432
00:21:04,050 --> 00:21:11,860
so you know first time we want to take

433
00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:15,879
it out on its own we bring up helm IVP

434
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:19,020
which is sort of a it's a module that

435
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:22,000
comes with mousse and it lets you take a

436
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:26,050
bunch of behaviors like say follow

437
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:29,290
waypoints and run them in in inside the

438
00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:31,540
helm process and then it outputs based

439
00:21:29,290 --> 00:21:33,659
on on whatever you've told it you know

440
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:36,280
what behaviors you've told it to follow

441
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:43,270
outputs a go this direction this fast

442
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:46,300
right then to also make this work I have

443
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:49,180
a little MUX module that lets me switch

444
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:53,139
between manual and automated control

445
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:55,480
things like that and then I'm currently

446
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:58,270
working on a module called winged sailor

447
00:21:55,480 --> 00:22:01,270
which actually turns go this direction

448
00:21:58,270 --> 00:22:02,800
this fast in to set the foresail tail to

449
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:07,779
this angle of the mizzen tail to this

450
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:09,609
angle and do that thing but this

451
00:22:07,779 --> 00:22:12,789
stack of software is only really good

452
00:22:09,609 --> 00:22:14,949
for you know the putzing around the

453
00:22:12,789 --> 00:22:18,820
sound right making sure the rest of the

454
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:21,849
boat works then when we want to actually

455
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:25,269
go offshore we need to add a few more

456
00:22:21,849 --> 00:22:29,830
things we had need to add a module that

457
00:22:25,269 --> 00:22:32,769
talks to the rock block we need to bring

458
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:35,499
up the contact manager module which is

459
00:22:32,769 --> 00:22:38,200
again a provided one which every time

460
00:22:35,499 --> 00:22:40,059
you see hey the AIS says there's a

461
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:41,830
container ship that's about you know ten

462
00:22:40,059 --> 00:22:46,389
miles away that's on course to run me

463
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:50,529
over contact manager responds the avoid

464
00:22:46,389 --> 00:22:52,029
avoid collision behavior so it sails

465
00:22:50,529 --> 00:22:55,539
away from the thing that's going to run

466
00:22:52,029 --> 00:22:58,089
it over and then we have of course a

467
00:22:55,539 --> 00:23:01,809
power manager module because we need to

468
00:22:58,089 --> 00:23:04,119
keep everything going so that's all the

469
00:23:01,809 --> 00:23:08,799
boat software we need some we need some

470
00:23:04,119 --> 00:23:11,709
shoreside software - so Adafruit i/o

471
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:16,559
gives us a sort of monitoring and

472
00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:19,179
control over cell modem capability I

473
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:21,009
don't have to I hope to mess with a

474
00:23:19,179 --> 00:23:22,929
server or anything like that I just sort

475
00:23:21,009 --> 00:23:26,859
of you know send them a few bucks every

476
00:23:22,929 --> 00:23:28,269
month and it just works their data rate

477
00:23:26,859 --> 00:23:31,960
and their widget library a little

478
00:23:28,269 --> 00:23:35,259
limited though so it's not great for

479
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:37,749
future inshore operations it would be

480
00:23:35,259 --> 00:23:40,359
nice to have a custom web app that it

481
00:23:37,749 --> 00:23:44,499
can go say here have some data and then

482
00:23:40,359 --> 00:23:45,968
it'll COFF the data backup and some sort

483
00:23:44,499 --> 00:23:49,839
of dashboard to be figured out when

484
00:23:45,969 --> 00:23:53,830
we're there for like for real offshore

485
00:23:49,839 --> 00:23:55,029
work the rock block you know you send

486
00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:59,080
little datagrams

487
00:23:55,029 --> 00:24:01,629
and then the rock block company server

488
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:04,899
goes and hits a web app that you tell it

489
00:24:01,629 --> 00:24:11,649
to hit to dump the data out so we'd have

490
00:24:04,899 --> 00:24:16,029
to actually build that okay so here's

491
00:24:11,649 --> 00:24:18,070
where we are on the boat right now we've

492
00:24:16,029 --> 00:24:20,109
got the hull all catted up and we're

493
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:20,620
working on getting all of our ducks in a

494
00:24:20,109 --> 00:24:24,070
row to

495
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:26,260
that all those pieces cut because

496
00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:29,050
unfortunately the largest pieces of wood

497
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:33,309
for that are bigger than the CNC router

498
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:36,399
we currently have access to the wings

499
00:24:33,309 --> 00:24:38,610
and the tails I've got the tails all

500
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:42,730
made and glassed up I just need to do

501
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:43,959
yet more sanding on them to get them

502
00:24:42,730 --> 00:24:46,420
ready to go

503
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:50,260
I've made all of the molds for the wing

504
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:53,140
spars and the wing skins the CAD for the

505
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:55,000
wing is somewhat variant from what

506
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:58,870
actually from what I actually got built

507
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:01,990
so I got to update the CAD to reflect

508
00:24:58,870 --> 00:25:05,439
what I actually built on the electronic

509
00:25:01,990 --> 00:25:08,920
side I've had the PCBs for end

510
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:10,179
components for a few months and I've

511
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:13,920
been busy with other things so that

512
00:25:10,179 --> 00:25:16,600
isn't isn't done I've written all of

513
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:19,600
we've written all of the software except

514
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:23,740
for the rock blocks and power manager

515
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:25,120
modules those are kind of future so

516
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:27,220
we're working on getting all the other

517
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:30,939
ones tested up but make sure they're all

518
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:33,730
working testing is naturally behind so

519
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:37,360
none of you act about software for a

520
00:25:33,730 --> 00:25:41,170
while I have pictures of building the

521
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:44,649
various parts of the of the wings for

522
00:25:41,170 --> 00:25:47,340
the for the micro Transat both so the

523
00:25:44,650 --> 00:25:49,960
first thing I did was was the tails and

524
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:53,649
I figured that the easiest way to KI

525
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:56,559
to build the tails was to cast them I'm

526
00:25:53,650 --> 00:25:58,210
not sure I feel the same way anymore but

527
00:25:56,559 --> 00:26:02,910
the free so the first part of making a

528
00:25:58,210 --> 00:26:05,620
mold is you make sort of a male plug and

529
00:26:02,910 --> 00:26:07,809
again laser-cut plywood in this case

530
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:09,909
with a polycarbonate heap bent

531
00:26:07,809 --> 00:26:12,879
polycarbonate skin over the outside of

532
00:26:09,910 --> 00:26:14,800
it makes a nice smooth mould and I was

533
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:17,830
able to actually pour this rubber you

534
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:22,240
know two-part rubber mold around it that

535
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:27,220
went pretty well so what I did with that

536
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:33,730
was I wanted to cast in the the axles

537
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:34,490
for the tail pieces so I cast basically

538
00:26:33,730 --> 00:26:37,809
foam

539
00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:40,460
the foam cores of each each of the tails

540
00:26:37,809 --> 00:26:43,730
in the mold that you saw earlier

541
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:46,610
and then I you know filled it up so

542
00:26:43,730 --> 00:26:50,450
they're pretty nice surface and then

543
00:26:46,610 --> 00:26:53,629
glass that over when I glassed it I got

544
00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:56,450
access to vacuum bagging which if you're

545
00:26:53,630 --> 00:27:00,230
doing fiberglass just like makes it so

546
00:26:56,450 --> 00:27:02,179
much better it's and what you do is you

547
00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:05,420
basically wrap it in a plastic bag and

548
00:27:02,179 --> 00:27:08,620
and suck all the air out so it clamps

549
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:11,690
the clamps of the fiberglass across

550
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:15,070
against whatever you're covering with

551
00:27:11,690 --> 00:27:17,480
fiberglass so you get a very very dense

552
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:22,540
it tends to suck out most of the air

553
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:26,210
bubbles and it's very dense very nice

554
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:30,770
surface and it feels like it takes a

555
00:27:26,210 --> 00:27:35,150
little less work so for the wing we also

556
00:27:30,770 --> 00:27:37,510
needed to build a plug and yeah it's got

557
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:40,010
you know a big aluminum piece of

558
00:27:37,510 --> 00:27:45,280
rectangle that sort of is the main

559
00:27:40,010 --> 00:27:48,290
strength for it and then plywood ribs to

560
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:51,139
form the shape now

561
00:27:48,290 --> 00:27:55,340
so the polycarbonate worked so well for

562
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:59,240
the for the tail mold they decided we're

563
00:27:55,340 --> 00:28:03,169
going to do the same thing for the for

564
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:04,309
the wing mold heating what was really

565
00:28:03,170 --> 00:28:07,820
about a four by eight sheet of

566
00:28:04,309 --> 00:28:12,678
polycarbonate up so that we could bend

567
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:17,780
it around the the nose radius we needed

568
00:28:12,679 --> 00:28:20,780
to get to get some fire so we got a big

569
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:22,490
steel tube the right size drilled a

570
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:26,870
bunch of holes in it it took it to a

571
00:28:22,490 --> 00:28:30,050
place called Hazzard factory shoved a

572
00:28:26,870 --> 00:28:30,678
propane burner down the whole length set

573
00:28:30,050 --> 00:28:34,669
it on fire

574
00:28:30,679 --> 00:28:37,370
and I I have probably more pictures of

575
00:28:34,670 --> 00:28:39,920
us standing around waiting for it to get

576
00:28:37,370 --> 00:28:44,330
a hot enough to farming temperature than

577
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:46,690
any other stage of the build because you

578
00:28:44,330 --> 00:28:51,309
know we're standing around for

579
00:28:46,690 --> 00:28:53,799
10 or 15 minutes usually I have barely

580
00:28:51,309 --> 00:28:56,918
any pictures of actually putting

581
00:28:53,799 --> 00:28:59,918
fiberglass on things because wearing

582
00:28:56,919 --> 00:29:02,649
gloves to keep it off my skin epoxy it

583
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:04,269
turns out will will give you a ler geez

584
00:29:02,649 --> 00:29:06,340
if you have too much skin contact with

585
00:29:04,269 --> 00:29:09,359
it and then you don't get to use epoxy

586
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:11,978
anymore because it's a sensitizer

587
00:29:09,359 --> 00:29:13,449
and you know if I'm wearing gloves

588
00:29:11,979 --> 00:29:18,099
covered in epoxy I'm sure as hell not

589
00:29:13,450 --> 00:29:20,559
going to touch my phone so I have

590
00:29:18,099 --> 00:29:24,039
pictures of it like this of putting the

591
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:26,559
the skin molds or pulling the skin molds

592
00:29:24,039 --> 00:29:30,720
off of that plug that you saw in the

593
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:34,359
last slide so I have the leading edge

594
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:36,940
both you know while it was curing and

595
00:29:34,359 --> 00:29:39,149
afterwards you can see you know the

596
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:41,950
inside comes out is pretty nice finish

597
00:29:39,149 --> 00:29:43,899
and then you can you know vacuum bag as

598
00:29:41,950 --> 00:29:47,309
skin onto that onto the inside of that

599
00:29:43,899 --> 00:29:53,109
and then it's just like the right shape

600
00:29:47,309 --> 00:29:56,229
and very light and then so the and here

601
00:29:53,109 --> 00:29:58,989
I have them one of the side they the

602
00:29:56,229 --> 00:30:01,210
mold for one of the trailing edges is

603
00:29:58,989 --> 00:30:02,979
all laid up on it unfortunately I didn't

604
00:30:01,210 --> 00:30:05,830
get any pictures of it after I popped it

605
00:30:02,979 --> 00:30:07,289
off but the inside looks similar to the

606
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:10,509
other one

607
00:30:07,289 --> 00:30:13,840
now there's a up the center of the sail

608
00:30:10,509 --> 00:30:18,159
there's a there's a spar that's formed

609
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:20,529
by two hat shapes and the way I made

610
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:23,979
that one is actually the same size piece

611
00:30:20,529 --> 00:30:30,519
of aluminum is the wing but I used a

612
00:30:23,979 --> 00:30:33,460
router to cut a bunch of foam no foam

613
00:30:30,519 --> 00:30:36,190
sections right just two inch thick foam

614
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:38,859
sections is stacked him up glue them

615
00:30:36,190 --> 00:30:42,849
together covered them with one layer of

616
00:30:38,859 --> 00:30:47,080
fiberglass and then the first one I did

617
00:30:42,849 --> 00:30:49,658
by hand the second one I did I applied

618
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:52,168
that fiberglass with a vacuum bag the

619
00:30:49,659 --> 00:30:55,749
second one came out much much better

620
00:30:52,169 --> 00:31:00,230
vacuum bagging is just awesome and then

621
00:30:55,749 --> 00:31:05,090
I hand laid a mold here

622
00:31:00,230 --> 00:31:08,450
now this mold here okay it came off the

623
00:31:05,090 --> 00:31:11,209
plug it was perfect it was straight it

624
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:14,240
was beautiful and I loaded it in my car

625
00:31:11,210 --> 00:31:18,200
before it was completely cured and as a

626
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:20,510
result it got about it you know I'd say

627
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:23,840
about a five degree bent a 5 degree Bend

628
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:27,169
and 15 degree twist which meant I had to

629
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:31,178
do it again this is about five layers of

630
00:31:27,169 --> 00:31:35,900
fiberglass and I did it all in a single

631
00:31:31,179 --> 00:31:38,900
single shot by the time I was putting

632
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:41,030
the top layer on the bottom layer the

633
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:45,940
inside layer was starting to kick

634
00:31:41,030 --> 00:31:45,940
so it was uncomfortably hot to touch it

635
00:31:47,410 --> 00:31:56,150
anyways how am i doing on time well I

636
00:31:51,799 --> 00:31:59,629
have lots of time for questions so team

637
00:31:56,150 --> 00:32:04,330
members of course Jeremy's here Alex

638
00:31:59,630 --> 00:32:06,200
couldn't be here here Alessandro is

639
00:32:04,330 --> 00:32:09,409
definitely involved with this but he's

640
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:13,910
since moved to Colorado and Dillon gray

641
00:32:09,410 --> 00:32:16,940
who could also cannot be here and let's

642
00:32:13,910 --> 00:32:18,320
see so acknowledgments of folks who have

643
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:21,370
really helped us out in one way or

644
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:23,689
another hacker bot labs where were based

645
00:32:21,370 --> 00:32:26,570
the facility at Edmonds Community

646
00:32:23,690 --> 00:32:30,500
College where I've been doing a lot of

647
00:32:26,570 --> 00:32:32,120
machining and composites work it's maker

648
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:32,950
space based out of Community College

649
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:36,139
it's pretty awesome

650
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:40,549
hazard Factory and rusty who probably

651
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:42,380
some of you know helped us with the with

652
00:32:40,549 --> 00:32:48,080
heat bending of things and welding other

653
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:50,320
things BeagleBoard org has been kind

654
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:54,409
enough to give us some hardware

655
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:56,990
Leviathan and Frank Hite have also been

656
00:32:54,410 --> 00:33:00,010
a big help to us and the Arduino folks

657
00:32:56,990 --> 00:33:05,870
have given us some hardware as well so

658
00:33:00,010 --> 00:33:08,690
links have a blog that I should update a

659
00:33:05,870 --> 00:33:11,360
whole lot more often than I do

660
00:33:08,690 --> 00:33:15,010
hacker bot labs also has a blog which I

661
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:18,340
also need to update we haven't yet

662
00:33:15,010 --> 00:33:21,850
github project late on you can see the

663
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:25,090
state of our software and maybe even

664
00:33:21,850 --> 00:33:26,560
give us a hand on that that's you know

665
00:33:25,090 --> 00:33:30,939
that's one of our pain points is that

666
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:32,080
need more software help if you want to

667
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:36,370
just give us some money we have a

668
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:39,490
patreon under our old name hacker bot or

669
00:33:36,370 --> 00:33:42,159
hacker boat I mean and we're also in a

670
00:33:39,490 --> 00:33:46,570
kadai IO which is yet another blog that

671
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:48,810
I need to update okay so I have about

672
00:33:46,570 --> 00:33:57,280
probably 10 or 15 minutes for questions

673
00:33:48,810 --> 00:34:00,929
so any questions okay I think you would

674
00:33:57,280 --> 00:34:00,930
a orange jacket

675
00:34:08,409 --> 00:34:14,450
so I think the lid shot we ended up

676
00:34:11,239 --> 00:34:16,219
using was number four and that's just

677
00:34:14,449 --> 00:34:19,189
because it was on tight

678
00:34:16,219 --> 00:34:23,540
the first size I saw when I was a kid

679
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:28,609
Bella's buying a bag uh-huh and it's a

680
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:32,029
lot easier to to use lead shot than it

681
00:34:28,609 --> 00:34:34,580
is to pour led right because I could

682
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:37,159
just you know it's a bag I cap one end

683
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:39,529
you know I pour the lead shot in until

684
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:42,290
there's enough and then I glue on the

685
00:34:39,530 --> 00:34:46,940
other cap I don't have to do all the

686
00:34:42,290 --> 00:34:49,429
setup for for you know doing a melt and

687
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:51,619
pour with lead because it requires a

688
00:34:49,429 --> 00:34:55,639
fair amount of safety setup to do that

689
00:34:51,619 --> 00:34:58,510
without you know poisoning yourself and

690
00:34:55,639 --> 00:34:58,510
you had

691
00:35:07,130 --> 00:35:15,530
so we got the batteries got donated and

692
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:17,330
replacing them with new batteries I mean

693
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:20,300
their big lead at big lead acid truck

694
00:35:17,330 --> 00:35:21,440
batteries so it's about four hundred for

695
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:24,560
the batteries and about a hundred

696
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:28,430
dollars for new motor so we decided we'd

697
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:33,250
rather spend it on sailboats we may

698
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:41,629
reverse that decision at some point and

699
00:35:33,250 --> 00:35:44,210
in the gray so just eyeballing it when

700
00:35:41,630 --> 00:35:48,380
we're a test sailing it sailing it up at

701
00:35:44,210 --> 00:35:52,070
a green lake it looked like we were able

702
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:55,340
to make progress up to about 15 to 20

703
00:35:52,070 --> 00:35:57,290
degrees off the wind so it sails upwind

704
00:35:55,340 --> 00:36:02,530
really well because you can't left the

705
00:35:57,290 --> 00:36:02,529
sails gray

706
00:36:05,290 --> 00:36:08,380
[Music]

707
00:36:09,470 --> 00:36:13,850
it's really really easy to make

708
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:21,480
really that's that that is its advantage

709
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:25,010
all of the shapes are very easy to

710
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:30,420
understand because it's just two arcs

711
00:36:25,010 --> 00:36:32,220
it's it's vaguely sharpie like and looks

712
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:36,480
a little bit like some of the advanced

713
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:38,609
sharpies that Phil Bolger designed but

714
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:40,440
it's even more simplified than that

715
00:36:38,610 --> 00:36:43,530
because it has no rocker on the bottom

716
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:50,640
it's no curve on the bottom yeah it's

717
00:36:43,530 --> 00:37:03,780
basically just easy with this keel on it

718
00:36:50,640 --> 00:37:06,060
at the water lines about there yeah in

719
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:08,180
open ocean this would be big a hook that

720
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:11,910
would be really good at collecting

721
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:14,160
seaweed fishing gear everything else so

722
00:37:11,910 --> 00:37:16,920
on the ocean-going both the keel is

723
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:19,049
swept back and there's no protrusion so

724
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:21,690
if it does you know pick up some weed

725
00:37:19,050 --> 00:37:28,190
it'll just go down and out rather than

726
00:37:21,690 --> 00:37:28,190
slowing the boat i green hat in the back

727
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:35,019
[Music]

728
00:37:36,090 --> 00:37:41,500
so we wouldn't know we wouldn't want to

729
00:37:38,650 --> 00:37:45,250
do that right because the the best

730
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:46,630
position for the sale in the case so for

731
00:37:45,250 --> 00:37:50,470
instance we were in a storm and we

732
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:53,230
wanted to do deep our is to just feather

733
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:56,049
the tail so that'll point this directly

734
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:59,410
into the wind which is about the lowest

735
00:37:56,050 --> 00:38:00,850
air resistant the lowest wind force that

736
00:37:59,410 --> 00:38:03,730
it could possibly have is when it's

737
00:38:00,850 --> 00:38:07,029
pointed directly into the wind so on

738
00:38:03,730 --> 00:38:09,610
this boat we I can't think of any

739
00:38:07,030 --> 00:38:12,820
circumstances when locking it would be

740
00:38:09,610 --> 00:38:14,260
advantageous and for handling it's

741
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:31,330
better to just take the sails out of the

742
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:33,520
boat okay you had a question than you so

743
00:38:31,330 --> 00:38:40,480
we haven't done all the calculations for

744
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:45,150
that so the expectation is that for for

745
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:49,630
micro Transat we can go several days

746
00:38:45,150 --> 00:38:52,990
without any you know with with basically

747
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:55,060
nothing the thing is is that for the

748
00:38:52,990 --> 00:38:59,649
north atlantic if we did have that sort

749
00:38:55,060 --> 00:39:02,020
of extended period of no no light we'd

750
00:38:59,650 --> 00:39:03,520
probably want to feather the sails

751
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:06,610
because it would probably be a big storm

752
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:10,120
in which case if we feather up the sails

753
00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:14,100
we can shut down the the tail actuators

754
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:16,630
and really reduce our power draw and

755
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:18,250
part of the you know let's talk about

756
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:20,380
with the power manager software that we

757
00:39:18,250 --> 00:39:22,480
haven't written yeah it's sort of

758
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:25,720
starting to shed off that all those

759
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:29,680
loads so we're just burning the minimum

760
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:34,540
amount of electricity and ultimately the

761
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:38,440
system will be set up so that if we lose

762
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:41,410
all power we just drift until we get

763
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:43,830
some sunlight and you had another

764
00:39:41,410 --> 00:39:43,830
question

765
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:55,140
no I just happy I've never done this

766
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:57,540
personally but I know that Jackie

767
00:39:55,140 --> 00:40:01,310
already has been apprehended with always

768
00:39:57,540 --> 00:40:01,310
a point there's a worship into the waves

769
00:40:07,910 --> 00:40:14,990
so our logic for bad weather conditions

770
00:40:11,070 --> 00:40:18,780
is feather up the sails and let it drift

771
00:40:14,990 --> 00:40:22,279
because Ulta because they're you know

772
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:26,099
ultimately a anonymous boat like this

773
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:28,140
differs from a crewed vessel in in a

774
00:40:26,099 --> 00:40:33,359
number of ways first of all there are no

775
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:35,520
unsealed deck openings right that's the

776
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:36,869
first big thing right which means that

777
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:39,900
if we have green water on deck we have

778
00:40:36,869 --> 00:40:41,849
green one on deck who cares right

779
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:43,380
in those kind of conditions we probably

780
00:40:41,849 --> 00:40:47,730
aren't getting any solar power anyways

781
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:52,040
so we're and it's a sealed boat so yeah

782
00:40:47,730 --> 00:40:55,079
it happens the other thing is is that

783
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:59,160
you know sailing vessels you know like

784
00:40:55,079 --> 00:41:02,040
those you know age of sail square

785
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:04,770
riggers were not self-righting right if

786
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:08,040
they went you know if they healed too

787
00:41:04,770 --> 00:41:10,950
far over they were going down this boat

788
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:14,040
will write for itself right from 180

789
00:41:10,950 --> 00:41:17,759
degrees right so if a wave rolls it over

790
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:21,180
a wave rolled it over it's not a not

791
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:23,520
really a big deal it he'll also helps

792
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:26,970
that it's small which means the amount

793
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:28,109
of you know the water on this part is

794
00:41:26,970 --> 00:41:30,509
going that way and the water on the

795
00:41:28,109 --> 00:41:33,390
other part is going that way it's a

796
00:41:30,510 --> 00:41:36,569
small lever arm and the difference isn't

797
00:41:33,390 --> 00:41:38,910
that the velocity difference can't can't

798
00:41:36,569 --> 00:41:46,230
be that large just physically can't be

799
00:41:38,910 --> 00:41:48,629
that large on this boat probably not

800
00:41:46,230 --> 00:41:51,540
that much the axles on these are just

801
00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:55,770
eight millimeter stainless steel rods it

802
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:57,990
wouldn't you could bend one you if you

803
00:41:55,770 --> 00:42:00,560
really wrenched on it you could probably

804
00:41:57,990 --> 00:42:03,200
Bend one just grabbing it here and

805
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:07,020
pulling real hard

806
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:10,410
this boat is designed to hang around on

807
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:16,590
Green Lake and verify that our software

808
00:42:10,410 --> 00:42:20,299
and electronics are sane okay I think

809
00:42:16,590 --> 00:42:20,300
you were first and then you

810
00:42:25,690 --> 00:42:31,910
nope there is no no connection so this

811
00:42:29,869 --> 00:42:35,269
boat since it's just a test but it's

812
00:42:31,910 --> 00:42:37,368
just battery power right so this piece

813
00:42:35,269 --> 00:42:40,640
of tape is covering the electronics

814
00:42:37,369 --> 00:42:43,579
compartment there and actually I'll take

815
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:47,200
it off and actually what do you come by

816
00:42:43,579 --> 00:42:47,200
after and then we can take a look at it

817
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:10,380
so so we looked at different variations

818
00:43:06,270 --> 00:43:17,009
on that he's definitely on our on our

819
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:20,880
radar so we the problem with a lot of

820
00:43:17,010 --> 00:43:23,790
that is that in so if like you have a

821
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:27,180
pendulum connected to a to a generator

822
00:43:23,790 --> 00:43:28,560
right is one way to do that you end up

823
00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:33,330
with a fair amount of mechanical

824
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:36,270
complexity and our design philosophy is

825
00:43:33,330 --> 00:43:37,020
very very much been design out ways for

826
00:43:36,270 --> 00:43:40,410
it to fail

827
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:42,780
right so things tener solid-state we

828
00:43:40,410 --> 00:43:44,370
don't have any slip rings don't have a

829
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:48,930
rudder right

830
00:43:44,370 --> 00:43:51,600
so really averse to adding anything else

831
00:43:48,930 --> 00:43:53,730
that might fail the other thing there is

832
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:55,710
a simple version of that which is like a

833
00:43:53,730 --> 00:43:59,130
little strip of piezoelectric with a

834
00:43:55,710 --> 00:44:00,750
weight on it if you if you have a car

835
00:43:59,130 --> 00:44:02,630
built in like the last 10 years it has a

836
00:44:00,750 --> 00:44:06,150
tire pressure monitoring system and

837
00:44:02,630 --> 00:44:09,240
those little sensors are powered by a

838
00:44:06,150 --> 00:44:11,190
little bit of piezoelectric stuff for

839
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:13,410
the weight on it that that does this

840
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:17,190
while the tires spinning right and power

841
00:44:13,410 --> 00:44:20,730
is that and the problem is is that the

842
00:44:17,190 --> 00:44:22,200
free the roll frequency isn't high

843
00:44:20,730 --> 00:44:23,210
enough to get an appreciable amount of

844
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:26,640
power out of that

845
00:44:23,210 --> 00:44:29,040
so yes we've totally looked into it and

846
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:31,650
it's not really appropriate for our

847
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:37,730
particular architecture and what we're

848
00:44:31,650 --> 00:44:37,730
doing and gray you had a question

849
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:57,578
do you have any on the wing we do we

850
00:44:54,560 --> 00:45:01,640
have a we have a full IMU in each wing

851
00:44:57,579 --> 00:45:05,210
and we use that under normal conditions

852
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:08,109
to sense the wind direction if the two

853
00:45:05,210 --> 00:45:10,490
sails suddenly start support you know

854
00:45:08,109 --> 00:45:14,390
reporting radically different values

855
00:45:10,490 --> 00:45:16,129
then clearly something has gone wrong

856
00:45:14,390 --> 00:45:19,160
the problem is at that point all it

857
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:20,960
could say is hey I'm broken it's not

858
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:23,450
anything we can actually do about it

859
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:25,690
unless it's in Puget Sound then we go

860
00:45:23,450 --> 00:45:25,689
get it

861
00:45:37,450 --> 00:45:44,270
we'll probably have a camera yeah well

862
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:47,740
well okay unless someone gives us a

863
00:45:44,270 --> 00:45:48,950
whole lot of money we're not going to be

864
00:45:47,740 --> 00:45:52,569
live-streaming

865
00:45:48,950 --> 00:45:57,379
anything for the middle of the Atlantic

866
00:45:52,569 --> 00:45:59,359
yeah yeah hey if they want to if they

867
00:45:57,380 --> 00:46:02,089
want to pay for that kind of bandwidth

868
00:45:59,359 --> 00:46:07,009
we will a hundred percent take their

869
00:46:02,089 --> 00:46:08,839
money but haha yes so cameras and

870
00:46:07,010 --> 00:46:10,310
hydrophones are two of the things that

871
00:46:08,839 --> 00:46:13,549
we have been thinking about it on there

872
00:46:10,310 --> 00:46:16,849
so to me that's you know that's mission

873
00:46:13,550 --> 00:46:18,940
payload if it breaks its loss of mission

874
00:46:16,849 --> 00:46:20,810
but we still get the boat back the

875
00:46:18,940 --> 00:46:24,020
everything shall be as simple as

876
00:46:20,810 --> 00:46:26,509
possible or is and we we shall design

877
00:46:24,020 --> 00:46:29,270
out as many failure modes as possible is

878
00:46:26,510 --> 00:46:39,859
more you know ship systems rather than

879
00:46:29,270 --> 00:46:42,079
mission systems no it's all on boards

880
00:46:39,859 --> 00:46:46,040
but the thing is is that everything it

881
00:46:42,079 --> 00:46:47,390
needs to do it can do one board one of

882
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:51,079
the software things we've been thinking

883
00:46:47,390 --> 00:46:53,540
about adding is wind chasing so because

884
00:46:51,079 --> 00:46:56,300
we can take publicly available wind data

885
00:46:53,540 --> 00:47:00,650
and National Weather Service

886
00:46:56,300 --> 00:47:03,710
publishes a global wind forecast for the

887
00:47:00,650 --> 00:47:07,100
next 48 hours every six hours and it's

888
00:47:03,710 --> 00:47:11,570
on a one-mile grit on a one-minute of

889
00:47:07,100 --> 00:47:14,110
art grid which is about a mile so the

890
00:47:11,570 --> 00:47:16,760
data to do that is definitely there

891
00:47:14,110 --> 00:47:18,650
however I'm not quite confident enough

892
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:23,000
in my own software engineering and tests

893
00:47:18,650 --> 00:47:24,950
to to want to take the risk and looking

894
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:27,460
at the wind condition you know the

895
00:47:24,950 --> 00:47:31,250
average wind conditions across the

896
00:47:27,460 --> 00:47:33,290
across the course it's much better to

897
00:47:31,250 --> 00:47:36,170
just drift for a little while and then

898
00:47:33,290 --> 00:47:38,390
the next band of storms or whatever

899
00:47:36,170 --> 00:47:39,860
comes through and you keep going so it

900
00:47:38,390 --> 00:47:41,660
takes a little longer than it would if

901
00:47:39,860 --> 00:47:45,920
you were actively trying to chase the

902
00:47:41,660 --> 00:47:49,670
wind but since just finishing is is the

903
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:58,490
big challenge right now you want to

904
00:47:49,670 --> 00:48:02,450
focus on focus on that so a big one is

905
00:47:58,490 --> 00:48:06,319
having his rudder failure another one is

906
00:48:02,450 --> 00:48:09,410
getting picked up by fishing boats to

907
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:13,400
the point where I think it was last year

908
00:48:09,410 --> 00:48:19,129
the u.s. Naval Academy named one of

909
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:20,470
their boats trawler bait a fair amount

910
00:48:19,130 --> 00:48:23,150
of them vanished without a trace

911
00:48:20,470 --> 00:48:29,509
right which is hard because you don't

912
00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:31,520
know what actually happened to it I said

913
00:48:29,510 --> 00:48:34,700
a sail buoy which is the Norwegian guys

914
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:37,700
had a they had some kind of electrical

915
00:48:34,700 --> 00:48:40,970
failure last year and then the boat got

916
00:48:37,700 --> 00:48:44,480
found which meant that they were able to

917
00:48:40,970 --> 00:48:45,890
diagnose it and try again this year they

918
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:49,430
actually have a reasonable chance of

919
00:48:45,890 --> 00:48:50,870
making it for the west-to-east course

920
00:48:49,430 --> 00:48:53,029
and they're they're actually out there

921
00:48:50,870 --> 00:48:55,580
right now if you go to the micro transit

922
00:48:53,030 --> 00:48:58,870
site you can you can watch their

923
00:48:55,580 --> 00:48:58,870
progress which I certainly have been

924
00:49:01,779 --> 00:49:18,769
yeah you so a lot of that is driven by

925
00:49:16,489 --> 00:49:20,479
what the actual contest rules are which

926
00:49:18,769 --> 00:49:24,258
is it's got to be safety orange pretty

927
00:49:20,479 --> 00:49:26,450
much we could put a put something on the

928
00:49:24,259 --> 00:49:31,009
sails which is you know research vessel

929
00:49:26,450 --> 00:49:33,859
do not molest but a biggie but I think a

930
00:49:31,009 --> 00:49:35,989
big part of our of the way we're going

931
00:49:33,859 --> 00:49:37,848
to deal with it is we're gonna choose

932
00:49:35,989 --> 00:49:42,170
the route so that we tend to stay away

933
00:49:37,849 --> 00:49:43,999
from like the Grand Banks and other

934
00:49:42,170 --> 00:49:46,069
areas that have particularly dense

935
00:49:43,999 --> 00:49:48,229
fishing boats the other nice thing

936
00:49:46,069 --> 00:49:50,779
whether the nice thing is about a is is

937
00:49:48,229 --> 00:49:54,410
that vessels transmit what kind of ship

938
00:49:50,779 --> 00:49:56,059
they are so we can you know so we could

939
00:49:54,410 --> 00:49:57,769
have different rules for what to do

940
00:49:56,059 --> 00:49:59,930
about a fishing vote versus a cargo

941
00:49:57,769 --> 00:50:02,808
vessel like if we're a kilometer away

942
00:49:59,930 --> 00:50:05,089
from you know an oil tanker or a

943
00:50:02,809 --> 00:50:08,239
container ship they're not gonna stop

944
00:50:05,089 --> 00:50:10,999
and mess with us being with inside of a

945
00:50:08,239 --> 00:50:14,809
fishing boat though that's bad for our

946
00:50:10,999 --> 00:50:17,689
health we probably want to give them you

947
00:50:14,809 --> 00:50:19,340
know more like ten kilometers basically

948
00:50:17,690 --> 00:50:24,960
teach the robot fear

949
00:50:19,340 --> 00:50:24,960
[Laughter]

950
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:34,250
we so my feeling about having our own

951
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:37,379
AIS transmitter is that's a lot of

952
00:50:34,250 --> 00:50:40,650
that's a lot of power budget and a lot

953
00:50:37,380 --> 00:50:53,940
of cost for what amounts to a steel

954
00:50:40,650 --> 00:50:56,670
v-sign so no so the North Atlantic is a

955
00:50:53,940 --> 00:50:58,920
big place and if you look at marine

956
00:50:56,670 --> 00:51:02,460
traffic comm you can look at like a

957
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:04,560
continuous global AIS map right and

958
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:05,880
you'll see a couple of dots in the North

959
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:07,440
Atlantic and they look like they're

960
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:11,420
close together and you zoom in and

961
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:14,790
they're 50 miles apart so for us it's

962
00:51:11,420 --> 00:51:17,450
listen for a is stay the hell out of

963
00:51:14,790 --> 00:51:17,450
everybody's way

964
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:41,270
yes formally it gets the rules but you

965
00:51:38,550 --> 00:51:44,760
have to paint it for high visibility

966
00:51:41,270 --> 00:51:46,800
right so people don't run to do it and

967
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:50,460
the other thing is is that if it breaks

968
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:53,100
it is like drifting I kinda like anybody

969
00:51:50,460 --> 00:51:55,410
sees it to pick it up right cuz I've

970
00:51:53,100 --> 00:51:57,360
been broke I'd like to get it bad you

971
00:51:55,410 --> 00:51:59,700
would like to get it back so he could

972
00:51:57,360 --> 00:52:04,170
you know take it apart on the bed should

973
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:07,819
see what the hell went wrong okay any

974
00:52:04,170 --> 00:52:11,240
other questions how am i doing on time

975
00:52:07,820 --> 00:52:13,410
okay so I've been told that I need to

976
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:15,979
little early so I can get the butt off

977
00:52:13,410 --> 00:52:18,990
the stage and clear for the next person

978
00:52:15,980 --> 00:52:21,800
so thank you all for coming we'll

979
00:52:18,990 --> 00:52:21,799
probably be hanging out
