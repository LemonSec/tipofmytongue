1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,140
so all right now we've got something a

2
00:00:01,979 --> 00:00:07,529
little bit special for you we have a

3
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:09,989
workshop Friday at 2:00 on I think

4
00:00:07,529 --> 00:00:12,690
Friday to it the oscilloscope music and

5
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:14,129
Geraldine Fenderson is here to actually

6
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:15,899
give kind of a demo an intro

7
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:18,210
maybe hype a little bit of your interest

8
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:20,730
into attending the event and then you're

9
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:22,140
performing tonight in the same yoga

10
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:24,119
studio where you can't bring your own

11
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:26,250
booze because there will be free booze

12
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:28,080
there so don't do it

13
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:29,640
but without I guess further ado let's

14
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:38,160
welcome to the stage and listen to this

15
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:40,110
wonderful demonstration so hello and

16
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:42,029
thanks for coming to my talk I'm going

17
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:44,280
to tell you a bit about my oscilloscope

18
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:48,690
music project and how I started making

19
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:49,890
it and how it works so you already know

20
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:51,809
that this is more like a short

21
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:54,989
introduction to the workshop later at me

22
00:00:51,809 --> 00:00:57,959
maker States at 2:00 p.m. and I think

23
00:00:54,989 --> 00:00:59,940
before I tell you about how any of this

24
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:02,609
works is probably best to show you an

25
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:05,759
example of what it even is so

26
00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:08,760
oscilloscope music is basically music

27
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:11,280
that is visualized on an analog

28
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:13,049
oscilloscope and here is the first track

29
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,979
that I made with this technique it's

30
00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:15,979
called nuclear black noise

31
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:26,650
[Laughter]

32
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:50,000
[Music]

33
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:58,640
[Music]

34
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:08,940
[Music]

35
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:59,699
[Music]

36
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:13,750
[Music]

37
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:18,459
so I think this is enough to give you an

38
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:20,560
idea what this is like so this video was

39
00:03:18,459 --> 00:03:23,349
filmed from an analog oscilloscope and

40
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:25,780
the signal that goes into it is the same

41
00:03:23,349 --> 00:03:27,579
signal that goes to the speaker's so one

42
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:29,440
channel is used for the horizontal

43
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:31,810
deflection and the other channel is used

44
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:35,290
for vertical deflection on the

45
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:38,260
oscilloscope so I first used an

46
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:39,940
oscilloscope a long time ago when I did

47
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:44,798
an apprenticeship as an electronic

48
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:47,109
technician this is what the everyday

49
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:48,790
life of an electronics technician looks

50
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:52,630
like in this beautiful shot of

51
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:55,900
Shutterstock image so back then all the

52
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:58,269
analog oscilloscopes were being replaced

53
00:03:55,900 --> 00:04:00,069
by digital ones but for teaching

54
00:03:58,269 --> 00:04:03,700
purposes we still use the analog ones

55
00:04:00,069 --> 00:04:09,429
and I got really into the aesthetic of

56
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:11,768
the green analog screen so back then I

57
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:13,720
was already making music and I played in

58
00:04:11,769 --> 00:04:16,690
bands and we tried to visualize our

59
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:19,000
music in several ways so of course I

60
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:21,310
would try out to play music through an

61
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,080
oscilloscope but it didn't really look

62
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:25,870
so good and I will show you an example

63
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:27,849
of what music usually looks like on an

64
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:29,650
oscilloscope if it's not specifically

65
00:04:27,849 --> 00:04:34,889
made for it so here's a song by the

66
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:34,888
Beatles it looks like this

67
00:04:36,389 --> 00:04:42,960
not just anybody

68
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:47,440
so it's basically just squiggly

69
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:49,270
something random lines so I actually

70
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:53,920
forgot about this for quite a long time

71
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:55,359
but then later as I started playing solo

72
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:57,610
electronic music shows and I got

73
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:59,740
interested in sound in a much lower

74
00:04:57,610 --> 00:05:04,480
level like the structure of the

75
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:07,450
waveforms and how they are made and yeah

76
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:11,110
I also studied audio engineering for a

77
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:13,469
while but never finished it but with by

78
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:17,080
studying this I learned a lot more about

79
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:22,030
like algorithmic composition and

80
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:24,550
programming so in this time I discovered

81
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:27,609
this program called pure data maybe some

82
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:29,680
of you already know it it's graphical

83
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:32,770
audio programming environment you have

84
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:35,890
all these all these objects that you

85
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:38,260
just connect and you can perform

86
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:40,659
mathematical operations to create your

87
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:44,920
own waveforms and combine them in some

88
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:47,380
ways so this patch that you can see here

89
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:49,120
is actually the one that I made for

90
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:52,150
nuclear black noise the track that you

91
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:56,020
saw in the beginning it is an additive

92
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:58,690
synthesis patch and the way additive

93
00:05:56,020 --> 00:06:02,320
synthesis works is you only use sine

94
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:06,940
waves and you add them up to to create

95
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:10,260
different sound spectra and I have a

96
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:10,260
video of that as well

97
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:18,400
so here you can see I use these sliders

98
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:21,010
that the base frequency is 100 100 Hertz

99
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:23,229
and then it's multiplied by 1 by 2 pi 3

100
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:27,250
by 4 and so on and I have all these

101
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:34,390
sliders to change the volume of each

102
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:36,740
overtone and the way this sounds is not

103
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:50,280
Oliver

104
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:53,190
I'm not sure why I think I know why and

105
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:56,859
you can see the way forum setting up it

106
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:58,330
sort of sideways but together they form

107
00:06:56,860 --> 00:07:01,110
song

108
00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:01,109
different waveforms

109
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:07,300
as long as you have several of these

110
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:09,640
tones suddenly your perception of it is

111
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:11,950
not the same anymore you to see that as

112
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:14,800
one tone others several different tones

113
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:16,750
so when the frequency is changed it

114
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:21,180
sounds like it's just one so the place

115
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:21,180
melody with a different place

116
00:07:21,849 --> 00:07:27,500
so then the next step is to use a sine

117
00:07:24,979 --> 00:07:29,960
wave on the horizontal channel and the

118
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:32,620
cosine wave on the vertical channel now

119
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:35,180
together they would add up to a circle

120
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:38,870
so here's a slightly different patch

121
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:42,189
that does the same thing for XY on the

122
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:44,810
oscilloscope and you can see it it's

123
00:07:42,189 --> 00:07:48,020
it's circles being drawn at the same

124
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:51,169
time at different speeds so they create

125
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:54,878
these spiral kind of shapes that you

126
00:07:51,169 --> 00:07:54,878
also saw in the clear black noise

127
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:08,180
and now you can see it moving that is

128
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:12,460
when the frequency of one of the

129
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:15,710
overtones is not not a full number

130
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:20,388
multiple of the base frequency so here

131
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:22,758
it is 401 Hertz now so it I was changing

132
00:08:20,389 --> 00:08:25,669
some other frequencies as well so the

133
00:08:22,759 --> 00:08:28,699
image started moving and so I uploaded

134
00:08:25,669 --> 00:08:32,419
my first such video to YouTube in 2013

135
00:08:28,699 --> 00:08:35,000
and and I started playing live shows

136
00:08:32,419 --> 00:08:38,929
with that as well and my life shows I

137
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:45,860
often used a shape like a mushroom I

138
00:08:38,929 --> 00:08:48,739
think yeah and so a lot of people ask me

139
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:52,220
how I make this mushroom so I made a

140
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:53,990
tutorial about that and the tutorial is

141
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:57,649
also done completely on the oscilloscope

142
00:08:53,990 --> 00:09:00,170
so that video got rather popular on

143
00:08:57,649 --> 00:09:04,149
Reddit and so on and I think it is a

144
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:06,890
good explanation how these things work

145
00:09:04,149 --> 00:09:09,920
basically the video all it does is just

146
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:11,300
explaining how the video was made so I

147
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:15,050
think it's a good idea to show you this

148
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:19,189
one as well welcome good people of the

149
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:23,260
Internet today I'm going to show you how

150
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:23,260
to draw mushrooms on an oscilloscope

151
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:32,069
with sound we're gonna use our left

152
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:32,070
audio channel for horizontal deflection

153
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:38,020
now first we need a sine wave on our

154
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:40,150
horizontal deflection channel and a

155
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:42,910
cosine wave on our vertical deflection

156
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:50,560
channel together they add up to a

157
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:52,660
beautiful circle we can alter its size

158
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:56,680
and shape by increasing or decreasing

159
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:59,219
the volume of both channels now we add a

160
00:09:56,680 --> 00:10:02,290
sawtooth waveform to the right channel

161
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:03,160
our circle or ellipse and turns into a

162
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:05,089
spiral

163
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:07,490
[Music]

164
00:10:05,089 --> 00:10:09,620
to get this spiral into the shape of a

165
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:11,360
mushroom we need to multiply our left

166
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:14,860
channel with a sine wave of the same

167
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,860
frequency as the sawtooth

168
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:21,330
but we're only gonna use the signs last

169
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:21,330
quarter

170
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:28,610
of course we want our mushroom to move

171
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:28,610
just like in real life

172
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:35,100
[Music]

173
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:43,180
that's why we now add another sawtooth

174
00:10:40,839 --> 00:10:45,190
multiplied with a cosine wave of a

175
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:47,699
slightly different frequency to our left

176
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:47,699
channel

177
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:56,699
we can increase the number of mushrooms

178
00:10:52,089 --> 00:10:56,699
by dividing the cosines frequency by two

179
00:10:56,819 --> 00:11:00,689
or even by three

180
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:08,469
by randomly adding square waves we get

181
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:08,470
even more mushrooms

182
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:19,520
in fact we can plant an entire field

183
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:37,509
or move into space

184
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:54,169
[Music]

185
00:11:55,890 --> 00:12:00,990
there's no matter how far you go

186
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:18,959
always remember to let there be alone

187
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:29,920
[Music]

188
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:32,620
so so you could see that the images went

189
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:37,209
a bit beyond what was actually explained

190
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:39,850
like with the 3d graphics and but I'm

191
00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:46,150
going to show you a bit about the 3d

192
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:48,250
graphics so here is a here is a patch

193
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:50,490
that does something like this in pure

194
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:50,490
data

195
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:55,439
[Music]

196
00:12:58,090 --> 00:13:04,370
so here you can see it drawing this

197
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:08,569
mushroom landscape with a grid and a

198
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:12,170
butterfly and what it actually does what

199
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:14,690
I do to draw 3d images is this I draw

200
00:13:12,170 --> 00:13:17,329
all these all these things with three

201
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:20,980
coordinates XY and z coordinates and

202
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:23,870
then I just feed them into basically

203
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:27,560
audio rendering engine which works very

204
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:29,960
simply I I just made everything that is

205
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:31,699
further away like that has a high Z

206
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:33,800
coordinated smaller than the other

207
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:35,510
things and then two channels come out

208
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:37,910
that I can heat into the oscilloscope

209
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:40,430
the same way as before so that's

210
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:42,709
basically how it would also work for any

211
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:51,739
3d graphics that are shown on a

212
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:54,310
two-dimensional monitor so was I gonna

213
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:58,010
say yeah I made an album with this in

214
00:13:54,310 --> 00:14:00,260
2016 with 10 tracks of this kind of

215
00:13:58,010 --> 00:14:02,660
music and I teamed up with a friend

216
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:05,840
named Nancy who helped me a lot on the

217
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:10,339
software part of all of this and he made

218
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:12,950
a program called Asti studio which takes

219
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:14,600
away a lot of of the work that we have

220
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:17,420
that you would have to do over and over

221
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:20,240
again like for example the 3d rendering

222
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:22,969
thing and this is all see studio here

223
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:26,560
you can for example just select one of

224
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:26,560
the presets like the cue

225
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:31,080
put some perspective on it

226
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:35,200
rotate

227
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:45,500
and then with this program you also have

228
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:49,279
for example the ability to use this

229
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:52,040
phrase plugin this lets you draw just a

230
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:54,500
part of this line and you can hear the

231
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:56,599
overtones changing it gets more

232
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:58,810
overtones the the more of the image you

233
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,810
draw

234
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:05,490
[Music]

235
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:07,510
so this makes pretty cool sounds and

236
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:10,030
when it rotates

237
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:14,170
you have a constant variation of the

238
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:16,589
sound so I use effects like this a lot

239
00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:18,240
[Music]

240
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:20,120
now another cool thing that this program

241
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:22,740
can do

242
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:25,720
connect to blender

243
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:29,010
many of you probably know blender

244
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:29,010
yeah I can just

245
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:39,990
yeah now I sent this same over

246
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:39,990
this video and I have to sit in there

247
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:44,670
so basically this program converts to

248
00:15:43,319 --> 00:15:46,740
the

249
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:51,510
and one thing that is pretty important

250
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:53,430
when doing so is if you have jumps in

251
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:55,350
the wave form like with the jump from

252
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:58,949
here to there then you suddenly get a

253
00:15:55,350 --> 00:16:01,170
lot of harsh and very loud sounds so the

254
00:15:58,950 --> 00:16:03,870
thing that is important is as you can

255
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:06,449
see when I when I just saw part of it

256
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:10,620
that it always has to be one connected

257
00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:14,240
line so you can see it's it's drawing up

258
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:14,240
and down all of these lines here

259
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,760
and

260
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:24,999
with basically the same technique I did

261
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:26,738
one of my tracks actually several of my

262
00:16:24,999 --> 00:16:29,139
tracks on the album but here's an

263
00:16:26,739 --> 00:16:32,069
animation that I made in blender with

264
00:16:29,139 --> 00:16:37,749
these robot arms that assemble something

265
00:16:32,069 --> 00:16:39,399
and you can also send the sender

266
00:16:37,749 --> 00:16:42,369
complete animation over to Austrey

267
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:44,199
studio however I'm not going to do this

268
00:16:42,369 --> 00:16:47,169
now because it takes some time until

269
00:16:44,199 --> 00:16:51,479
it's all there but I can show you a clip

270
00:16:47,169 --> 00:16:51,480
of how I used it

271
00:16:54,200 --> 00:17:00,299
[Music]

272
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:41,630
you have a little the fact that and then

273
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:41,630
there comes the bicycle and so on

274
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:56,850
yeah anyway so I think that's pretty

275
00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:58,409
much it you can try out all of these

276
00:17:56,850 --> 00:18:02,250
things I made a lot of patches in pure

277
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:04,290
data and max/msp oh yeah one one thing

278
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:06,600
that I also wanted to say is in the new

279
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:10,230
version of Office video which is not out

280
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:12,389
yet but will come out very soon it's

281
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:17,730
been coming out very soon for about a

282
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:20,280
year now this is live coding feature but

283
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:23,000
you can just write code directly in C++

284
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:26,520
so it makes it very efficient to just

285
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:29,360
use to some kinds of operations you

286
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:29,360
example if I

287
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:41,629
see if it does anything yeah now I

288
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:46,070
replaced the x-coordinate with a sign

289
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:48,980
and this makes it very powerful and very

290
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:51,590
efficient to work with sound so actually

291
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:54,590
this opens it up for audio programming

292
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:58,070
of all times not just for oscilloscope

293
00:18:54,590 --> 00:19:02,689
music so yeah anyway you can try out all

294
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:05,360
these things hands-on I made there over

295
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:06,890
in the maker stage from 2:00 p.m. and I

296
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:12,699
think if you have questions it's

297
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:12,700
probably over there unless you have some

298
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:37,190
[Applause]

299
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:56,270
Pacific Science Center on Wednesday

300
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:59,060
night I guess the first time ever with

301
00:19:56,270 --> 00:20:01,490
the laser so basically driving the laser

302
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:03,740
galvo is directly with the sound audio

303
00:20:01,490 --> 00:20:05,210
signals so if you happen to be around on

304
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:07,220
Wednesday night there are tickets

305
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:08,990
available I think we sent out some links

306
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:10,280
if you go to ADA's books comm it's on

307
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:12,950
the events page just be increased by

308
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:19,230
ADA's books so come check it out sorry

309
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:27,460
what's that yes yeah thanks

310
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:27,460
[Applause]
