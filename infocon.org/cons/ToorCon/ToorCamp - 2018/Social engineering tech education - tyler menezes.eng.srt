1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:05,040
so we've got social engineering tech

2
00:00:02,909 --> 00:00:07,140
education coming up next and Tyler is

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:09,269
here either with a full band or a posse

4
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:10,500
I'm not entirely sure which but let me

5
00:00:09,269 --> 00:00:11,700
hand the stage over to him and please

6
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:18,900
welcome him to the stage

7
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:19,859
oh you should get that sat that's cool

8
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:21,330
thank you

9
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:23,670
so yeah I did bring a bunch of people

10
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:25,080
here I know that they're not on the the

11
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:27,180
formal schedule but that's because I

12
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:28,919
wasn't entirely sure who was coming so

13
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:30,960
that's good to know tour camp was

14
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:33,239
actually nice enough to provide all of

15
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:36,660
us free tickets and so a lot of us are

16
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:38,129
from I'm from Seattle but these two for

17
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:39,898
example are from Chicago

18
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:43,350
I'm James over there area on the end is

19
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:46,260
from New York and a TV over there is

20
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:49,350
from Philadelphia and we have a few

21
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:50,940
other people around as well and who we

22
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:53,399
are hopefully will become more clear in

23
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:56,339
a few seconds so social engineering Tech

24
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:57,899
education what exactly does that mean

25
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:59,100
the way that I look at it social

26
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:00,449
engineering applying engineering

27
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:03,059
principles to things that aren't

28
00:01:00,449 --> 00:01:04,619
technology and tech education obviously

29
00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:06,439
getting people interested in technology

30
00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:08,939
and getting them to learn about things

31
00:01:06,439 --> 00:01:10,679
so traditionally the way that we do

32
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:13,039
education is we have like schools we

33
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:16,080
have workshops we have classes we have

34
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,909
guides walkthroughs we have books

35
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,259
whatever and traditionally if you want

36
00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:20,909
to get someone to and to learn about

37
00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:24,630
technology this is the way that people

38
00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:26,820
do things which I think many of us here

39
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:29,460
are familiar with the fact that we are

40
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:31,860
not oftentimes this is not the way that

41
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:33,089
we learn things I think most of the

42
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:34,439
people who come to tour camp are more

43
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:36,180
interested in kind of like the hacker

44
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:36,869
mentality of like find something figure

45
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:45,930
out how it works

46
00:01:36,869 --> 00:01:47,158
but in any case next slide yeah so in

47
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:50,130
any case like I think all of us have

48
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:51,600
friends or kids which I know is a big

49
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:53,460
one and I think it's white or camp gave

50
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:56,189
us some of the tickets here I wants to

51
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:57,270
get more kids involved you know if we

52
00:01:56,189 --> 00:01:58,529
work for a company we might have

53
00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:00,390
executives who do not consider

54
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:02,430
themselves technically minded and I

55
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:04,909
think the big one for me that I am

56
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:07,020
always concerned about is politicians

57
00:02:04,909 --> 00:02:09,360
there are a lot of people who consider

58
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:10,829
themselves as I can't do technology this

59
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,030
is not something I can do and as a

60
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:14,340
result like they're not going to take

61
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:17,099
the classes they're not going to

62
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:21,300
learn to code and that leads to things

63
00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:23,760
that are sometimes humorous sometimes

64
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:27,180
sort of disappointing and sad

65
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:29,879
net neutrality repeal the potential

66
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:31,709
copyright law that is looking more

67
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:33,870
likely that it's going to pass in Europe

68
00:02:31,709 --> 00:02:34,769
if you followed any of that all of these

69
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:36,480
sort of things are because like people

70
00:02:34,769 --> 00:02:38,040
don't know about technology and they

71
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,268
consider themselves like not the sort of

72
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:44,129
person who could ever learn so they

73
00:02:39,269 --> 00:02:45,360
don't give it a try so Who am I I'm

74
00:02:44,129 --> 00:02:46,890
gonna introduce myself I'll have other

75
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,920
people briefly introduce themselves as

76
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:51,540
well I didn't make a slide for them

77
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:53,548
because I didn't have any BIOS

78
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:56,250
I'm Tyler I run a nonprofit that works

79
00:02:53,549 --> 00:02:58,079
all across the u.s. 49 cities I think

80
00:02:56,250 --> 00:03:00,090
right now across the u.s. to get kids

81
00:02:58,079 --> 00:03:02,400
interested in technology and get them to

82
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:04,019
give coding a try and specifically

83
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,280
targeting people who are completely

84
00:03:04,019 --> 00:03:06,840
uninterested in coding and people who

85
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,819
think I could never do this this isn't

86
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:10,260
something that I do for us it's

87
00:03:08,819 --> 00:03:11,790
partially an equity thing like we want

88
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:13,560
to get lower-income kids kids from

89
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:16,560
underrepresented backgrounds interested

90
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:17,819
but it's also you know like I said it's

91
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,889
a thing of just like increasing the

92
00:03:17,819 --> 00:03:21,540
general awareness but for this I did

93
00:03:19,889 --> 00:03:23,220
like Microsoft Research machine learning

94
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:24,900
applied statistics I found it a startup

95
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:28,650
that raised money from what Combinator

96
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:30,000
and and I was not actually the founder

97
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:31,650
of this organization but I did some

98
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,970
other things so my kind of background is

99
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:34,290
basically from like a start-up an

100
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:35,760
engineering background like what can we

101
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:37,650
do for tech education that people aren't

102
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,510
thinking about right now do you guys

103
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:42,090
want to all introduce yourselves really

104
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:44,010
quickly yeah so I can start I'll keep it

105
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:45,930
a bit simple but my name is James Gunn I

106
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:49,078
actually have been working with student

107
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:51,900
R&D for the past three and a half years

108
00:03:49,079 --> 00:03:54,829
just about and that's been in the form

109
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:57,450
of running a code day down in Boca Raton

110
00:03:54,829 --> 00:04:00,150
actually remotely which has had a lot of

111
00:03:57,450 --> 00:04:01,679
challenges and then also to recently run

112
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:06,329
some computer science fairs with

113
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:10,049
Microsoft tools my name is George mater

114
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:13,230
I've run and host I've organized and

115
00:04:10,049 --> 00:04:17,060
hosted to code days and these days I

116
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:20,440
just mentor at code days I just go and

117
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:25,150
help direct kids

118
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:27,310
in their efforts to build things my

119
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:29,650
name's Liam Shoom I've organized the

120
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:31,360
past three eco days in Chicago

121
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:34,090
along with Anton and our original

122
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:36,340
manager Akash previous to that I

123
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:38,429
attended I think five code days as an

124
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:40,840
attendee and it's where I really got

125
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:42,640
really cut my teeth on coding and got

126
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:45,369
got interested in it as a career and

127
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:47,680
I've been doing some stuff recently with

128
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:49,480
a programming club at my school with

129
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,340
some locally organized events for

130
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:52,960
Chicago Public School students so I've

131
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:55,419
just been trying to get involved in tech

132
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,979
education both as a student in terms of

133
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:58,630
like learning cool things and also

134
00:04:56,980 --> 00:05:00,220
organizing events for fellow students

135
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:02,370
haven't had as much experience or

136
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:05,620
opportunities wherever I could find me

137
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:08,170
hi I'm Anton I also started at a code

138
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:10,420
day and have been helping with coda

139
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:11,770
Chicago I think that these types of

140
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:14,950
events are super good at encouraging

141
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:16,570
kids so Liam me and a bunch of my

142
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:18,729
friends all are currently working on in

143
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:20,020
Chicago organization that also does tech

144
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:24,040
events I think tech events are really

145
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:26,320
cool my name is Gian Lazzarini I'm a

146
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:29,890
dotnet software engineering consultant

147
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:31,540
at DXE technology and I don't think I'd

148
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:35,229
be where I am now if it weren't for coda

149
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:38,580
in Stern Rd I started volunteering and

150
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:42,280
found this community back in 2012 and

151
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:45,210
I've seen the work they've done at code

152
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:48,700
days that I've helped volunteer with and

153
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:50,859
impact so many people positively so it's

154
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:54,250
definitely something I'm a big fan of

155
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:55,600
and yeah cool all right so I could tell

156
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:56,650
you more about what we do but I can just

157
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,210
play you this one-minute video which

158
00:05:56,650 --> 00:06:00,460
I'll do a better job in less time I

159
00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:02,409
remember walking into my first coat day

160
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:04,960
and seeing all the faces and everybody

161
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:08,440
on the laptops that was cool to me

162
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:10,090
because where I'm from there's not a lot

163
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:12,820
of people that aren't attackin we didn't

164
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:14,679
we have resources to just have events

165
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:16,419
like this programs start out by reaching

166
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:17,889
students who don't want to take a cs

167
00:06:16,419 --> 00:06:19,359
class because they think program isn't

168
00:06:17,889 --> 00:06:21,220
for me by engaging with an existing

169
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:23,020
interest like art or video games we get

170
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:25,360
them to attend one of our programs you

171
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:27,639
keep these the village Nick ads and

172
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:29,410
there was one with like an Xbox 360

173
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:31,750
controller it is literally just next box

174
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:35,560
360 controller and I said do you want to

175
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:39,100
learn how to make video games and I was

176
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:40,960
like yeah but this is just looks it

177
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:43,240
looks it looked and looked too good to

178
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,500
be true so I clicked it anyways because

179
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:47,470
that's what you do with ads like that

180
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:49,479
you just click them got like five or six

181
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:51,400
of my friends and I told them hey come

182
00:06:49,479 --> 00:06:59,530
come to this thing with me and they

183
00:06:51,400 --> 00:07:02,080
didn't know about code either like every

184
00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:03,429
single one of us in one seats are at one

185
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,659
of our events we teach some computer

186
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:06,460
science through the lens of their

187
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:07,570
existing interests as well as making

188
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:09,400
them feel like part of the coder

189
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:13,560
community the entire thing is just a ton

190
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:16,940
of fun it's this feeling you get where

191
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:20,610
you can just explore

192
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:20,610
[Music]

193
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:48,329
[Music]

194
00:07:51,699 --> 00:07:59,510
really just took me to another another

195
00:07:54,770 --> 00:08:03,229
world opened my eyes and it just really

196
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:05,330
sucked me in yeah so that's us in a

197
00:08:03,229 --> 00:08:06,620
nutshell we work with students we try to

198
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:08,090
get students who wouldn't otherwise be

199
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:10,760
interested interested in technology

200
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:12,440
we've had think at this point about

201
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:15,620
35,000 students who've gone through our

202
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:17,960
programs all across the US and we base

203
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:22,220
everything on behavioral economics which

204
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:26,030
is a fancy educated like Nobel Prize

205
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:28,000
winning term for what I consider to be

206
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:29,989
social engineering effectively

207
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,280
traditionally basically the way this is

208
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:32,719
worked I chose the worst stock

209
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:35,299
photography I possibly could by the way

210
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:38,000
for this presentation so so

211
00:08:35,299 --> 00:08:40,458
traditionally economists considered

212
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,919
people to just be like completely

213
00:08:40,458 --> 00:08:44,959
logical and purely like they do exactly

214
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:46,550
the right thing all the time and clearly

215
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:50,300
that is not what people do that is

216
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:52,160
robots so there is this guy Daniel

217
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:53,750
Kahneman who proposed that this radical

218
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:55,670
idea that humans were not completely

219
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:57,140
rational and did a whole bunch of

220
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:58,640
research into all the ways that humans

221
00:08:57,140 --> 00:09:00,319
are not rational and so even though has

222
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:03,500
the word economics in there it's

223
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:06,020
actually a lot more based on like

224
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:07,310
various you know like logical fallacies

225
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:13,040
did you want to mention thing about that

226
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:16,189
James you know Pat said yeah so I'm

227
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:18,740
actually a recently graduated economics

228
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:20,900
major and one thing that I really like

229
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:23,720
about like behavioral economics and this

230
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:25,069
approach in general is that one thing

231
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:27,050
that student earned II manages to do

232
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:31,490
really well is to adapt to different

233
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:33,410
situations so for example I was one of

234
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:37,190
the first people to

235
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:40,040
long-term manager code day from a

236
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:41,720
different state so while I was going to

237
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:43,939
school in upstate New York I was

238
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:46,550
actually running the code day down in

239
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:48,230
Boca Raton and sort of organizing

240
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:50,449
everything via phone calls and emails

241
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:52,040
and so that was a very different

242
00:09:50,449 --> 00:09:55,310
experience from what a lot of our

243
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:56,689
organizers have in terms of you know the

244
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:59,989
challenges that arise from that and

245
00:09:56,689 --> 00:10:01,639
managing a team remotely and one great

246
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:04,550
thing about behavioral economics is that

247
00:10:01,639 --> 00:10:05,240
really it boils down to if something

248
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:08,300
isn't working

249
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:11,750
you really cannot just keep doing what

250
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:13,519
you're doing and to that same degree you

251
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:14,930
know a lot of things can be made more

252
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:17,629
efficient by trying to standardize

253
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:20,329
certain processes and one thing that we

254
00:10:17,629 --> 00:10:23,060
do really well is to avoid doing that

255
00:10:20,329 --> 00:10:25,519
when things aren't working so we will

256
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:27,258
try to standardize things to make things

257
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:29,360
more efficient but if those things

258
00:10:27,259 --> 00:10:32,689
aren't working in certain contexts then

259
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:34,759
we try you know everything possible to

260
00:10:32,689 --> 00:10:37,069
try to figure out why that is and to

261
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:39,019
introduce new variables that wouldn't

262
00:10:37,069 --> 00:10:41,360
traditionally be considered right so

263
00:10:39,019 --> 00:10:43,519
basically traditional framework is way

264
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:45,050
to teach CS is traditional schooling and

265
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:47,089
behavioral economics is like a different

266
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:48,800
framework for us to look at problems and

267
00:10:47,089 --> 00:10:50,959
find new approaches

268
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,370
so Daniel Khanna is the guy who prevents

269
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:54,319
it presented this initially he won a

270
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:56,089
Nobel Prize for it if you're interested

271
00:10:54,319 --> 00:10:58,160
in detail there's a book called Thinking

272
00:10:56,089 --> 00:10:59,089
Fast and Slow which is really cool but

273
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,469
I'm just gonna go through some of the

274
00:10:59,089 --> 00:11:01,880
things that we've actually learned that

275
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:03,529
it hopefully will be helpful to you as

276
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:07,310
you try to get your kids your friends

277
00:11:03,529 --> 00:11:09,230
your family members or if you happen to

278
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:10,630
know any politicians who might be able

279
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:13,300
to vote on things like that neutrality

280
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:15,470
some things that we've learned that from

281
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:17,029
applying this to tech education that

282
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:18,920
might be helpful so first one is just

283
00:11:17,029 --> 00:11:20,540
getting people interested and one of the

284
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:21,889
things again I put quotes from Daniel

285
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:25,040
Kahneman it doesn't really matter but

286
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:27,170
like people tend to believe things just

287
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:28,550
because they're told them a lot and so

288
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:30,079
one of the most common ones that you'll

289
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:33,349
see what this is like this is a picture

290
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:34,638
of someone in a code day people think of

291
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:36,379
themselves in terms of identities

292
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:38,660
because they're told that this is the

293
00:11:36,379 --> 00:11:40,100
way they are so if someone is good when

294
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:42,139
they're really young at music for

295
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:43,610
example as perhaps this person is I

296
00:11:42,139 --> 00:11:46,130
haven't actually met her but she was at

297
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:47,270
one of our events so if people are told

298
00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:48,290
that they're you know they're

299
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:49,610
really good at music from a young age

300
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:51,410
they'll tend to think of themselves as

301
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:53,090
really good at music from a young age

302
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:54,800
and for the rest of their life

303
00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:56,900
unless it's challenged they'll consider

304
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:58,969
themselves to be that sort of person

305
00:11:56,900 --> 00:12:00,470
and at the same time a lot of people and

306
00:11:58,970 --> 00:12:02,120
I think that we are all familiar with

307
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:05,540
this have this view of what programming

308
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:06,680
and hacking is which is so I mean

309
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:08,030
obviously this is a little bit

310
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:09,650
exaggerated but I've gone into high

311
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:11,180
schools especially in the middle of the

312
00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:12,439
US and people and I ask them what they

313
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:15,800
think of when I say programming they'll

314
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:17,360
literally describe this so you'd be

315
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:18,740
surprised at the number of people who do

316
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,360
legitimately think that programming is

317
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:22,460
typing ones and zeros even if not

318
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:24,620
completely logically at some level

319
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:26,750
people seem to believe this and so if

320
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:28,880
you are this sort of person you're not

321
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:30,530
very likely to consider yourselves to be

322
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:32,120
this sort of person it's not something

323
00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:33,770
that you think is very achievable and

324
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:36,080
there's that's not true I mean I think

325
00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:37,220
that certainly even a tour camp I've

326
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:38,930
never been to tour camp by the way I

327
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:41,960
mean this is this has been amazing and

328
00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:43,310
like the amount of art and music and the

329
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:45,860
way that everything is sort of connected

330
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:47,180
together is really amazing but for a lot

331
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:48,380
of people if you just ask them do you

332
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:50,000
want to learn to code they would say

333
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:51,380
absolutely not I could never do anything

334
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,360
like that because that's not the sort of

335
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:54,650
person that I am so having what I like

336
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:57,260
to call these sort of like hybrid

337
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:58,730
activities is first of all a really

338
00:12:57,260 --> 00:13:00,380
great way to get people interested in

339
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:01,700
learning um if you just ask people do

340
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:04,189
you want to learn to code most of them

341
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:05,810
will say no for something like tour camp

342
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:07,280
it might be music and art there's a lot

343
00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:08,630
of really cool music and art things and

344
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:10,370
in fact I've gotten some of the people

345
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:13,100
to come to tour camp with our group

346
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:14,390
because you know there was lots of

347
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:17,030
really interesting things like the creme

348
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:19,160
brulee talk that's not you know a

349
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:21,860
traditional oh here's how to you know do

350
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:24,589
network security or something talk for

351
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:26,090
us it's code day it's video games and so

352
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:27,170
what we do is we will actually just talk

353
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:28,850
to students and we'll say do you want to

354
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:30,079
make a game and they'll say no I don't

355
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:30,500
want to code a game we'll say well it's

356
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,060
okay

357
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:33,710
do you wanna make art for me for a video

358
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:36,050
game you wanna make music for a video

359
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:37,520
game do you want to do voice acting for

360
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:38,839
a video game and that's actually how we

361
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:40,370
get a lot of people who have never

362
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:41,810
considered themselves a programmer and

363
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:45,500
who've never considered trying to do

364
00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:47,000
programming you know interested in

365
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:48,230
coding so that's that's one thing that

366
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,790
you can do is if you're trying to get

367
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:51,410
like a student of your if you're trying

368
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:53,810
to get like a child of yours interested

369
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:55,339
in programming one way to do that is

370
00:13:53,810 --> 00:13:56,479
actually to not try to get them

371
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:58,190
interested in programming at all because

372
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,820
they don't want to do that and to find

373
00:13:58,190 --> 00:14:00,950
something that they're already

374
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:02,840
interested in figure out some way

375
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:04,520
it's related to technology and start

376
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:05,570
from that basis and obviously that's not

377
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,530
going to teach them everything about

378
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:07,910
coding but it's going to get them

379
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:09,170
excited enough and I think that we're

380
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:10,969
all familiar with the fact that like

381
00:14:09,170 --> 00:14:12,130
intuitively people are curious I think

382
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:15,220
that's why we're all here

383
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:19,870
sparking that is is really important

384
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:23,270
second one making programming fun so

385
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:24,920
basically what what this section boils

386
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:26,630
down to is like programming languages

387
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:27,680
that are real programming language is

388
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:29,090
what we would consider to be real

389
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:31,459
programming languages are really shitty

390
00:14:29,090 --> 00:14:33,170
for people who are not experienced in

391
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:35,210
programming and so like if you chart fun

392
00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:36,650
whatever that means on a graph this is

393
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:38,150
kind of what the story looks like you

394
00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:39,829
come in like moderately excited

395
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:41,300
especially if you're a beginner you're

396
00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:42,770
like really excited I'm gonna work on

397
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:44,449
this cool thing I want to do you know

398
00:14:42,770 --> 00:14:46,189
like we get you excited about that and

399
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:48,110
then you try to do it you don't make any

400
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:49,880
progress and like maybe you make a tiny

401
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:51,110
bit of progress and then you don't make

402
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:52,430
any progress because you hit your head

403
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:53,960
against a wall for an hour because we

404
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:57,349
all know that programming is actually

405
00:14:53,960 --> 00:15:00,440
like 80 percent like debugging and 20

406
00:14:57,350 --> 00:15:01,880
percent bugging right it's not you know

407
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:03,530
you hit your head against a wall for a

408
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:05,300
really long time especially if you're a

409
00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:06,530
beginner because everything is new to

410
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:08,150
you and you have no idea how to do

411
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:09,620
anything and then maybe you make a

412
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:10,910
little bit of progress again and you get

413
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:12,080
a build working and it kind of does

414
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:14,300
something and it's not anywhere near

415
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:15,590
what you want it to be and then you hit

416
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:16,819
your head against the wall for a while

417
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:18,440
and eventually you get to this point

418
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:20,720
that I like to call and I don't say this

419
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:23,420
when I'm talking to schools I like to

420
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:25,520
call it the point and eventually

421
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:26,870
if you are tired enough of programming

422
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:29,510
and you hit your head against a wall for

423
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:30,980
long enough you get to this point where

424
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:34,640
you're like I don't want to do this

425
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:37,850
anymore it I'm going home that is

426
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:39,980
what we want to avoid and so how do we

427
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:42,080
make this as fun as possible real

428
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:43,580
programming languages well great for the

429
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:45,440
long term it's great for someone to know

430
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:48,050
that they're really not very good for

431
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:49,700
beginners because this is what they

432
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:51,349
cause as people hit their head against a

433
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:53,870
wall for a while what they don't really

434
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:55,670
want to be there and so an example of

435
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:56,870
this is like scratch is the common one

436
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:58,640
that we teach to be inners I actually

437
00:15:56,870 --> 00:16:00,770
really don't like scratch because the

438
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:02,900
thing about scratch is you have to

439
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:04,640
understand game loops and yes you don't

440
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:07,100
have to actually understand how to drag

441
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:08,210
and drop things you don't have to

442
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:10,010
understand how to write code cuz you can

443
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:10,850
drag and drop things but conceptually if

444
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:13,160
you want to make a game where a

445
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:14,420
character can jump up and down you have

446
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:15,800
to understand

447
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:17,510
that conceptually physics is just

448
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:18,829
pulling someone down toward the ground

449
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:21,110
and when they collide with something

450
00:16:18,829 --> 00:16:22,459
then it stops and that conceptually when

451
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:23,899
someone is jumping up all you're doing

452
00:16:22,459 --> 00:16:26,660
is adding a force upwards and that

453
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:28,639
conceptually the way that a game works

454
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:30,290
is it just every frame you know is

455
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:31,970
constantly pulling them down a certain

456
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:33,620
amount based on you know I mean it's

457
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:35,120
just it's like you need to know so much

458
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:37,850
about how something works to make a

459
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:39,139
really simple game so we actually like

460
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:41,510
to use the thing called construct and

461
00:16:39,139 --> 00:16:44,600
I'm gonna see if I can okay this isn't

462
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:46,089
already not boding well if I can I'm

463
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:48,290
gonna do a demo of this really quickly

464
00:16:46,089 --> 00:16:50,930
let's see if I can connect to the Wi-Fi

465
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:52,639
or not if not it's no big deal so I can

466
00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:57,979
just talk to that a bit while he's

467
00:16:52,639 --> 00:17:01,399
trying to figure this out so so I think

468
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:03,139
that I can testify very well to this so

469
00:17:01,399 --> 00:17:06,140
when I was a kid my dad tried throwing

470
00:17:03,139 --> 00:17:08,630
like C++ books at me and it never really

471
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:10,850
got me interested in coding but once I

472
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:14,419
started being able to program from a

473
00:17:10,849 --> 00:17:16,339
more like friendly sort of manner then I

474
00:17:14,419 --> 00:17:18,020
got way more interested in coding and

475
00:17:16,339 --> 00:17:20,359
I've seen that at all the events that

476
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:22,910
I've run and all the student Rd type

477
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:24,948
events is that we're able to figure out

478
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:27,020
the best like good ways to actually

479
00:17:24,949 --> 00:17:29,240
connect with students and get them

480
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:31,309
interested in something that you know I

481
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:33,770
you wouldn't get from being thrown a

482
00:17:31,309 --> 00:17:35,990
book with tons of like code snippets

483
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:37,490
yeah so I'm gonna really quickly like in

484
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:38,870
five minutes I think run you through how

485
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:40,730
we would teach students to make a game

486
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:42,139
so we find we start with something

487
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:44,330
interesting how many people in this room

488
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:46,309
know Bill Gates right

489
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:48,439
yeah I'm not I'm not even gonna actually

490
00:17:46,309 --> 00:17:49,910
require you to raise your hands so

491
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:51,020
here's what we do is we find that it has

492
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:56,630
anyone seen the video of Bill Gates

493
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:58,549
jumping over a chair okay so this is

494
00:17:56,630 --> 00:18:00,080
what we do we play this video and

495
00:17:58,549 --> 00:18:01,220
students all know Bill Gates but none of

496
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,659
them have seen this video so it's great

497
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:03,440
you can leap over a chair from a

498
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:06,230
standing position

499
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:08,269
it depends on the size of the chair I'll

500
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:11,109
cheat a little bit

501
00:18:08,269 --> 00:18:11,109
yeah

502
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:17,430
[Music]

503
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:18,980
feels good

504
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:22,080
[Music]

505
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:26,400
yeah so students love that as I think we

506
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:27,870
do as well why close I closed it so what

507
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,700
we would do is we would say okay well

508
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:31,080
this area right here is our world and

509
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:32,550
this construct thing don't worry about

510
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:33,750
what it is yet and what we're gonna do

511
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:35,280
is we're gonna create a new thing in the

512
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:36,960
world it's called an object don't worry

513
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,070
about that what that means everything in

514
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,630
a game pretty much is going to be a

515
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:41,428
sprite some things won't be but you'll

516
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:43,080
probably start out with this so if

517
00:18:41,429 --> 00:18:44,760
you're not sure go for it we're gonna

518
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:46,949
make the things in this world what is

519
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:50,460
one of the things ask the students Bill

520
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:51,840
Gates right we'll click on the world

521
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:54,750
does someone want to come up here and

522
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:57,240
draw Bill Gates as fast as they can go

523
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:59,070
volunteer okay Jeannie I'm gonna have

524
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:03,240
you do it draw up Bill Gates as fast as

525
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:05,790
you can go for it you also have to look

526
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:09,350
backwards because my Linux monitor

527
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:09,350
configuration is interesting

528
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:29,210
okay I'm gonna I'm gonna call it as good

529
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:30,710
enough because I this isn't the entire

530
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:32,270
point of the the thing but yeah I mean

531
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:34,690
this is this is the general idea so

532
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:37,520
we'll do that and we have to crop it

533
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:38,900
right and then we'll have that you know

534
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:40,310
and in real life we do this in 20

535
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:41,930
minutes instead of five minutes but I'm

536
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:46,010
gonna do as fast as possible we have the

537
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:47,180
chair so we'll make a chair and a chair

538
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:48,980
is this bright because almost everything

539
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:51,140
in a video game is a sprite and every

540
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:52,670
single student draws the same chair the

541
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:56,780
only difference is which direction it's

542
00:19:52,670 --> 00:20:00,650
spacing will crop it we'll put it here

543
00:19:56,780 --> 00:20:01,879
and okay so if we hit run now this is

544
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:06,500
gonna make the world's most boring game

545
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:08,690
because nothing happens so yeah that's

546
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:11,330
our game right so now what do we have to

547
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:12,800
do well first of all we actually need

548
00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:14,389
the ground and usually I'd let students

549
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:15,860
figure out that this is a problem on its

550
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:17,750
own but this is where I talk about how

551
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:21,080
computers are stupid and how if you

552
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:22,370
don't put the ground in then things will

553
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:24,649
happen and by the way you can't aim it

554
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:28,310
floor because that is a mathematical

555
00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:29,690
operation so we have some ground and

556
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:31,399
we'll go ahead and resize it and this

557
00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:33,680
thing this language by the way has all

558
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:35,840
sorts of stuff like arrays and linked

559
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:38,000
lists and like you could do in-app

560
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:40,310
purchases and everything but here's the

561
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,110
way it works we talked about concepts we

562
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:44,240
talked about objects versus instances

563
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:46,010
but here's the key of the entire thing

564
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:48,200
is like in five minutes all I have to do

565
00:20:46,010 --> 00:20:49,790
is like add platforming behavior because

566
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,810
every game is gonna have platforming

567
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:52,310
behavior and some people would say

568
00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:54,290
that's because you're not

569
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:56,629
turned teaching the code and I would say

570
00:20:54,290 --> 00:20:58,550
like every single programmer imports

571
00:20:56,630 --> 00:21:01,040
modules all the time to do all sorts of

572
00:20:58,550 --> 00:21:02,540
basic stuff oh yeah and by the way

573
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:05,750
computers are stupid so we have to tell

574
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:07,100
it but the floor is a solid right so

575
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:09,350
we'll go ahead and click on this and add

576
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:12,709
it behaviors and add a new effect and

577
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:15,709
we'll say oh oh sorry I added an effect

578
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:17,840
in cinema behavior behaviorism will add

579
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:20,150
a behavior and we'll say it's a solid

580
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:21,949
and we'll do this and by the way this

581
00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:25,160
does have actual code but all of the

582
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:26,780
basic stuff is basically in modules you

583
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:28,100
can just import so now we have a jumping

584
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:29,100
game and we could add collision

585
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:30,510
detection of the chair

586
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:31,799
and what I'll have students do then is

587
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:33,510
then go on their own and like add a

588
00:21:31,799 --> 00:21:35,280
bunch of fun things that they have on

589
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:37,049
their own and so we'll have things like

590
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:38,549
chairs flying down from the ceiling and

591
00:21:37,049 --> 00:21:40,170
Bill Gates is trying to dodge them and

592
00:21:38,549 --> 00:21:42,179
they can do all of this in less than an

593
00:21:40,170 --> 00:21:43,440
hour and then every single one of them

594
00:21:42,179 --> 00:21:44,820
comes out of this workshop with an

595
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,049
immediate idea of what they're gonna do

596
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:47,639
next and they're excited and they're

597
00:21:46,049 --> 00:21:48,900
they think it's going to be so cool and

598
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:50,250
if they're an artist they want to add

599
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:51,809
all sorts of cool art but they still do

600
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:53,250
the gameplay and if they're a musician

601
00:21:51,809 --> 00:21:55,049
they want to add music but they still do

602
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:56,670
the gameplay and when you get down to it

603
00:21:55,049 --> 00:21:59,580
the gameplay is writing these things and

604
00:21:56,670 --> 00:22:00,960
events which are basically like

605
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:02,610
JavaScript events because this entire

606
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:04,410
thing is made in JavaScript and by the

607
00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:06,178
way after you go out of code day you can

608
00:22:04,410 --> 00:22:07,950
write modules for this in JavaScript and

609
00:22:06,179 --> 00:22:09,840
so it's it's really great because I

610
00:22:07,950 --> 00:22:11,250
agree with people who say that this

611
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,809
isn't real programming in the sense that

612
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:15,330
we do it but it gets people interested

613
00:22:12,809 --> 00:22:20,040
right away so that's one of the key

614
00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:25,439
things I wanted to talk about go back

615
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:29,700
into from current slide that is not what

616
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:30,780
from current slide means that's okay

617
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:33,030
I'll just click that really quickly

618
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:36,960
anyone else want to add anything to that

619
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:38,399
general concept while we're yeah so I

620
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:41,549
would say that this works well because

621
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:42,770
it manages to engage students through

622
00:22:41,549 --> 00:22:45,179
video games

623
00:22:42,770 --> 00:22:47,220
everyone loves video games so one thing

624
00:22:45,179 --> 00:22:49,020
we actually did recently was trying to

625
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:52,140
develop some new workshops for those CS

626
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:54,179
fairs I mentioned and one idea I came up

627
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:57,390
with was to do something blockchain

628
00:22:54,179 --> 00:22:59,250
related and so I managed to put together

629
00:22:57,390 --> 00:23:02,220
this workshop that taught students how

630
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:04,740
to deploy their own ERC 20 token in like

631
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:07,110
half an hour and it was really simple

632
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:08,669
didn't even require writing any code but

633
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:10,949
managed to explain to them some basic

634
00:23:08,669 --> 00:23:14,070
ideas behind blockchain and

635
00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:15,450
cryptocurrency and you know they were

636
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:17,159
way with that pretty quickly those

637
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:18,540
workshops were packed same with like 3d

638
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:21,630
printing which is not really coding but

639
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:23,010
it gets them in the door and it brings

640
00:23:21,630 --> 00:23:24,990
you know again we were looking at that

641
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:26,549
graph of like you know the point

642
00:23:24,990 --> 00:23:27,809
this like immediately gives them

643
00:23:26,549 --> 00:23:31,770
something to catch hold - and we'll talk

644
00:23:27,809 --> 00:23:33,629
about the next part later to give

645
00:23:31,770 --> 00:23:36,150
realistic expectations this is another

646
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:37,890
really big one for us so a lot of

647
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:39,210
students people tend to assess the

648
00:23:37,890 --> 00:23:40,590
relative importance of issues by the

649
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:42,060
ease of which they retrieve from memory

650
00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:43,620
as in

651
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:44,970
that are easy to remember things or

652
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:46,229
things that are easy to see are things

653
00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:49,410
that we think are true which is not

654
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:51,390
always the case so if we think about

655
00:23:49,410 --> 00:23:53,820
like a sporting event or like racecar

656
00:23:51,390 --> 00:23:55,800
driving it's very easy to tell who is in

657
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:57,149
the lead and students can tell who is in

658
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:58,590
the lead and if they were racing the car

659
00:23:57,150 --> 00:24:00,060
they'd be able to tell roughly where

660
00:23:58,590 --> 00:24:01,290
they were I mean you know maybe you

661
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:03,510
don't have a bird's-eye view of the

662
00:24:01,290 --> 00:24:04,649
entire thing but still with coating it's

663
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:06,660
like how do you know how well this is

664
00:24:04,650 --> 00:24:08,070
doing right I mean then all of us have

665
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:10,380
probably had this experience we don't

666
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:12,840
know how well this is doing for students

667
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:14,610
who are new to this entire thing they

668
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:17,129
look at their code and they're like

669
00:24:14,610 --> 00:24:19,020
like this doesn't work why doesn't it

670
00:24:17,130 --> 00:24:20,670
work and then they look at someone else

671
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:22,680
who has their code building and they're

672
00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:24,600
like they got it to work and of course

673
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:26,070
that person had the exact same struggles

674
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:27,959
20 minutes ago but like from the outside

675
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:31,770
you just see two people sitting at a

676
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:33,090
screen right so you can't tell like

677
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:34,500
maybe you could measure like pizza

678
00:24:33,090 --> 00:24:36,000
consumption and my guess is the people

679
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:38,490
who are eating more pizza probably have

680
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,470
a slightly more free time you know or

681
00:24:38,490 --> 00:24:41,700
whatever or like I - I always tell

682
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:42,810
people to like look for when they're

683
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:44,070
looking for people who are stressed out

684
00:24:42,810 --> 00:24:45,480
look for things like people who are like

685
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:47,310
biting their nails or like running their

686
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:48,870
hands through their hair that's the

687
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:50,220
extent of the feedback that we get on

688
00:24:48,870 --> 00:24:51,810
how well people are doing in students

689
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:53,760
aren't looking for it and so as a result

690
00:24:51,810 --> 00:24:56,179
like students tend to judge themselves

691
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:58,320
by the struggle that they go through and

692
00:24:56,180 --> 00:25:00,240
on the other hand they judge other

693
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:02,490
people by the result that they see and

694
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:04,440
as a result when students talk to

695
00:25:02,490 --> 00:25:07,020
mentors or any of us who are actually

696
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:08,760
good at things they don't see us as

697
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:10,530
people who have learned to do things but

698
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:13,170
don't know how to do many things as well

699
00:25:10,530 --> 00:25:14,790
they see oh we're a programming expert

700
00:25:13,170 --> 00:25:16,710
and obviously this isn't realistic

701
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:19,170
because there's like sixth sense like

702
00:25:16,710 --> 00:25:20,190
well okay so this ballpoint wasn't

703
00:25:19,170 --> 00:25:22,410
supposed to be up here but that's fine

704
00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:23,930
so people litter it some students

705
00:25:22,410 --> 00:25:26,910
literally think that programmers

706
00:25:23,930 --> 00:25:29,820
literally have memorized every function

707
00:25:26,910 --> 00:25:31,830
and I have seen students in classes that

708
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:33,179
I've taught her at Cote where they way

709
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:34,770
that you study in school is you take

710
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:36,030
notes on things and so I've literally

711
00:25:34,770 --> 00:25:37,889
seen students you think the way to

712
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:39,960
become a programming expert is to take a

713
00:25:37,890 --> 00:25:41,280
notepad and go through the Java

714
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:42,510
documentation of the c-sharp

715
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:44,100
documentation or whatever else and

716
00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:46,710
literally take notes on every method I

717
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:49,409
have literally seen students do this

718
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:51,780
many times and obviously that's not how

719
00:25:49,410 --> 00:25:53,640
we've learned like I took this slide

720
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:54,990
from another presentation where I was

721
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:55,980
talking directly to students but there's

722
00:25:54,990 --> 00:25:57,900
over 6,000

723
00:25:55,980 --> 00:26:00,210
is in just the Java standard library

724
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:01,549
Java being the standard APCs thing not

725
00:26:00,210 --> 00:26:04,440
that I like it

726
00:26:01,549 --> 00:26:06,179
not including third-party packages not

727
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:09,150
including other programming languages

728
00:26:06,179 --> 00:26:10,860
not including like even the methods even

729
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:13,860
if you were to just if you were only to

730
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:15,270
do the classes so just not realistic but

731
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:17,250
that is the way that a lot of students

732
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:19,679
really think is that we are programming

733
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:22,230
experts and at some point if they try

734
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:26,520
hard enough one day they too will know

735
00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:28,980
all of technology right because again

736
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:30,870
that that perception bias about things

737
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:33,299
that come easily to mind are the things

738
00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:35,280
that we're aware of so how do we you

739
00:26:33,299 --> 00:26:36,450
know oh and this is a conversation I

740
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:37,678
have by the way all the time even with

741
00:26:36,450 --> 00:26:39,240
really good programmers that are

742
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:40,830
students who haven't quite figured this

743
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:42,510
out it is like I'll say you're really

744
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:44,490
talented programmer and they'll say no

745
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:45,900
I'm really bad and I'm saying no you're

746
00:26:44,490 --> 00:26:47,640
actually really good like I've worked

747
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:49,590
with a lot of programmers I used to run

748
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:51,030
a startup like I used to hire people and

749
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:53,760
they'll say I appreciate that but I

750
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:56,220
don't know how to write an operating

751
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:58,440
system right or like I don't know how to

752
00:26:56,220 --> 00:27:00,540
use get very well which does does anyone

753
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:05,429
actually know how to use get fully with

754
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:07,500
like the entirety of like yeah yeah I

755
00:27:05,429 --> 00:27:09,090
mean I've been using it for years and

756
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:13,110
even so I still have to Google some

757
00:27:09,090 --> 00:27:14,520
weird error messages or like yeah so

758
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:16,740
like this is called the availability

759
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:19,580
heuristic is what Daniel Kahneman called

760
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:21,780
it and he and a guy named Amos Tversky

761
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:22,918
for this was their very first thing that

762
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:25,200
they discovered when they were looking

763
00:27:22,919 --> 00:27:26,400
into how people were irrational so what

764
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:28,500
are some ways that we can avoid the

765
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:29,790
availability heuristic my favorite is to

766
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:32,910
just whenever someone asked me a

767
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:35,879
question not answer their question quite

768
00:27:32,910 --> 00:27:37,320
simply if someone is not a programmer

769
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:39,120
and they're not really good one of the

770
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:40,439
best things we can possibly do is teach

771
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:42,689
them that we don't know the answers to

772
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:44,760
everything all the time and this is

773
00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:47,370
probably not true for just technology by

774
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:49,230
the way so if you have AI you know a

775
00:27:47,370 --> 00:27:50,399
child or if you're working with students

776
00:27:49,230 --> 00:27:52,260
or if you're working with people who are

777
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:54,150
new to something and you know the answer

778
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:55,710
to something this is the hardest thing

779
00:27:54,150 --> 00:27:59,610
for the mentors that we train to learn

780
00:27:55,710 --> 00:28:01,290
don't tell them the answer ask them what

781
00:27:59,610 --> 00:28:03,299
have you tried so far and what have you

782
00:28:01,290 --> 00:28:04,440
googled those are my two favorite

783
00:28:03,299 --> 00:28:05,700
questions and by the way that's another

784
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:08,730
thing I mean students feel bad about

785
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:09,809
googling things can you imagine if we

786
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:11,729
felt bad about Google

787
00:28:09,809 --> 00:28:13,519
things like how terrible we would feel

788
00:28:11,729 --> 00:28:16,499
about our lives at the end of the day

789
00:28:13,519 --> 00:28:17,849
that is how students actually feel and

790
00:28:16,499 --> 00:28:19,799
I've had to take them over to friends

791
00:28:17,849 --> 00:28:21,779
laptops you like work at Facebook and

792
00:28:19,799 --> 00:28:23,580
happen to be hanging out nearby and be

793
00:28:21,779 --> 00:28:26,969
like show me which tabs you have open

794
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:28,228
just to prove the point so that's one of

795
00:28:26,969 --> 00:28:30,059
the main ones is like just telling

796
00:28:28,229 --> 00:28:31,710
mentors to not give them the answer and

797
00:28:30,059 --> 00:28:42,809
I don't know you guys have good examples

798
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:44,309
of that okay okay cool so that's that's

799
00:28:42,809 --> 00:28:46,529
one more thing is like the availability

800
00:28:44,309 --> 00:28:48,389
heuristic is a really big thing and I

801
00:28:46,529 --> 00:28:49,950
want to stress throughout this entire

802
00:28:48,389 --> 00:28:52,289
presentation that we're talking about

803
00:28:49,950 --> 00:28:54,299
tech education and we're talking about

804
00:28:52,289 --> 00:28:55,830
how do we do this for tech education but

805
00:28:54,299 --> 00:28:57,929
this is equally applicable to anything

806
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:59,939
that we all think we can't learn right I

807
00:28:57,929 --> 00:29:01,710
mean if we if I'm really bad at foreign

808
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:03,389
languages I I've been trying for a while

809
00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:05,669
but that's partially internalized and

810
00:29:03,389 --> 00:29:07,168
I'm aware of that logically like the

811
00:29:05,669 --> 00:29:09,359
reason that I think I can't learn

812
00:29:07,169 --> 00:29:11,489
another language is because like that's

813
00:29:09,359 --> 00:29:13,379
just who I think I am and whenever I try

814
00:29:11,489 --> 00:29:14,700
immediately I get negative feedback and

815
00:29:13,379 --> 00:29:16,589
other people it seems to come so

816
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:19,019
naturally to them so like I don't do it

817
00:29:16,589 --> 00:29:20,460
right when I was in high school I used

818
00:29:19,019 --> 00:29:21,839
to think that computer programming was

819
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:23,190
the only thing I was good at and now I'm

820
00:29:21,839 --> 00:29:25,469
like really interested in baking

821
00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:27,749
implants which by the way if you ever

822
00:29:25,469 --> 00:29:29,279
tyler dot VC slash plants if you want to

823
00:29:27,749 --> 00:29:31,559
see a live stream of some succulents

824
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:32,639
growing in my closet that is not the

825
00:29:31,559 --> 00:29:35,460
sort of thing I would have done when I

826
00:29:32,639 --> 00:29:38,129
was in high school just because like

827
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:39,929
that was my perception was other people

828
00:29:38,129 --> 00:29:42,748
can do this I can't and they're so good

829
00:29:39,929 --> 00:29:44,279
at it last thing I wanted to talk about

830
00:29:42,749 --> 00:29:46,589
that we've really learned is leave

831
00:29:44,279 --> 00:29:49,349
people with fond memories because as

832
00:29:46,589 --> 00:29:51,960
Daniel Kahneman again the inventor of a

833
00:29:49,349 --> 00:29:53,609
lot of this said like the remembering

834
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:55,499
self is very different from the present

835
00:29:53,609 --> 00:29:57,210
self all of us will have a certain

836
00:29:55,499 --> 00:29:59,039
memory of tour camp when we leave and

837
00:29:57,210 --> 00:30:00,749
hopefully it will be positive but what

838
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:03,509
it turns out is it's actually very

839
00:30:00,749 --> 00:30:05,519
unrelated to our actual experience here

840
00:30:03,509 --> 00:30:07,320
and maybe some of you have experienced

841
00:30:05,519 --> 00:30:09,389
this like whenever I go on vacation with

842
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:10,439
my parents or whenever I used to go on

843
00:30:09,389 --> 00:30:13,918
vacation with my parents at least

844
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:15,539
because I don't anymore they would

845
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:16,889
always take pictures of everything in

846
00:30:15,539 --> 00:30:18,509
our entire vacation would revolve around

847
00:30:16,889 --> 00:30:19,498
taking pictures so that later on they

848
00:30:18,509 --> 00:30:21,210
could look back at the pictures and

849
00:30:19,499 --> 00:30:23,180
remember what a fun vacation we had

850
00:30:21,210 --> 00:30:25,620
taking pictures in front of things

851
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:28,050
you know I mean that's that's the way we

852
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:29,459
remember things and when it comes to

853
00:30:28,050 --> 00:30:31,649
getting new people into interested in

854
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:34,320
something the very first memory is is

855
00:30:31,650 --> 00:30:35,790
absolutely the most important and so

856
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:37,169
when we have an event like code day

857
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:39,180
which I'll show you a video of what it

858
00:30:37,170 --> 00:30:40,890
looks like later our goal is actually

859
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:42,720
not even really to teach them much about

860
00:30:40,890 --> 00:30:44,070
how programming works at all our goal is

861
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:45,570
actually just her make them feel like

862
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:47,399
they learn something about programming

863
00:30:45,570 --> 00:30:48,419
and that they did something and then

864
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:50,430
make them feel really good about

865
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:52,080
themselves and those two are not related

866
00:30:50,430 --> 00:30:53,100
at all because especially these are

867
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:54,870
twenty-four-hour they're basically

868
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:56,250
hackathons so they're gonna be really

869
00:30:54,870 --> 00:30:57,239
tired in a way and when they come out of

870
00:30:56,250 --> 00:30:59,580
it they're just gonna have like an

871
00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:01,950
emotion and a vague sense of like having

872
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:03,000
done something related to programming so

873
00:31:01,950 --> 00:31:04,290
I'll play you a video what that looks

874
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,150
like this is the video we have on the

875
00:31:04,290 --> 00:31:07,649
website I apologize it's pretty old so

876
00:31:06,150 --> 00:31:10,590
it's like not the highest quality video

877
00:31:07,650 --> 00:31:12,990
we need to redo it but this is literally

878
00:31:10,590 --> 00:31:14,189
what we saw students on even of what

879
00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:15,330
code day looks like and you'll notice by

880
00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:17,010
the way that we mentioned the word

881
00:31:15,330 --> 00:31:19,530
coding or programming maybe twice in the

882
00:31:17,010 --> 00:31:20,820
entire thing outside of our name code

883
00:31:19,530 --> 00:31:22,320
day is an event where student

884
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:24,389
programmers and artists from around the

885
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:26,580
world get together to build cool apps

886
00:31:24,390 --> 00:31:27,600
and games and have a lot of fun all in

887
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:29,730
just 24 hours

888
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:34,709
you can attend whether you're a total

889
00:31:29,730 --> 00:31:36,990
beginner or very experienced at the

890
00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:39,210
startup code day anyone with an idea for

891
00:31:36,990 --> 00:31:42,350
an app or game pitches it we then form

892
00:31:39,210 --> 00:31:42,350
teams around the coolest ones

893
00:31:43,490 --> 00:31:46,710
[Music]

894
00:31:56,999 --> 00:32:00,899
simulator and visualizer if you're a

895
00:31:59,190 --> 00:32:02,639
total beginner we have optional

896
00:32:00,899 --> 00:32:04,678
workshops at the start to get you up to

897
00:32:02,639 --> 00:32:07,439
speed or just get started working on

898
00:32:04,679 --> 00:32:09,960
your idea immediately our mentors your

899
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:11,330
team and other event attendees are happy

900
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:14,070
to help out as needed

901
00:32:11,330 --> 00:32:15,600
timely quickly at code day and as it

902
00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:17,428
gets into the evening we have lots of

903
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:19,139
fun activities plans to give you and

904
00:32:17,429 --> 00:32:21,090
your team brief breaks and working on

905
00:32:19,139 --> 00:32:29,340
your ideas so this is a no hands

906
00:32:21,090 --> 00:32:30,899
programming contest whenever I show this

907
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:33,658
video in schools in Arizona cardiac

908
00:32:30,899 --> 00:32:35,580
fighting that was a group

909
00:32:33,659 --> 00:32:39,019
rock-paper-scissor Norman and people are

910
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:39,019
getting ready to show off what they made

911
00:32:46,759 --> 00:32:51,499
all that in just one weekend we hope

912
00:32:49,549 --> 00:32:52,399
you'll join us at the next code day to

913
00:32:51,499 --> 00:32:55,699
make new friends

914
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:57,079
have fun and build something awesome yes

915
00:32:55,699 --> 00:32:59,209
I mean I think what you can really see

916
00:32:57,079 --> 00:33:02,269
from the video is that the entire focus

917
00:32:59,209 --> 00:33:03,979
of the event is really not on this is

918
00:33:02,269 --> 00:33:06,379
that was my last slide but the entire

919
00:33:03,979 --> 00:33:08,329
focus the event is not on teaching

920
00:33:06,379 --> 00:33:09,799
people how to code really it is about

921
00:33:08,329 --> 00:33:11,418
leaving them with that experience and

922
00:33:09,799 --> 00:33:12,979
making sure that they have fun and

923
00:33:11,419 --> 00:33:15,289
making sure that they have a positive

924
00:33:12,979 --> 00:33:16,609
experience afterward because what it

925
00:33:15,289 --> 00:33:19,429
comes down to is again the most

926
00:33:16,609 --> 00:33:21,218
difficult part of programming of

927
00:33:19,429 --> 00:33:24,019
teaching someone to program is often not

928
00:33:21,219 --> 00:33:25,609
especially for for this context of this

929
00:33:24,019 --> 00:33:27,379
workshop is not actually teaching them

930
00:33:25,609 --> 00:33:28,968
when someone is really interested in

931
00:33:27,379 --> 00:33:30,468
something yes maybe some people have

932
00:33:28,969 --> 00:33:32,539
more natural aptitude or less natural

933
00:33:30,469 --> 00:33:34,569
aptitude when someone is really

934
00:33:32,539 --> 00:33:36,649
interesting like interested in something

935
00:33:34,569 --> 00:33:38,509
they're generally gonna want to try to

936
00:33:36,649 --> 00:33:39,738
pursue it and a lot of the time that is

937
00:33:38,509 --> 00:33:41,149
the thing that actually makes a

938
00:33:39,739 --> 00:33:43,309
difference is like them just wanting to

939
00:33:41,149 --> 00:33:45,619
do something and so not even focusing on

940
00:33:43,309 --> 00:33:48,079
teaching them the basics of programming

941
00:33:45,619 --> 00:33:49,698
but just getting them so excited that

942
00:33:48,079 --> 00:33:51,079
they want to continue on their own and

943
00:33:49,699 --> 00:33:52,429
that they're not even gonna ask you for

944
00:33:51,079 --> 00:33:53,928
help anymore because they want to go out

945
00:33:52,429 --> 00:33:55,779
and google it and because they know

946
00:33:53,929 --> 00:33:58,669
they're real programmers Google things

947
00:33:55,779 --> 00:33:59,089
you know and and that they know where to

948
00:33:58,669 --> 00:34:00,949
start

949
00:33:59,089 --> 00:34:02,779
right from the beginning you know giving

950
00:34:00,949 --> 00:34:05,029
them that ability to do that is is what

951
00:34:02,779 --> 00:34:06,469
makes a difference and again like at the

952
00:34:05,029 --> 00:34:08,210
very end of the video you saw the like

953
00:34:06,469 --> 00:34:10,220
counter-strike mod I think it was we're

954
00:34:08,210 --> 00:34:11,480
like there was a guy jumping on like

955
00:34:10,219 --> 00:34:12,439
those people didn't really do much of

956
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:13,730
anything they just kind of played

957
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:14,750
counter-strike the entire time and then

958
00:34:13,730 --> 00:34:17,599
made something at the end and they were

959
00:34:14,750 --> 00:34:19,789
total beginners and and they also made a

960
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:21,470
bunch of blue backgrounds this is one of

961
00:34:19,789 --> 00:34:23,509
my favorite stories they made a bunch of

962
00:34:21,469 --> 00:34:25,428
blue backgrounds literally just

963
00:34:23,509 --> 00:34:28,009
backgrounds that were different shades

964
00:34:25,429 --> 00:34:29,149
of blue and they didn't they were in

965
00:34:28,009 --> 00:34:30,289
middle school I think at the time and

966
00:34:29,149 --> 00:34:31,638
they didn't really know much about it or

967
00:34:30,289 --> 00:34:33,500
anything about coding but they had a

968
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:34,970
really good experience and they did make

969
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:37,159
something coding related which was that

970
00:34:34,969 --> 00:34:39,319
mod and so the next code day that they

971
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:41,059
went to they made a website that listed

972
00:34:39,319 --> 00:34:42,859
all of their blue backgrounds and then

973
00:34:41,059 --> 00:34:45,049
the next code day that they went to they

974
00:34:42,859 --> 00:34:47,480
made a mobile app that allowed you to

975
00:34:45,049 --> 00:34:49,339
like it would automatically fetch the

976
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:50,599
latest blue backgrounds and it wouldn't

977
00:34:49,339 --> 00:34:52,549
it would allow you to select a blue

978
00:34:50,599 --> 00:34:54,799
background for their website and then

979
00:34:52,549 --> 00:34:56,690
the next code day that they went to they

980
00:34:54,799 --> 00:34:59,609
made a live social networking site where

981
00:34:56,690 --> 00:35:02,170
you can discuss blue backgrounds

982
00:34:59,609 --> 00:35:04,119
which was absolutely a running joke at

983
00:35:02,170 --> 00:35:05,529
that point but it really does kind of

984
00:35:04,119 --> 00:35:06,880
prove the point to me that like it

985
00:35:05,529 --> 00:35:08,170
really is not about when you're trying

986
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:10,269
to get people interested in things it's

987
00:35:08,170 --> 00:35:11,799
not about what they actually learn at

988
00:35:10,269 --> 00:35:13,450
that first experience it really is all

989
00:35:11,799 --> 00:35:15,880
about all those other pieces of things

990
00:35:13,450 --> 00:35:17,890
all the irrational pieces of things of

991
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:20,529
human psychology to really get them

992
00:35:17,890 --> 00:35:22,509
interested in something and I just want

993
00:35:20,529 --> 00:35:23,650
to I want to turn it over to some other

994
00:35:22,510 --> 00:35:24,880
people to just talk about anything that

995
00:35:23,650 --> 00:35:26,230
they think I like I missed and then

996
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:28,839
we're all here to answer questions for a

997
00:35:26,230 --> 00:35:30,579
little bit but I just want to add as a

998
00:35:28,839 --> 00:35:32,019
very last parting thought like how many

999
00:35:30,579 --> 00:35:33,670
people here thought that they would be

1000
00:35:32,019 --> 00:35:36,189
interested in creme brulee before seeing

1001
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:38,559
you know Osmond talked about his like

1002
00:35:36,190 --> 00:35:41,890
adventures in engineering the out

1003
00:35:38,559 --> 00:35:43,450
of creme brulee right that is exactly

1004
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:44,950
the sort of experience that we want to

1005
00:35:43,450 --> 00:35:46,180
give students as well and so when you're

1006
00:35:44,950 --> 00:35:47,859
trying and not just students I mean

1007
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:50,200
again whether it's your your

1008
00:35:47,859 --> 00:35:51,670
non-technical manager whether it's your

1009
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:53,339
family members who don't understand what

1010
00:35:51,670 --> 00:35:55,869
you do whether it's you know a

1011
00:35:53,339 --> 00:35:57,279
politician like whoever it is we need to

1012
00:35:55,869 --> 00:35:58,750
get more people interested in this and

1013
00:35:57,279 --> 00:36:00,760
the way that we do this is often not

1014
00:35:58,750 --> 00:36:02,140
through the traditional methods it's

1015
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:04,240
through understanding human psychology

1016
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:05,558
all the little flaws of it and finding

1017
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:07,930
ways around those flaws to get them

1018
00:36:05,559 --> 00:36:09,130
interested so with that do you guys have

1019
00:36:07,930 --> 00:36:11,140
anything else that you think we should

1020
00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:12,849
talk about or that I I missed and then

1021
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:15,308
also if anyone else has any questions

1022
00:36:12,849 --> 00:36:17,259
feel free to yell them out yeah so I

1023
00:36:15,309 --> 00:36:21,190
have kind of a side point just on that

1024
00:36:17,259 --> 00:36:23,079
last point Tyler made we will often have

1025
00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:24,579
students from varying sorts of

1026
00:36:23,079 --> 00:36:27,039
educational backgrounds in computer

1027
00:36:24,579 --> 00:36:28,680
science so some have taken say AP

1028
00:36:27,039 --> 00:36:31,420
Computer Science and not done anything

1029
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:33,490
apart from that so sometimes we get

1030
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:34,809
students who know you know for loops and

1031
00:36:33,490 --> 00:36:38,169
objects but they haven't really done

1032
00:36:34,809 --> 00:36:39,849
anything fun and so even though you know

1033
00:36:38,170 --> 00:36:42,220
we focused a lot on that more beginner

1034
00:36:39,849 --> 00:36:43,960
oriented stuff we're really able to

1035
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:46,089
connect with a wide range of students

1036
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:48,460
and really get them interested in it in

1037
00:36:46,089 --> 00:36:51,660
a way that they wouldn't have imagined

1038
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:58,020
before coming to a code day

1039
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:59,520
I think sort of at the end of the day or

1040
00:36:58,020 --> 00:37:01,940
a guard list of your skill level of a

1041
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:04,440
regardless of what you're pursuing the

1042
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:06,690
principle to accomplishing something

1043
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:07,530
that's difficult is motivation and drive

1044
00:37:06,690 --> 00:37:10,049
do that

1045
00:37:07,530 --> 00:37:11,819
so code day instead of following the

1046
00:37:10,049 --> 00:37:14,069
traditional school based classroom

1047
00:37:11,819 --> 00:37:16,109
setting which is clearly an effective

1048
00:37:14,069 --> 00:37:18,210
method of teaching cs4 you just slam

1049
00:37:16,109 --> 00:37:20,220
textbooks and standard libraries in

1050
00:37:18,210 --> 00:37:21,480
people's face we instead try to sort of

1051
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:23,368
build positive memories that you

1052
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:24,900
associate with coding so when you hear

1053
00:37:23,369 --> 00:37:29,039
like the word coding or Cu code you

1054
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:32,609
think oh man 12 am singing karaoke

1055
00:37:29,039 --> 00:37:35,490
drinking Mountain Dew with my friends at

1056
00:37:32,609 --> 00:37:37,348
this crazy event you don't think of just

1057
00:37:35,490 --> 00:37:38,669
like letters on your screen you think of

1058
00:37:37,349 --> 00:37:40,770
like it's some kind of positive memory

1059
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:43,349
and that drives you to do to do more and

1060
00:37:40,770 --> 00:37:45,900
instead of just teaching students there

1061
00:37:43,349 --> 00:37:47,760
are materials or resources you need for

1062
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:51,030
programming it gives you sort of like

1063
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:53,700
the drive and motivation to pursue your

1064
00:37:51,030 --> 00:37:54,960
passions to code it yeah so being in

1065
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:57,569
high school has given me kind of a

1066
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:59,010
unique perspective on the issue and I

1067
00:37:57,569 --> 00:38:01,829
think the biggest problem is just a new

1068
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:03,660
way that APCs classes are taught makes

1069
00:38:01,829 --> 00:38:06,089
it mix coding into more of a

1070
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:08,788
standardized kind of curriculum than an

1071
00:38:06,089 --> 00:38:10,380
actual fun experience so for example

1072
00:38:08,789 --> 00:38:12,779
there are big tests which forced you to

1073
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:14,940
recall like standard library methods and

1074
00:38:12,779 --> 00:38:16,890
the reason that that's so bad isn't even

1075
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:17,940
because that you memorize those they

1076
00:38:16,890 --> 00:38:20,069
have to memorize those methods but

1077
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:21,750
because students often you start to

1078
00:38:20,069 --> 00:38:24,000
think of coding as like this pedantic

1079
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:25,710
school activity that I have to just just

1080
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,569
like memorize and then after the test

1081
00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:29,579
it's over so I think that a really cool

1082
00:38:27,569 --> 00:38:31,230
thing about code day is we show them yes

1083
00:38:29,579 --> 00:38:34,170
that's one side of coding but there's

1084
00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:35,849
this also this really cool awesome fun

1085
00:38:34,170 --> 00:38:37,680
creative side where you code something

1086
00:38:35,849 --> 00:38:39,240
and you instantly see feedback and you

1087
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:41,069
can make like little shapes move and

1088
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:43,078
that's what really kind of shows

1089
00:38:41,069 --> 00:38:44,220
students that you know this is actually

1090
00:38:43,079 --> 00:38:47,510
something that I might want to pursue

1091
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:49,859
and that's ultimately our goal

1092
00:38:47,510 --> 00:38:51,990
let's see another thing I'd like to talk

1093
00:38:49,859 --> 00:38:54,390
about is kind of another side of code

1094
00:38:51,990 --> 00:38:58,950
day more for the volunteers and mentors

1095
00:38:54,390 --> 00:39:01,589
at the last one I helped facilitate in

1096
00:38:58,950 --> 00:39:02,839
Bellevue at t-mobile I went ahead and

1097
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:05,359
make

1098
00:39:02,839 --> 00:39:07,729
an app to coordinate interactions

1099
00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:09,919
between the on-premises mentors that we

1100
00:39:07,729 --> 00:39:11,629
got to come and all of the students I

1101
00:39:09,919 --> 00:39:14,209
wanted to lower the barrier as much as

1102
00:39:11,630 --> 00:39:15,739
possible for any of the participants to

1103
00:39:14,209 --> 00:39:18,408
feel comfortable reaching out to people

1104
00:39:15,739 --> 00:39:20,659
what I've seen in the past is since

1105
00:39:18,409 --> 00:39:23,299
frequently they're they're often young

1106
00:39:20,659 --> 00:39:25,189
and still building confidence in this

1107
00:39:23,299 --> 00:39:27,919
subject the odds of them reaching out to

1108
00:39:25,189 --> 00:39:30,439
somebody for a problem they have it

1109
00:39:27,919 --> 00:39:32,029
happens but if that's not maybe the

1110
00:39:30,439 --> 00:39:33,408
person that can give them the right

1111
00:39:32,029 --> 00:39:35,589
direction they're looking for the odds

1112
00:39:33,409 --> 00:39:38,059
of them doing it again is very small

1113
00:39:35,589 --> 00:39:39,979
that's her that's a really really really

1114
00:39:38,059 --> 00:39:41,599
key point to remember when I said

1115
00:39:39,979 --> 00:39:43,999
programming experts like it's really

1116
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:45,739
daunting to talk to someone who to you

1117
00:39:43,999 --> 00:39:47,988
is like an absolute expert in the field

1118
00:39:45,739 --> 00:39:49,729
and you're just this total newcomer it's

1119
00:39:47,989 --> 00:39:51,859
super daunting so yeah that's super

1120
00:39:49,729 --> 00:39:53,899
important and I've been doing this long

1121
00:39:51,859 --> 00:39:56,150
enough that I kind of came in earlier

1122
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:58,519
kind of more relating to the rest of the

1123
00:39:56,150 --> 00:40:00,229
students and now being at the other side

1124
00:39:58,519 --> 00:40:02,328
of the table

1125
00:40:00,229 --> 00:40:04,489
and seeing this other perspective and

1126
00:40:02,329 --> 00:40:06,859
having friends and peers I've made along

1127
00:40:04,489 --> 00:40:08,900
the way who I see are kind of in

1128
00:40:06,859 --> 00:40:11,359
different places and it's story I really

1129
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:14,299
like from the last code day where I had

1130
00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:15,709
this app so essentially really quick in

1131
00:40:14,299 --> 00:40:17,390
five seconds they could just see

1132
00:40:15,709 --> 00:40:19,459
everybody on there and request their

1133
00:40:17,390 --> 00:40:21,229
help that get a text messaging cop and I

1134
00:40:19,459 --> 00:40:23,569
got as many people as I possibly could

1135
00:40:21,229 --> 00:40:26,239
to register as a mentor and one of my

1136
00:40:23,569 --> 00:40:28,099
favorite bits of feedback I heard were

1137
00:40:26,239 --> 00:40:30,289
people who didn't realize how much they

1138
00:40:28,099 --> 00:40:33,529
had to teach and give back and I think

1139
00:40:30,289 --> 00:40:35,150
that that was a great opportunity out of

1140
00:40:33,529 --> 00:40:37,640
code aid for people to really get

1141
00:40:35,150 --> 00:40:43,549
familiar with networking and build that

1142
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:44,629
skill as well cool okay um so why we

1143
00:40:43,549 --> 00:40:49,279
gonna kind of wrap up because I want to

1144
00:40:44,630 --> 00:40:53,390
get to questions so I kind of have one

1145
00:40:49,279 --> 00:40:54,739
last point so just in general what I've

1146
00:40:53,390 --> 00:40:57,259
learned over the past three and a half

1147
00:40:54,739 --> 00:40:59,150
years is really if something isn't

1148
00:40:57,259 --> 00:41:01,159
working then you just have to figure out

1149
00:40:59,150 --> 00:41:04,059
how to do it better and how to do it

1150
00:41:01,159 --> 00:41:07,729
successfully so in teaching students if

1151
00:41:04,059 --> 00:41:09,619
they're disengaged then really just try

1152
00:41:07,729 --> 00:41:11,118
to change up your methods in a way that

1153
00:41:09,619 --> 00:41:12,890
you think will be more successful and

1154
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:14,599
keep doing it until you find something

1155
00:41:12,890 --> 00:41:16,279
that is successful and roll with that

1156
00:41:14,599 --> 00:41:17,780
yeah that's it's

1157
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:19,400
good point and I did want to add just as

1158
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:22,250
I forgot to put a summary slide off and

1159
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:25,790
I was gonna do that and I didn't the key

1160
00:41:22,250 --> 00:41:27,770
takeaways again are just find something

1161
00:41:25,790 --> 00:41:29,029
that is a existing interest and find a

1162
00:41:27,770 --> 00:41:31,580
way that coding relates to it and start

1163
00:41:29,030 --> 00:41:33,140
there make it really fast and easy for

1164
00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:34,670
them to build something initially so

1165
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:35,750
that they have a place to start from and

1166
00:41:34,670 --> 00:41:37,850
make sure that they have a positive

1167
00:41:35,750 --> 00:41:40,190
experience at the end and make sure that

1168
00:41:37,850 --> 00:41:41,569
you don't come across as a super-intense

1169
00:41:40,190 --> 00:41:43,970
expert that knows everything and that

1170
00:41:41,570 --> 00:41:46,820
they could never possibly approach so

1171
00:41:43,970 --> 00:41:52,490
without any questions for for us that we

1172
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:53,690
can answer yeah oh yeah so tickets are

1173
00:41:52,490 --> 00:41:55,009
ten dollars that's actually saying I

1174
00:41:53,690 --> 00:41:56,750
didn't talk about in this presentation

1175
00:41:55,010 --> 00:41:59,180
that's interesting tickets are ten

1176
00:41:56,750 --> 00:42:01,310
dollars almost everyone gets a promo

1177
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:03,290
code and it depends from city to city

1178
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:05,270
what almost everyone means but like in

1179
00:42:03,290 --> 00:42:07,220
Arizona for example will have 400 people

1180
00:42:05,270 --> 00:42:11,450
at an event and like 13 of them will

1181
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:12,770
have paid so but that's actually one

1182
00:42:11,450 --> 00:42:14,450
interesting thing when we used to run

1183
00:42:12,770 --> 00:42:16,670
completely free events one of the things

1184
00:42:14,450 --> 00:42:17,960
that we found was that obviously a lot

1185
00:42:16,670 --> 00:42:20,030
of people are not gonna show up but

1186
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:22,970
guess who if you actually broke it down

1187
00:42:20,030 --> 00:42:24,530
by experience level more of the advanced

1188
00:42:22,970 --> 00:42:26,450
people showed up an almost no total

1189
00:42:24,530 --> 00:42:28,340
beginner showed up and my theory at

1190
00:42:26,450 --> 00:42:29,569
least as to why that is is like they

1191
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:30,650
were just psyching themselves out on the

1192
00:42:29,570 --> 00:42:32,420
morning of and there was no reason for

1193
00:42:30,650 --> 00:42:34,190
them to be there so even if they get a

1194
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:36,560
free ticket the fact that they felt like

1195
00:42:34,190 --> 00:42:37,850
they paid for it by means of asking for

1196
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:40,090
the free ticket or the fact that they

1197
00:42:37,850 --> 00:42:41,779
felt like it had a $10 value

1198
00:42:40,090 --> 00:42:44,090
dramatically increase the number of

1199
00:42:41,780 --> 00:42:45,380
people who come and so when I add an

1200
00:42:44,090 --> 00:42:47,450
event ender like a really high income

1201
00:42:45,380 --> 00:42:48,740
area where we don't give out very many

1202
00:42:47,450 --> 00:42:49,700
promo codes because it's just not an

1203
00:42:48,740 --> 00:42:51,529
issue

1204
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:53,960
we usually have 90 percent of people

1205
00:42:51,530 --> 00:42:55,280
show up at an event that we give out

1206
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:57,950
tons of promo codes it'll still be like

1207
00:42:55,280 --> 00:43:00,800
70 percent at an event where we marketed

1208
00:42:57,950 --> 00:43:03,109
it as free again even in an event where

1209
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:04,910
it was effectively free versus an event

1210
00:43:03,110 --> 00:43:06,380
where we marketed as free marketed as

1211
00:43:04,910 --> 00:43:11,509
freak was like 40 percent and almost

1212
00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:13,880
none of them were beginners yep yeah

1213
00:43:11,510 --> 00:43:16,820
absolutely so across the u.s. it varies

1214
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:18,530
from city to city in general 68 or 69

1215
00:43:16,820 --> 00:43:21,200
percent of participants are from an

1216
00:43:18,530 --> 00:43:23,750
underrepresented group I think it's 40

1217
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:25,669
underrepresented in computer science so

1218
00:43:23,750 --> 00:43:28,910
I think it's about 41 percent people who

1219
00:43:25,670 --> 00:43:30,080
identify as women 38 percent low-income

1220
00:43:28,910 --> 00:43:33,160
students

1221
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:41,120
and 28 or 29 percent african-american or

1222
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:42,440
Latino uh yet so it probably does I

1223
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:43,670
mostly whenever I'm talking about the

1224
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:45,470
statistics I'm mostly talking about

1225
00:43:43,670 --> 00:43:46,670
beginners I could actually look into

1226
00:43:45,470 --> 00:43:48,649
that if you're interested in the answer

1227
00:43:46,670 --> 00:43:50,270
and I put it up as like a blog post or

1228
00:43:48,650 --> 00:43:52,370
something more details in the statistics

1229
00:43:50,270 --> 00:43:53,590
in general people usually don't come to

1230
00:43:52,370 --> 00:43:55,790
code day more than two or three times

1231
00:43:53,590 --> 00:43:57,560
and I think a lot of that is it is

1232
00:43:55,790 --> 00:43:59,990
really focused on beginners and people

1233
00:43:57,560 --> 00:44:02,750
start to cycle out really quickly like

1234
00:43:59,990 --> 00:44:04,310
they start to get good at it and I think

1235
00:44:02,750 --> 00:44:05,780
that there are tons of events that are

1236
00:44:04,310 --> 00:44:07,279
great out there for people who are

1237
00:44:05,780 --> 00:44:08,810
really experienced coders I think we

1238
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:10,760
could do a little bit better of a job of

1239
00:44:08,810 --> 00:44:12,560
marketing of like providing for them at

1240
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:14,540
our events as well but like it's not our

1241
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:16,160
primary core focus and so like we

1242
00:44:14,540 --> 00:44:17,690
usually don't focus as much on people

1243
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:19,279
who are returning I will say the other

1244
00:44:17,690 --> 00:44:20,540
the key metric that we actually measure

1245
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:22,310
in terms of success though is the

1246
00:44:20,540 --> 00:44:24,050
percentage of people who are the the

1247
00:44:22,310 --> 00:44:26,060
number of people who are beginners who

1248
00:44:24,050 --> 00:44:27,560
say that they continued coding when we

1249
00:44:26,060 --> 00:44:29,870
asked them again two and a half or three

1250
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:31,340
months later so we do actually have

1251
00:44:29,870 --> 00:44:32,990
about seventy percent of people who

1252
00:44:31,340 --> 00:44:35,690
started out without an intent to pursue

1253
00:44:32,990 --> 00:44:37,939
computer science are still working on a

1254
00:44:35,690 --> 00:44:39,380
project outside of school work two and a

1255
00:44:37,940 --> 00:44:40,250
half or three months later but doesn't

1256
00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:41,750
mean that they'll pursue it

1257
00:44:40,250 --> 00:44:42,950
professionally or anything like that but

1258
00:44:41,750 --> 00:44:45,500
it does mean like they are still at

1259
00:44:42,950 --> 00:44:47,990
least taking it seriously by and large

1260
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:50,060
and some of those demographic numbers

1261
00:44:47,990 --> 00:44:53,419
can also vary city by city so I know

1262
00:44:50,060 --> 00:44:57,290
like my event in Boca Raton ended up

1263
00:44:53,420 --> 00:45:00,410
being like eighty percent men one time

1264
00:44:57,290 --> 00:45:02,779
and you know three times in a row after

1265
00:45:00,410 --> 00:45:04,490
that was like sixty percent women yeah

1266
00:45:02,780 --> 00:45:06,050
so it really it really does depend as

1267
00:45:04,490 --> 00:45:08,680
well same with low-income or other

1268
00:45:06,050 --> 00:45:08,680
chemicals

1269
00:45:10,850 --> 00:45:13,850
mostly high school we've been trying to

1270
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:15,740
work with middle school a little bit

1271
00:45:13,850 --> 00:45:17,180
more middle school students are

1272
00:45:15,740 --> 00:45:19,520
interesting they're often a lot more

1273
00:45:17,180 --> 00:45:21,319
excitable but they which is a good thing

1274
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:23,300
but they're often a lot more excitable

1275
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:24,620
which is a bad thing at ten a at 12

1276
00:45:23,300 --> 00:45:25,940
midnight when everyone else wants to

1277
00:45:24,620 --> 00:45:27,230
kind of like just chill out and like

1278
00:45:25,940 --> 00:45:28,970
either work on their project or sleep

1279
00:45:27,230 --> 00:45:30,680
and the middle school students start at

1280
00:45:28,970 --> 00:45:32,120
one point we had these weird inflatable

1281
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:33,620
hammers of swag and like the middle

1282
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:34,670
school students were literally one of

1283
00:45:33,620 --> 00:45:36,470
the middle school students was literally

1284
00:45:34,670 --> 00:45:40,280
running up to a wall and hitting it with

1285
00:45:36,470 --> 00:45:41,089
a hammer for like over 20 minutes so

1286
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:42,230
that's actually been something we've

1287
00:45:41,090 --> 00:45:43,610
been kind of trying to figure out where

1288
00:45:42,230 --> 00:45:44,840
the balance is there we've mostly worked

1289
00:45:43,610 --> 00:45:45,920
with high school students middle school

1290
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:47,240
students it's usually a little bit

1291
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:49,220
easier because they don't have as many

1292
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:51,229
preconceptions so it's a little bit

1293
00:45:49,220 --> 00:45:52,549
easier to kind of change their mind high

1294
00:45:51,230 --> 00:45:54,110
school students a little bit harder but

1295
00:45:52,550 --> 00:45:55,310
you know that's kind of that's where we

1296
00:45:54,110 --> 00:45:56,690
started out and we're kind of working

1297
00:45:55,310 --> 00:46:04,400
the other way might have been better to

1298
00:45:56,690 --> 00:46:05,960
start with middle school students entry

1299
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:07,400
school-aged kids it's still very much

1300
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:09,200
the same if they have an existing

1301
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:10,520
interest like this is what we found but

1302
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:13,100
we do have some elementary school aged

1303
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:15,920
students who come if they have an

1304
00:46:13,100 --> 00:46:17,779
existing interest in something trying to

1305
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:19,220
get them interested through that through

1306
00:46:17,780 --> 00:46:21,050
the lens of that existing interest as

1307
00:46:19,220 --> 00:46:23,509
much as possible even if it's just a TV

1308
00:46:21,050 --> 00:46:25,820
show they like showing them how to make

1309
00:46:23,510 --> 00:46:27,110
a video game based on that TV show a big

1310
00:46:25,820 --> 00:46:28,790
one that I see is well for younger

1311
00:46:27,110 --> 00:46:30,620
students is they seem to be into games

1312
00:46:28,790 --> 00:46:32,870
like minecraft or roblox or things like

1313
00:46:30,620 --> 00:46:35,180
that all of those have modding kits and

1314
00:46:32,870 --> 00:46:38,440
I've actually seen 10 year olds who

1315
00:46:35,180 --> 00:46:40,339
don't know much at all about programming

1316
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:42,110
coming into it like they really don't

1317
00:46:40,340 --> 00:46:44,450
have any experience who just through

1318
00:46:42,110 --> 00:46:46,190
sheer force of will managed to learn Lua

1319
00:46:44,450 --> 00:46:48,350
which i think is what roblox uses as

1320
00:46:46,190 --> 00:46:50,990
their modding engine not very not very

1321
00:46:48,350 --> 00:46:52,940
well and it was not very much

1322
00:46:50,990 --> 00:46:54,229
but the fact that they loved roblox so

1323
00:46:52,940 --> 00:46:56,300
much which I probably have never played

1324
00:46:54,230 --> 00:46:59,540
roblox is really weird to watch whatever

1325
00:46:56,300 --> 00:47:00,680
was going on on the screen through sheer

1326
00:46:59,540 --> 00:47:02,420
force of will if they really like

1327
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:04,609
something especially the younger

1328
00:47:02,420 --> 00:47:06,170
students seem a lot more driven even to

1329
00:47:04,610 --> 00:47:07,460
you know they take less coaxing as long

1330
00:47:06,170 --> 00:47:09,290
as you find the thing that they want to

1331
00:47:07,460 --> 00:47:10,820
do the other thing with younger students

1332
00:47:09,290 --> 00:47:12,980
is they spend more time slacking off you

1333
00:47:10,820 --> 00:47:14,600
kind of have to be okay with that

1334
00:47:12,980 --> 00:47:15,920
the nice thing about an event like code

1335
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:17,120
day is we kind of have this arbitrary

1336
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:18,140
deadline of like you're gonna present

1337
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:20,359
something tomorrow

1338
00:47:18,140 --> 00:47:21,950
like everyone presents and as part of it

1339
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:23,900
it's like everyone presents almost no

1340
00:47:21,950 --> 00:47:24,230
one goes home and if you're there we're

1341
00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:25,520
gonna

1342
00:47:24,230 --> 00:47:28,190
perjury to present and you're gonna find

1343
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:30,859
something to present another thing is

1344
00:47:28,190 --> 00:47:33,109
that for middle schoolers especially one

1345
00:47:30,859 --> 00:47:36,380
thing that I found that works well at my

1346
00:47:33,109 --> 00:47:38,359
event and some other ones is that we so

1347
00:47:36,380 --> 00:47:39,260
we run code day simultaneously

1348
00:47:38,359 --> 00:47:42,170
throughout the country

1349
00:47:39,260 --> 00:47:44,619
so we'll have like 20 30 cities all

1350
00:47:42,170 --> 00:47:48,350
having a code day at the same time and

1351
00:47:44,619 --> 00:47:50,750
sometimes some sort of meme like things

1352
00:47:48,350 --> 00:47:52,790
will pop up within that culture and so

1353
00:47:50,750 --> 00:47:54,890
for example we had a Twitter war between

1354
00:47:52,790 --> 00:47:56,750
Boca Raton and Chicago awhile back and

1355
00:47:54,890 --> 00:47:58,368
that really engaged a lot of the middle

1356
00:47:56,750 --> 00:48:00,890
schoolers who really enjoyed that sort

1357
00:47:58,369 --> 00:48:03,080
of competition aspect of just spamming

1358
00:48:00,890 --> 00:48:06,020
Twitter with memes yeah we actually we

1359
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:09,080
teach and we have a cybersecurity like

1360
00:48:06,020 --> 00:48:11,180
CTF and it has questions everything from

1361
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:14,270
like really complex questions that

1362
00:48:11,180 --> 00:48:15,950
people have not ever gotten to fish this

1363
00:48:14,270 --> 00:48:17,450
person like here's a link if they click

1364
00:48:15,950 --> 00:48:20,779
the link it will it will send you the

1365
00:48:17,450 --> 00:48:22,819
flag over your email to like take a

1366
00:48:20,780 --> 00:48:24,260
picture of you of like draw a picture of

1367
00:48:22,820 --> 00:48:26,000
the person organizing your event in

1368
00:48:24,260 --> 00:48:27,619
Microsoft Paint

1369
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,850
and that's one of those things as well

1370
00:48:27,619 --> 00:48:30,109
that really kind of draws the students

1371
00:48:28,850 --> 00:48:31,759
in because they feel like they can they

1372
00:48:30,109 --> 00:48:33,140
can collaborate and that that's like

1373
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:36,140
another super popular one and it

1374
00:48:33,140 --> 00:48:37,730
actually has that was sort of presented

1375
00:48:36,140 --> 00:48:38,750
through one of our sponsors who wanted

1376
00:48:37,730 --> 00:48:39,520
to get more people interested in

1377
00:48:38,750 --> 00:48:43,220
cybersecurity

1378
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:44,030
Splunk and they it actually has

1379
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:45,500
increased the number of people

1380
00:48:44,030 --> 00:48:46,910
dramatically that I've talked to her

1381
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:48,440
interested in cybersecurity as well in

1382
00:48:46,910 --> 00:48:55,700
saying some of the surveys we've sent

1383
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:57,890
out yeah where do you live Bremerton um

1384
00:48:55,700 --> 00:48:59,509
talk to us basically like send me an

1385
00:48:57,890 --> 00:49:00,890
email I'm the executive director so I

1386
00:48:59,510 --> 00:49:03,350
run code Dave sort of all across the

1387
00:49:00,890 --> 00:49:04,790
u.s. send me an email there's a link on

1388
00:49:03,350 --> 00:49:07,250
our website or my email address is right

1389
00:49:04,790 --> 00:49:09,109
up there again we run them all across

1390
00:49:07,250 --> 00:49:10,460
the US on the same day and so the next

1391
00:49:09,109 --> 00:49:11,630
one is actually not until November

1392
00:49:10,460 --> 00:49:13,820
because schools aren't in session over

1393
00:49:11,630 --> 00:49:16,040
the summer and so November I think 10

1394
00:49:13,820 --> 00:49:18,200
311 is the next one we do them three

1395
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:19,550
times a year seasonally we you try to do

1396
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:23,649
them more frequently once and it was

1397
00:49:19,550 --> 00:49:23,650
like way too intense does the Portland

1398
00:49:23,740 --> 00:49:27,529
Portland has not for a while because we

1399
00:49:26,060 --> 00:49:28,820
don't have any volunteers from Portland

1400
00:49:27,530 --> 00:49:29,869
anymore so if anyone's interested in

1401
00:49:28,820 --> 00:49:31,160
volunteering for Portland that's

1402
00:49:29,869 --> 00:49:32,630
actually one I'd like to get started

1403
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:34,480
again it hasn't for I think about a year

1404
00:49:32,630 --> 00:49:38,920
and a half

1405
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:40,470
any other questions cool thank you all

1406
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:47,950
