1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:07,290
so how many of you have had a creme

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:11,099
brulee here at camp uh-huh

3
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:15,059
see that's the problem we in the past

4
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:16,079
have had some graciously made creme

5
00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:19,799
brulees but the problem has been

6
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:21,778
throughput so we I think are attempting

7
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:23,580
to remedy that and we've got Taylor and

8
00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:25,140
Jacob up here about to talk about let

9
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:34,290
them eat creme brulee so please welcome

10
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:35,940
welcome them to the camp stage thank you

11
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:39,570
thank you

12
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:42,300
so geo mentioned I'm Taylor this is

13
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:46,370
Jacob we're we work for great Scot

14
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:54,809
gadgets and we are going to attempt to

15
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:57,899
make our slides work we're gonna attempt

16
00:00:54,809 --> 00:01:01,800
to make 700 creme brulees here this week

17
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:08,520
and weekend and make sure that everybody

18
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:10,798
gets one so this this attempt would not

19
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:12,899
be possible without some great people I

20
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:15,900
want to thank the whole grades got

21
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:20,729
gadgets crew Mike and Dominic Elizabeth

22
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:23,040
Lisa Steve Matt they've helped us

23
00:01:20,729 --> 00:01:25,670
through all of this getting everything

24
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:28,380
built designed and getting up here today

25
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:31,740
also Kate Tim Ken helps write some great

26
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:34,110
great FET code cos and Rebecca helped

27
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:37,289
get some stuff here which makes it very

28
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:39,960
possible for us to do this and all of

29
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:44,369
tor camp for giving us this opportunity

30
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:48,960
and helping us helping us achieve it

31
00:01:44,369 --> 00:01:51,899
hopefully so I'm sure most of you know

32
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:55,289
what creme brulee is it's a but if you

33
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:59,520
don't it's a custard with a caramelized

34
00:01:55,290 --> 00:02:03,899
sugar on the surface of it lovely

35
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:06,149
dessert the origins of creme brulee are

36
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:08,128
claimed by quite a few different

37
00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:10,318
countries the French the Spanish in

38
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:12,790
English or the Catalans in the English

39
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:15,099
all claim

40
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:17,730
have created creme brulee they all call

41
00:02:15,099 --> 00:02:21,849
it various things but the very first

42
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:24,369
recipe appears in a cookbook in 1691 and

43
00:02:21,849 --> 00:02:28,179
then it kind of disappears it's around

44
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:37,540
for a little while there are a few

45
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:39,879
exceptions the the Trinity College which

46
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:41,950
is part of Cambridge University has been

47
00:02:39,879 --> 00:02:44,950
serving it continuously to students

48
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:46,988
since the late 1800s and one of the cool

49
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:49,268
things that they did was they took an

50
00:02:46,989 --> 00:02:51,189
iron brand and actually branded their

51
00:02:49,269 --> 00:02:55,000
insignia into the into the caramelized

52
00:02:51,189 --> 00:02:57,220
sugar which we've tried to imitate in

53
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:01,120
different ways but uh with various

54
00:02:57,220 --> 00:03:03,879
various success and then it just

55
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:08,079
disappears again until the the opulent

56
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:09,608
80s all the sudden you know kind of I've

57
00:03:08,079 --> 00:03:11,319
made creme brulee in many different ways

58
00:03:09,609 --> 00:03:12,519
in many different times and you just

59
00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:15,159
kind of thought it was a dessert that's

60
00:03:12,519 --> 00:03:17,650
been around it it just disappeared and

61
00:03:15,159 --> 00:03:20,349
in the 80s somewhere it pops up and it

62
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:21,879
caught fire and it spread everywhere and

63
00:03:20,349 --> 00:03:23,500
now it's in restaurants it's in grocery

64
00:03:21,879 --> 00:03:26,620
stores it's you know people make it at

65
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:29,889
home the the biggest advance has been in

66
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:31,870
flavors the original recipe was just a

67
00:03:29,889 --> 00:03:35,109
plain custard but vanilla quickly became

68
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:37,060
the main rest the main flavor added you

69
00:03:35,109 --> 00:03:39,659
got other flavors that people add

70
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:43,720
strawberry apricot espresso chocolate

71
00:03:39,659 --> 00:03:46,649
matcha green tea pumpkin pumpkin spice

72
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:50,228
latte no we won't do that

73
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:52,930
and then we've decided to do this in a

74
00:03:50,229 --> 00:03:55,419
sous-vide process the sous-vide process

75
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:56,979
is sous-vide the stands for under vacuum

76
00:03:55,419 --> 00:03:59,229
and it's a method of cooking that

77
00:03:56,979 --> 00:04:02,470
involves sealing food usually involves

78
00:03:59,229 --> 00:04:05,260
sealing food in vacuum sealed bags and

79
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:08,109
then cooking it under water and in a

80
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:10,030
very temperature controlled water the

81
00:04:08,109 --> 00:04:13,259
invention of sous-vide was has been

82
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:18,130
claimed by three different people the

83
00:04:13,259 --> 00:04:21,459
earliest the earliest claim is in the in

84
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:22,290
the late 60s by Colonel MacGuffin he was

85
00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:24,900
in

86
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:28,380
he he was a retired colonel he got hired

87
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:31,409
by the by a hospital in South Carolina

88
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:33,570
to improve the quality of food in the

89
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:36,240
hospital and hopefully to sell that to

90
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:38,460
other institutions and then he he

91
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:42,330
actually started vacuum-sealing food

92
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:44,849
cooking in under water and it sealed it

93
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:47,039
it made it everything tastes better from

94
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:51,600
that institutional standpoint it also

95
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:53,280
made it last a lot longer without

96
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,230
without additives without putting

97
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,659
chemical preservatives in it which

98
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:59,430
obviously helped out in institutions and

99
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:01,260
then there were two Frenchmen that also

100
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:03,060
claimed to have created the method and

101
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:04,230
they eventually began working together

102
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:10,680
and that's where we get the name

103
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:15,270
sous-vide and then a brief history of

104
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:16,800
creme brulee at torque and it all

105
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:18,930
started eight or nine years ago at

106
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,610
torque on there was a group of people

107
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:23,310
that wanted to go out at eat in a

108
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:26,730
restaurant and a young or younger Mike

109
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:28,800
Osmond decided to tag along they all

110
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:30,870
jumped in a van and headed many miles

111
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:33,330
north of San Diego to a restaurant that

112
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:35,970
claimed to have the best creme brulee on

113
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:38,640
the planet they they went through the

114
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:41,130
meal they got creme brulee and shortly

115
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:43,950
afterwards that that same Mike Osmond

116
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:46,380
popped up and and proclaimed that was

117
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:53,969
good but I make the best creme brulee on

118
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:56,250
the planet shortly after that the

119
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:58,710
concept of creme brulee con was formed

120
00:05:56,250 --> 00:06:03,180
and after the prerequisite con hangover

121
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:06,299
it was abandoned a few years later at a

122
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:08,970
tour camp 2014 Mike's infamous claim was

123
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:11,490
called some ingredients were procured

124
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:15,060
and a small batch was made the creme

125
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:17,250
part went well the brulee part not as

126
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:19,850
well he tried to brulee it with a hot

127
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:19,850
every workstation

128
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:27,520
fast forward again to 2060 tour camp

129
00:06:24,379 --> 00:06:32,210
2016 and there was a better attempt made

130
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:34,128
about 10 to 20 were made and and there

131
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:37,669
was a torch available this time which

132
00:06:34,129 --> 00:06:40,340
which helped things out but promises

133
00:06:37,669 --> 00:06:42,789
were made and and not kept and people

134
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:42,789
were Sean

135
00:06:44,469 --> 00:06:49,219
the shunning of people led to a an

136
00:06:47,539 --> 00:06:55,699
elitist hierarchy around creme brulee

137
00:06:49,219 --> 00:06:58,129
and leavis hierarchies are made to be

138
00:06:55,699 --> 00:07:01,550
toppled ladies and gentlemen we stand

139
00:06:58,129 --> 00:07:03,169
before you today to proclaim no more no

140
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:10,219
more shall creme brulee a be used as a

141
00:07:03,169 --> 00:07:12,258
status symbol the lucky few who want to

142
00:07:10,219 --> 00:07:18,979
return to a feudal custard-based

143
00:07:12,259 --> 00:07:20,509
feudalism this will not happen that is

144
00:07:18,979 --> 00:07:22,340
why we've created creme brulee camp

145
00:07:20,509 --> 00:07:26,110
where custard flows like wine and

146
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:26,109
everyone shall get their just desserts

147
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:36,469
so yeah there's probably an easier way

148
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:41,840
to do this but so fun in that Dominic's

149
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:44,840
bill 2018 so the problem is how do we

150
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:48,020
make roughly 700 jars of creme brulee

151
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:50,119
while we're at camp the custard needs to

152
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:53,210
be cooked pretty slowly and at a very

153
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:55,460
even temperature for this reason when

154
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:58,039
custard is cooked in an oven it's in a

155
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:59,930
water bath Mike and geo found a creme

156
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:03,590
brulee method for a counter top sous

157
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:06,080
vide cooker on this website information

158
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:09,890
was given about using jars in a canning

159
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:11,870
method as opposed to vacuum sealing bags

160
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:14,599
which would work out a lot better when

161
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:18,950
you go to brulee the sugar on top of the

162
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:20,990
jars they they tried it out is pretty

163
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:24,320
good is very good it was also pretty

164
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:25,670
easy and it only took a little bit of

165
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:30,140
discussion to realize that it would also

166
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:32,000
scale well the recipe was simple the it

167
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:34,100
was scalable and creme brulee aspecting

168
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:38,390
jars were fully submerged so you can

169
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:41,930
utilize the entire expansive space

170
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:47,030
inside of your luggage so obviously we

171
00:08:41,929 --> 00:08:49,459
need to make our own version of this how

172
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:50,900
do we get to that the first step in

173
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:53,690
designing a system is you kind of need

174
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:55,189
to know what you're designing for once

175
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:59,300
we realized that we were gonna be making

176
00:08:55,190 --> 00:09:02,570
well over 500 servings we kind of had to

177
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:06,680
start figuring out how to make large

178
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:08,030
batches what we also needed to figure

179
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:10,550
out what the size of those servings

180
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:12,260
would be we ended up we started looking

181
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:15,050
for available jar sizes we ended up

182
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:17,990
going with a 4 ounce jar size which was

183
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:20,270
one on the last slide figured that was a

184
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:23,150
good it wasn't you know a single bite

185
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:25,880
but it was good enough that everybody

186
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:27,380
get a good taste and wouldn't be wasting

187
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:31,189
too much we could make a lot in one

188
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:34,460
batch then then we had to figure out how

189
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:37,960
we're gonna heat the water they make can

190
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:40,340
they make countertop sous vide stations

191
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:42,110
but they're not very large

192
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:43,410
they make sous vide sticks but they're

193
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:45,359
kind of overly pricey

194
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:48,419
and there are industrial sous-vide

195
00:09:45,359 --> 00:09:51,599
cookers but they're large and pricey and

196
00:09:48,419 --> 00:09:54,660
hard to get to tour camp so we're gonna

197
00:09:51,599 --> 00:10:00,869
go ahead and make our own so what do we

198
00:09:54,660 --> 00:10:02,249
do we heat the water we we we decided we

199
00:10:00,869 --> 00:10:08,669
didn't have to reinvent the wheel but

200
00:10:02,249 --> 00:10:11,729
we're going to reinvent the wheel so we

201
00:10:08,669 --> 00:10:13,228
also needed to know the recipe the

202
00:10:11,729 --> 00:10:16,979
recipe uses four simple ingredients

203
00:10:13,229 --> 00:10:19,289
cream sugar egg yolks and vanilla that's

204
00:10:16,979 --> 00:10:20,939
pretty easy but all the creme brulee

205
00:10:19,289 --> 00:10:23,339
that I've ever made in the past you have

206
00:10:20,939 --> 00:10:25,139
to take all the egg yolks you temper

207
00:10:23,339 --> 00:10:27,179
them you or sorry you cream them first

208
00:10:25,139 --> 00:10:29,309
so you whip a bunch of sugar into them

209
00:10:27,179 --> 00:10:32,459
get some air into them it's

210
00:10:29,309 --> 00:10:34,769
time-consuming it's arm consuming it's

211
00:10:32,459 --> 00:10:37,409
kind of a pain then you have to temper

212
00:10:34,769 --> 00:10:40,289
cream into a hot boiling cream into it

213
00:10:37,409 --> 00:10:42,809
without cooking the eggs again very time

214
00:10:40,289 --> 00:10:45,209
consuming what the recipe that they

215
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:47,219
found online didn't call for creaming

216
00:10:45,209 --> 00:10:49,978
the eggs didn't call for tempering it

217
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:52,889
called for just nice slow mixing of

218
00:10:49,979 --> 00:10:55,470
these ingredients and the test cooks

219
00:10:52,889 --> 00:10:57,119
were great so all right perfect we've

220
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:59,629
got an easy recipe that's not as time

221
00:10:57,119 --> 00:10:59,629
consuming

222
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:12,089
so yeah it turns out a jacking it a

223
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:13,980
whisk into the end of a drill and going

224
00:11:12,089 --> 00:11:17,670
to town on the custard isn't a good way

225
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:19,980
to make it you uh

226
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:24,118
you end up with a few more air bubbles

227
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:26,550
than you would like so uh you just mix

228
00:11:24,119 --> 00:11:29,600
it by hand so now that we've got the

229
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:31,949
custard how do we get it into the jars

230
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:36,899
we looked at a bunch of different fill

231
00:11:31,949 --> 00:11:40,979
methods we looked at mechanizing a pour

232
00:11:36,899 --> 00:11:43,259
spout with a servo and then taking that

233
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:44,339
mechanized pour spout and using

234
00:11:43,259 --> 00:11:49,110
different things like an ultrasonic

235
00:11:44,339 --> 00:11:50,249
sensor to get fill level all right shuts

236
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:53,220
down the servo when it gets to a certain

237
00:11:50,249 --> 00:11:55,139
height or we weigh out what we want we

238
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:57,240
put limit switches on a balance or on a

239
00:11:55,139 --> 00:12:00,209
scale it shuts down when it hits the

240
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:02,339
weight we even looked at shooting optic

241
00:12:00,209 --> 00:12:04,859
or shooting light to an optical sensor

242
00:12:02,339 --> 00:12:08,519
through the jar and when that hits level

243
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:09,929
it shuts off we looked at a lot of these

244
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:13,529
things we played around with some stuff

245
00:12:09,929 --> 00:12:16,709
and you know it really it turns out that

246
00:12:13,529 --> 00:12:21,290
the best way for us to get custard into

247
00:12:16,709 --> 00:12:21,290
a jar is to give an intern a pitcher

248
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:33,170
so the first iteration that we came up

249
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:35,030
with involves a series of buckets we

250
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:37,630
found some bucket heaters online they

251
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:41,060
were cheap they they worked really well

252
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:43,760
so we decided all right let's heat up

253
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:45,560
water in one bucket will pump it to

254
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:47,180
another bucket when it's time or will

255
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:49,339
circulate it between buckets so we have

256
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:51,739
the correct volume of water when it's

257
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:53,960
time when it's up to temperature we'll

258
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:55,910
introduce a third bucket circulate the

259
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:58,670
water into that that won't drop the

260
00:12:55,910 --> 00:13:01,640
temperature too much and and we can do

261
00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:04,849
the cook just in a bucket the problem

262
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:06,590
was buckets lose heat like crazy and we

263
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:06,950
could only do about thirty five at a

264
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:09,590
time

265
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:11,420
we did look at doing multiple buckets

266
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:14,090
you could scale the amount of buckets

267
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:16,069
but we were still losing heat very

268
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:21,140
quickly and it was hard to keep it even

269
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:24,800
up at temperature yeah after that it was

270
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:28,760
time for a better option than buckets we

271
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:30,770
came up with coolers yeah so we got a

272
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:33,620
cooler will heavily modify a cooler and

273
00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:36,079
we should say that there are cooler this

274
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:37,670
isn't necessarily our initial idea we

275
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:40,160
redesigned the way we wanted to do it

276
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:42,219
but we there's definitely been people

277
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:44,600
that have made sous-vide sous-vide

278
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:47,230
systems and coolers before there's a

279
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:50,260
there's a hackaday page about it and

280
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:53,810
they're good systems but we wanted to

281
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:58,280
spin our own and so we started modifying

282
00:13:53,810 --> 00:13:59,959
a cooler the bucket heaters worked great

283
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:01,339
even though the buckets didn't so we

284
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:04,400
wanted to continue with the bucket

285
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:06,470
heaters they obviously didn't fit into

286
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:08,569
the cooler so we had to modify one side

287
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:09,830
and we quickly realized as we were

288
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:12,260
trying to check temperature and things

289
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:15,230
as we opened ok well now we've got to

290
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:19,460
cut the cooler lid in half or in pieces

291
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:21,680
and now we've got a good setup all right

292
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:21,860
so the bucket heaters stay we can get to

293
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:27,260
it

294
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:29,150
we can get access in and initially we

295
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:32,480
tried heating the water we tried

296
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:34,000
checking temperature and it we quickly

297
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:36,689
realized that if

298
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:39,399
weren't circulating the water the water

299
00:14:36,689 --> 00:14:41,410
was definitely much hotter on one side

300
00:14:39,399 --> 00:14:43,810
than it was on the other and it didn't

301
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:45,459
make sense to move bucket heaters let's

302
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:46,810
move water so we started introducing

303
00:14:45,459 --> 00:14:50,800
some of the pumps that we had used

304
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:55,268
before that worked great all right so

305
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:59,019
we've got a good cooler going now how do

306
00:14:55,269 --> 00:15:04,089
we get the jars of custard in and out of

307
00:14:59,019 --> 00:15:05,949
the cooler you know we looked at okay we

308
00:15:04,089 --> 00:15:08,079
could just cycle the water in and out of

309
00:15:05,949 --> 00:15:09,699
the cooler that didn't make sense then

310
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:12,599
we'd have to modify multiple coolers we

311
00:15:09,699 --> 00:15:14,800
couldn't scale it as easily

312
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:16,060
we tried sticking our hands in the hot

313
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:18,128
well we tried sticking the interns hands

314
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:25,719
in hot water that didn't work well

315
00:15:18,129 --> 00:15:27,129
either need a new intern anybody so then

316
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:30,699
we came up with a kind of concept that

317
00:15:27,129 --> 00:15:33,569
if we use the basket if we use the

318
00:15:30,699 --> 00:15:37,269
basket it would make it easy enough to

319
00:15:33,569 --> 00:15:38,620
drop a bunch of custard in at once take

320
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:43,839
it out bring it to a different place to

321
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:45,759
cool we could also vary the size if we

322
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:49,449
say we make a hundred we make we make a

323
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:50,800
full cooler worth first but then we've

324
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:51,758
got a bunch of custard around and we

325
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,680
don't have enough people that want to

326
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:56,139
eat the custard yet well we could do two

327
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:57,489
baskets one basket that kind of thing or

328
00:15:56,139 --> 00:16:01,019
we could cook our lunch in there at the

329
00:15:57,490 --> 00:16:05,350
same time if we do a different basket

330
00:16:01,019 --> 00:16:07,149
we tried looking for any old basket but

331
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:09,399
thought fryer baskets that might work

332
00:16:07,149 --> 00:16:12,189
but it turns out coolers and fryers

333
00:16:09,399 --> 00:16:13,389
don't tend to be the same size so we

334
00:16:12,189 --> 00:16:16,089
need to go ahead and make our own

335
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:19,420
baskets we went through a couple designs

336
00:16:16,089 --> 00:16:21,160
I won't bore you with creating a box

337
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:25,300
because you've all folded a box before

338
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:27,459
so we we created a few designs we came

339
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:30,579
up with ones that worked and we also

340
00:16:27,459 --> 00:16:32,258
found that expanded aluminum worked

341
00:16:30,579 --> 00:16:36,279
really well it doesn't oxidize very

342
00:16:32,259 --> 00:16:37,870
easily its malleable so that when they

343
00:16:36,279 --> 00:16:38,860
don't fit we can kind of smash it in

344
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:42,250
there

345
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:42,990
and we happen to have some on hand so

346
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:46,339
that helped

347
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:51,630
well so so great we've got the baskets

348
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:53,790
we need to get them in and out now so

349
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:56,510
yeah reaching into a cooler full of

350
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:59,219
nearly boiling hot water kind of sucks

351
00:16:56,510 --> 00:17:01,800
so we thought of ways to make that suck

352
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:03,959
less in one of the ways well the way

353
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:06,688
that we decided on what bend some metal

354
00:17:03,959 --> 00:17:10,708
rods into a hook fashion and pull the

355
00:17:06,689 --> 00:17:11,850
baskets up out of the hot coolers but we

356
00:17:10,709 --> 00:17:14,819
didn't want to stop there

357
00:17:11,849 --> 00:17:17,520
so we haven't have a 3d printer back at

358
00:17:14,819 --> 00:17:20,280
the lab and decided to print some nice

359
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:22,020
little handles for it because why not

360
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:28,879
two of the three handles are made out of

361
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:32,610
a green PLA filament GSG yeah GST green

362
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:34,590
the third handle - yeah the third out of

363
00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:37,110
three handles which I'll get to in a

364
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:40,770
minute is made out of a white PCT PE

365
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:42,449
flex the idea here is that you know

366
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:45,389
while we had some nice green handles we

367
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:48,929
wanted to raise the bar in 3d printer

368
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:50,910
handle comfort and so this material

369
00:17:48,929 --> 00:17:52,710
would ideally make for a squish your

370
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:55,100
handle making it nicer for us to pick

371
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:58,470
these baskets up out of the cooler

372
00:17:55,100 --> 00:18:01,590
unfortunately our handle design was too

373
00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:03,870
rigid and it just ended up being just as

374
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:07,740
hard as the green stuff but is worth a

375
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:11,550
shot so why do we only have three

376
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:15,540
handles mouths for oh well I kind of

377
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:17,460
suck at 3d printing at least with a dual

378
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:20,309
extruder head which is what we started

379
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:23,340
experimenting with leading up to torque

380
00:18:20,309 --> 00:18:26,730
am so what you see here is kind of a

381
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:31,199
graveyard of lost handles just a moment

382
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:33,690
of silence loss but we ended up with a

383
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:36,210
nice purple flower pot with green

384
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:38,880
filament flowers so you know not all was

385
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:43,110
lost there so why did this start

386
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:44,910
happening I have a bit of a theory so

387
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:47,580
dual extruder printing how it works is

388
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:49,559
you have to print nozzles one nozzle

389
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:52,439
prints the material for the actual

390
00:18:49,559 --> 00:18:54,450
handle and the other nozzle prints the

391
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:56,380
support structure to kind of hold the

392
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:58,150
object up while it's printing

393
00:18:56,380 --> 00:19:00,070
and this support structure can be broken

394
00:18:58,150 --> 00:19:02,380
off or washed off after the print is

395
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:05,350
done and so one nozzle will turn on in

396
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:07,390
heat up and print a layer and then turn

397
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:10,659
off and cool down while the other nozzle

398
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:13,840
heats up in prints it's layer and I

399
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:15,400
think the problem is arising and if

400
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,990
anyone actually knows the solution to

401
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:20,289
this definitely let me know because I

402
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:22,450
haven't figured it out the second

403
00:19:20,289 --> 00:19:24,309
support structure nozzle wasn't cooling

404
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:26,410
down enough and so we were just getting

405
00:19:24,309 --> 00:19:28,120
drip edge while and also one was

406
00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:31,000
printing and ending up with kind of a

407
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:33,250
double print and ultimately it was

408
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:35,789
interfering with the handle and all

409
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:38,169
kinds of bad things started happening

410
00:19:35,789 --> 00:19:39,610
the printer isn't smart enough to know

411
00:19:38,169 --> 00:19:41,860
that that's happening so it just kind of

412
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:43,928
keeps going on its merry way until it

413
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:45,729
thinks it's done

414
00:19:43,929 --> 00:19:47,320
at which point all hell kind of breaks

415
00:19:45,730 --> 00:19:49,059
loose and you end up with flowerpots and

416
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:50,379
all kinds of crazy stuff especially if

417
00:19:49,059 --> 00:19:57,340
you're not paying attention to the 3d

418
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:59,740
printer nice globular mess so yeah if

419
00:19:57,340 --> 00:20:04,000
anyone knows how to fix it definitely

420
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:05,350
let me know alright now that we have the

421
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,470
proper cook vessel

422
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:10,539
we've got jars we've got baskets we've

423
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:13,659
got comfortable handles well three out

424
00:20:10,539 --> 00:20:16,690
of four of our comfortable handles and a

425
00:20:13,659 --> 00:20:19,630
method for filling the jars we're ready

426
00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:24,250
to cook we did want to do some

427
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:26,620
automation of it and how we decided we

428
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:30,400
were going to automate is with the grape

429
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:33,520
set so yeah time for a shameless product

430
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:37,600
plug great fit is a next generation good

431
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:39,370
fit reading off our website the next

432
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:41,379
generation good fit intended to serve as

433
00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:43,360
your custom high speed USB peripheral

434
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:46,480
through the addition of expansion boards

435
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:47,949
called neighbors so all that's good and

436
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,520
fine but up to do with cooking creme

437
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:51,909
brulee

438
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:53,289
well cooking 700 jars of creme brulee as

439
00:20:51,909 --> 00:20:55,360
you might imagine might be kind of

440
00:20:53,289 --> 00:20:58,510
time-consuming and kind of gets in the

441
00:20:55,360 --> 00:21:00,850
way of drinking it can so in the name of

442
00:20:58,510 --> 00:21:02,500
drinking on the job we decided to

443
00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:05,678
automate our cook process using great

444
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:08,250
fit so we attached our two bucket

445
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:09,580
heaters to GPIO pins as well as a

446
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:13,720
temperature

447
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:16,270
and a nice little LCD screen so that we

448
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:18,640
can easily look at it and see what it's

449
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:20,290
doing if it's cooking if it's cooling

450
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:24,610
down if it's done how much time see

451
00:21:20,290 --> 00:21:27,070
laughs things like that now that we have

452
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:28,780
all this nice hardware hooked up we kind

453
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:30,129
of quickly realized that we actually

454
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:32,290
needed to write some code to make any of

455
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:36,970
this do anything useful or maybe even

456
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:38,379
cook some creme brulee for us so we have

457
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:42,130
all the ingredients a great fit and

458
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:45,160
temperature sensor bucket heaters a nice

459
00:21:42,130 --> 00:21:46,930
little screen and so the cut process

460
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:49,870
itself is pretty simple

461
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:51,990
you turn on the board and it turns on

462
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:55,149
the sensors and the heaters for you and

463
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:57,100
it continuously heats up until we reach

464
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:59,320
about eighty degrees Celsius at which

465
00:21:57,100 --> 00:22:02,530
point we moved from the heating up phase

466
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:05,740
into the cooking phase at which point a

467
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:08,649
timer is started and the heaters are

468
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:11,050
turned off and we stay in the cooking

469
00:22:08,650 --> 00:22:13,030
phase until temperature drops below a

470
00:22:11,050 --> 00:22:15,010
threshold at which point we move back

471
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:17,940
into heating up and basically this cycle

472
00:22:15,010 --> 00:22:23,560
continues until the timer is done and

473
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:26,560
ideally our creme brulee is cooked so

474
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:29,710
while the design is fairly simple it was

475
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:30,970
kind of a lot to take on as someone who

476
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:36,280
had never really written a lot of

477
00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:38,980
embedded C code before so I did what any

478
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:42,129
great programmer would do and started

479
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:44,889
writing some Python because why not

480
00:22:42,129 --> 00:22:49,899
luckily for me the great fit can run

481
00:22:44,889 --> 00:22:52,899
Python code so double win there so yeah

482
00:22:49,899 --> 00:22:56,229
after writing up a script based on the

483
00:22:52,899 --> 00:22:58,989
cook design and getting all that working

484
00:22:56,230 --> 00:23:02,230
we tested it out and ran a test code

485
00:22:58,990 --> 00:23:03,549
with it and it worked pretty well just

486
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:06,220
needed to tweak some numbers here and

487
00:23:03,549 --> 00:23:09,929
there but overall it was a pretty nice

488
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:13,509
system after that I moved on to the fun

489
00:23:09,929 --> 00:23:17,500
embedded C code version of the Python

490
00:23:13,509 --> 00:23:19,990
project which wasn't too bad but if

491
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:23,289
anyone's interested in that code or how

492
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:26,529
to program terribly all of this codes on

493
00:23:23,289 --> 00:23:29,250
just you github so now that we have our

494
00:23:26,529 --> 00:23:31,899
automated system we can spend less time

495
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:35,970
staring at a cooler full of custard and

496
00:23:31,899 --> 00:23:35,969
more time drinking at camp

497
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:42,500
[Laughter]

498
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:49,570
so we now have working hard while

499
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:53,500
theoretically working hardware and

500
00:23:49,570 --> 00:23:54,939
software and now it's time to get to the

501
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:56,430
meat of it and actually see if any of it

502
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:59,320
works

503
00:23:56,430 --> 00:24:00,940
so Jacob mentioned that we have the

504
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:04,230
bucket heaters hooked up to the great

505
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:07,150
FET we actually have these two

506
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:10,090
off-the-shelf relays hooked up to the

507
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:11,800
great FET and they're just swishing the

508
00:24:10,090 --> 00:24:13,300
bucket heaters on and off once they once

509
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:15,190
they hit threshold switch them on and

510
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:17,889
off and the reason why I kind of want to

511
00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:20,550
show this is like other than the great

512
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:23,200
FET which was going to be available soon

513
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:24,790
everything that we used is off-the-shelf

514
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,890
we didn't want to actually design any

515
00:24:24,790 --> 00:24:29,320
hardware we wanted to like piece

516
00:24:26,890 --> 00:24:31,630
everything together do stuff off the

517
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:32,919
breadboard and just kind of see what we

518
00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:36,630
came up with see how we could make it

519
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:39,550
work and see how repeatable it was and

520
00:24:36,630 --> 00:24:43,210
hopefully anybody else could do the same

521
00:24:39,550 --> 00:24:46,690
thing that was the goal we ended up

522
00:24:43,210 --> 00:24:50,010
doing two and a half test cooks the

523
00:24:46,690 --> 00:24:53,350
first one was at our Christmas party it

524
00:24:50,010 --> 00:24:54,850
went mostly well except for we ended up

525
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:56,980
having too much Christmas party and not

526
00:24:54,850 --> 00:24:59,590
enough custard and had to come back and

527
00:24:56,980 --> 00:25:02,110
try that test cook again another day but

528
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:04,360
we did get it all done that we did

529
00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:06,820
actually make 35 creme brulee is in the

530
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:11,229
buckets but as I mentioned before you

531
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:12,909
know we we lost a lot of heat we decided

532
00:25:11,230 --> 00:25:15,220
we couldn't scale it so all right then

533
00:25:12,910 --> 00:25:16,660
we went back redesigned got everything

534
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:21,910
back in working order again then we did

535
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:27,040
our next test cook in the cooler the the

536
00:25:21,910 --> 00:25:28,510
cooler went well so yeah the cooler

537
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:31,480
tests some things that we found is it

538
00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:33,820
turns out that dropping 120 cold jars of

539
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:35,170
custard into 10 gallons of hot water

540
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:38,110
drops the temperature pretty

541
00:25:35,170 --> 00:25:39,550
significantly and go figure and that

542
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:42,010
could have an effect on the outcome of

543
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:44,200
the cook so we tweaked the code a little

544
00:25:42,010 --> 00:25:46,660
bit to heat up more on the initial ramp

545
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:48,670
up before dropping jars in and then

546
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:50,860
maintaining the 80 degrees over the

547
00:25:48,670 --> 00:25:54,010
duration of the cook which turned out

548
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:55,689
pretty well and the heaters yeah we

549
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:58,090
mentioned before the pumps are pretty

550
00:25:55,690 --> 00:25:58,750
crucial because the bucket heaters are

551
00:25:58,090 --> 00:26:01,780
really good at he

552
00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:04,300
water but water it's right next to it

553
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:06,940
right so pump the water around ensures

554
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:09,490
that we have a more even and consistent

555
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:11,380
temperature at each jar throughout the

556
00:26:09,490 --> 00:26:17,740
entire cooler so you end up with more

557
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:23,050
delicious custard and we had done we had

558
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:25,030
done that test cook once with the Python

559
00:26:23,050 --> 00:26:27,220
code and then we did it another I

560
00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:29,889
mentioned two and a half test cooks we

561
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:32,140
did several half test cooks we didn't

562
00:26:29,890 --> 00:26:33,820
cook any custard but we once we got the

563
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:36,430
embedded code working we ran through a

564
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:38,590
bunch of tests with the embedded code

565
00:26:36,430 --> 00:26:40,050
and just water and seeing what happens

566
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:42,159
and seeing how we could alter the

567
00:26:40,050 --> 00:26:45,730
temperature of the water make sure our

568
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:47,380
code kept up and it all worked well one

569
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:48,610
thing I didn't mention before is creme

570
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:50,740
brulee you have to cook it but then you

571
00:26:48,610 --> 00:26:52,240
have to cool it if you don't cool the

572
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:53,740
creme brulee and you try to relay it

573
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:55,690
once as soon as you put the sugar on the

574
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:59,020
sugar starts to melt it turns into a

575
00:26:55,690 --> 00:27:04,120
runny mess it just you don't get that

576
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:06,460
nice brulee on top and cooling in the

577
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:09,340
past especially with the temps that have

578
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:11,890
been made here at tour camp cooling has

579
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:13,120
taken hours either have to let it settle

580
00:27:11,890 --> 00:27:14,710
at room temperature and then put it in

581
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:18,040
the fridge or slam it right in the

582
00:27:14,710 --> 00:27:22,120
fridge and and and it's still even if

583
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:23,980
you do that takes hours but it turns out

584
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:26,889
through through nice scientific research

585
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:29,860
that if you put a vessel into ice water

586
00:27:26,890 --> 00:27:32,980
not ice not water but ice water that

587
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:35,560
vessel cools in around seven minutes we

588
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:41,200
assumed this from custard but I've

589
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:42,639
always known that with beer so time to

590
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:47,230
test that out we had done we've done a

591
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:48,790
full cook of 120 jars throw it in a

592
00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:50,530
cooler fill ice sure enough

593
00:27:48,790 --> 00:27:55,450
seven minutes they were all cold they

594
00:27:50,530 --> 00:27:57,070
were all ready to go so we ended up with

595
00:27:55,450 --> 00:28:00,550
this we ended up with two coolers we

596
00:27:57,070 --> 00:28:03,610
have one for cooking one for cooling we

597
00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:05,800
have two bucket heaters a pump we ended

598
00:28:03,610 --> 00:28:08,439
up with several pumps but we've killed a

599
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:10,810
few of them in the process but you know

600
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:12,460
that'll happen with pumps six nice

601
00:28:10,810 --> 00:28:15,700
artisanal aluminum baskets

602
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:18,270
to relay switches a temperature sensor

603
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:23,020
an LCD screen a great fat one with a

604
00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:26,050
lipo battery neighbor and sorry less

605
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:29,889
breadboard neighbor piece all that

606
00:28:26,050 --> 00:28:33,460
together we have our system now it's

607
00:28:29,890 --> 00:28:37,380
time for brulee brulee yeah as you can

608
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:40,600
see there we did brand our logo in into

609
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:42,040
into a brulee at one point it looks nice

610
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:44,020
it doesn't go well on a slide where it

611
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:49,330
doesn't transfer well to a slide so much

612
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:51,970
but it's there and there are several

613
00:28:49,330 --> 00:28:55,510
brulee methods the the essentially the

614
00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:59,050
original one was you can cook off disks

615
00:28:55,510 --> 00:29:01,360
in an oven of of sugar and then just

616
00:28:59,050 --> 00:29:03,760
drop them on top of a custard the other

617
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:07,570
thing you can do is put them under a

618
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:09,850
broiler cook that you risk curdling the

619
00:29:07,570 --> 00:29:12,159
custard at that point and the most

620
00:29:09,850 --> 00:29:14,199
common method is is to handheld torch

621
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:17,070
the mesons we're going to use here but

622
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:20,290
we also you know this is a common

623
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:25,780
handheld torch it doesn't take long it's

624
00:29:20,290 --> 00:29:27,760
it's quick and it works well we we

625
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:29,800
however can't just leave good enough

626
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:32,980
alone we wanted to try to figure out

627
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:38,010
several ways to make the brew brulee

628
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:38,010
more exciting so we tried a few methods

629
00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:46,810
so we have a hundred watt laser so at

630
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:48,580
the lab we thought hey we've always

631
00:29:46,810 --> 00:29:52,000
talked about what we could cook in that

632
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:53,830
with a laser why not and all right this

633
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:57,430
is a perfect opportunity to try to cook

634
00:29:53,830 --> 00:30:01,210
something we we go ahead we went ahead

635
00:29:57,430 --> 00:30:03,190
and at full power brûléed some sugar on

636
00:30:01,210 --> 00:30:05,230
top which is both of these videos are at

637
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:07,900
full power and and Jacob created this

638
00:30:05,230 --> 00:30:10,270
this spiral pattern that went well and

639
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:12,100
full power that's great

640
00:30:10,270 --> 00:30:14,139
it takes a little less than a minute and

641
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:16,810
if we were to go ahead and cut a jig

642
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:20,710
that would fit into it we could you know

643
00:30:16,810 --> 00:30:22,340
scale that pretty well however we didn't

644
00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:24,140
want to break down our entire

645
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:26,810
100 watt laser cutter and bring it to

646
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:29,750
camp considering we moved it across town

647
00:30:26,810 --> 00:30:36,830
once and and broke the broke the the

648
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:38,510
laser and yeah so what are some other

649
00:30:36,830 --> 00:30:40,790
options for laser well we started

650
00:30:38,510 --> 00:30:43,250
looking around and we found that you

651
00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:47,840
could buy five watt and 10 watt 10 watt

652
00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:49,790
laser pointers and thought maybe we

653
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:51,679
could make a little CNC machine to do

654
00:30:49,790 --> 00:30:56,360
this with a laser pointer or even hand

655
00:30:51,680 --> 00:31:07,460
out laser pointers at this nice somewhat

656
00:30:56,360 --> 00:31:10,010
legal power rating couple issues there

657
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:12,800
obviously we didn't want anyone to like

658
00:31:10,010 --> 00:31:16,400
while they're here at camp but it also

659
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:20,750
takes around 40 minutes to brulee sugar

660
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:23,990
at 5 watts we tested that on the laser 5

661
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:26,360
percent power and yeah just way too long

662
00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:33,290
and the size also was obviously an issue

663
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:35,840
like just think massive so yeah we moved

664
00:31:33,290 --> 00:31:39,649
on to a third option which involved

665
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:43,790
torches but they were much bigger torch

666
00:31:39,650 --> 00:31:47,270
a little bigger it seemed like a good

667
00:31:43,790 --> 00:31:49,040
idea you know what could go wrong it's

668
00:31:47,270 --> 00:31:51,590
got a nice big torch you hopefully just

669
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:53,420
pass it by and it's gonna brulee you've

670
00:31:51,590 --> 00:32:00,980
got to be to you there it's good all

671
00:31:53,420 --> 00:32:04,910
right well so um we had a large failure

672
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:08,060
rate with this there's there we lost for

673
00:32:04,910 --> 00:32:11,330
every I'd say 15 custards that we tried

674
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:14,240
we lost at least three jars so that's

675
00:32:11,330 --> 00:32:16,970
not gonna scale very well every jar that

676
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:18,790
we lost also shot glass into the

677
00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:23,880
adjacent jars

678
00:32:18,790 --> 00:32:25,750
a little less delicious and and there's

679
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:27,340
couldn't get a good video of it but

680
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:29,440
there's like little volcanoes have

681
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:33,459
custard every once in a while because it

682
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:35,290
hot custom comes shooting out yeah it

683
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:36,610
curdled the custard it cooked it but it

684
00:32:35,290 --> 00:32:39,940
turned it to scrambled eggs yeah it

685
00:32:36,610 --> 00:32:42,669
didn't work yeah and with all of the

686
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:44,620
methods we broke glass every single

687
00:32:42,670 --> 00:32:47,290
method even just the handheld torch we

688
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:50,080
left it too long in one spot and

689
00:32:47,290 --> 00:32:53,409
shattered one of the jars obviously the

690
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:55,899
the big torch took a lot of jars out and

691
00:32:53,410 --> 00:32:58,690
even the laser cutter we had it just we

692
00:32:55,900 --> 00:33:01,030
had one jar just slightly offset and as

693
00:32:58,690 --> 00:33:03,010
the spiral came around it started

694
00:33:01,030 --> 00:33:04,840
hitting the jar it actually shaved a

695
00:33:03,010 --> 00:33:07,840
little piece of glass off in the jar of

696
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:10,209
the jar and you can see the spiral cut

697
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:11,530
as it goes by it's shaved a pizza off

698
00:33:10,210 --> 00:33:12,510
and it landed right you know right in

699
00:33:11,530 --> 00:33:15,220
the brulee

700
00:33:12,510 --> 00:33:25,330
so you know we've got good at breaking

701
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:27,730
glass so yeah so the moment you thought

702
00:33:25,330 --> 00:33:30,250
you were waiting for we're not actually

703
00:33:27,730 --> 00:33:32,320
serving creme brulee right here we are

704
00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:34,390
gonna serve creme brulee the rest of the

705
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:36,370
the rest of camp we're gonna immediately

706
00:33:34,390 --> 00:33:39,070
after this talk go back to our cabin

707
00:33:36,370 --> 00:33:40,750
we're gonna start up the cooler we're

708
00:33:39,070 --> 00:33:42,220
gonna have the whole full setup going so

709
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:44,950
anybody can come by and check out the

710
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:46,540
setup it's gonna take us three to

711
00:33:44,950 --> 00:33:48,910
three-and-a-half hours from the time we

712
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:50,290
start to get the first batch but then

713
00:33:48,910 --> 00:33:52,030
it'll be every hour hour and a half that

714
00:33:50,290 --> 00:33:57,070
we get another hundred and twenty to

715
00:33:52,030 --> 00:34:00,100
come out of the cooler yeah at least

716
00:33:57,070 --> 00:34:07,600
that's the goal hopefully we get in

717
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:10,929
another 120 every hour yeah and then we

718
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:14,770
also have a small supply chain problem

719
00:34:10,929 --> 00:34:17,380
where the grocery store actually lost a

720
00:34:14,770 --> 00:34:20,230
good chunk of their dairy delivery was

721
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:21,700
failed due to temperature and so they

722
00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:24,040
had to send a bunch of stuff back so

723
00:34:21,699 --> 00:34:26,319
hopefully tomorrow morning they're

724
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:28,389
supposed to get the rest in we hope to

725
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:29,770
have everything done by the end of the

726
00:34:28,389 --> 00:34:31,408
day tomorrow we hope to have at least

727
00:34:29,770 --> 00:34:35,009
700 of them

728
00:34:31,409 --> 00:34:37,409
so come by come bring your token come

729
00:34:35,010 --> 00:34:38,909
check out the setup we'll brulee it

730
00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:45,270
right there for you and hand you a nice

731
00:34:38,909 --> 00:34:45,990
fresh fresh creme brulee just the

732
00:34:45,270 --> 00:34:48,810
handheld torch

733
00:34:45,989 --> 00:34:50,848
yeah we got about ten propane torches

734
00:34:48,810 --> 00:34:54,840
sitting back in the cabin we're ready to

735
00:34:50,849 --> 00:34:57,090
go so yeah that was just an exercise in

736
00:34:54,840 --> 00:35:02,840
failure for the most part it was great

737
00:34:57,090 --> 00:35:02,840
it was good fun but yeah right exactly

738
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:13,200
power if you sign a waiver yes so that's

739
00:35:11,550 --> 00:35:14,970
pretty much it oh the other thing to

740
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:17,580
mention as you notice this is a badge

741
00:35:14,970 --> 00:35:19,859
this is a fully populated badge in the

742
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:21,779
jar they are sized to fit in the jar so

743
00:35:19,859 --> 00:35:23,970
if you come get your creme brulee you

744
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:25,980
can take the jar back the kits will be

745
00:35:23,970 --> 00:35:27,359
available at the Maker stage or the

746
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:29,310
components will be available at the

747
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:33,690
Maker stage you can populate your jar

748
00:35:29,310 --> 00:35:35,070
and then it's a it's a Firefly kit we've

749
00:35:33,690 --> 00:35:37,170
hung them around our necks they don't

750
00:35:35,070 --> 00:35:39,420
they're they it's not too heavy it's

751
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:42,540
nice and they're good I mean after the

752
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:47,220
costume no custard you know yeah it's

753
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:49,820
nice so that's pretty much it thanks for

754
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:49,819
coming to the talk

755
00:35:56,750 --> 00:36:00,170
any questions

756
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:08,290
easier to easier to access basically

757
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:13,779
like if we just stopped at Home Depot on

758
00:36:08,290 --> 00:36:18,670
the way by butane refillable butane

759
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:20,440
torches sometimes suck the often they

760
00:36:18,670 --> 00:36:22,450
work really well but sometimes if you

761
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:24,610
just get a bad you you can either break

762
00:36:22,450 --> 00:36:28,180
your fill you break your fill nozzle or

763
00:36:24,610 --> 00:36:30,310
you can break the port very easily it

764
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:32,350
seemed more stable for us with the

765
00:36:30,310 --> 00:36:34,960
quantity that we had to do to do just

766
00:36:32,350 --> 00:36:36,880
propane and I've used that in restaurant

767
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:47,560
many times propane so it's just kind of

768
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:49,710
what I knew - yeah once we abandon the

769
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:53,440
laser we kind of had to abandon the CNC

770
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:55,060
idea which that would be fun and if we

771
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:59,080
had more time I would love to play with

772
00:36:55,060 --> 00:37:02,880
that but yeah it we basically ran out of

773
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:02,880
time to do more more brew laying ideas

774
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:15,970
it does well know cuz our process I I

775
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:16,960
kind of glossed over the process we

776
00:37:15,970 --> 00:37:19,990
actually put it in room-temperature

777
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:22,630
water first let that do the initial cool

778
00:37:19,990 --> 00:37:25,390
then add ice to that and and once you

779
00:37:22,630 --> 00:37:29,620
add the ice you you end up with that

780
00:37:25,390 --> 00:37:31,089
seven minutes kind of thing and it's

781
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:32,620
okay because we've still got another

782
00:37:31,090 --> 00:37:35,200
hour before the next batch comes out

783
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:37,180
basically so yeah if we had multiple

784
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:38,770
cooking coolers that could become more

785
00:37:37,180 --> 00:38:01,779
of a problem but since we're only using

786
00:37:38,770 --> 00:38:03,759
one cooking cooler I actually thought

787
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:06,340
about that this morning that I wanted to

788
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:09,760
I failed to do the math for even just

789
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:11,710
the full setup I wanted to know so many

790
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:13,780
variables change throughout that I kind

791
00:38:11,710 --> 00:38:15,330
of lost track and then we started

792
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:17,160
working on the talk and I kind of

793
00:38:15,330 --> 00:38:20,130
oh shoot we should have gone back and

794
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:21,569
done the math on all this so look for

795
00:38:20,130 --> 00:38:34,920
that on the github page coming down the

796
00:38:21,570 --> 00:38:37,200
line here anybody else just time yeah

797
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:41,130
well it was definitely a concept that we

798
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:42,720
looked at and when we the initial step

799
00:38:41,130 --> 00:38:46,470
to that was looking at automating the

800
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:48,990
servo for the pour spout since we never

801
00:38:46,470 --> 00:38:50,399
ended up getting that working right we

802
00:38:48,990 --> 00:38:51,899
just kind of abandoned it's not that we

803
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:53,370
couldn't have gotten the servo going we

804
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:57,480
just kind of ended up having to focus

805
00:38:53,370 --> 00:38:59,009
our time elsewhere we definitely want to

806
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:01,020
do some server stuff with the great Phet

807
00:38:59,010 --> 00:39:03,180
just to see how it works we'd like to

808
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:05,280
make a motor control board so if that

809
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:08,009
happens obviously it would be nice and

810
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:15,950
nice and easy to make a CNC kind of

811
00:39:08,010 --> 00:39:21,420
setup we ever actually tried one week

812
00:39:15,950 --> 00:39:24,390
first the low-power one yeah oh really

813
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:26,250
that was pretty solar but yeah max power

814
00:39:24,390 --> 00:39:28,529
there's a little too much glass for our

815
00:39:26,250 --> 00:39:36,570
taste so yeah didn't actually try those

816
00:39:28,530 --> 00:39:39,210
ones that's that's what we ended up

817
00:39:36,570 --> 00:39:41,250
using yeah we brûléed one so we that was

818
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:43,830
an initial attempt at the low power

819
00:39:41,250 --> 00:39:48,090
brulee we thought maybe we could add

820
00:39:43,830 --> 00:39:49,410
that and then as we did those tests we

821
00:39:48,090 --> 00:39:51,000
decided to come back around alright

822
00:39:49,410 --> 00:39:53,040
let's go ahead and brulee one by hand

823
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:54,630
stick it back under the laser and see

824
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:56,820
what we get and that's what the with the

825
00:39:54,630 --> 00:39:59,460
logo ended up looking at like and was

826
00:39:56,820 --> 00:40:02,370
that it the low power yeah that was also

827
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:04,830
a low power that was so it the low power

828
00:40:02,370 --> 00:40:08,160
we could we actually did discuss using

829
00:40:04,830 --> 00:40:11,310
the low power lasers to do designs

830
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:16,100
instead of brew lane and we also decided

831
00:40:11,310 --> 00:40:19,220
that would be a little dangerous yeah

832
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:19,220
anybody else

833
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:30,450
all right well thank you

834
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:30,450
[Applause]
