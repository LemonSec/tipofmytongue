1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:07,029
without further ado we have Snyder here

2
00:00:04,149 --> 00:00:08,270
talking about GRE eridium so please give

3
00:00:07,029 --> 00:00:16,660
him a warm welcome

4
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:21,939
[Applause]

5
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:25,689
this talk will be about our new radio

6
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:29,410
out of tree tool kit to receive stuff

7
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:32,800
from iridium and just maybe quickly

8
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:37,710
about me so I'm from Munich with the CCC

9
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:41,640
there for now over 10 years have done

10
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:44,109
first blinky things and then more

11
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:46,600
electronic embedded stuff the badges for

12
00:00:44,109 --> 00:00:49,030
the camps was involved there and around

13
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:51,460
four years ago started to look together

14
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:56,199
a sec also someone from the Munich CCC

15
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:57,609
into iridium this talk will be as

16
00:00:56,199 --> 00:00:59,409
mentioned mainly about the Auto free

17
00:00:57,609 --> 00:01:02,530
module so it will be rather technical

18
00:00:59,409 --> 00:01:06,990
and more about the signal processing

19
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:09,460
part and how to effectively do this on a

20
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:12,310
not that modern machine anymore

21
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:15,030
if you're interested in how does iridium

22
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:17,619
work what kind of data can you see there

23
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:20,259
how to use the tools and everything I

24
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:23,140
suggest looking at these two talks we

25
00:01:20,259 --> 00:01:25,539
especially the last one from xi hope

26
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:27,250
gives a good overview over the whole

27
00:01:25,539 --> 00:01:30,250
tool chain because the tool chain

28
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:31,840
doesn't exist consists out of own des

29
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:34,090
non exceedence consists out of key

30
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:36,219
iridium that's also the iridium toolkit

31
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:40,810
written in Python which is mainly there

32
00:01:36,219 --> 00:01:43,119
to make sense of the receive data so

33
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:46,450
quick introduction to iridium it has

34
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:49,270
been up there for almost 20 years I

35
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:54,070
guess a few satellites are up 20 years

36
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:59,699
already it provides a number of

37
00:01:54,070 --> 00:02:02,530
different services data boys SMS pagers

38
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:04,090
short burst data which is more for

39
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:07,149
machine to machine communication and

40
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:09,280
lots of things you couldn't even count

41
00:02:07,149 --> 00:02:12,790
all of them at at least I can't

42
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:15,400
it has 66 logical satellites

43
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:18,220
especially the older satellites say

44
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:20,470
sometimes teamed them up so you'd have

45
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:23,079
two satellites moving along close to

46
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:26,349
each other and both of them slightly

47
00:02:23,079 --> 00:02:28,599
defective but you put them together they

48
00:02:26,349 --> 00:02:31,119
make up for that and then you have like

49
00:02:28,599 --> 00:02:34,480
still one satellite it looks like one

50
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:36,519
satellite to the receivers they are at a

51
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:38,980
moment in the process of replacing all

52
00:02:36,519 --> 00:02:41,530
of these satellites with the Iridium

53
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:44,290
next satellites because these have

54
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:46,900
reached the end of their lifetime and so

55
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:49,120
iridium is here to stay and still

56
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:52,590
probably for many years to come an

57
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,590
interesting thing to look at

58
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:02,530
Gareth just was on the empower talking

59
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:07,030
about using iridium for tracking tuna

60
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:09,430
fishing buoys and he mentioned that yes

61
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:11,980
so when they were thinking about

62
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:13,389
security for Iridium they just said okay

63
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:16,690
it's just going to be very very

64
00:03:13,389 --> 00:03:18,970
difficult to do because there's a huge

65
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:21,609
Doppler shift and it's so complex and

66
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:23,980
only yeah the most determined

67
00:03:21,609 --> 00:03:29,290
adversaries will be able to do this and

68
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:31,358
yes I mean we were determined and it

69
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:34,090
took us roughly half a year to get from

70
00:03:31,359 --> 00:03:36,910
we have no idea about anything - we can

71
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:38,319
at least decode something and from that

72
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:40,690
point on together to help

73
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:42,578
also from the osmocon people which -

74
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:46,379
open source mobile communication in

75
00:03:42,579 --> 00:03:49,540
Germany it went pretty quickly from

76
00:03:46,379 --> 00:03:53,980
decoding one-way pages to decoding voice

77
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:56,168
calls and though that's all super

78
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:59,980
interesting I want to talk a little bit

79
00:03:56,169 --> 00:04:02,530
more about the signal processing here so

80
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:05,409
we're talking about SDR Co

81
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:08,739
software-defined radio and just to lay

82
00:04:05,409 --> 00:04:10,540
down a few terms here the most basic

83
00:04:08,739 --> 00:04:15,760
piece of information can have there is a

84
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:18,190
sample in a sample is in the world of

85
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:20,289
SDR is made out of two numbers the

86
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:21,880
in-phase and the quadrature component

87
00:04:20,289 --> 00:04:22,419
and we'll get to talk about that in a

88
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:24,700
second

89
00:04:22,419 --> 00:04:26,680
but it's like the single piece of

90
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:30,190
information and you SDR gives you a few

91
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:32,350
millions of these per second and we

92
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:35,710
would call that the stream so stream is

93
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:37,900
a number of samples coming in one after

94
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:42,930
each other over time and that's what

95
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:45,340
your algorithm is looking at a burst is

96
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:45,820
just an increase in energy in this

97
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:49,000
stream

98
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:51,009
it's just says okay something just came

99
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:55,690
in there's something going on we don't

100
00:04:51,009 --> 00:04:58,750
know exactly what yet but we might want

101
00:04:55,690 --> 00:05:01,870
to look at this and in this picture over

102
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:03,729
here frequencies on the x-axis and

103
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:06,639
energy is on the y-axis you can see

104
00:05:03,729 --> 00:05:08,889
these Peaks here and each of these Peaks

105
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:10,990
over time is a burst so it goes up and

106
00:05:08,889 --> 00:05:13,750
down and up and down and when energy

107
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:16,509
goes up we have a burst these bursts

108
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:19,180
contain symbols a symbol is the smallest

109
00:05:16,509 --> 00:05:22,090
entity of like actual data which can be

110
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:25,539
in there and if you assemble multiple

111
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:27,549
symbols together you get a frame so not

112
00:05:25,539 --> 00:05:30,009
every burst contain symbols it might

113
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:32,250
just be noise but bursts coming from the

114
00:05:30,009 --> 00:05:36,190
Iridium satellite will contain symbols

115
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:38,380
so this thing down here is an example of

116
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:42,630
an iridium frame as it's like in the

117
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:46,680
waterfall it's just over time how does

118
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:49,510
this image evolve and you just have a a

119
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:51,250
preamble with some static content and

120
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:53,169
then the actual data and if you throw

121
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:55,810
this into our tool chain you get this

122
00:05:53,169 --> 00:05:58,150
thing with just zeros and ones coming

123
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:59,770
out of it and that's where the out of PD

124
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:02,530
module stops and if you put that into

125
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:04,060
the iridium toolkit it will decode stuff

126
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:06,758
and will tell you okay this is from

127
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:12,250
following satellite and it contains I'm

128
00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:17,560
not sure pager messages or ring alerts

129
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:19,449
for a certain device iridium uses just

130
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:22,120
slightly over ten megahertz of bandwidth

131
00:06:19,449 --> 00:06:24,699
it starts at exactly one point six one

132
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:28,570
six gigahertz then you have ten

133
00:06:24,699 --> 00:06:31,970
megahertz of duplex channels this is

134
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:36,690
where the actual voice data is

135
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:41,060
where most of the stuff happens in these

136
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:44,599
ten megahertz you get 240 channels and

137
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:47,220
above this you get some special channels

138
00:06:44,599 --> 00:06:48,960
specifically the ring alert and the

139
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:51,569
Pedro Channel which have higher power

140
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:55,859
they are there to even reach into

141
00:06:51,569 --> 00:06:58,650
buildings and you know at least a ring a

142
00:06:55,860 --> 00:07:01,020
phone or deliver a one-way pager message

143
00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:06,388
to a pager which is maybe sitting behind

144
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:07,770
a glass window we originally started

145
00:07:06,389 --> 00:07:08,220
looking just looking at the Pedro

146
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:09,990
Channel

147
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:11,789
this is what we were interested in

148
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:14,580
because you have these passive devices

149
00:07:11,789 --> 00:07:17,280
they just received something and we were

150
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:21,030
wondering who would use that and I need

151
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:22,619
you can't you can guess I guess so and

152
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:26,698
this is what it then looks like you have

153
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:30,449
this is the animation every time this

154
00:07:26,699 --> 00:07:32,280
goes up as a bird and you get hundreds

155
00:07:30,449 --> 00:07:36,419
of birds per second maybe a thousand of

156
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:39,440
bursts per second and this is then

157
00:07:36,419 --> 00:07:42,659
starting to demand a little bit of

158
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:44,569
computing power so here we zoom in a

159
00:07:42,659 --> 00:07:49,889
little bit and you can see there's

160
00:07:44,569 --> 00:07:51,270
channels here and we get data from two

161
00:07:49,889 --> 00:07:55,889
different satellites right now and you

162
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:57,448
can see that the the red line which just

163
00:07:55,889 --> 00:07:59,909
stays up if there's a burst it's it's

164
00:07:57,449 --> 00:08:01,409
wider than a single burst and what you

165
00:07:59,909 --> 00:08:03,779
can see here is the effect of the

166
00:08:01,409 --> 00:08:06,960
Doppler shift so the satellites start to

167
00:08:03,779 --> 00:08:08,580
come towards you then they're just on

168
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,029
top basically and then they leave you

169
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:11,370
again

170
00:08:09,029 --> 00:08:15,630
and what this produces is a Doppler

171
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:17,400
shift so this is the frequency a single

172
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:19,169
satellite produces on this channel and

173
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:20,310
first it's high and it starts to get

174
00:08:19,169 --> 00:08:22,740
lower and lower and lower and then

175
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:25,020
tapers out over here and when it's just

176
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:28,050
above you it the rate of change is the

177
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:29,669
highest a big of an issue bit of an

178
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:32,610
issue here is that the Doppler shift is

179
00:08:29,669 --> 00:08:34,919
larger than a single channel so you

180
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:37,229
cannot just by looking at a frequency

181
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:39,539
say okay this is this channel or there's

182
00:08:37,229 --> 00:08:41,969
this death channel because they overlap

183
00:08:39,539 --> 00:08:43,380
and this is actually what they were

184
00:08:41,969 --> 00:08:44,900
talking about in this slide so the

185
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:47,270
Doppler shift makes it also

186
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:50,630
difficult because him you know you have

187
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:52,760
to track all of this stuff but we simply

188
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:54,500
decided to let we'll just brute force it

189
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:56,480
basically every time something comes in

190
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:58,490
we'll just to decode it no matter in

191
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,960
which channel it is and we'll just look

192
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:03,590
at it afterwards so that's the beauty of

193
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:09,140
SDR you don't have to limit yourself to

194
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:11,540
these specific filters or a certain you

195
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:12,980
know how people fought in the beginning

196
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:14,870
how you would do this you can just throw

197
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:19,610
a little bit more computing power in it

198
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:21,290
and then just go around the corner so

199
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:25,130
how doesn't it reimburse look like you

200
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:26,719
first have some unmodulated carrier it's

201
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:29,090
different for the uplink and downlink

202
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:32,210
and then a unique section which

203
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:34,430
identifies this as a medium frame every

204
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:36,590
iridium frame contains the section so if

205
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:39,079
you find it in a burst you can be sure

206
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:41,620
this is an iridium frame and then later

207
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:50,420
on most of the stuff here's the payload

208
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:54,980
which is in a little bit higher range of

209
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:57,319
modulation and now we'll get to a quick

210
00:09:54,980 --> 00:10:00,500
primer about IQ signals so I mentioned

211
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:03,110
that STRs give you samples and they have

212
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:06,650
an eye and IQ component and in face and

213
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:10,010
a quadrature component and usually you

214
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:11,900
would draw them on a on a complex plane

215
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:16,280
so you put the Q component up here and

216
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:20,110
the I component here and every sample

217
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:23,480
you get gives you a dot on this plane

218
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:29,180
and to quickly give you an overview of

219
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:30,580
how this then looks like let's see is it

220
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:33,239
is

221
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:33,240
pure

222
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:43,280
hope it's visible okay so we have a a

223
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:44,870
signal it's at zero Hertz and with IQ

224
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:48,800
signal you can have positive and

225
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:51,290
negative frequencies there is no special

226
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:53,120
magic about that it's just that you may

227
00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:55,219
be tuned somewhere in your frequency

228
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:57,410
band that's a one point six two six zero

229
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:59,510
Hertz and you grab ten megahertz of it

230
00:10:57,410 --> 00:11:01,939
then you get minus five to plus five

231
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:03,800
megahertz in your spectrum that you get

232
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:05,930
out of there and this dot right here is

233
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:08,959
our signal right now it's on the complex

234
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:11,959
plane it doesn't move but if I give it a

235
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:13,490
little bit of a frequency positive

236
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:16,870
frequency in this case you can see it

237
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:22,070
starts moving counterclockwise so

238
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:26,690
constant movement means frequency and I

239
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:34,010
can also go around and get it to stop

240
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:35,780
again basically and just change its

241
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:37,819
angle using this slider so here I can

242
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:41,240
just drag it around on the plane and

243
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:44,030
that's just a phase offset so if you

244
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:47,240
have phase shift keying what will happen

245
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:50,540
is that this dot just jumps around in

246
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:52,430
the plane and every time you get a new

247
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:54,680
symbol it might just get a little bit of

248
00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:58,640
a face offset and then it jumps from one

249
00:11:54,680 --> 00:12:01,189
place to another place and if you add a

250
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:03,500
second signal to this this is just a

251
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:06,560
single frequency what you get is that

252
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:09,020
it's just superimposed so now I've added

253
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:11,390
a little bit weaker signal with a higher

254
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:14,300
frequency and it will just rotate around

255
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:16,610
the already rotating point it's like a

256
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:20,530
you can it's almost like planets and

257
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:20,530
moons rotating around each other

258
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:30,030
so a a fixed rotation somewhere here is

259
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:32,850
a phase shift if it keeps rotating you

260
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:35,220
have a frequency shift and the distance

261
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:37,260
from the origin here is the amplitude so

262
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:40,700
the further away from the origin the

263
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:42,840
more energy you are signal has and

264
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:45,480
sometimes you also see plots like these

265
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:47,760
so we have a red line and a blue line

266
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:52,590
here one of them is I one of them is Q

267
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:55,020
and they always come in pairs and every

268
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:56,940
sample here gives you one of these pairs

269
00:12:55,020 --> 00:13:02,010
and over time you can then see how the

270
00:12:56,940 --> 00:13:05,040
signal balls so an Iridium burst in this

271
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:08,040
view will look like just constant energy

272
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:10,469
on both channels then you get the unique

273
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:13,319
word which identifies the frame and here

274
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:15,810
the blue and the red signal I am Q they

275
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:19,410
go together they stay on top of each

276
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:21,989
other and you only have high and low and

277
00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:24,750
this is the unique word and over here in

278
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:26,700
the payload you can see they start to

279
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:29,220
diverge from each other so sometimes you

280
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:30,750
have the red one on top and the blue one

281
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:34,230
on the bottom or the other way around

282
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:36,960
and this means here every symbol can

283
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:39,090
encode for different states or to bits

284
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:41,550
and over here every symbol can only

285
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:43,770
encode two different states or one bit

286
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:48,750
so this is binary shift keying and this

287
00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:51,420
is quadrature shift keying so how does

288
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:53,220
the whole thing work you see in the

289
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:56,939
animation where the peaks went up and

290
00:13:53,220 --> 00:14:01,140
down and if you just you know flatten it

291
00:13:56,940 --> 00:14:02,910
out basically and up here is the

292
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:04,680
beginning and over time it devolves in

293
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:06,900
this direction here you have the

294
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:09,180
frequency and the bright head gets the

295
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:11,760
more energy you have this is called the

296
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:13,859
waterfall and the first thing you do is

297
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:16,890
you run an FFT which gives you basically

298
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:18,960
this picture for a for the algorithm and

299
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:20,580
you just pick out some region where

300
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:22,710
there's energy and let's say we want to

301
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:24,390
have a look at this this thing over here

302
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:28,410
this is the second one we are interested

303
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:32,550
in and what we do is we just detect the

304
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:35,480
energy we cut out a little bit of our

305
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:39,050
signal we leave a little bit

306
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:40,640
of noise in front and we leave a little

307
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:43,010
bit of stuff behind so we are sure that

308
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:44,930
everything is inside it and we just

309
00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:48,680
marked the frequency where this burst

310
00:14:44,930 --> 00:14:50,569
happens then what you do is you rotate

311
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:53,030
the whole thing so everything which was

312
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:55,040
on the left over there just rotated in

313
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:56,689
on the right and the second which was

314
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:59,209
over here we've just moved over here and

315
00:14:56,690 --> 00:15:01,700
to roughly the middle of our spectrum

316
00:14:59,210 --> 00:15:04,960
this makes it easier for the algorithms

317
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:07,340
to work with the signal almost all

318
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:09,200
signal processing algorithms which

319
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:11,540
operate on these segments expect a

320
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:14,440
signal to be roughly centered at zero

321
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:17,120
Hertz this is where they want it and

322
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:21,200
this is the first step to just roughly

323
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:23,060
get it there next step is we put a

324
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:24,650
filter around it so we throw away

325
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:29,239
everything which is on the sides and

326
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:31,939
then we actually also reduce the amount

327
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:34,180
of data which we are processing by just

328
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:37,100
taking every tenth sample for example

329
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:38,270
this gives you just the information in

330
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:41,750
the middle and you can throw out the

331
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:42,800
rest which makes it easier to handle all

332
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:44,060
the data which is coming in because

333
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:46,300
we're still talking about like a

334
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:51,199
thousand bursts per second here

335
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:53,030
then it gets easier to look at the

336
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:55,100
signal and you just have a look at okay

337
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:58,310
where does the energy actually start you

338
00:15:55,100 --> 00:16:01,190
cut away everything above it and then

339
00:15:58,310 --> 00:16:03,829
the nice part about an Iridium signal is

340
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:07,340
this unmodulated part up here which

341
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:09,800
makes it pretty easy to say okay we'll

342
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:11,870
just take a very fine frequency

343
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:15,219
estimation of over this thing and this

344
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:19,670
will give us a much better estimate of

345
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:22,010
where is this the signal located where a

346
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:24,760
zero Hertz because you can see that over

347
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:27,470
here the inq components they form these

348
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:29,030
sinusoidal waves which is an indication

349
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:32,150
that it's still rotating a little bit in

350
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:34,130
the plane and after moving it exactly in

351
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:37,579
the middle you see there's no change

352
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:39,170
anymore in the inq part they're not on

353
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:40,880
top of each other but at least they're

354
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:44,150
not rotating anymore they're somewhere

355
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:46,220
in the plane now so what do we do we

356
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:47,900
rotate the whole thing so that these

357
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:48,920
took two components are on top of each

358
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:51,199
other

359
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:53,779
and then you can start to see okay over

360
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:56,118
here's our unique word we can correlate

361
00:16:53,779 --> 00:17:00,649
against that thing we know how it should

362
00:16:56,119 --> 00:17:03,559
look like and we just basically run an

363
00:17:00,649 --> 00:17:06,138
algorithm which looks for this pattern

364
00:17:03,559 --> 00:17:08,449
and as soon as it finds this pattern it

365
00:17:06,138 --> 00:17:12,648
produces a peak and says exactly at this

366
00:17:08,449 --> 00:17:14,360
sample this pattern appears and now we

367
00:17:12,648 --> 00:17:17,148
have everything we need we have we know

368
00:17:14,359 --> 00:17:19,969
exactly where does our signal start we

369
00:17:17,148 --> 00:17:23,268
have rotated it nicely so that we can

370
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:25,579
directly look at each single symbol

371
00:17:23,269 --> 00:17:27,199
there and decide is the blue one on top

372
00:17:25,579 --> 00:17:28,580
and the red one on the bottom and then

373
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:34,159
it's a zero one or the other way round

374
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:39,199
and get to a stream of bits that's all

375
00:17:34,159 --> 00:17:41,240
we want it so looks nice in the pictures

376
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:45,620
and in theory but how do you take a

377
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:48,559
computer do this well that was a lot of

378
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:51,768
work and back at the 32 C 3 we had

379
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:53,450
something implemented in Python so it we

380
00:17:51,769 --> 00:17:55,850
prototyped all of this stuff in python

381
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:57,169
it took us roughly I guess one and a

382
00:17:55,850 --> 00:18:00,529
half years or something like that

383
00:17:57,169 --> 00:18:02,600
and what we had done was so the STR code

384
00:18:00,529 --> 00:18:05,690
and you put everything into the F of T

385
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:07,879
there's a birth detector which just

386
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:09,409
looks for the energy and then I

387
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:12,730
mentioned you look for the energy and

388
00:18:09,409 --> 00:18:15,860
then you cut something out of the signal

389
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:19,789
these cuts were put into a queue but

390
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:22,309
every single one of these cut was

391
00:18:19,789 --> 00:18:28,129
roughly one megabyte of data so you get

392
00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:33,158
a whole lot of potential iridium friends

393
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:36,380
in here and then it fans out into a a

394
00:18:33,159 --> 00:18:38,120
chain of filters and estimators the down

395
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:43,340
mixer who was just doing you know

396
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:46,760
shifting it over and removing all of the

397
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:48,320
excess data finding the start and

398
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:53,360
everything and then just D modulating

399
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:55,639
the data to very end so we were doing to

400
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:57,510
do we were able to do about two

401
00:18:55,639 --> 00:19:00,389
megahertz of spectrum you

402
00:18:57,510 --> 00:19:06,060
this and not that ten megahertz that

403
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:08,820
iridium actually uses so I sat down and

404
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:12,030
thought okay probably it's a good idea

405
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:14,730
to really implement this in C++ new

406
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:18,180
radio because while python is really

407
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:19,860
nice to prototype things it's and it's

408
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:23,520
still not the fastest thing to work with

409
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:26,219
even with numpy and also what's very

410
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:27,960
nice about the new radio is ya ecosystem

411
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:31,920
so you get things like the Osmo comm

412
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:35,310
source well in this picture the SDR is

413
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:40,110
actually plugged into this thing by a

414
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:43,379
unix pipe and it's rtl-sdr pipe Python

415
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:47,219
script no radio offers you real

416
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:49,950
integration with good STRs which also

417
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:53,550
can do more so it was a pretty easy

418
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:54,900
decision to to go for it though the

419
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:57,510
thing is that no radio

420
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:59,510
it doesn't really want to work with the

421
00:19:57,510 --> 00:20:06,570
stuff we are working with to work with

422
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:10,020
constant streams of things it it comes

423
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:13,500
from a world where you have an analog

424
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:15,360
dream of boys or TV signals or something

425
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,870
like that and it just goes on and on and

426
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:20,429
on

427
00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:21,600
though Iridium birthday change in

428
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:24,090
frequency they're there they're not

429
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:27,659
there and you don't want to run 240

430
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:31,470
decoders all the time especially also

431
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:32,570
with the Doppler shift so this wasn't

432
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:35,130
that easy

433
00:20:32,570 --> 00:20:37,139
also the blocks which decode stuff

434
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:38,640
actually want to have some data they

435
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:40,620
want to synchronize on it and then they

436
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:42,660
might throw the stuff away but from that

437
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:44,760
point on they can fairly easily decode

438
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:46,470
the rest though that doesn't work for us

439
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:48,540
either because every burst you have to

440
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:54,420
basically decode from the beginning and

441
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:56,190
you cannot throw away data then people

442
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:58,620
who have worked with can radio companion

443
00:20:56,190 --> 00:21:03,180
might know that you have to click a lot

444
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:05,159
and if you want to let's say to the

445
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:07,230
brute force with the 240 channels you

446
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:09,929
have to click 240 things

447
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:12,210
that's not idea so you actually want to

448
00:21:09,929 --> 00:21:15,389
build a flow graph which already was

449
00:21:12,210 --> 00:21:18,539
made out of programmatically and not in

450
00:21:15,389 --> 00:21:21,000
radio and in general it's very high

451
00:21:18,539 --> 00:21:25,169
effort so I would still recommend to not

452
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:27,840
do such a project you ready to begin

453
00:21:25,169 --> 00:21:29,639
with like when you start out but do

454
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:31,230
prototypes in Python and then only when

455
00:21:29,639 --> 00:21:36,149
you know what you actually want to do do

456
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:40,679
a link no radio no the radio has nice

457
00:21:36,149 --> 00:21:43,110
things also I mentioned the stream and

458
00:21:40,679 --> 00:21:46,470
it's made out of samples and but you can

459
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:49,379
add metadata to each sample they they

460
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:51,659
call it tags and this might actually be

461
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:53,519
nice to it say to say okay here's

462
00:21:51,659 --> 00:21:55,830
something starts or it's actually at

463
00:21:53,519 --> 00:21:58,710
this frequency and you can know build

464
00:21:55,830 --> 00:22:02,220
blocks which do stuff and and I have a

465
00:21:58,710 --> 00:22:05,309
bit of a bit of intelligence in there

466
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:07,169
and then a stream comes out of it still

467
00:22:05,309 --> 00:22:08,639
a constant stream but at least it

468
00:22:07,169 --> 00:22:11,340
contains some information about what's

469
00:22:08,639 --> 00:22:14,158
going on in the stream and then it also

470
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:18,510
has the concept of PDUs and apdu

471
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:22,950
is not a stream anymore it's more packet

472
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:25,620
based it can be arbitrary data in there

473
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:28,110
but usually would put in a block of

474
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:32,610
samples and then the metadata describing

475
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:35,490
what's in this samples and they're

476
00:22:32,610 --> 00:22:37,590
important also that is that memory gives

477
00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:39,360
you access to lots of digital signal

478
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:39,990
processing algorithms which are pretty

479
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,889
fast

480
00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:46,649
especially the falk library which

481
00:22:42,889 --> 00:22:48,120
directly helps you to optimize things

482
00:22:46,649 --> 00:22:50,518
because it looks at your architecture of

483
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:52,199
your machine and it chooses to the

484
00:22:50,519 --> 00:22:55,440
optimal algorithm for your machine so it

485
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:58,039
might use some AVX instructions here and

486
00:22:55,440 --> 00:23:00,090
just the MMX instructions over there

487
00:22:58,039 --> 00:23:02,269
which is really nice and you don't have

488
00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:06,480
to think about this anymore

489
00:23:02,269 --> 00:23:08,669
so after 32 C 3 we started to work on gr

490
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:11,269
idiom or basically I started to port

491
00:23:08,669 --> 00:23:14,010
whatever we had in Python over there and

492
00:23:11,269 --> 00:23:16,379
yes some people took it up and also

493
00:23:14,010 --> 00:23:18,350
wrote some nice UIs for it so you can

494
00:23:16,379 --> 00:23:20,809
see what's going on

495
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:24,860
make statistics for it and it took

496
00:23:20,809 --> 00:23:26,690
roughly three months to to get it

497
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:30,500
working so it was much quicker than

498
00:23:26,690 --> 00:23:36,770
prototyping in Python but steep learning

499
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:41,990
curve still so this is a very basic flow

500
00:23:36,770 --> 00:23:43,760
graph which is implemented in G iridium

501
00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:46,520
so you first have the f50 burst tagger

502
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:50,030
this thing looks for the peaks and the

503
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:53,179
signal it marks them then this block is

504
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:56,330
only responsible to cut things out of

505
00:23:53,179 --> 00:23:58,940
the stream produce PDUs which go over

506
00:23:56,330 --> 00:24:02,090
here this whole block does all the

507
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:03,559
moving and decimating and filtering and

508
00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:05,720
looking for the stuff and all of this

509
00:24:03,559 --> 00:24:08,330
stuff so it's the most complex block of

510
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:12,140
all of these and it out put some more

511
00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:14,510
PDUs into the QPSK d modulator which

512
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:16,669
basically just does the I'm okay where's

513
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:20,360
the red line was the blue line and I'll

514
00:24:16,669 --> 00:24:21,770
put something on the standardout so

515
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:25,178
we're going to look at these different

516
00:24:21,770 --> 00:24:29,330
blocks first year 50 burst tagger then

517
00:24:25,179 --> 00:24:32,929
okay first tagger so what you do is do

518
00:24:29,330 --> 00:24:35,770
an FFT and how an FFT works is you put

519
00:24:32,929 --> 00:24:39,049
in let's say a thousand 24 samples and

520
00:24:35,770 --> 00:24:41,059
then it tells you okay you gave me a

521
00:24:39,049 --> 00:24:44,510
thousand 24 samples I'll give you on my

522
00:24:41,059 --> 00:24:46,549
output 1024 frequencies and I'll tell

523
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:50,090
you how much energy is in which

524
00:24:46,549 --> 00:24:52,639
frequency we build an average out of

525
00:24:50,090 --> 00:24:54,620
that so we know roughly where's our

526
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:56,360
noise floor are there any constant

527
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:58,699
transmitters in the region because we

528
00:24:56,360 --> 00:25:00,979
don't want to trigger all the time on to

529
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:03,320
some interference which is coming from

530
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:05,390
unnatural some cell tower something I'll

531
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:07,700
get which is constantly there so we just

532
00:25:05,390 --> 00:25:10,730
take an average it gives us an idea of

533
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:12,799
what does our environment look like and

534
00:25:10,730 --> 00:25:16,840
what we also feed it into the energy

535
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:19,730
detection it just compares the instant

536
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:21,530
FFT against the average and if the

537
00:25:19,730 --> 00:25:26,570
instant goes above the average we have a

538
00:25:21,530 --> 00:25:28,460
peak all it does then is okay the sample

539
00:25:26,570 --> 00:25:31,850
where the peak gets detected gets tagged

540
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:34,970
with roughly which frequency is it

541
00:25:31,850 --> 00:25:37,669
and which purse was detected and down

542
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:40,310
here we also have a block which bypasses

543
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:41,690
this stuff this is just a delay block so

544
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:43,820
this stuff looks a little bit in the

545
00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:47,060
future and this is what actually then

546
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:51,530
comes out of the end of this finger it

547
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:55,629
means that the burst can happen it can

548
00:25:51,530 --> 00:25:58,670
rise we detect it somewhere and then

549
00:25:55,630 --> 00:26:00,740
when the d light signal comes along over

550
00:25:58,670 --> 00:26:04,430
here we can actually say okay roughly

551
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:05,720
here was the beginning let's tag it what

552
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:07,540
comes out of this thing these are the

553
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:12,230
only lines of code you'll see in here

554
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:15,260
except for the other blocks as well we

555
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:18,020
give it an ID so the whole thing can be

556
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:20,270
checked through the whole flow graph

557
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:22,910
this is good for debugging but it also

558
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:24,530
helps in sorting the stuff later on it

559
00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:26,150
will tell you roughly what was the

560
00:26:24,530 --> 00:26:29,360
frequency where's the center frequency

561
00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:32,660
of the signal how strong was the burst

562
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:35,149
and at which temper it was this taken

563
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:38,210
and if the burst has gone again we just

564
00:26:35,150 --> 00:26:42,650
say okay this ID which we've found over

565
00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:43,130
here is away so that the next block down

566
00:26:42,650 --> 00:26:48,170
there

567
00:26:43,130 --> 00:26:50,180
the burst tagger can say okay if the the

568
00:26:48,170 --> 00:26:51,770
ID comes in I start collecting samples

569
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:54,530
and if the ID goes out I'll stop

570
00:26:51,770 --> 00:26:56,960
collecting samples and I just published

571
00:26:54,530 --> 00:27:00,110
apdu over here this is pretty simple it

572
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:02,600
just keeps a list of currently active

573
00:27:00,110 --> 00:27:03,530
bursts and multiple bursts can be active

574
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:06,469
at the same time on different

575
00:27:03,530 --> 00:27:07,970
frequencies so you have a list of bursts

576
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:10,790
multiple ones which are active at the

577
00:27:07,970 --> 00:27:13,430
same time and when one of them goes out

578
00:27:10,790 --> 00:27:15,950
it just spits out the PDU over here

579
00:27:13,430 --> 00:27:20,090
don't you do burst Dominic's

580
00:27:15,950 --> 00:27:22,190
so it keeps the ID and basically all of

581
00:27:20,090 --> 00:27:26,290
the other stuff the only thing it

582
00:27:22,190 --> 00:27:29,660
inserts is an offset and the offset is

583
00:27:26,290 --> 00:27:34,700
basically a timestamp how many samples

584
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:37,280
into the stream is this PDU old the

585
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:43,220
burst on mix now is the more complex

586
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:44,450
thing you do a see if oh that's the

587
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:47,560
center frequency of

588
00:27:44,450 --> 00:27:52,210
estimation is just the initial f of T

589
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:55,179
then the decimation finding the start

590
00:27:52,210 --> 00:27:57,770
doing the fine centre frequency offset

591
00:27:55,180 --> 00:28:00,550
we square the signal here which means we

592
00:27:57,770 --> 00:28:02,210
multiplied by itself that's useful for

593
00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:05,350
uplink signals

594
00:28:02,210 --> 00:28:10,630
applix anchors have a slightly different

595
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:14,840
preamble and it consists of two tones

596
00:28:10,630 --> 00:28:16,190
but if you square the signal out comes a

597
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:18,860
single tone that's how the math works

598
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:21,710
and it works both for uplink as well as

599
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:23,060
downlink which is nice for us because we

600
00:28:21,710 --> 00:28:25,480
don't have to distinguish between them

601
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:29,149
anymore here you can just square it

602
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:32,150
rotate a little bit more other pattern

603
00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:36,740
to the to the middle then we can look at

604
00:28:32,150 --> 00:28:37,970
is it an uplink or downlink and blah

605
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:40,630
blah blah do all the stuff I've

606
00:28:37,970 --> 00:28:52,880
mentioned before publish a burst and say

607
00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:56,690
okay I'm done with this burst yes I'm

608
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:59,480
not sure I have to look at the code but

609
00:28:56,690 --> 00:29:02,480
probably yes oh it's it's a complex

610
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:03,890
multiplication right you have these inq

611
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:05,450
signals you treat them as complex

612
00:29:03,890 --> 00:29:07,220
numbers you just do a complex

613
00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:10,730
multiplication of I thank you that's

614
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:13,700
what's happening they're saying done

615
00:29:10,730 --> 00:29:16,400
over here is pretty important just

616
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:19,160
quickly go back over here there's a back

617
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:23,330
channel here it's this arrow which goes

618
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:25,820
over here because your new radio keeps a

619
00:29:23,330 --> 00:29:29,810
cue between this output and this input

620
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:32,389
and there's no limits to it and the

621
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:34,340
sender can actually not see how much is

622
00:29:32,390 --> 00:29:36,350
on my output how much of this stuff has

623
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:38,030
already been processed and if you don't

624
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:39,740
have a back channel you just fill up

625
00:29:38,030 --> 00:29:42,530
this cue you fill up all your RAM and

626
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:45,770
suddenly your machine freezes great so

627
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:47,720
this this part over here which goes back

628
00:29:45,770 --> 00:29:51,020
there just signals hey I'm done you can

629
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:52,640
count that one of you out the PDU zip

630
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:56,150
code on your output has been processed

631
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:59,090
and if you want to

632
00:29:56,150 --> 00:30:01,250
limit the number of birth switches in

633
00:29:59,090 --> 00:30:02,840
this queue over here that's the only way

634
00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:05,300
you can do it so right now for example

635
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:10,490
this produces maximum 500 outstanding

636
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:12,590
births okay what's coming out of the

637
00:30:10,490 --> 00:30:14,210
birthstone mix then you have the

638
00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:17,030
separate it might have changed because

639
00:30:14,210 --> 00:30:19,130
we did some decimation center frequency

640
00:30:17,030 --> 00:30:21,800
stays the same direction tells you if

641
00:30:19,130 --> 00:30:25,250
it's an uplink or downlink it tells you

642
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:29,000
exactly where is the first sample where

643
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:31,490
the unique identifier starts and offset

644
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:35,240
is still an indication of how old or at

645
00:30:31,490 --> 00:30:40,600
which time this did this frame appear in

646
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:45,560
the stream the QPSK the modulator first

647
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:52,060
decimates the data and it decimates it

648
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:54,379
to one sample per symbol that means I

649
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:57,379
mean you're only interested in is the I

650
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:59,120
computer I component hi and the q

651
00:30:57,380 --> 00:31:00,410
component law or the other way around or

652
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:03,050
they both or both hi

653
00:31:00,410 --> 00:31:05,060
you don't need many samples to do that

654
00:31:03,050 --> 00:31:09,260
but for the signal processing and to

655
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:14,200
look at at the signal as a human it's

656
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:17,480
nice to have more points in between so

657
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:19,010
while you have these you know you can

658
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:21,800
see this thing goes down there's lots of

659
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:23,780
points and it goes up again actually

660
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:26,419
these points here in the middle or these

661
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:28,070
samples are not of value they don't have

662
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:30,110
any additional information you're

663
00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:32,149
actually only interested in okay over

664
00:31:30,110 --> 00:31:35,000
here here and here you because you can

665
00:31:32,150 --> 00:31:37,580
see that there's some periodicity to it

666
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:40,670
and you only need to sample this sample

667
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:42,439
this sample in this sample so the first

668
00:31:40,670 --> 00:31:47,680
thing we do is we throw away everything

669
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:51,740
else but how do you actually figure out

670
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:56,630
which one of these is now where is the

671
00:31:51,740 --> 00:32:00,500
right point to sample and that was told

672
00:31:56,630 --> 00:32:01,970
to us by this unique word start thinking

673
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:04,280
that comes out of the birthstone mix it

674
00:32:01,970 --> 00:32:06,110
tells us like exactly which sample is it

675
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:08,270
that we should start with and then you

676
00:32:06,110 --> 00:32:09,860
know exactly okay it starts over here

677
00:32:08,270 --> 00:32:12,410
and we know exactly our sample

678
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:14,990
right so you know what this this this in

679
00:32:12,410 --> 00:32:18,920
this sample anything else we can throw

680
00:32:14,990 --> 00:32:20,870
away then we remove any remaining

681
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:24,230
frequency offset and here I have to say

682
00:32:20,870 --> 00:32:28,729
that most of the stuff we do here you

683
00:32:24,230 --> 00:32:30,470
could do quite differently it's just the

684
00:32:28,730 --> 00:32:33,770
easiest way we came up we have to do it

685
00:32:30,470 --> 00:32:35,480
and a real receiver wouldn't do it like

686
00:32:33,770 --> 00:32:38,270
that and I'll quickly talk at the end

687
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:40,370
what a real receiver wouldn't do here so

688
00:32:38,270 --> 00:32:43,549
we removed the frequency offset and I

689
00:32:40,370 --> 00:32:45,860
mentioned that the samples you can draw

690
00:32:43,549 --> 00:32:49,250
on the complex plane and a perfect QPSK

691
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:53,209
signal will just do this it just wanders

692
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:55,040
around on these four points and we've

693
00:32:53,210 --> 00:32:56,510
decimated it already to one sample per

694
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:58,428
symbol so we just look at each one of

695
00:32:56,510 --> 00:33:02,330
them after each other and you can say

696
00:32:58,429 --> 00:33:04,940
okay so it starts with one one one zero

697
00:33:02,330 --> 00:33:09,049
zero one zero zero fine everything

698
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:11,600
perfect but if there's a frequency

699
00:33:09,049 --> 00:33:14,690
offset what's happening is this your

700
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:17,110
point starts rotate it doesn't reach

701
00:33:14,690 --> 00:33:19,370
this point anymore perfectly but it

702
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:21,620
rotates a little bit on the on the

703
00:33:19,370 --> 00:33:23,870
circle and every time there's a sample

704
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:26,449
it rotates a little bit more up until

705
00:33:23,870 --> 00:33:28,969
the point where it actually one of us

706
00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:30,710
from this quadrant over to this quadrant

707
00:33:28,970 --> 00:33:32,360
and now your decoder will probably say

708
00:33:30,710 --> 00:33:35,750
this is another one one anymore this is

709
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:43,668
a zero one and everything you do will be

710
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:46,760
scrutinized take you look at your your

711
00:33:43,669 --> 00:33:50,120
sample and you say okay it's over here

712
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:53,360
but it's in this quadrant so I'll just

713
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:57,439
note that this was around 20 degrees off

714
00:33:53,360 --> 00:34:01,309
and just remember that and the next time

715
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:03,200
a symbol comes in which is the red one

716
00:34:01,309 --> 00:34:05,450
over here I I know already I have to

717
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:09,080
rotate it by roughly 20 degrees you get

718
00:34:05,450 --> 00:34:11,030
yellow symbol and then you look again at

719
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:14,239
which quadrant is it okay it's this

720
00:34:11,030 --> 00:34:16,909
quadrant I know know by looking at the

721
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:20,658
distance on these two it's 40 degrees

722
00:34:16,909 --> 00:34:22,940
off and you do this over and over so in

723
00:34:20,659 --> 00:34:23,480
the end you you get a signal which has

724
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:24,830
been caught

725
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:26,690
directed in terms of frequency you get

726
00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:30,520
perfect symbols they're always at the

727
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:30,520
right 45-degree angle

728
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:37,639
next thing is to demodulate the D and

729
00:34:34,429 --> 00:34:40,609
the D QPSK that the Radian sense so so

730
00:34:37,639 --> 00:34:43,690
far we've always talked about QPSK but

731
00:34:40,609 --> 00:34:47,779
iridium actually sends differential QPSK

732
00:34:43,690 --> 00:34:49,190
what does this mean it's actually the

733
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:51,500
transition from one point to another

734
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:54,649
point which could base the information

735
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:57,139
so if this point goes over here to zero

736
00:34:54,649 --> 00:34:59,330
one if it goes over here it's one zero

737
00:34:57,139 --> 00:35:00,890
and the nice thing about this is that if

738
00:34:59,330 --> 00:35:05,660
even if you rotate the whole thing

739
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:07,580
that's about 90 degrees if it goes over

740
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:10,118
here it's still a zero one if it goes

741
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:12,710
over here it's still a one zero

742
00:35:10,119 --> 00:35:17,680
this is useful if you don't actually

743
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:25,150
know which way it's oriented right now

744
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:28,009
we in our flow graph don't need to do it

745
00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:30,050
actually because we rotate everything

746
00:35:28,010 --> 00:35:32,600
already in the birthstone mixer but a

747
00:35:30,050 --> 00:35:34,940
real receiver actually doesn't have to

748
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:37,220
do the frequency offset removal it just

749
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:40,040
has to look at how is this thing jumping

750
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:42,529
around it doesn't need to do the first

751
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:46,970
step there but for whatever reason we

752
00:35:42,530 --> 00:35:51,140
decided to remove the frequency offset

753
00:35:46,970 --> 00:35:55,250
and demodulate the DQ SP just in on a

754
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:57,770
bit level basically it has the advantage

755
00:35:55,250 --> 00:36:00,050
that if you look at it a signal which

756
00:35:57,770 --> 00:36:03,650
passes between these two blocks it's

757
00:36:00,050 --> 00:36:05,240
easy to say with your pure eyes that

758
00:36:03,650 --> 00:36:07,640
okay this is an iridium signal I know

759
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:10,310
what it's doing that's the only reason

760
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:13,040
why I did it this way so what comes out

761
00:36:10,310 --> 00:36:14,570
of this thing it converts the offset

762
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:17,420
into an actual timestamp in milliseconds

763
00:36:14,570 --> 00:36:19,250
you get the center frequency again the

764
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:21,619
ID which came out of the stuff it gives

765
00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:26,619
you a confidence and the confidence is

766
00:36:21,619 --> 00:36:29,060
directly based on this stuff so if the

767
00:36:26,619 --> 00:36:31,369
you have to receive symbols

768
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:34,060
straight too far away from the ideal

769
00:36:31,369 --> 00:36:35,890
position we lower the confidence

770
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:37,810
and you can usually see that with

771
00:36:35,890 --> 00:36:43,150
signals which on that strong anymore

772
00:36:37,810 --> 00:36:46,390
that the confidence goes down we give it

773
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:48,370
a percentage and a 100% confidence tells

774
00:36:46,390 --> 00:36:50,410
you that the similar was always very

775
00:36:48,370 --> 00:36:53,170
close to the ideal position and when the

776
00:36:50,410 --> 00:36:54,460
confidence goes down you know there was

777
00:36:53,170 --> 00:36:56,850
lots of noise on there and it didn't

778
00:36:54,460 --> 00:37:01,240
work that well anymore

779
00:36:56,850 --> 00:37:03,759
now the flow graph you saw before

780
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:06,069
basically looks like this you have the

781
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:07,930
source you have to birth stagger you

782
00:37:06,070 --> 00:37:10,810
have to birth to pee dude and that's the

783
00:37:07,930 --> 00:37:15,069
internal radio piu burst on mixer QP is

784
00:37:10,810 --> 00:37:17,500
keyed QPSK D mod and wipe new radio

785
00:37:15,070 --> 00:37:22,350
gives every single block of these its

786
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:28,270
own thread this flow graph will only

787
00:37:22,350 --> 00:37:29,589
give you roughly two cores will max out

788
00:37:28,270 --> 00:37:32,020
roughly two course on your machine

789
00:37:29,590 --> 00:37:33,850
because mainly the burst I'll mix over

790
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:37,990
here will limit everything it's the most

791
00:37:33,850 --> 00:37:40,779
complex block and it will just take one

792
00:37:37,990 --> 00:37:45,520
core to constantly spin and the rest

793
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:47,650
doesn't nothing so we fought back to our

794
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:50,590
patent which and how do we how did we do

795
00:37:47,650 --> 00:37:53,080
it there yeah well you just have

796
00:37:50,590 --> 00:37:55,120
multiple bursts down mix the queue

797
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:56,860
before it stays the same and they can

798
00:37:55,120 --> 00:38:00,940
all share the same QP skin-deep what

799
00:37:56,860 --> 00:38:03,820
this works but the problem is that at

800
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:05,770
this point over here you get enormous

801
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:07,300
amounts of data because the FFT bursts

802
00:38:05,770 --> 00:38:08,820
agar every time there's a burst and it

803
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:17,050
can be multiple burst at the same time

804
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:19,090
issues some some PDU and you easily get

805
00:38:17,050 --> 00:38:21,360
over 10 gigabits per second of data of

806
00:38:19,090 --> 00:38:24,070
just flowing between your course now and

807
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:27,250
I believe that boss flowing down

808
00:38:24,070 --> 00:38:28,410
everything here button radio has a nice

809
00:38:27,250 --> 00:38:32,290
component

810
00:38:28,410 --> 00:38:34,690
it's the qualifies Channel Iser which

811
00:38:32,290 --> 00:38:37,270
will help us hear a lot that was also

812
00:38:34,690 --> 00:38:40,690
one of the reasons we chose can radio

813
00:38:37,270 --> 00:38:42,640
because to make use of this component

814
00:38:40,690 --> 00:38:50,170
I'll give you a quick demo of what this

815
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:54,848
thing does it's a very cheap way in

816
00:38:50,170 --> 00:38:58,319
terms of computational effort to split a

817
00:38:54,849 --> 00:39:00,730
single stream into multiple streams so

818
00:38:58,319 --> 00:39:04,890
down here I've a signal at zero Hertz

819
00:39:00,730 --> 00:39:07,299
and up there is free different channels

820
00:39:04,890 --> 00:39:10,450
which are the output of the filter Bank

821
00:39:07,299 --> 00:39:13,390
and if I move to signal it moves from

822
00:39:10,450 --> 00:39:15,279
one of these outputs to another output

823
00:39:13,390 --> 00:39:18,279
and you can see that each of these

824
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:21,430
outputs has now one third of the width

825
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:30,910
of the original input signal which makes

826
00:39:21,430 --> 00:39:33,308
it very nice as it allows us to put all

827
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:35,410
of the stuff on each of these outputs

828
00:39:33,309 --> 00:39:38,280
but each output has a lower sample rate

829
00:39:35,410 --> 00:39:41,379
there's less data so if you take a one

830
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:44,440
millisecond span of samples over here

831
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:47,500
you have just one-fifth of the data on a

832
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:49,930
one millisecond sample span of samples

833
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:52,950
over here which lowers a lot the the

834
00:39:49,930 --> 00:39:56,230
data rate between the different course

835
00:39:52,950 --> 00:40:00,240
though a bit of a problem is that the

836
00:39:56,230 --> 00:40:03,160
this filter Bank it has very sharp edges

837
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:06,129
we know though that the Doppler shift

838
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:08,319
can just fall between different channels

839
00:40:06,130 --> 00:40:10,270
so if you have sharp edges on these

840
00:40:08,319 --> 00:40:12,038
channels you might have a signal or a

841
00:40:10,270 --> 00:40:15,130
purse which falls between two channels

842
00:40:12,039 --> 00:40:16,690
and it will get lost because one part of

843
00:40:15,130 --> 00:40:20,020
is one channel and the other part is in

844
00:40:16,690 --> 00:40:22,119
the other channel so what do you do the

845
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:25,150
nice thing is here you can have an

846
00:40:22,119 --> 00:40:30,369
overlap you can design these two filters

847
00:40:25,150 --> 00:40:32,849
in a way that are these two channels

848
00:40:30,369 --> 00:40:32,849
that

849
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:50,339
so same thing again it is signal if I

850
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:59,609
move it over here it starts I move the

851
00:40:50,340 --> 00:41:02,310
wrong slider parameter is wrong okay so

852
00:40:59,610 --> 00:41:03,780
if I move this the signal around you can

853
00:41:02,310 --> 00:41:06,210
see in the middle in the stream it it

854
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:08,760
moves to the left as usual but here it

855
00:41:06,210 --> 00:41:10,350
starts to appear already over here and

856
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:12,530
if you imagine that this thing was a

857
00:41:10,350 --> 00:41:15,960
little bit wider few kilohertz white

858
00:41:12,530 --> 00:41:18,960
it's already in reach of this channel

859
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:21,930
and about to go out on this channel and

860
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:23,340
this is how we can decode stuff which

861
00:41:21,930 --> 00:41:25,640
has a Doppler shift it will just

862
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:28,890
potentially decode on multiple channels

863
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:34,350
but it will for sure decode and later on

864
00:41:28,890 --> 00:41:36,359
we just throw away two duplicates I'm

865
00:41:34,350 --> 00:41:37,799
not going to go about the design of

866
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:41,790
these things because we don't have time

867
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:43,350
for that but this is how it looks now we

868
00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:46,700
have two FFT bursts and then it goes

869
00:41:43,350 --> 00:41:50,970
dark in the poly face channel Iser and

870
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:52,710
which outputs a number of streams often

871
00:41:50,970 --> 00:41:55,649
having slightly lower sample rates and

872
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:59,610
now we only are around at free gigabits

873
00:41:55,650 --> 00:42:02,700
per second between these two blocks and

874
00:41:59,610 --> 00:42:05,880
this now allows us to on a single cone

875
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:11,520
sorry for core machine from 2010 decode

876
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:15,650
the whole band so we feed it with a 10

877
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:18,390
megahertz white signal and it produces

878
00:42:15,650 --> 00:42:21,900
in its peak up to a thousand to two

879
00:42:18,390 --> 00:42:24,509
thousand actual video frames and 20 to

880
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:28,500
25 millions per day this is what we see

881
00:42:24,510 --> 00:42:31,740
in Munich I could imagine that in a more

882
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:33,890
busy area let's say a harbor or

883
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:36,089
close to the coast you would see more

884
00:42:33,890 --> 00:42:40,109
dependent what's going on it's pretty

885
00:42:36,090 --> 00:42:43,830
much exactly making use of the four

886
00:42:40,110 --> 00:42:45,570
cores and still sometimes overflows but

887
00:42:43,830 --> 00:42:48,509
very seldomly at least for some UNIX

888
00:42:45,570 --> 00:42:50,970
zone good enough for us and anyone who

889
00:42:48,510 --> 00:42:54,810
wants to have a bit more performance can

890
00:42:50,970 --> 00:43:02,459
just buy now buy more cores right so

891
00:42:54,810 --> 00:43:05,810
that's fine looking into the future this

892
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:08,520
approach will have its drawbacks

893
00:43:05,810 --> 00:43:12,390
iridium next we'll have new modulation

894
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:15,540
types there's a few FCC documents which

895
00:43:12,390 --> 00:43:19,618
which describe death and they are

896
00:43:15,540 --> 00:43:24,690
talking about up to 240 kilo symbols per

897
00:43:19,619 --> 00:43:26,730
second so right now we are over here we

898
00:43:24,690 --> 00:43:29,250
are 25 kilo symbols per second that is

899
00:43:26,730 --> 00:43:32,150
what iridium on a single channel at the

900
00:43:29,250 --> 00:43:35,790
moment and they're talking about roughly

901
00:43:32,150 --> 00:43:37,950
times 10 over here and bit of an issue

902
00:43:35,790 --> 00:43:40,170
is that our current twitch and it does

903
00:43:37,950 --> 00:43:41,939
not track the connections so it just

904
00:43:40,170 --> 00:43:44,580
assumes everything which comes down as a

905
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:47,850
burst is that 25 kilo samples per second

906
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:49,170
Oh pillow symbols per second and tries

907
00:43:47,850 --> 00:43:50,960
it and if it doesn't work it doesn't

908
00:43:49,170 --> 00:43:54,210
work if it work it's fine

909
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:56,010
but iridium next we'll have new

910
00:43:54,210 --> 00:43:58,770
modulations and the con torch and will

911
00:43:56,010 --> 00:44:01,470
not know how to deal with them nor will

912
00:43:58,770 --> 00:44:03,690
it know that a specific traffic channel

913
00:44:01,470 --> 00:44:05,899
maybe from some satellite actually is on

914
00:44:03,690 --> 00:44:09,000
this new modulation

915
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:11,430
we'll have to see it's not life yet I

916
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:14,340
haven't seen any iridium next frame on

917
00:44:11,430 --> 00:44:18,359
the air yet but the moment at least they

918
00:44:14,340 --> 00:44:24,059
will be any unique bubbles but they have

919
00:44:18,359 --> 00:44:27,359
looked at that what else so

920
00:44:24,059 --> 00:44:33,779
you can spend an enormous amount of time

921
00:44:27,359 --> 00:44:36,299
on the stock also there's there's dozens

922
00:44:33,779 --> 00:44:41,910
of services on the iridium and we had to

923
00:44:36,299 --> 00:44:45,239
look at voice data pagers SMS the GSM

924
00:44:41,910 --> 00:44:47,699
layer there but there are still lots of

925
00:44:45,239 --> 00:44:49,079
stuff we don't know about we have no

926
00:44:47,699 --> 00:44:50,519
intention of looking at this stuff

927
00:44:49,079 --> 00:44:52,829
anymore because it's just like you know

928
00:44:50,519 --> 00:44:54,959
one more service one more niche thing

929
00:44:52,829 --> 00:44:58,439
that the radio reports though there's

930
00:44:54,959 --> 00:45:02,549
one thing and that's iridium burst which

931
00:44:58,439 --> 00:45:04,890
is going to oh I think it's active I'm

932
00:45:02,549 --> 00:45:07,829
not 100% sure it's a one-way

933
00:45:04,890 --> 00:45:12,239
communication channel again where you

934
00:45:07,829 --> 00:45:14,430
might have a burst which is global where

935
00:45:12,239 --> 00:45:16,019
you can save from your web browser or

936
00:45:14,430 --> 00:45:18,808
somewhere I want to send down this

937
00:45:16,019 --> 00:45:22,948
signal across the whole planet and every

938
00:45:18,809 --> 00:45:24,930
receiver which is authorized to receive

939
00:45:22,949 --> 00:45:26,789
it should receive it and know do

940
00:45:24,930 --> 00:45:30,328
something or display something we call

941
00:45:26,789 --> 00:45:32,609
it the radium burst they in fact over

942
00:45:30,329 --> 00:45:34,679
here say only authorized devices

943
00:45:32,609 --> 00:45:37,788
belonging to the specified recipient

944
00:45:34,679 --> 00:45:41,369
group can unscramble the transmission

945
00:45:37,789 --> 00:45:45,209
unscramble so I don't read decrypt or

946
00:45:41,369 --> 00:45:46,890
anything like that here I'd really love

947
00:45:45,209 --> 00:45:48,779
to get my hands on an Iridium burst

948
00:45:46,890 --> 00:45:51,598
device and see what it does so if anyone

949
00:45:48,779 --> 00:45:53,099
you know works in the field and has

950
00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:56,269
access to this stuff or can make a

951
00:45:53,099 --> 00:46:00,420
recording we would be very interested

952
00:45:56,269 --> 00:46:01,859
the application like whoever uses this

953
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:04,859
stuff must have very interesting

954
00:46:01,859 --> 00:46:08,189
applications I'm sure all right

955
00:46:04,859 --> 00:46:09,900
and then make it just something which I

956
00:46:08,189 --> 00:46:12,299
gave this talk already once in Germany

957
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:16,739
and someone mentioned hey why don't you

958
00:46:12,299 --> 00:46:18,329
you know you could do these polyphase

959
00:46:16,739 --> 00:46:20,189
filter banks we've lost a lot of

960
00:46:18,329 --> 00:46:22,549
channels and maybe have one pure

961
00:46:20,189 --> 00:46:24,928
satellite and just track the satellite

962
00:46:22,549 --> 00:46:27,140
we're not doing this here

963
00:46:24,929 --> 00:46:29,429
but it would be certainly a possibility

964
00:46:27,140 --> 00:46:30,779
we're not tracking any kind of Doppler

965
00:46:29,429 --> 00:46:33,390
shift here like we were treating

966
00:46:30,779 --> 00:46:35,069
reversed equal and no matter from which

967
00:46:33,390 --> 00:46:38,489
satellite it's coming and which

968
00:46:35,069 --> 00:46:41,308
kind of dopplers it has but I could

969
00:46:38,489 --> 00:46:43,319
imagine just a completely different

970
00:46:41,309 --> 00:46:46,380
layout of this thing which is more

971
00:46:43,319 --> 00:46:48,269
efficient and can track multiple

972
00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:50,549
satellites at the same time using these

973
00:46:48,269 --> 00:47:05,629
polar phase filter banks but we just

974
00:46:50,549 --> 00:47:05,630
didn't alright so questions yeah

975
00:47:41,020 --> 00:47:47,320
okay so the question is about basically

976
00:47:44,330 --> 00:47:51,140
predicting the Doppler shift so can we

977
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:52,720
use additional information which is not

978
00:47:51,140 --> 00:47:55,129
what we received from the satellites to

979
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:58,580
predict what kind of Doppler shift a

980
00:47:55,130 --> 00:48:03,250
satellite will health and yes you can do

981
00:47:58,580 --> 00:48:05,509
that for sure so there is nora tracking

982
00:48:03,250 --> 00:48:10,849
basically every satellite and you get

983
00:48:05,510 --> 00:48:13,099
these two line entries or Tilly's which

984
00:48:10,849 --> 00:48:14,960
you can use together with your current

985
00:48:13,099 --> 00:48:20,450
location to predict how the satellite

986
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:22,040
will move relative to you and that's all

987
00:48:20,450 --> 00:48:24,169
you need to predict the Doppler shift

988
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:26,060
but for that you need to have an

989
00:48:24,170 --> 00:48:28,609
internet connection and after they

990
00:48:26,060 --> 00:48:29,839
Tilly's they measure the satellites I

991
00:48:28,609 --> 00:48:36,348
guess once per day or something like

992
00:48:29,839 --> 00:48:37,640
that and they quickly get outdated but

993
00:48:36,349 --> 00:48:39,609
it would be easy if you just have two

994
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:42,230
Tilly's of all radium satellites you can

995
00:48:39,609 --> 00:48:44,000
directly say okay at this point in time

996
00:48:42,230 --> 00:48:45,290
the satellite will come up to horizon

997
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:48,800
you will have that Doppler shift and

998
00:48:45,290 --> 00:48:52,640
just you know programmatically shift the

999
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:55,099
Doppler shift around absolutely though I

1000
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:57,348
mean I use this stuff every now and then

1001
00:48:55,099 --> 00:48:59,060
you know in a car or or somewhere just

1002
00:48:57,349 --> 00:49:01,940
you know plug the thing turn it on and

1003
00:48:59,060 --> 00:49:03,830
then I want to have some data I don't

1004
00:49:01,940 --> 00:49:05,510
want to get online and get new TVs but

1005
00:49:03,830 --> 00:49:09,230
absolutely that would work so

1006
00:49:05,510 --> 00:49:12,310
specifically for a stationary receiver

1007
00:49:09,230 --> 00:49:12,310
that would work yes

1008
00:49:14,180 --> 00:49:26,480
anyone else again question is if iridium

1009
00:49:22,970 --> 00:49:28,669
NEX is a public standard so none of this

1010
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:31,430
is a public standard neither iridium

1011
00:49:28,670 --> 00:49:33,650
nuridium next it's all proprietary there

1012
00:49:31,430 --> 00:49:37,520
of course are specifications but they

1013
00:49:33,650 --> 00:49:41,420
are kept within iridium everything we

1014
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:43,819
did was based on looking at bits and

1015
00:49:41,420 --> 00:49:47,599
trying to figure out what's going on so

1016
00:49:43,819 --> 00:49:50,808
I do not expect anything coming from the

1017
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:53,150
Iridium cooperation which will detail

1018
00:49:50,809 --> 00:49:56,240
how I redeem next actually works except

1019
00:49:53,150 --> 00:49:59,359
you know anything they they're forced to

1020
00:49:56,240 --> 00:50:02,209
do so this table is out of a rather

1021
00:49:59,359 --> 00:50:04,940
comprehensive PDF which describes the

1022
00:50:02,210 --> 00:50:06,859
beam patterns and the used modulations

1023
00:50:04,940 --> 00:50:09,500
and and stuff like that

1024
00:50:06,859 --> 00:50:11,630
but that's where it ends it never tells

1025
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:15,200
you what's inside there how long are the

1026
00:50:11,630 --> 00:50:19,010
bursts what kind of error correcting

1027
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:22,038
correction is used fun fact also the

1028
00:50:19,010 --> 00:50:25,849
whole internet says that iridium is

1029
00:50:22,039 --> 00:50:28,099
using a convolutional code to protect

1030
00:50:25,849 --> 00:50:29,569
its stuff I mean in terms of error

1031
00:50:28,099 --> 00:50:31,789
correction but that's just plain wrong

1032
00:50:29,569 --> 00:50:34,279
it never does know where maybe between

1033
00:50:31,789 --> 00:50:35,900
satellites but like everyone is copying

1034
00:50:34,279 --> 00:50:40,539
this information from everyone else and

1035
00:50:35,900 --> 00:50:40,539
everyone thinks it's true but just isn't

1036
00:50:50,369 --> 00:50:55,359
which frequency enters a satellite

1037
00:50:53,109 --> 00:50:59,558
communication I'm not sure but it's

1038
00:50:55,359 --> 00:51:11,499
somewhere I'm not sure between 18 and 25

1039
00:50:59,559 --> 00:51:14,859
gigahertz something like that so can can

1040
00:51:11,499 --> 00:51:20,589
we you know listen in on that basically

1041
00:51:14,859 --> 00:51:25,269
at which point we've never tried its I

1042
00:51:20,589 --> 00:51:27,038
you know it's not magic right but I'm

1043
00:51:25,269 --> 00:51:29,140
not sure it depends also on how tight

1044
00:51:27,039 --> 00:51:32,140
their beams are between the satellites

1045
00:51:29,140 --> 00:51:36,069
if you can look basically you know just

1046
00:51:32,140 --> 00:51:40,839
at the horizon and and catch one of

1047
00:51:36,069 --> 00:51:43,299
these beams I don't want to say no it

1048
00:51:40,839 --> 00:51:45,880
also crossed our minds obviously but I

1049
00:51:43,299 --> 00:51:48,630
think it's going to be pretty tough if

1050
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:48,630
possible at all

1051
00:52:03,460 --> 00:52:07,200
was that going to allow you to receive

1052
00:52:05,859 --> 00:52:10,600
more

1053
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:12,490
question is when we went from our Python

1054
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:14,410
implementation which it was already

1055
00:52:12,490 --> 00:52:15,939
paralyzed at that point did like two

1056
00:52:14,410 --> 00:52:21,299
megahertz or tune of megahertz of

1057
00:52:15,940 --> 00:52:25,480
spectrum and moved to the G Iridium one

1058
00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:29,650
how much improvement was there I don't

1059
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:32,170
know anymore to be honest it's easy to

1060
00:52:29,650 --> 00:52:35,850
try you just said decimation to one

1061
00:52:32,170 --> 00:52:42,010
which means no decimation and you get

1062
00:52:35,850 --> 00:52:44,610
like the initial thing I showed but yeah

1063
00:52:42,010 --> 00:52:44,610
I don't know anymore

1064
00:53:09,589 --> 00:53:15,049
question is how much improvement was

1065
00:53:12,210 --> 00:53:19,200
there from going from an rtl-sdr to a

1066
00:53:15,049 --> 00:53:21,390
more professional grade str and what i

1067
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:23,098
can say about that is that at the moment

1068
00:53:21,390 --> 00:53:30,479
we're not using a professional grade str

1069
00:53:23,099 --> 00:53:34,769
at all so we were using the radio batch

1070
00:53:30,479 --> 00:53:38,069
in munich and it's a formidable iridium

1071
00:53:34,769 --> 00:53:41,249
receiver really you are more interested

1072
00:53:38,069 --> 00:53:45,210
in the antenna in fact so this is a

1073
00:53:41,249 --> 00:53:47,720
modified gps antenna with the gps filter

1074
00:53:45,210 --> 00:53:50,759
removed an iridium filter inserted and

1075
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:53,009
also the patch antenna changed to an

1076
00:53:50,759 --> 00:53:54,809
Iridium one and this is the most

1077
00:53:53,009 --> 00:53:57,059
important part of the system it's not so

1078
00:53:54,809 --> 00:53:59,369
much how much dynamic range does you

1079
00:53:57,059 --> 00:54:02,249
receive a half it's more how good is

1080
00:53:59,369 --> 00:54:04,670
your antenna so this thing has 8-bit

1081
00:54:02,249 --> 00:54:08,759
ADCs also just as the RTL SDR has and

1082
00:54:04,670 --> 00:54:11,849
we've tried with a blade RF which has I

1083
00:54:08,759 --> 00:54:14,729
think a 12 bit ADC and it didn't give us

1084
00:54:11,849 --> 00:54:23,640
really significant improvements so

1085
00:54:14,729 --> 00:54:26,868
that's what I can say about that all

1086
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:26,868
right thank you happy hacking

1087
00:54:29,310 --> 00:54:31,370
you
