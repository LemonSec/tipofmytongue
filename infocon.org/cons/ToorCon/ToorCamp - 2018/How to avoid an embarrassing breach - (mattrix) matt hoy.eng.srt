1
00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:04,660
I have the unique pleasure of

2
00:00:02,710 --> 00:00:06,340
introducing another longtime friend of

3
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:09,730
mine and a longtime friend of all of

4
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:11,469
ours here at tour started the day with a

5
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:13,150
longtime friend and closing out the day

6
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:14,800
with a longtime friends so it makes a

7
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:15,460
wonderful set of bookends makes me

8
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:17,680
really happy

9
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:19,420
we've got metrics here talking about

10
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:21,400
data security how to avoid an

11
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:30,039
embarrassing breach so please welcome

12
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:33,129
him to the final talk of the day all

13
00:00:30,039 --> 00:00:36,999
right so I have basically worked in

14
00:00:33,129 --> 00:00:40,239
information security for over 15 years

15
00:00:36,999 --> 00:00:44,760
I've done quite a few interesting things

16
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:49,019
in regard to Incident Response I

17
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:53,318
basically have presented a torque on and

18
00:00:49,019 --> 00:00:56,248
torque on Seattle and derbycon

19
00:00:53,319 --> 00:00:59,729
and layer1 all the good ones so

20
00:00:56,249 --> 00:01:05,680
essentially I'm glad to have been

21
00:00:59,729 --> 00:01:08,979
selected to be the alternate this talk

22
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:12,009
is eventually going to go ahead and

23
00:01:08,979 --> 00:01:15,359
cover data and a lot of people don't

24
00:01:12,009 --> 00:01:19,840
actually think about data as far as how

25
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:23,560
we handle it how expansive it is and

26
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:26,859
things like that so we're going to cover

27
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:29,079
the history of data security the way we

28
00:01:26,859 --> 00:01:32,048
used to do things and why we used to do

29
00:01:29,079 --> 00:01:35,639
them the way that we used to do them a

30
00:01:32,049 --> 00:01:38,140
data security lifecycle data

31
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:45,700
classification and types of data that

32
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:49,780
actually exist so questions are usually

33
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:51,249
brought up I actually get paid quite a

34
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:56,380
lot to go ahead and solve these issues

35
00:01:51,249 --> 00:01:58,719
and how do I solve it there are elements

36
00:01:56,380 --> 00:02:01,270
of data security they're elements in

37
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:03,449
actually all of information security

38
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:08,019
which would be people process and

39
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:11,260
technology so I will also cover the

40
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:13,270
industry standards we will do some

41
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:18,370
threat modeling the tabletop

42
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:20,880
exercises and talk about architecture so

43
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:24,010
why would we need data security

44
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:26,710
essentially a lot of people have now

45
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:30,540
started thinking about data security due

46
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:32,890
to privacy laws gdpr

47
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:34,720
if you guys haven't been paying

48
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:38,649
attention those are all the emails that

49
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:41,740
you've been spammed the thing is is it

50
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:45,010
actually does have some meat behind it

51
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:50,770
and the fact that it wants certain data

52
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:57,399
types actually categorized cataloged and

53
00:02:50,770 --> 00:03:00,580
able to be essentially dealt with so if

54
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:03,580
I'm a European citizen if I want my data

55
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:07,240
deleted I can go ahead and have that

56
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:12,400
data deleted if I am a European citizen

57
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:16,420
and you gave my data to a third party

58
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:18,970
I can ask who you gave my data to so in

59
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:24,070
general knowing what type of data you

60
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:30,190
have and how to catalogue it is pretty

61
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:32,890
good but this is not that talk so it's

62
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:35,109
kind of bad because we all use acronyms

63
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:38,589
and nobody knows what the hell is going

64
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:40,470
on as far as these things here's some

65
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:48,600
real fun ones

66
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:48,600
Dhar dim DLP UBA pH I PII IP

67
00:03:51,000 --> 00:04:00,600
you're gonna know more Darr data rest

68
00:03:56,010 --> 00:04:05,130
dim Dayton motion DLP data loss

69
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:07,530
prevention UVA this UVA is actually

70
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:09,960
supposedly the new hotness when you go

71
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:14,850
ahead and implement it it's user

72
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:16,890
behavioral analysis which uses AI and

73
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:20,579
machine learning which we know doesn't

74
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:21,988
really work that well but essentially

75
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:24,630
what it's supposed to do is it's

76
00:04:21,988 --> 00:04:27,299
supposed to work in tandem with user

77
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:32,070
intent so if I'm stealing all your

78
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:34,200
documents essentially if it's a part of

79
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:37,620
my normal business process and it's a

80
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:41,070
business process that's broken it will

81
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:43,290
attempt to go ahead and if I stick a USB

82
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:46,860
in there and I'm starting to take the

83
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:49,740
secret formula for Coke that should

84
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:52,980
never happen so it's going to actually

85
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:55,560
say what is this document what is this

86
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:57,480
easier doing with this document are they

87
00:04:55,560 --> 00:05:00,690
actually supposed to have access to it

88
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:03,390
and if not it's going to go ahead and

89
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:05,490
kick off flags and somebody should be

90
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:09,210
able to respond to it

91
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:11,300
thi is protected health information PII

92
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:15,000
is personally identifiable information

93
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:24,270
and then we have intellectual property

94
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:28,470
IP so if we go way way way way back the

95
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:32,310
internet ARPANET essentially it was only

96
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:34,710
a concept in 1969 nobody thought that we

97
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:38,190
were going to have the clewd the

98
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:40,919
Internet's and now what and all that

99
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:44,430
stuff ARPANET changed the DARPA net and

100
00:05:40,919 --> 00:05:47,609
back again so we could actually go ahead

101
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:52,440
and spread data with inner connectivity

102
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:54,419
to increase research we kind of also

103
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:56,880
shot ourselves in the foot with that

104
00:05:54,419 --> 00:06:03,840
because now everything as far as data

105
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:04,380
moves around when we ended World War two

106
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:07,469
we

107
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:11,460
actually had a Cold War which was a lot

108
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:13,440
of research and development and since we

109
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:16,739
could actually transfer this data back

110
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:21,390
and forth we needed to go ahead and

111
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:24,750
figure out how to prevent the leakage of

112
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:29,250
the secret to our missiles our space

113
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:33,630
program and everything else if you are

114
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:36,270
ACS cissp and you passed the exam you

115
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:40,080
actually should know what I'm gonna go

116
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:41,340
ahead and show if you got it and you

117
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,890
still don't get it

118
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:50,520
I feel sorry because then it is really a

119
00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:56,240
mill so there are two types of models

120
00:06:50,520 --> 00:07:01,560
that existed so the Biba model was

121
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:06,680
developed in 1975 specifically to go

122
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:11,120
ahead and prevent corruption of data

123
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:15,540
corruption of data is essentially the

124
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:18,080
integrity of it and it is in a read up

125
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:21,150
and write down manner

126
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:26,370
so essentially you can only create

127
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:30,090
content at or below the integrity level

128
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:34,770
so think about it as you have the

129
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:37,530
hierarchy of monks and only the the top

130
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:42,000
priests can go ahead and write the

131
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:44,309
scriptures and the interns can only read

132
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,860
it they can't write it so you're

133
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:49,560
protecting the integrity of data by

134
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:57,510
making sure only the highest authority

135
00:07:49,560 --> 00:08:01,590
writes the data the next methodology is

136
00:07:57,510 --> 00:08:04,320
basically the Bela padula model in 1972

137
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:07,710
and these actually go back and forth and

138
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:11,370
contradict one another so this one is

139
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:15,560
called write up read down so you take

140
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:17,610
your average ordinary office worker and

141
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:18,389
they're going to go ahead and build

142
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:23,849
something

143
00:08:18,389 --> 00:08:25,979
and what it is is I have office clerks

144
00:08:23,849 --> 00:08:31,010
who get news feeds

145
00:08:25,979 --> 00:08:34,130
they basically write it and essentially

146
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:38,429
the way that the data is protected is

147
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:41,189
it's only at your level so think of it

148
00:08:38,429 --> 00:08:44,279
as you're a scientist creating something

149
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:49,350
for the space program you can create the

150
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:53,279
top-secret files but you can't create

151
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:53,910
the public files in the sense of you

152
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:57,630
wrote it

153
00:08:53,910 --> 00:09:04,260
a person who has higher clearance than

154
00:08:57,630 --> 00:09:08,399
you can go ahead and read down a general

155
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:11,310
can definitely go ahead and read them so

156
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:17,130
that they actually have these specifics

157
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:20,160
as to the data but if I am NOT in a

158
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:22,769
classified area or have the clearance to

159
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:30,029
go ahead and access that data I cannot

160
00:09:22,769 --> 00:09:34,050
actually access the data so we built

161
00:09:30,029 --> 00:09:38,060
machines back in the 80s specifically to

162
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:42,420
have MLS which is multi-level security

163
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:46,199
we don't actually have machines capable

164
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:50,610
of doing that with this built in so what

165
00:09:46,199 --> 00:09:55,079
that means is my particular box a

166
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:57,110
mainframe or an as400 or something that

167
00:09:55,079 --> 00:10:00,630
was built during the Cold War

168
00:09:57,110 --> 00:10:04,620
essentially have different security

169
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:09,060
levels so the IBM as/400 which is now

170
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:12,060
the iSeries essentially still has as

171
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:15,779
Cold War controls in it a lot of people

172
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:20,699
don't turn them on unfortunately so if I

173
00:10:15,779 --> 00:10:24,149
turn a iSeries as400 platform into a

174
00:10:20,699 --> 00:10:28,260
level 4 it is going to strictly enforce

175
00:10:24,149 --> 00:10:30,899
the database so that if you do not have

176
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:32,550
the proper clearance you actually cannot

177
00:10:30,899 --> 00:10:37,230
access the data

178
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:41,219
so it follows that that model the ward

179
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:46,170
the write up and read down so whatever

180
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:49,410
level you are you basically write it you

181
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:53,760
have access to it and people higher than

182
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:57,390
your level can read it so the thing of

183
00:10:53,760 --> 00:11:01,790
it is is these were designed back in the

184
00:10:57,390 --> 00:11:01,790
day once again during the Cold War and

185
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:09,150
essentially memory is protected memory

186
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:12,000
space is protected databases were

187
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:14,780
segmented you could have multi-tenant

188
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,830
things on there and be assured that

189
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:20,600
unless you have the proper clearance

190
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:22,950
level it wasn't going to happen and

191
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:26,970
specter and meltdown would not be a

192
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:29,670
thing in this environment so it's kind

193
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:35,820
of funny because seadragon awesome guy

194
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:38,069
awesome friend it's like his twitter has

195
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:40,440
given up on sanity and have decided i'm

196
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:42,900
going to retire too nice a s400

197
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:46,950
somewhere in new zealand when it's time

198
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:49,439
to unplug so in other words he's saying

199
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:51,420
i want to go to a very very very secure

200
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:53,790
environment and i want to be segmented

201
00:11:51,420 --> 00:12:01,079
and only people who need to have access

202
00:11:53,790 --> 00:12:03,510
to me can have that access so also we

203
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:08,130
had things back in the day as far as

204
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:10,710
data custodian roles we have gone ahead

205
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:14,430
and pretty much gotten rid of that

206
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:19,740
because it's a cost center so who here

207
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:21,959
remembers a large green bar paper yeah

208
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:25,440
that was the way he used to get things

209
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:28,110
he didn't get an actual database extract

210
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:30,660
you didn't get anything if you were

211
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:32,940
lucky and it was approved a data

212
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:36,540
custodian would print out all your data

213
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:39,990
and then you would get a big big green

214
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:43,209
bar sheet and that's a way that it was

215
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:46,490
and gee there were no breaches

216
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:50,940
[Laughter]

217
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:54,390
so the other thing is is backups were a

218
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:59,180
part of this role so specter and

219
00:12:54,390 --> 00:13:02,699
meltdown or ransomware rather ransomware

220
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:05,060
if you lost all your stuff this was the

221
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:10,320
guys job he basically protects the data

222
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:12,959
so he validates that backups are done

223
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:17,040
he validates that people with the proper

224
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:22,940
access levels to the backups get the

225
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:26,069
data back and essentially ensured that

226
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:30,120
any of the data that was stored never

227
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:32,190
went bad and it's correct we don't do

228
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:35,190
this anymore we have fast business let's

229
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:40,200
throw it in the clewd let's give it to

230
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:42,750
everyone let's set up Hadoop to throw

231
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:46,200
our data everywhere even though it's

232
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:50,820
unsanitized we have no idea what that

233
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:53,970
data is so given the fact that we've

234
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:58,440
moved to the fast business model it

235
00:13:53,970 --> 00:14:00,660
requires that we have all the things

236
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:03,000
let's have all the data all the time

237
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:05,610
everywhere we don't care what it is and

238
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,770
that's why I said the GDP our thing

239
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:10,590
that's kind of gonna have to change

240
00:14:07,770 --> 00:14:13,260
things for people because you can't put

241
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:14,330
that type of data anywhere and not know

242
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:19,439
where it is

243
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:24,150
so hey why don't we go ahead and give an

244
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:28,620
API rights to the entire database yeah

245
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:31,400
that's happened that's a breach let's

246
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:34,470
take a mainframe environment or in a

247
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:36,090
s400 environment which is pretty locked

248
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:40,890
down and you don't actually get access

249
00:14:36,090 --> 00:14:44,700
to it and just throw it everywhere or

250
00:14:40,890 --> 00:14:47,610
even worse that public bucket that's

251
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:51,980
three it's just data let's move it

252
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:51,980
better that's happened

253
00:14:53,269 --> 00:14:58,309
we now interrupt this talk to ask why

254
00:14:56,059 --> 00:15:00,709
the hell would you do that why is this

255
00:14:58,309 --> 00:15:03,860
wood flailed his arms so we brought

256
00:15:00,709 --> 00:15:15,229
virtual viz yeah I think you're cutting

257
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:18,740
out alright so what changed why did we

258
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:20,569
go ahead and have the advent of breeches

259
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:24,319
yeah we got Internet

260
00:15:20,569 --> 00:15:28,599
we got email let's go ahead and take the

261
00:15:24,319 --> 00:15:31,729
formula to Coke and email it to the

262
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:35,389
marketing team great

263
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:36,110
we got cloud instances like the s3

264
00:15:35,389 --> 00:15:40,339
buckets

265
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:44,720
we've got laptop computers that could

266
00:15:40,339 --> 00:15:49,730
actually be encrypted but I find it very

267
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:52,040
very very highly unlikely because most

268
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:54,399
people don't have the maturity to even

269
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:57,079
have a proper image on a laptop computer

270
00:15:54,399 --> 00:16:02,869
we've got people who store them on their

271
00:15:57,079 --> 00:16:07,339
phone and then that goes to iCloud we

272
00:16:02,869 --> 00:16:09,439
then we got Dropbox mass storage the

273
00:16:07,339 --> 00:16:14,290
size of your fingernail your smallest

274
00:16:09,439 --> 00:16:14,290
fingernail and of course internet a

275
00:16:15,309 --> 00:16:22,519
alright so going back to the way that

276
00:16:18,589 --> 00:16:25,759
data should be protected and for all the

277
00:16:22,519 --> 00:16:29,540
CIS ESPYs you already know that they

278
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:34,459
changed it to the AIC triad it's more

279
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:38,569
politically correct so you have this

280
00:16:34,459 --> 00:16:40,279
triad and it's a triangle and what you

281
00:16:38,569 --> 00:16:45,128
should be thinking about as far as your

282
00:16:40,279 --> 00:16:48,079
data is one availability is it always

283
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:50,209
accessible to me as a business or an

284
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:55,699
individual because I need that data I

285
00:16:50,209 --> 00:16:58,790
need confidentiality when I have this

286
00:16:55,699 --> 00:17:02,569
data are the right people accessing it

287
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:05,809
am i giving it away is it in the public

288
00:17:02,569 --> 00:17:10,219
cloud and then you need to

289
00:17:05,809 --> 00:17:13,398
have the last triad of integrity is my

290
00:17:10,219 --> 00:17:16,729
data correct so going back to the two

291
00:17:13,398 --> 00:17:19,819
models that I had previously talked

292
00:17:16,729 --> 00:17:23,509
about you have the confidentiality part

293
00:17:19,819 --> 00:17:29,168
which is the read up write down and then

294
00:17:23,509 --> 00:17:33,289
you have the Biba model for integrity so

295
00:17:29,169 --> 00:17:36,590
essentially what is the attack vector

296
00:17:33,289 --> 00:17:39,080
for confidentiality exfiltration

297
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:42,519
and other people who should not be

298
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:46,249
accessing that data what is the

299
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:48,919
integrity well we can't go ahead and

300
00:17:46,249 --> 00:17:53,259
change your FICO score just because we

301
00:17:48,919 --> 00:17:56,659
want to and what is the availability I

302
00:17:53,259 --> 00:18:06,739
got to be able to access my data every

303
00:17:56,659 --> 00:18:08,690
time all the time so this is a data

304
00:18:06,739 --> 00:18:11,960
security lifecycle there are a couple

305
00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:16,059
things that I feel are missing as far as

306
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:19,879
it so when you work with data

307
00:18:16,059 --> 00:18:23,928
essentially it starts at the create area

308
00:18:19,879 --> 00:18:27,589
and then it's stored then it's used and

309
00:18:23,929 --> 00:18:34,070
it needs to be shared and then archived

310
00:18:27,589 --> 00:18:37,609
and most importantly destroyed so when I

311
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:41,718
go into a client the first thing I

312
00:18:37,609 --> 00:18:45,129
usually ask them is ok I need to see

313
00:18:41,719 --> 00:18:50,869
what your standards and policies are and

314
00:18:45,129 --> 00:18:53,359
they usually go these and they're so

315
00:18:50,869 --> 00:18:56,029
poorly written that they don't really

316
00:18:53,359 --> 00:19:00,589
have a chance in hell and actually going

317
00:18:56,029 --> 00:19:02,629
ahead and fixing it so the first thing I

318
00:19:00,589 --> 00:19:05,029
want to go ahead and do is look at what

319
00:19:02,629 --> 00:19:10,849
I can destroy and that's going to be

320
00:19:05,029 --> 00:19:14,929
retention so once again you can't exfil

321
00:19:10,849 --> 00:19:20,979
what ain't around if you delete it yeah

322
00:19:14,929 --> 00:19:20,979
I can't take it the thing of it is

323
00:19:21,670 --> 00:19:28,300
we need to go ahead and destroy data and

324
00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:31,490
not be afraid to go ahead and delete it

325
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:33,440
there are regulatory things like if

326
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:36,020
you're in a bank you have to keep data

327
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:38,060
for seven years I'm kind of stuck on

328
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:42,230
that seven years it's not changeable

329
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:44,570
whatsoever if I'm in certain government

330
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:48,320
places I have to keep data for up to

331
00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:53,480
fourteen years but you should make sure

332
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:58,250
that when you have this talk you make

333
00:19:53,480 --> 00:20:05,000
sure that you do have a retention policy

334
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:08,830
that will go ahead and ensure that you

335
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:12,020
don't have any issues with retention I

336
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:17,120
would say your most dangerous person in

337
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:22,580
your organization our data hoarders ask

338
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:27,370
Sony how those unencrypted PST files

339
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:30,320
help them a lot or embarrass them a lot

340
00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:32,000
that was really really really bad and it

341
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:36,070
had nothing to even do with actual

342
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:40,840
business things personal emails leaked

343
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:49,540
so data hoarders are dangerous and

344
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:54,889
people can't steal what's deleted so

345
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:56,690
essentially let's say I'm an Rd house or

346
00:20:54,890 --> 00:21:00,230
I'm designing things and I have

347
00:20:56,690 --> 00:21:03,620
intellectual property I need these old

348
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:07,280
designs to design things better I can't

349
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:10,729
actually go ahead and destroy them so

350
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:16,250
this is where we talk about the actual

351
00:21:10,730 --> 00:21:19,280
archive area and essentially what do we

352
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:21,680
see people making mistakes on every time

353
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:23,480
they archive them they don't know what

354
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:28,370
they actually were backing up to begin

355
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:32,170
with so it is important that you

356
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:34,810
reconsider things as far as

357
00:21:32,170 --> 00:21:38,500
basically making it harder for your

358
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:41,010
attacker so you can go ahead and solve

359
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:45,250
this one of two ways you can encrypt all

360
00:21:41,010 --> 00:21:48,370
the archives or backups or you can use

361
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:50,710
rights management and essentially even

362
00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:53,070
if that data is exfilled it's pretty

363
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:53,070
useless

364
00:21:53,550 --> 00:22:00,190
so backups aren't even a part of that

365
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:06,459
that little circle thing that I actually

366
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:09,940
showed you and now even more than ever

367
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:12,070
now it's going to be much more important

368
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:15,360
because the whole city the city of

369
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:19,000
Atlanta essentially lost their whole

370
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:21,429
infrastructure and didn't have any

371
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:24,910
backups and the backups that they did

372
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:29,670
have were about five years to old so I

373
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:33,460
was pretty much disastrous so once again

374
00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:38,890
we need to ensure that backups actually

375
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:41,050
work and if they go missing on a truck

376
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:44,710
that went to the something Mountain

377
00:22:41,050 --> 00:22:46,690
place they should be encrypted or all

378
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:51,550
the good stuff should have rights

379
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:56,590
management so once again even if I'm hit

380
00:22:51,550 --> 00:23:01,210
with ransomware I still am operational

381
00:22:56,590 --> 00:23:05,889
at least I can come back within a day or

382
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:09,310
48 hours worth I don't know any of too

383
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:12,400
many organizations who have actually not

384
00:23:09,310 --> 00:23:14,260
lost more than two weeks worth of work

385
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:18,280
so that's something you want to actually

386
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:20,470
look at in your organization on average

387
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:24,639
when I've done Incident Response and

388
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:26,710
we've had to take machines offline it's

389
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:29,530
usually about a month's worth the data

390
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:32,260
that was behind because we can't

391
00:23:29,530 --> 00:23:35,200
actually go ahead and take something off

392
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:37,710
production so things you can go ahead

393
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:40,360
and do to make sure is that you run

394
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:43,779
systems in parallel to do high

395
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:46,029
availability and at least have those

396
00:23:43,779 --> 00:23:49,059
warm transfers databases are the

397
00:23:46,029 --> 00:23:50,320
absolute horriblest ones to try and do

398
00:23:49,059 --> 00:23:54,059
because there's just too many

399
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:57,668
transactions and the only thing I

400
00:23:54,059 --> 00:24:03,549
suggest and those things are to actually

401
00:23:57,669 --> 00:24:07,239
run two databases in hot swappable h.a

402
00:24:03,549 --> 00:24:09,239
and all the databases are correct and

403
00:24:07,239 --> 00:24:14,649
you encrypt the hell out of it and

404
00:24:09,239 --> 00:24:17,440
essentially monitor the actual tables

405
00:24:14,649 --> 00:24:24,158
that you actually understand to be very

406
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:26,019
sensitive so data classification we go

407
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:29,320
back to that little circle thing and

408
00:24:26,019 --> 00:24:31,169
it's the actual create mode so which

409
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:35,168
came first chicken or the egg

410
00:24:31,169 --> 00:24:37,779
well you created the file what are you

411
00:24:35,169 --> 00:24:38,349
going to go ahead and do as far as deal

412
00:24:37,779 --> 00:24:41,739
with it

413
00:24:38,349 --> 00:24:44,259
I suggest that by the time you create a

414
00:24:41,739 --> 00:24:50,679
file you should actually go ahead and

415
00:24:44,259 --> 00:24:52,389
classify the data reasons are you don't

416
00:24:50,679 --> 00:24:56,049
have the excusive I didn't know what

417
00:24:52,389 --> 00:24:59,699
data is dealing with so I didn't know I

418
00:24:56,049 --> 00:25:04,119
wasn't supposed to sending the stuff out

419
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:06,789
other technologies actually rely on this

420
00:25:04,119 --> 00:25:10,509
so I was talking about UVA which is the

421
00:25:06,789 --> 00:25:15,009
user behavioral analysis as well as data

422
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:17,619
loss prevention they suck you cannot

423
00:25:15,009 --> 00:25:20,619
actually get any of the data loss

424
00:25:17,619 --> 00:25:23,999
prevention or UVA things to actually

425
00:25:20,619 --> 00:25:26,468
work it's not going to happen

426
00:25:23,999 --> 00:25:30,759
once again magical AI and machine

427
00:25:26,469 --> 00:25:34,210
learning it just doesn't do it the other

428
00:25:30,759 --> 00:25:37,119
thing is is I can't turn on DLP to

429
00:25:34,210 --> 00:25:40,330
actually be an active block mode because

430
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:43,478
there's too much critical things that

431
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:47,228
may go out so if I block an executive

432
00:25:43,479 --> 00:25:48,999
from doing a sales guy from actually

433
00:25:47,229 --> 00:25:51,159
doing the million dollar deal because he

434
00:25:48,999 --> 00:25:54,489
actually had to send out stuff that we

435
00:25:51,159 --> 00:25:56,190
approved yeah I'm probably going to be

436
00:25:54,489 --> 00:25:59,269
fired if I block that

437
00:25:56,190 --> 00:26:03,210
but if we actually go ahead and have

438
00:25:59,269 --> 00:26:05,279
classification with meta tags that

439
00:26:03,210 --> 00:26:09,049
actual AI and machine learning can

440
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:12,389
actually take the real meta tag and go

441
00:26:09,049 --> 00:26:15,259
this is classified at this person's

442
00:26:12,389 --> 00:26:18,110
level once again the read up write down

443
00:26:15,259 --> 00:26:20,580
they are authorized to send it to XYZ

444
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:23,610
this is a normal part of their business

445
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:25,350
process I don't care it's three o'clock

446
00:26:23,610 --> 00:26:28,110
in the morning it's an email it's going

447
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:32,279
out they're cleared to do this type of

448
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:36,199
thing that's proper way to actual have a

449
00:26:32,279 --> 00:26:38,820
monitor mode and actually have awed it

450
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:43,230
it's better to actually go ahead and

451
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:45,689
block than it is to actually attempt to

452
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:48,389
just do monitor mode your sock will

453
00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:51,990
never catch it all that data will be

454
00:26:48,389 --> 00:26:53,668
exhaled we've done all kinds of

455
00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:58,169
interesting things to solve these

456
00:26:53,669 --> 00:27:02,190
solutions we've done hey if you see 500

457
00:26:58,169 --> 00:27:04,620
credit cards block it credit cards are

458
00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:06,809
super easy to go ahead and do because we

459
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:09,809
have a loon on the rythm what about all

460
00:27:06,809 --> 00:27:12,299
the states different states driver's

461
00:27:09,809 --> 00:27:15,690
license a New York drivers license

462
00:27:12,299 --> 00:27:17,460
cannot be done via loon it doesn't have

463
00:27:15,690 --> 00:27:19,559
a pattern it's all over the damn place

464
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:22,289
so if I have a thousand New York

465
00:27:19,559 --> 00:27:25,259
driver's license go out they will go out

466
00:27:22,289 --> 00:27:26,970
and I'm gonna let it go out but or I'm

467
00:27:25,259 --> 00:27:32,039
gonna be blocking everything it's just

468
00:27:26,970 --> 00:27:33,889
not very elegant so I highly recommend

469
00:27:32,039 --> 00:27:38,669
that you look into some type of data

470
00:27:33,889 --> 00:27:43,709
classification to actually tag and use

471
00:27:38,669 --> 00:27:46,230
metadata for the actual document upon

472
00:27:43,710 --> 00:27:52,500
creation there are very very very good

473
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:56,600
ones so somebody asked me wants to go

474
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:59,159
ahead and explain how this all works so

475
00:27:56,600 --> 00:28:03,209
data classification we have a single

476
00:27:59,159 --> 00:28:05,509
file that little drop single file not a

477
00:28:03,210 --> 00:28:05,509
problem

478
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:13,309
petabytes of the I can't even sew

479
00:28:13,790 --> 00:28:20,879
from drop to flood where the hell does

480
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:24,150
it go so I walk into a organization they

481
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:27,950
have MCS and have everything they have

482
00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:31,679
petabytes hundreds of terabytes of data

483
00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:36,570
they ask me hey I need you to find all

484
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:44,610
the PII can you tell me why the PII is

485
00:28:36,570 --> 00:28:47,250
I'm like ah no so you have to start

486
00:28:44,610 --> 00:28:50,790
somewhere so to solve these problems

487
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:54,500
what I actually go ahead and do is I

488
00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:57,540
usually implement data classification

489
00:28:54,500 --> 00:29:00,120
start meta tagging things and since I

490
00:28:57,540 --> 00:29:01,620
know data is like water the drops are

491
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:02,219
gonna actually follow the rest of the

492
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:04,469
flood

493
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:07,380
so once I've actually gone ahead and

494
00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:10,650
tagged it I start looking for what I

495
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:12,929
tagged and if I found some good stuff

496
00:29:10,650 --> 00:29:15,660
I'm guaranteed to go ahead and find

497
00:29:12,929 --> 00:29:18,059
where the rest of it is instead of

498
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:20,280
actually trying to actually scan the

499
00:29:18,059 --> 00:29:23,090
entire petabyte because I can't do

500
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:25,889
enough distributed computing and

501
00:29:23,090 --> 00:29:28,139
especially if it's a database to go scan

502
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:31,140
a database that would take it down I

503
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:32,940
can't do that because they're gonna say

504
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:36,000
well you need to scan the database you

505
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:38,550
can only do it every window but that

506
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:43,860
will affect my backups and then you

507
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:46,169
can't do it so what I like to do is as I

508
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:49,129
said make sure you tag it and then just

509
00:29:46,170 --> 00:29:52,500
start following it and you're definitely

510
00:29:49,130 --> 00:29:54,500
guaranteed to go ahead and find it so

511
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:56,550
the benefits of actually doing data

512
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:59,550
classification as an exercise

513
00:29:56,550 --> 00:30:01,830
implementing in technology are one I

514
00:29:59,550 --> 00:30:05,370
know what to go ahead and back up I know

515
00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:08,570
how recent these things are so if I

516
00:30:05,370 --> 00:30:12,600
actually start doing the metadata tags I

517
00:30:08,570 --> 00:30:14,780
can go ahead and say show me all the

518
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:17,290
things that were tagged that have

519
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:20,590
confidential information

520
00:30:17,290 --> 00:30:23,139
and start backing that up I know I need

521
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:25,810
to back that up it also shows me date

522
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:30,670
that it was last accessed and last

523
00:30:25,810 --> 00:30:32,800
touched once again that discovery thing

524
00:30:30,670 --> 00:30:36,850
I was talking about find me all my data

525
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:40,120
I just follow the rest of the data you

526
00:30:36,850 --> 00:30:43,169
can then go ahead and consider smarter

527
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:45,899
security architecture in the fact that

528
00:30:43,170 --> 00:30:48,310
nobody does defense in depth right

529
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:54,220
because they're trying to defend all

530
00:30:48,310 --> 00:30:57,780
things as I was talking about to help

531
00:30:54,220 --> 00:31:01,960
along the machine learning and III I

532
00:30:57,780 --> 00:31:04,149
have to rely on those meta tags if I

533
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:06,880
want to do rights management correctly

534
00:31:04,150 --> 00:31:09,250
and make sure that I properly locked

535
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:12,550
down particular files that contain

536
00:31:09,250 --> 00:31:14,910
things that I need hey I can prove that

537
00:31:12,550 --> 00:31:18,040
it was done because of data

538
00:31:14,910 --> 00:31:21,550
classification and I get a general

539
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:24,220
situational awareness now I will say if

540
00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:28,210
you do choose a vendor who does data

541
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:31,180
classification you need to have a vendor

542
00:31:28,210 --> 00:31:33,640
that will actually go ahead and watch

543
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:37,930
the state of the file from cradle to

544
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:40,060
grave so I create a document and maybe

545
00:31:37,930 --> 00:31:43,480
an Excel spreadsheet I may have first

546
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:45,970
names and last names nobody cares about

547
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:48,790
that that's cool but then I give it to

548
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:52,930
jail he had telephone numbers in there

549
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:55,270
and then I give it to another guy oh we

550
00:31:52,930 --> 00:31:58,390
have their social security numbers in

551
00:31:55,270 --> 00:32:00,730
that excel spreadsheet now your

552
00:31:58,390 --> 00:32:04,150
particular data classification software

553
00:32:00,730 --> 00:32:05,830
should actually start noticing that this

554
00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:08,080
document has been changed

555
00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:12,850
it wasn't sensitive it wasn't

556
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:17,949
confidential and oh crap now we have

557
00:32:12,850 --> 00:32:21,750
SSNs first names last names it needs to

558
00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:24,750
retag that as actually a sensitive

559
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:24,750
classification

560
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:31,140
all right so we have types of data

561
00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:34,350
there's structured data this is the

562
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:39,030
easiest to deal with structured data is

563
00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:42,120
essentially all your databases all your

564
00:32:39,030 --> 00:32:46,230
asked 400 systems run databases and

565
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:49,800
actually control the tables a lot of

566
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:52,860
customers asked me to do the wrong thing

567
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:56,159
all my good stuff is in the database I

568
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:57,449
need to go ahead and protect this yes we

569
00:32:56,160 --> 00:33:02,670
know you need to go ahead and protect

570
00:32:57,450 --> 00:33:04,890
this but databases were inherently built

571
00:33:02,670 --> 00:33:08,550
to be pretty secure

572
00:33:04,890 --> 00:33:10,620
in most situations as they've been

573
00:33:08,550 --> 00:33:12,330
around forever and most designs came

574
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:14,790
from the earlier designs that I was

575
00:33:12,330 --> 00:33:20,730
talking about unless people actually run

576
00:33:14,790 --> 00:33:24,240
ese so the one that's the hardest

577
00:33:20,730 --> 00:33:26,420
unstructured data anything that you can

578
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:30,900
create on one of these personal machines

579
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:34,830
so we've got Hadoop databases we've got

580
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:37,410
pictures we've got source code source

581
00:33:34,830 --> 00:33:41,100
code is damn near impossible to deduct

582
00:33:37,410 --> 00:33:43,950
and I would never ever try and even do

583
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:48,689
any data loss prevention at all without

584
00:33:43,950 --> 00:33:52,050
using tagging because when you use data

585
00:33:48,690 --> 00:33:55,200
loss prevention and you actually try and

586
00:33:52,050 --> 00:33:57,990
use the algorithm for source code which

587
00:33:55,200 --> 00:34:01,830
is crap it usually is done on an end

588
00:33:57,990 --> 00:34:05,730
point and essentially it causes your

589
00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:08,129
developers too much grief and they can't

590
00:34:05,730 --> 00:34:11,520
get their work done but if I have a tag

591
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:14,730
that I can look more on the network the

592
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:17,989
the classified tag I can actually find

593
00:34:14,730 --> 00:34:17,990
that source code real quick

594
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:28,810
so how do I solve this I talked about

595
00:34:24,649 --> 00:34:31,730
the people the processes and technology

596
00:34:28,810 --> 00:34:35,060
first thing I usually have to do when I

597
00:34:31,730 --> 00:34:38,300
go to a customer is figure out who's in

598
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:41,929
charge of all this stuff usually it's

599
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:44,659
been some IT security manager who has

600
00:34:41,929 --> 00:34:49,270
been tasked with well they told me I

601
00:34:44,659 --> 00:34:51,679
have to do this stuff and I usually go

602
00:34:49,270 --> 00:34:56,090
alright so who's cutting the check for

603
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:58,880
me to be here ok let's go ahead and talk

604
00:34:56,090 --> 00:35:04,280
to those people all right so your boss

605
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:06,830
wanted you to do this we're gonna need

606
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:11,180
more than your boss we need legal we

607
00:35:06,830 --> 00:35:13,880
need HR we need everybody so we start

608
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:17,960
with how much of a budget do you

609
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:19,550
actually have to do this with and I'm

610
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:22,540
gonna have to figure out how to go ahead

611
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:25,160
and phase this usually it's going to be

612
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:28,520
you are not mature enough to even

613
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:32,299
monitor things in the sock yeah let's

614
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:35,000
try data classification it actually

615
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:37,849
usually works pretty well and then the

616
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:41,210
organization in itself becomes aware of

617
00:35:37,849 --> 00:35:43,960
the fact that we have more data that was

618
00:35:41,210 --> 00:35:48,560
sensitive than we think

619
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:50,570
then I've got legal and HR to go ahead

620
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:53,690
and talk about policies and the

621
00:35:50,570 --> 00:35:56,000
standards and then of course enforcement

622
00:35:53,690 --> 00:36:00,589
if you actually are stealing from the

623
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:03,859
company so once again it's all people in

624
00:36:00,589 --> 00:36:06,790
an organization that use any of these

625
00:36:03,859 --> 00:36:09,650
data protection products data

626
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:14,619
classification you have to get them to

627
00:36:09,650 --> 00:36:17,300
actively participate if you get your

628
00:36:14,619 --> 00:36:19,190
people who are creating these things to

629
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:22,660
actually tag these things really

630
00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:25,400
accurate my actual classification

631
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:28,629
software can actually start noticing the

632
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:31,280
patterns of what is truly classified and

633
00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:33,619
actually start auto correcting and auto

634
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:36,970
tagging based on the cons

635
00:36:33,619 --> 00:36:36,970
that you're actually putting in

636
00:36:38,289 --> 00:36:45,190
processes well I've got to educate all

637
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:48,490
the users as far as data classification

638
00:36:45,190 --> 00:36:52,190
I've also introduced a brand new tool

639
00:36:48,490 --> 00:36:57,348
into their environment to go ahead and

640
00:36:52,190 --> 00:37:00,230
tag this so the effective ones as far as

641
00:36:57,349 --> 00:37:02,210
products use plugins and when you're

642
00:37:00,230 --> 00:37:05,089
creating a document it literally makes

643
00:37:02,210 --> 00:37:07,549
you the first thing I do before I can

644
00:37:05,089 --> 00:37:11,960
even save is what type of document is

645
00:37:07,549 --> 00:37:14,180
this how do I classify this I would

646
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:16,789
recommend highly that that product that

647
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:19,578
you get force the person to actually

648
00:37:16,789 --> 00:37:23,210
think about what it is so when you save

649
00:37:19,579 --> 00:37:25,220
the document and won't actually save you

650
00:37:23,210 --> 00:37:29,660
then have to go ahead and match all the

651
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:31,640
technology with your processes so any of

652
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:34,359
these processes the processes or

653
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:38,749
controls when I was talking about

654
00:37:34,359 --> 00:37:42,160
standards and policies those should be

655
00:37:38,749 --> 00:37:44,450
published on your company intranet

656
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:48,618
everybody should actually know about

657
00:37:44,450 --> 00:37:54,919
that and there is no excuse to not know

658
00:37:48,619 --> 00:37:58,970
what they are if there is then they need

659
00:37:54,920 --> 00:38:00,559
to be referred to it and taught and one

660
00:37:58,970 --> 00:38:03,078
of the other things is the actual

661
00:38:00,559 --> 00:38:06,619
enforcement which is I need HR and legal

662
00:38:03,079 --> 00:38:11,059
to actually if somebody's purposely

663
00:38:06,619 --> 00:38:12,529
sticking things on USBs and I have proof

664
00:38:11,059 --> 00:38:15,499
that they are and they're not supposed

665
00:38:12,529 --> 00:38:21,739
to handle that data you need to go can't

666
00:38:15,499 --> 00:38:26,118
work for me anymore so Brian Krebs is

667
00:38:21,739 --> 00:38:29,150
not a DLP solution don't use him unless

668
00:38:26,119 --> 00:38:33,289
you just essentially use things in

669
00:38:29,150 --> 00:38:34,910
monitor so for technology there are

670
00:38:33,289 --> 00:38:37,180
things in the stack that you can go

671
00:38:34,910 --> 00:38:41,049
ahead and throw in there for data

672
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:45,259
classification and metadata tagging

673
00:38:41,049 --> 00:38:47,060
there's a discovery tools data loss

674
00:38:45,259 --> 00:38:50,720
prevention

675
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:54,440
Cosby rights management public key

676
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:57,919
infrastructure encryption and database

677
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:59,510
access monitoring and firewall I am not

678
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:02,120
actually going to go ahead and name

679
00:38:59,510 --> 00:39:04,280
vendors because I'm not pitching anybody

680
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:07,910
and I really don't care to do this in a

681
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:09,740
talk but no matter what I buy none of

682
00:39:07,910 --> 00:39:12,020
this is going to work if you leave

683
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:13,759
these tools in monitor mode and you

684
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:16,700
don't invest the time to actually tune

685
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:18,350
them so don't waste your money don't

686
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:20,210
waste your time don't buy any of this

687
00:39:18,350 --> 00:39:28,400
crap if you're not gonna actually invest

688
00:39:20,210 --> 00:39:32,690
time to actually make this work all

689
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:34,850
right so if you actually wanted to go

690
00:39:32,690 --> 00:39:38,210
ahead and research this more there is

691
00:39:34,850 --> 00:39:43,460
something called the CMM I data maturity

692
00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:48,320
model I do not remember or ghen ization

693
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:49,310
z-- because you have to be able to crawl

694
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:53,900
before you can walk

695
00:39:49,310 --> 00:39:57,110
but supposedly this data maturity model

696
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:59,750
is what good looks like if you want to

697
00:39:57,110 --> 00:40:03,290
see what it looks like it's definitely a

698
00:39:59,750 --> 00:40:09,170
thing to aspire to do I don't know

699
00:40:03,290 --> 00:40:11,540
anybody who hasn't been like PCI qsa not

700
00:40:09,170 --> 00:40:14,960
actually go through the correct controls

701
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:19,430
they just check box it's sad and it

702
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:28,010
doesn't work but it is it looks nice

703
00:40:19,430 --> 00:40:32,990
it's pretty so what could go wrong let's

704
00:40:28,010 --> 00:40:42,900
go ahead and switch to other things I've

705
00:40:32,990 --> 00:40:45,520
gotta love the new stuff

706
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:48,610
I'm 38 this happened the last

707
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:52,990
presentation PowerPoint essentially

708
00:40:48,610 --> 00:40:56,460
changed itself to - no focus and I'm

709
00:40:52,990 --> 00:40:56,459
using PDFs for other things

710
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:28,640
all right so I had to do this exercise

711
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:30,799
with a place that actually had an

712
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:34,460
intellectual property and they didn't

713
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:38,360
actually understand how data security

714
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:41,390
works and they didn't understand why it

715
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:43,670
would be of any value to them in fact

716
00:41:41,390 --> 00:41:45,620
some of them were developers and

717
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:47,570
absolutely wanted me to do this in a

718
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:49,250
waterfall thing and I'm like what the

719
00:41:47,570 --> 00:41:52,780
hell are you talking about

720
00:41:49,250 --> 00:41:55,130
so I did a waterfall diagram in any case

721
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:59,420
what I had to go ahead and do is break

722
00:41:55,130 --> 00:42:03,230
it down to stupid things so we were

723
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:05,300
doing the data maturity model so I had

724
00:42:03,230 --> 00:42:08,180
to cover each thing so you look at the

725
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:10,700
top it's risk what most of us care about

726
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:13,190
being the people that we are in InfoSec

727
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:18,080
just go straight to threat model and

728
00:42:13,190 --> 00:42:21,770
vector so the threat model for cloud

729
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:26,630
risk reduction is I'm unable to go ahead

730
00:42:21,770 --> 00:42:28,820
and provide legal hold materials because

731
00:42:26,630 --> 00:42:30,680
I don't know what what date I have so

732
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:32,840
guess what if I don't know where the

733
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:36,410
data is and somebody puts the legal hold

734
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:41,120
on me they can say that whole server is

735
00:42:36,410 --> 00:42:44,540
on legal hold I'm so screwed if I have

736
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:48,730
things there that shouldn't be there I'm

737
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:52,460
also unable to comply with regulatory

738
00:42:48,730 --> 00:42:54,410
requirements such as gdpr which is what

739
00:42:52,460 --> 00:42:58,760
did you do with my data did you delete

740
00:42:54,410 --> 00:43:01,759
it where did it go so to go ahead and

741
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:04,610
actually tell the people why this is an

742
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:07,070
important thing how I'm going to go

743
00:43:04,610 --> 00:43:12,590
ahead and reduce risk other than use the

744
00:43:07,070 --> 00:43:16,370
data maturity model essentially if I put

745
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:17,630
in some type of ediscovery based on what

746
00:43:16,370 --> 00:43:20,600
I had put together on data

747
00:43:17,630 --> 00:43:24,170
classification I should be able to have

748
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:27,200
an accurate data inventory of what it is

749
00:43:24,170 --> 00:43:29,420
that is on that machine I will know

750
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:32,419
whether it is in scope and can talk to

751
00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:34,310
my legal department and say absolutely

752
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:36,890
not you may not put this on legal hold

753
00:43:34,310 --> 00:43:41,060
because it has nothing to do

754
00:43:36,890 --> 00:43:45,440
with what we were doing data

755
00:43:41,060 --> 00:43:50,830
exfiltration once again what I don't

756
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:51,980
have on my server can't be sniffling but

757
00:43:50,830 --> 00:43:54,890
gdpr

758
00:43:51,980 --> 00:43:58,640
is absolutely funny because they want us

759
00:43:54,890 --> 00:44:01,879
to tell you exactly what was done in 72

760
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:06,589
hours in a event of a breach

761
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:08,270
I can't they're they're they're no

762
00:44:06,590 --> 00:44:12,590
companies that I know that even know

763
00:44:08,270 --> 00:44:15,890
what assets were hit in 72 hours let

764
00:44:12,590 --> 00:44:18,490
alone can tell you oh this this this

765
00:44:15,890 --> 00:44:22,700
over here it contained SS ends and

766
00:44:18,490 --> 00:44:25,189
pictures and IP addresses and and yeah

767
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:26,379
it was breached I've never ever seen

768
00:44:25,190 --> 00:44:35,630
anybody who could do that

769
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:38,750
ever so once again a threat model

770
00:44:35,630 --> 00:44:40,970
backups that have not been verified how

771
00:44:38,750 --> 00:44:43,670
do I reduce the risk and why do I want

772
00:44:40,970 --> 00:44:47,060
to reduce risk well if I have good

773
00:44:43,670 --> 00:44:52,880
backups essentially I can reduce risk by

774
00:44:47,060 --> 00:44:58,310
making sure that ransomware hits I'm not

775
00:44:52,880 --> 00:45:02,390
affected for 48 hours of loss RM minus

776
00:44:58,310 --> 00:45:06,020
RF somebody deleted everything by

777
00:45:02,390 --> 00:45:08,240
accident yeah we're good that's happened

778
00:45:06,020 --> 00:45:10,910
where people just accidentally deleted

779
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:15,500
everything that they were supposed to to

780
00:45:10,910 --> 00:45:18,460
actually have left all right so let's go

781
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:18,460
back to the slideshow

782
00:45:21,470 --> 00:45:26,689
so those were the few tabletop exercises

783
00:45:24,619 --> 00:45:29,450
you should be thinking about this in

784
00:45:26,690 --> 00:45:31,910
ways that you can explain to when you

785
00:45:29,450 --> 00:45:34,730
threat model you should have in mind

786
00:45:31,910 --> 00:45:36,500
three different audiences they're going

787
00:45:34,730 --> 00:45:40,089
to be the exact so I need to get my

788
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:43,339
crayons out for they're going to be the

789
00:45:40,089 --> 00:45:45,619
technical people who will go ahead and

790
00:45:43,339 --> 00:45:47,900
implement this but to have no reason why

791
00:45:45,619 --> 00:45:50,300
they're going to implement this and how

792
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:51,619
that it should be implemented so if

793
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:54,800
you're doing a good job you should

794
00:45:51,619 --> 00:45:57,980
actually have the controls and then you

795
00:45:54,800 --> 00:46:03,829
put technology in place to actually

796
00:45:57,980 --> 00:46:07,160
abide by those controls so hackers want

797
00:46:03,829 --> 00:46:10,310
crown jewels how did I protect them well

798
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:15,700
I need to know where they are you need

799
00:46:10,310 --> 00:46:18,078
to go ahead and essentially have

800
00:46:15,700 --> 00:46:21,078
perimeters so if I know that my

801
00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:23,810
databases have all the good stuff and I

802
00:46:21,079 --> 00:46:27,770
know that if you file servers have what

803
00:46:23,810 --> 00:46:32,750
it is that I want I need to define my

804
00:46:27,770 --> 00:46:35,210
defenses around it back when I was

805
00:46:32,750 --> 00:46:38,030
talking about the way that computers

806
00:46:35,210 --> 00:46:41,740
were designed earlier there was a thing

807
00:46:38,030 --> 00:46:45,579
called Mac mandatory access control

808
00:46:41,740 --> 00:46:49,729
essentially that data never ever left

809
00:46:45,579 --> 00:46:53,810
ever and you can actually go ahead and

810
00:46:49,730 --> 00:46:56,589
download or do some more research about

811
00:46:53,810 --> 00:46:59,270
mandatory access control those

812
00:46:56,589 --> 00:47:05,450
particular computers are still around

813
00:46:59,270 --> 00:47:07,520
and when SELinux was actually put

814
00:47:05,450 --> 00:47:10,368
together a long time ago you could

815
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:14,200
actually turn that on that hadn't been

816
00:47:10,369 --> 00:47:16,520
around in quite some time

817
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:21,649
another thing that you can go ahead and

818
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:23,900
do is I would say anybody holding

819
00:47:21,650 --> 00:47:26,900
sensitive data you could actually go

820
00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:29,990
ahead and risk model the user if this

821
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:32,240
guy has access to my sensitive data all

822
00:47:29,990 --> 00:47:36,200
the time

823
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:39,470
and if he's failing the fishing internal

824
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:42,169
attacks yes straight to VDI to you you

825
00:47:39,470 --> 00:47:45,618
don't get to go ahead and even access

826
00:47:42,170 --> 00:47:46,760
anything with important data but once

827
00:47:45,619 --> 00:47:48,710
again that goes back to the

828
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:53,089
classification I need to know where my

829
00:47:48,710 --> 00:47:55,460
good stuff is don't be afraid to go

830
00:47:53,089 --> 00:47:58,910
ahead and find leaks by using honey

831
00:47:55,460 --> 00:48:02,570
docks I purposely want to know where

832
00:47:58,910 --> 00:48:05,660
things are being egress to the honey

833
00:48:02,570 --> 00:48:10,250
dock essentially gives me a call back

834
00:48:05,660 --> 00:48:13,460
and gives me an IP address another

835
00:48:10,250 --> 00:48:15,650
company is out there and they were very

836
00:48:13,460 --> 00:48:18,530
controversial because not only did they

837
00:48:15,650 --> 00:48:21,080
do the beacon they actually did a net

838
00:48:18,530 --> 00:48:24,849
count a call back you can buy those

839
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:29,500
things but I'm not gonna go into that

840
00:48:24,849 --> 00:48:32,660
encrypt your data use PKI

841
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:37,480
make sure all of the things that you put

842
00:48:32,660 --> 00:48:44,868
in your stack are not in monitor mode

843
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:47,930
and essentially if I have to go ahead

844
00:48:44,869 --> 00:48:52,400
and transport data from one country to

845
00:48:47,930 --> 00:48:54,770
another I need to ensure that I know

846
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:59,960
what type of risk that data has with it

847
00:48:54,770 --> 00:49:05,349
and essentially if I have to have my day

848
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:08,660
to leave the environment and essentially

849
00:49:05,349 --> 00:49:11,630
move from one place to another I need

850
00:49:08,660 --> 00:49:14,509
that stuff classified and I need that

851
00:49:11,630 --> 00:49:19,430
stuff under rights management or

852
00:49:14,510 --> 00:49:21,830
encrypted so going back to the sensitive

853
00:49:19,430 --> 00:49:24,319
data people yeah you fail the phishing

854
00:49:21,830 --> 00:49:30,848
attempt you get to use VDI and that's

855
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:33,980
all you use that's basically it and

856
00:49:30,849 --> 00:49:40,180
there is no bar here but if you have

857
00:49:33,980 --> 00:49:40,180
questions go ahead yes

858
00:49:41,180 --> 00:49:45,848
your creation of data

859
00:49:43,420 --> 00:49:49,299
have I worked with any companies on

860
00:49:45,849 --> 00:49:52,720
limiting their creation of data no I

861
00:49:49,299 --> 00:49:54,759
have not in most cases it's going to be

862
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:59,529
a retention issue that I actually have

863
00:49:54,760 --> 00:50:02,380
to start deleting things I would like to

864
00:49:59,529 --> 00:50:05,859
do that but once again that's just not

865
00:50:02,380 --> 00:50:07,960
how things work well I would love to say

866
00:50:05,859 --> 00:50:12,220
if you don't need to make it don't make

867
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:14,289
it but we also run things in that fast

868
00:50:12,220 --> 00:50:17,319
business pace where it's like first to

869
00:50:14,289 --> 00:50:19,660
market and stupidity and yeah I'm going

870
00:50:17,319 --> 00:50:26,619
to save everything or hoard everything

871
00:50:19,660 --> 00:50:28,750
so pretty much so so once again data

872
00:50:26,619 --> 00:50:33,220
hoarders are my most dangerous adversary

873
00:50:28,750 --> 00:50:37,529
to my my client or company or things

874
00:50:33,220 --> 00:50:37,529
like that yes

875
00:50:58,700 --> 00:51:02,210
but now that

876
00:51:04,579 --> 00:51:14,269
so that's another thing that I actually

877
00:51:08,269 --> 00:51:16,578
blew by and supposedly the only pure way

878
00:51:14,269 --> 00:51:18,348
to go ahead and deal with this so we

879
00:51:16,579 --> 00:51:21,380
were talking he asked the question of

880
00:51:18,349 --> 00:51:24,529
how do I deal with data that now has

881
00:51:21,380 --> 00:51:27,109
become sensitive and could go ahead and

882
00:51:24,529 --> 00:51:29,630
reveal something let's just say a health

883
00:51:27,109 --> 00:51:32,660
thing that I don't want revealed got

884
00:51:29,630 --> 00:51:35,630
into that spreadsheet and I can't

885
00:51:32,660 --> 00:51:38,839
actually divulge that how do I make that

886
00:51:35,630 --> 00:51:40,640
anonymous that's through a the only

887
00:51:38,839 --> 00:51:45,979
proper way to do it is using a

888
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:47,660
technology called tokenization so you

889
00:51:45,979 --> 00:51:51,140
have to go ahead and find some type of

890
00:51:47,660 --> 00:51:54,558
the technology that will actually assign

891
00:51:51,140 --> 00:51:57,578
some other value that cannot be

892
00:51:54,559 --> 00:52:02,059
associated with the first value and

893
00:51:57,579 --> 00:52:04,939
that's tokenization which a lot of

894
00:52:02,059 --> 00:52:07,789
things are being done for GDP or right

895
00:52:04,939 --> 00:52:12,348
now but you have to be very careful

896
00:52:07,789 --> 00:52:13,880
because once again keys are created and

897
00:52:12,349 --> 00:52:16,670
a legend is created for that

898
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:19,759
tokenization so if you have the actual

899
00:52:16,670 --> 00:52:22,189
master list of all that stuff even

900
00:52:19,759 --> 00:52:23,179
though I've pseudo anonymized it by

901
00:52:22,189 --> 00:52:28,098
tokenization

902
00:52:23,179 --> 00:52:32,539
it's not anonymous so people make that

903
00:52:28,099 --> 00:52:36,709
mistake too all right I think I'm out of

904
00:52:32,539 --> 00:52:44,660
time and yeah come and see me if you

905
00:52:36,709 --> 00:52:47,808
want to any time and just to be clear

906
00:52:44,660 --> 00:52:50,149
there are actually at least one bar and

907
00:52:47,809 --> 00:52:53,390
a speakeasy sitting somewhere on camp

908
00:52:50,150 --> 00:52:55,900
but metrics can take questions where he

909
00:52:53,390 --> 00:52:58,038
wants thank you for filling in for us

910
00:52:55,900 --> 00:53:00,469
again the talk that we had here

911
00:52:58,039 --> 00:53:03,049
originally will be Saturday at 3 on the

912
00:53:00,469 --> 00:53:04,789
maker stage so if you want to catch that

913
00:53:03,049 --> 00:53:06,319
it's been moved it should be already

914
00:53:04,789 --> 00:53:11,660
updated in the schedules that are on the

915
00:53:06,319 --> 00:53:13,999
monitor and if you know someone there as

916
00:53:11,660 --> 00:53:15,529
an icebreaker tonight introduce yourself

917
00:53:13,999 --> 00:53:18,049
and say hey do you own a subaru from

918
00:53:15,529 --> 00:53:19,760
oregon or a gray BMW from washington

919
00:53:18,050 --> 00:53:24,590
they're in the long term parking we need

920
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:27,260
them moved don't don't set things on

921
00:53:24,590 --> 00:53:29,180
fire if you have cigarettes be

922
00:53:27,260 --> 00:53:33,940
respectful and put them out in a proper

923
00:53:29,180 --> 00:53:37,160
place the ground the oh we have the the

924
00:53:33,940 --> 00:53:40,340
but buckets sitting around put them in

925
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:41,960
there and no amplified music after 10

926
00:53:40,340 --> 00:53:43,670
p.m. and have a great time tonight

927
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:45,170
everyone thank you for showing up for

928
00:53:43,670 --> 00:53:48,610
the first day that's the end of the

929
00:53:45,170 --> 00:53:48,610
first day's worth the talks thank you
