1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,830
so next up we've got another friend of

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:06,450
ours up here that I have the pleasure of

3
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:08,610
introducing woz is going to be speaking

4
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:10,320
and she's got a wonderful talk on you

5
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:27,680
are only human so please welcome her to

6
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:31,320
the Torquay upstage I am hot now okay Oh

7
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:33,269
Mike's okay mmm all right my talk is

8
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:36,480
called you are only human and if you're

9
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:38,370
interested in it my particulars are down

10
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:41,040
here at the bottom I'm in a Boston

11
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:42,930
electrical engineer and I will actually

12
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,370
get into why I'm giving this talk in the

13
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:47,309
talk so I'm just going to jump into it

14
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:49,440
and start presenter mode because I've

15
00:00:47,309 --> 00:01:03,328
got 58 slides to get through so we're

16
00:00:49,440 --> 00:01:04,229
gonna go pretty fast resume alright next

17
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:07,530
okay

18
00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:09,299
so I don't know about you but I've heard

19
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:11,159
this completely made-up quote before

20
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:13,080
from my friends I got into technology

21
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:15,390
because I'd rather solve concrete

22
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:17,250
problems and find real solutions then

23
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:20,040
then deal with messy things like other

24
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:21,600
people in feelings I don't know about

25
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:23,430
you but I told this to myself a lot of

26
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,929
times in college that people were hard

27
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:27,810
and technology was easy and that's why I

28
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:29,520
wanted to be an engineer and you know

29
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:32,729
that's that's part and parcel with the

30
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:34,079
reality of being some of us you know but

31
00:01:32,729 --> 00:01:36,509
I'm gonna summarize something stealing

32
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:38,548
from Bunny's talk yesterday in very

33
00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:40,380
clear engineering terms the software we

34
00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:41,939
run is only as good as the hardware we

35
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:44,250
run it on and we're fundamentally

36
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:46,350
limited by our hardware our nature is

37
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:48,240
human beings is something that you're

38
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:49,829
probably interested in understanding

39
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,380
because you're human and you might have

40
00:01:49,829 --> 00:01:53,759
been ignoring it up until this point but

41
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:54,839
if you want to make a solid go of

42
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:56,189
getting through life and social

43
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:58,590
interaction without having a terrible

44
00:01:56,189 --> 00:02:00,919
time it's worth paying attention to who

45
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:03,689
you are not just who you think you are

46
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:05,670
so this is where I talk about how we're

47
00:02:03,689 --> 00:02:07,469
all existentially alone because we're

48
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:08,789
individuals living in a collective but

49
00:02:07,469 --> 00:02:11,519
we experience the world in a very

50
00:02:08,788 --> 00:02:13,390
singular way we don't natively have any

51
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,250
perspective but our own where the

52
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:17,049
only thing that's not in our environment

53
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:19,300
you know so we're out there you know

54
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:20,800
trying to suss out the world and explore

55
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:22,959
it in real time with this bizarre

56
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,270
time-lapse superposition of life and

57
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:27,160
trying to build you know perspective

58
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:29,590
from that and it's really slow it's

59
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:31,359
painful and it's error-prone which is to

60
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:33,490
say we're all walking alone in the dark

61
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,930
you know trying to discover what the

62
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:37,209
world looks like by running into the

63
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:39,640
furniture and wondering why it hurts I

64
00:02:37,209 --> 00:02:41,260
wish I remembered which author said that

65
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:43,809
it was someone cool like Ursula K Le

66
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:45,880
Guin or James Tiptree jr. you know or

67
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:47,380
maybe even Louise McMaster be old but

68
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:49,690
like it was someone who is insightful

69
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:53,200
about the human condition because this

70
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:55,450
is the human condition and and if you're

71
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:57,429
lucky you might only get to know

72
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:58,660
yourself you're not really going to ever

73
00:02:57,430 --> 00:03:01,060
know the whole world you're not really

74
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:03,700
gonna ever know anybody else it's pretty

75
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:05,080
 existential and even knowing

76
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:07,450
yourself isn't straightforward we've got

77
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:09,880
this entire self-help pop sigh culture

78
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:12,220
for a reason you know like I am ENTJ

79
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:14,109
destroyer of worlds like there's an

80
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:15,940
entire like literature section in the

81
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:18,010
bookstore and five sites on BuzzFeed

82
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:20,920
dedicated to giving you quick fixes and

83
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:22,660
quizzes to tell you who you are and you

84
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:24,700
know this they tell you this because you

85
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:26,140
want to be able to know yourself so that

86
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:28,179
you can do things like figure out what

87
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:30,458
you want get out of your own way

88
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:32,200
realize your own potential make a

89
00:03:30,459 --> 00:03:33,730
million dollars have a bigger penis like

90
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:35,500
whatever it is but like you're focused

91
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:37,750
on improving your element of the human

92
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:39,700
condition and these are things that a

93
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:41,680
lot of people spend a lot of time and

94
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:42,760
money trying to figure out and some some

95
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,610
people never figure it out they're

96
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:47,019
always frustrated but just like you can

97
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:49,120
learn the skills and tools of hardware

98
00:03:47,019 --> 00:03:51,130
design and then like create this pattern

99
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,079
where you make an investment it sucks a

100
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:55,720
lot it hurts to learn but then you can

101
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:57,370
fix something that's broken use that to

102
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:59,079
design and analyze something else use

103
00:03:57,370 --> 00:04:00,700
that to build a new thing break that and

104
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:03,400
then like go through this virtual cycle

105
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:05,290
of leveling up interpersonal skills and

106
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:06,970
trying to understand who you are and the

107
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:09,190
people around you has the exact same

108
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:10,660
governing principles and if you make a

109
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:12,489
little bit of an investment in

110
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:14,590
understanding yourself and understanding

111
00:04:12,489 --> 00:04:16,298
others you can open up a whole world of

112
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:18,220
possibilities that you don't know exists

113
00:04:16,298 --> 00:04:20,349
because you can marry your perspective

114
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:22,570
to the person next to you and the person

115
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:24,640
next to them and that's what teams are

116
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:26,500
and that's what society is that's what

117
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:29,890
value systems are

118
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:31,390
so um being social elite unlocks the

119
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:33,099
following in-game features and I don't

120
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:33,430
have notes so I have to read it off of

121
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:35,230
here

122
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:37,900
social interaction will become less

123
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:40,270
perplexing and you'll have lower social

124
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:41,739
anxiety and anxiety in general it will

125
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:43,690
also be a +10 to social engineering

126
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:45,550
because it's actually really easy to ask

127
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:49,030
people for things talk to Amanda Palmer

128
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:51,970
it also increases really ephemeral specs

129
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:53,890
like fun and satisfaction and improves

130
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:56,230
how you feel even though you're not more

131
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:58,090
hardcore you help it helps you

132
00:04:56,230 --> 00:05:01,360
accomplish goals with less angst things

133
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:02,830
just feel easier right like there's all

134
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,630
of these things about effectiveness and

135
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:06,820
productivity reducing self-criticism

136
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:10,180
reducing jealousy being a better person

137
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:12,010
eating vegan eating more kale you know

138
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:13,870
but at the end of the day you know it

139
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:16,210
even it even does in fact reduce

140
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:19,030
inflammation and illness because you are

141
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:20,799
made of meat and it helps you leverage

142
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:23,229
all of the people around you to have a

143
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,760
better life doesn't that sound really

144
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:28,480
really hardcore because it's really

145
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:30,550
really hard so why bother being a more

146
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:33,210
fully human when being a robot is your

147
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:35,950
current safe operating default and

148
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:39,849
because negative you are still a meat

149
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:42,310
popsicle being stressed as an organism

150
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:44,830
in as an organism with cockney no

151
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:46,870
cognition and and mind is really the

152
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:48,550
difference between where you have

153
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:51,640
expectations of what you think is going

154
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:53,500
on in reality whereas you all here are

155
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:55,390
problem solvers if you have an accurate

156
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:57,430
view of what's really going on in your

157
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:58,900
life you're going to problem solve it

158
00:05:57,430 --> 00:06:00,460
you're going to troubleshoot it you're

159
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:02,260
going to change the parameters and

160
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:04,239
you're going to with it so tweak it

161
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:05,440
to make it better but you can't do that

162
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:09,540
if you don't have an accurate

163
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:12,960
perspective so why am i giving this talk

164
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:15,160
ok so this is a social primate 101

165
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:17,799
you're lonely going to trust me if I'm

166
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:18,940
actually being genuine so I'm gonna flip

167
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:23,110
to the notes that I didn't put in the

168
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:26,380
speaker talk and yeah they're right here

169
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:29,380
so I'm giving this talk because once

170
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:31,600
upon a time I I up and so this is

171
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:33,520
radical vulnerability story time about

172
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:36,250
seven eight years ago I had a dream job

173
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:37,630
at the VESA Institute for Harvard visa

174
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:40,090
Institute for biologically inspired

175
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:42,159
engineering at Harvard University

176
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:44,229
where I was an early hire I was a staff

177
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,880
engineer we didn't have a lab we had a

178
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:48,669
hundred and fifty million dollar budget

179
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:50,169
that got matched and it involved all of

180
00:06:48,669 --> 00:06:52,389
the things I cared about after having

181
00:06:50,169 --> 00:06:54,729
burned out in semiconductors on consumer

182
00:06:52,389 --> 00:06:57,220
goods which was an operating mission to

183
00:06:54,729 --> 00:06:59,620
help people and I was like oh my god

184
00:06:57,220 --> 00:07:01,840
this is my moment I can like work on

185
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:03,370
things to save babies I can do projects

186
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,960
for the ninjas in the meantime I have a

187
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:10,030
laser cutter we're gonna build a team

188
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:12,638
it's gonna be great and I I cared so

189
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:14,888
much about my work and I cared way too

190
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:16,630
much so what happened is I was tasked

191
00:07:14,889 --> 00:07:18,940
with building a team I was tasked with

192
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:20,770
hiring out for other skill sets and it

193
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:22,180
went flying until I was like really good

194
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:24,010
at finding like this guy's better at me

195
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:25,810
than firmware this person's better at

196
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:27,490
mechanical and then it got to the point

197
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:28,990
where I needed to reproduce myself on

198
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:31,360
the team I had to hire another engineer

199
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:32,770
who is mixed-signal analog and I really

200
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,180
wanted to work with another woman and we

201
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:36,969
found one she really wanted to be on the

202
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:38,919
team so we hired her and uh and I was I

203
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:40,900
was really confused about how other

204
00:07:38,919 --> 00:07:43,120
people work so I assumed she was like me

205
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:45,549
and I assumed the things that motivated

206
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:47,470
me motivated her and I assumed that we

207
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:49,389
would like be good friends and I assumed

208
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:52,260
that we would work well together and I

209
00:07:49,389 --> 00:07:57,039
was completely completely wrong

210
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:59,229
you know so uh I was ineffective in

211
00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:01,300
bringing this person on my team they

212
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:03,340
ended up hating me I started getting

213
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:07,590
angry I started getting more antisocial

214
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:10,179
and I'm like what am I doing wrong and

215
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:11,590
then a friend handed me this book called

216
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:13,060
dealing with people you can't stand

217
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:15,219
because the way I started this process

218
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:17,500
was I assumed that the woman who joined

219
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:19,240
my team was my work nemesis I assumed

220
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:21,789
she was lazy I assumed she didn't care

221
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:24,789
and I was like oh she's terrible I can't

222
00:08:21,789 --> 00:08:27,010
stand her and in in paged like and the

223
00:08:24,789 --> 00:08:28,750
way this book starts out is it gives you

224
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:30,099
a whole list of the ten archetypes of

225
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:31,419
people you can't stand in the workplace

226
00:08:30,099 --> 00:08:32,409
whether it's the person who's

227
00:08:31,419 --> 00:08:33,760
belligerently throwing their weight

228
00:08:32,409 --> 00:08:35,349
around the person who's

229
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:37,689
passive-aggressive the person who avoids

230
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:38,979
work the yes-man whatever you get

231
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:40,750
through and you're like yeah I know that

232
00:08:38,979 --> 00:08:42,669
guy work with him he's a dick yeah I

233
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:45,370
know that person Oh make me so mad and

234
00:08:42,669 --> 00:08:47,829
then in like page ten they go okay so

235
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:49,660
which archetypes are you being in this

236
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:50,950
relationship because it takes two to

237
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:52,120
fight and you're part of the problem if

238
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:53,410
you hate someone this much that you

239
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:57,010
can't stand them

240
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:58,750
you're being a dick too and so the rest

241
00:08:57,010 --> 00:09:00,850
of this slide because I done up

242
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:02,650
and I made my team DOA and I destroyed

243
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:04,450
this work relationship and admittedly

244
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:06,100
the technology got out you know we

245
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:08,200
deployed it in Nick Hughes you know the

246
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:10,360
data collection went well by arguably by

247
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:12,310
all means it was a success it was like a

248
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:14,170
Pyrrhic victory it hurt too much to do

249
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:15,849
and I'm like man if I don't fix this

250
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:17,650
interpersonal thing I'm not gonna build

251
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:20,860
cool things cuz I'm a limited capacity

252
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:24,310
unit right so I realized that I had to

253
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:27,490
grow TM and become a better person to do

254
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:29,410
better next time so art and technology

255
00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:30,550
actually have a huge intersection

256
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:32,110
already and they have excellent

257
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:33,880
metaphors for understanding the human

258
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:35,620
condition I started off by listening to

259
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:38,380
a couple Smith's albums and realized I

260
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:40,210
wasn't alone I I tried to console myself

261
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:41,880
by validating my feelings about how much

262
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:43,900
the situation sucked because it did and

263
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:44,830
you know but I'm like you know what I've

264
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:46,480
been through I've been through really

265
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:48,280
crappy situations before I got through

266
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:50,170
undergrad at MIT which is mainly like

267
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:50,920
demoralizing you know but it taught me

268
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:53,800
how to build things

269
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:56,410
my manager consoled me by telling me

270
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:58,030
most people when confronted with an

271
00:09:56,410 --> 00:10:00,010
opportunity for growth because they are

272
00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:02,260
screwing up choose instead not to grow

273
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:03,760
and to move on to a different situation

274
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:05,920
with a new set of people where they play

275
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:07,840
out the same routines because growing is

276
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:10,569
scary and hard and most people aren't up

277
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:12,040
for doing it you know and and then the

278
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:13,300
next thing I did was I told myself you

279
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:15,430
have to break something in order to

280
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:17,079
extend it and I was clearly broken and I

281
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:18,969
needed to figure myself out so that I

282
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:20,410
could get out of my own way so rather

283
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:21,940
than being really willful and stubbornly

284
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:23,410
insisting I was right and this woman was

285
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:25,870
wrong and that guy was wrong and this

286
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:27,640
person was wrong I I sucked it up and I

287
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:29,560
wholeheartedly accepted that I was wrong

288
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:32,260
even though it hurt a lot to do that and

289
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:33,880
then I realized I didn't still didn't

290
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:35,500
magically know like accepting that you

291
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:36,880
suck doesn't teach you anything new

292
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:38,560
you're like man I'm really bad at shell

293
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:40,930
scripting it doesn't like wanting it

294
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:43,089
doesn't make you better at it and so

295
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:44,500
since my goal was really ultimately to

296
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:47,920
make cool things with teams to help

297
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:49,840
people here's what I do in - so what

298
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:51,610
does it mean to be human and basically

299
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:53,410
we all have this thing called theory of

300
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:54,760
mind a theory of mind kicks in between

301
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:57,040
like around one to two years old and

302
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:58,510
it's the developmental state for your

303
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,310
hardware at which point you realize that

304
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:02,560
everybody else in the world is not an

305
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:04,810
NPC and a figment of your subconscious

306
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:06,910
like there's actually a point where very

307
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:07,599
with the way we run is we're so self

308
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:09,790
referential

309
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,860
that it is a developmental stage to

310
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:13,990
realize other people are human and that

311
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:16,990
you are just a small part of a large

312
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:18,130
space if you go into philosophy it

313
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:19,300
covers a lot of this as well there's

314
00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:21,250
this thing called the mind-body problem

315
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:22,750
where Descartes tried to argue that

316
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:24,670
we're a consciousness and the body

317
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:26,019
doesn't matter and I'll take card so

318
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:28,300
silly that's

319
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:31,029
you know we're a whole complete organism

320
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:32,949
and and you've got to treat yourself as

321
00:11:31,029 --> 00:11:36,399
a organism and not a crystalline entity

322
00:11:32,949 --> 00:11:38,079
or a brain in a jar so how do we process

323
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:39,100
the world and in machine learning terms

324
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:41,229
because we're very good learning

325
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:43,089
machines we're basically a conscious

326
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:45,040
process that's constantly waiting our

327
00:11:43,089 --> 00:11:47,920
experiences and those experiences are

328
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:49,480
intrinsic and extrinsic extrinsic being

329
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:51,099
other people what's going on with the

330
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:53,139
weather and intrinsic being things like

331
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:54,519
I really wonder if I should have drank a

332
00:11:53,139 --> 00:11:56,190
liter of water before I got on stage

333
00:11:54,519 --> 00:11:59,589
because I'm worried I have to pee right

334
00:11:56,190 --> 00:12:01,300
so these things there's also things like

335
00:11:59,589 --> 00:12:02,709
vulnerability factors which is extra

336
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:04,839
load on your system extra things you're

337
00:12:02,709 --> 00:12:07,420
dealing with and these things form like

338
00:12:04,839 --> 00:12:08,709
a shield around your self-identity you

339
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:10,569
know and a lot of the cognitive

340
00:12:08,709 --> 00:12:11,949
shortcuts and sort of things associated

341
00:12:10,569 --> 00:12:14,500
with your belief system and your

342
00:12:11,949 --> 00:12:16,359
personality that you keep with you in

343
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:18,459
your backpack up in front of your face

344
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:21,970
like a hood you know as you navigate

345
00:12:18,459 --> 00:12:24,939
through life and these weights are

346
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:25,990
approximations we make that also affect

347
00:12:24,939 --> 00:12:27,040
how we interact with everyone else

348
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:29,130
because everyone else has their own

349
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:32,199
story and their own training matrix and

350
00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:35,350
everyone forms things like judgments

351
00:12:32,199 --> 00:12:36,729
biases cognitive distortions things that

352
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:38,170
they believe to be true that might be

353
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:39,730
completely different from what you

354
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:41,050
believe to be true even though you're

355
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:43,689
both operating in a very similar

356
00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:45,969
environment because like I said we're

357
00:12:43,689 --> 00:12:47,170
all alone in this environment and

358
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:52,329
everyone's got a different path or

359
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:54,219
walking hmm so another step is the fact

360
00:12:52,329 --> 00:12:56,199
that we're social primates so this is

361
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:58,899
some pretty recent research I really

362
00:12:56,199 --> 00:13:01,389
like Sarah Pesek Sarah Perry's summary

363
00:12:58,899 --> 00:13:03,670
essay on this which is linked down here

364
00:13:01,389 --> 00:13:06,250
but it's others in mind social origins

365
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:07,899
of self-consciousness and I mentioned

366
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:09,490
before that you don't really know who

367
00:13:07,899 --> 00:13:10,689
you are right because like you're a

368
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:12,880
single point of reference and you're not

369
00:13:10,689 --> 00:13:15,730
in your environment and that's because

370
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:17,199
cognitively social primates we get to

371
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:18,579
know ourselves through the eyes of the

372
00:13:17,199 --> 00:13:20,890
people around us so there's this like

373
00:13:18,579 --> 00:13:24,040
interesting recursive process that

374
00:13:20,890 --> 00:13:25,960
it's like I know sometimes that I feel

375
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:28,030
really goofy silly and anxious and then

376
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:29,230
Fabian is like no was you're cool and I

377
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:32,980
can tell that she means it

378
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:34,780
so in my viewpoint I'm like oh and then

379
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:36,520
I see myself reflected in Fabian's

380
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:38,740
viewpoint that she gives me honestly no

381
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:40,390
you're doing fine and I'm like oh okay

382
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:42,670
so now I have this mental model of

383
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:44,590
myself in Fabian and I have this model

384
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:46,719
of Fabian and I've got that little me

385
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:48,340
inside Fabian and that's one view of me

386
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:50,170
that she who gives back to me and then

387
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:51,940
I've got another one from deviant and

388
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:53,589
I've got another one from Redbeard and

389
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:55,150
this is why people say you should choose

390
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:57,280
your friends because if the people

391
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:59,110
around you are reflecting really

392
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:01,180
distorted or completely wrong or

393
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:03,220
manipulative images of you you are going

394
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:06,310
to believe it because this is how we're

395
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:07,990
wired to form social groups this is how

396
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:10,420
we actually establish the identity of

397
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:14,890
others and ourselves you know unmask

398
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:16,780
that's how our consciousness works so

399
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:18,520
Alone's so we've got this lens of

400
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:21,280
perception right both internal

401
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:23,620
perception and external perception we've

402
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:25,720
got this bizarre recursive social model

403
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:27,850
and we've got this tendency to be like

404
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:28,360
constantly learning machines so what

405
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:32,200
does that get us

406
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:35,320
ah it gets us a lot of kind of messed up

407
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:38,440
bugs so biases 101 meat doesn't follow

408
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:40,390
Moore's law we you know fundamentally

409
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:42,670
are running on a very limited amount of

410
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:43,810
hardware and so we take computational

411
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:46,030
shortcuts we're very good at measuring

412
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:47,199
you know looking at patterns so we start

413
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:49,360
with things like perception and

414
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:50,800
experience and then you have something

415
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,790
to occur to you repeatedly and then

416
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:54,040
you're like okay I'm gonna make an

417
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:56,020
assessment about it like the sky is blue

418
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:57,760
and it's Tuesday so I'm like quick sweet

419
00:14:56,020 --> 00:15:00,250
the sky is blue on Tuesday I've got an

420
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:01,930
association now and then you can turn

421
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:04,030
those associations into things like

422
00:15:01,930 --> 00:15:05,410
archetypes so that when I walk up to

423
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:07,480
somebody I'm like that person has a

424
00:15:05,410 --> 00:15:07,959
utility of I bet they also have a

425
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:10,540
Leatherman

426
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:14,170
right and then uh then you get into

427
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:16,839
things like judgments or that person

428
00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:20,349
drives a Tesla I think I'm going to

429
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:22,180
reserve judgment for now or uh you know

430
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:23,680
and then and then in addition to meat

431
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:24,969
doesn't follow Moore's law you've got a

432
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,349
limited amount of cash so there's a

433
00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:28,360
phenomenon called the monkey sphere and

434
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:30,130
I apologize I forgot to link it but

435
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:31,750
there's actually like a limited amount

436
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:33,460
of processing power you have to view

437
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:34,230
other people as people so that you're

438
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:35,580
interacting with

439
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:37,230
in the sort of green zone is sort of

440
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:39,540
like I take you as you come and it's

441
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:41,910
like new every time you rapidly jump to

442
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:43,770
arc types and judgments and then biases

443
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:45,449
logical fallacies cognitive distortions

444
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:46,800
and shortcuts like racism as soon as

445
00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:48,990
there are too many people in the room

446
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:51,660
right and so that's how you get like you

447
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:53,880
know massive sweeping statements about

448
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:56,219
dirty hippies or hipsters because they

449
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:58,470
ruin everything right and and this is

450
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:59,910
just how we work right you can get to

451
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:02,220
know someone who's different from you

452
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:04,770
but this is computationally intensive

453
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:06,960
and this is almost computationally free

454
00:16:04,770 --> 00:16:08,760
which is why we do it which is why it's

455
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:11,910
hard which is why actually having a

456
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:14,010
Jaron fair and just society is constant

457
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:18,120
vigilance right absolutely constant

458
00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:19,800
vigilance my diaphragm shakes when I

459
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:23,760
have to try to talk quiet so I'm gonna

460
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:25,260
move the mic back and yell alright

461
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:26,910
so cognitive bias I'm gonna give an

462
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:28,860
example of this stuff cognitive biases

463
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:30,959
go up to Wikipedia because cognitive

464
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:32,160
biases you actually can categorize them

465
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:33,870
the way you can categorize things like

466
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:36,150
stack overflows because you can stack

467
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:37,410
overflow people so you know they're

468
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:39,180
organized into categories based on

469
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:41,579
things like too much information right

470
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:43,380
you just gave me too many words - no not

471
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:45,930
enough meaning so I'm gonna jump to a

472
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:47,610
conclusion the need to act quickly put

473
00:16:45,930 --> 00:16:48,959
pressure on somebody like a used car

474
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:51,150
salesman and see what you can get away

475
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:52,200
with you know and the limits of memory

476
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:53,939
give them too many things to remember

477
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:56,910
and eventually they'll just dump core

478
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:58,320
and go into a random state right and you

479
00:16:56,910 --> 00:17:00,150
know this because you've done it and you

480
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:02,940
usually feel pretty bad when you realize

481
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:04,349
that's happened to you all right then

482
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:05,640
there's also logical fallacies by the

483
00:17:04,349 --> 00:17:07,319
way you can download this poster for

484
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:09,540
free or order thou shalt not commit

485
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:12,089
logical fallacies from your logical

486
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:13,770
fallacies org these are things like if

487
00:17:12,089 --> 00:17:15,899
you've argued on the internet you know

488
00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:18,060
what these mean but there are there are

489
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:20,240
fundamental flaws and reasoning and when

490
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:22,440
you think about it these fallacies are

491
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,910
repeated throughout cultures they're

492
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:25,410
repeated throughout generations you can

493
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:26,730
see them in older writings right they're

494
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:28,830
repeated constantly they're part of the

495
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:30,810
human condition they indicate some of

496
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:33,659
our shortcuts that we take cognitively

497
00:17:30,810 --> 00:17:35,940
as we participate in society and then

498
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:37,230
we've got cognitive distortions and if

499
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:38,730
you know what these are I hope you're

500
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:40,620
getting help to work on them because

501
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:42,950
they're exaggerated or irrational

502
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:45,479
thoughts that you just fall into you and

503
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:47,820
every single person does this this is

504
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:49,770
not the purview of mental health and

505
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:52,379
human has cognitive distortions I had a

506
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:54,750
friend where he he was telling me a

507
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:57,360
story about how his parents took him

508
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:59,100
snowboarding as a kid or skiing and he

509
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:01,229
was giving a friend fashion advice for

510
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:03,270
snowboarding as an adult and she was

511
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:05,760
picking out some garish jacket and he's

512
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:07,320
like you can't you can't buy that you

513
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:10,770
you can't wear that moguls don't like

514
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:13,080
bright colors and then he hurt himself

515
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:14,400
and he's like oh right because his

516
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:15,960
parents just didn't want him wearing

517
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,910
like neon yellow on the slopes but he

518
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:19,920
actually integrated that right and it

519
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:22,620
was real to him as a 35 year old right

520
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:24,300
so and we all do things like selective

521
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:25,949
abstraction we take the wrong lesson out

522
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:28,080
we make things our fault we over

523
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:30,870
personalized we over generalize and

524
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:32,970
these are actually distorted cognitive

525
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:36,540
processes these are shortcuts you've and

526
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:38,280
ruts you've gotten into and in the

527
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:41,340
context of tech because I do want to

528
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:44,460
make this about tech check out this

529
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:46,679
paper because bias is why qa/qc is

530
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:48,720
completely separate from dev and product

531
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:50,160
eV and DevOps right this is why

532
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:52,950
engineers aren't allowed to test their

533
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:54,720
own things biases why the FDA publishes

534
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:57,450
guidances on user interactions and

535
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:59,670
structures things about you know adverse

536
00:18:57,450 --> 00:19:02,250
event reporting biases why the FDA has

537
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:03,510
created this really interesting event

538
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:05,640
reporting system because they realize

539
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:07,290
that pilots won't report when they mess

540
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:09,450
up if there is a penalty so they have a

541
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:11,730
double blind reporting system so that

542
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:13,320
they can keep track of faults while not

543
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:15,750
you know discouraging people from

544
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:17,340
reporting because of bias and all of

545
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:19,530
these cognitive shortcuts literally kill

546
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:20,879
people all the time especially when you

547
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:22,680
don't mean to this is how humans make

548
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:25,440
mistakes and either advertently or

549
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:26,610
inadvertently hurt other people so check

550
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,350
out you are not the user the false

551
00:19:26,610 --> 00:19:29,879
consequence of false consensus effect

552
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:31,500
it's a really good paper for why this

553
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:34,680
applies to tech it'll be a good

554
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:36,060
introductory into the topic and then I

555
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:37,830
mentioned things like vulnerability

556
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:41,669
factors like how much water I had to

557
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:44,340
drink these things all predispose you to

558
00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:46,550
being to making these cognitive mistakes

559
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:48,659
right like if you have low-grade pain

560
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:50,399
it's the same thing as the spoons

561
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:52,290
metaphor you only have so many spoons to

562
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,880
get through your day that actually means

563
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:56,190
that you have a finite amount of

564
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:58,710
cognitive resources allocated per waking

565
00:19:56,190 --> 00:20:00,460
cycle or less if you sleep terribly

566
00:19:58,710 --> 00:20:02,590
because we're made of meat

567
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:04,090
and you go through that executive

568
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:05,919
function you know throughout the day you

569
00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:08,470
can only make so many decisions decision

570
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:12,120
fatigue is real and these things will

571
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:14,710
actively make your error rate go up and

572
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:16,750
you know part of how that works is uh

573
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:19,390
these things elevate cortisol and

574
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:21,190
adrenaline and those neurotransmitters

575
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:22,450
reinforce this short cutting process

576
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:24,460
it's supposed to be the very fast

577
00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:27,820
reaction that keeps you safe from a lion

578
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:29,410
so there's a PTSD talk coming up if you

579
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:32,020
want to know more about the body effects

580
00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:33,190
of you know stress go to that talk it's

581
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:36,190
also good to check out and the body

582
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:37,990
keeps the score so I'm gonna go through

583
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:39,430
a quick example because I don't want to

584
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:42,010
run out of time but I think I'm doing

585
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:43,720
okay on judgement and bias so check this

586
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:45,280
out legal first is outtie driver who

587
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:49,150
deliberately slammed the brakes in road

588
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:50,350
rage is convicted so let's go through

589
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:51,310
the order of operations of how this

590
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:52,750
works because I don't know about you but

591
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:56,530
I think all Audi drivers are assholes

592
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:59,500
and this confirms that bias so Mike Oh

593
00:20:56,530 --> 00:21:00,820
finally justice so what happens is

594
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:02,980
there's usually an established pattern

595
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:04,990
and you can't necessarily control what

596
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:06,700
takes a certain input stimulus and makes

597
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:08,440
a pattern for you sometimes it's

598
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:09,670
conscious sometimes it's unconscious

599
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:11,470
right sometimes it happened when you

600
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:13,660
were a kid sometimes it's something you

601
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:15,370
borrow from your friends like hardcore

602
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:17,860
people have to drink redbull and stay up

603
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:19,719
till 5:00 a.m. every day and then but

604
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:21,129
you establish a pattern and then that

605
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:23,230
repeats and you create a judgement and

606
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:24,640
then what happens is you react based on

607
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:26,470
that judgment because it's a shortcut

608
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:28,540
for when you're in a stress situation so

609
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:30,670
say and I'm like driving along I'm super

610
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:32,230
late to work I'm super stressed and now

611
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:35,500
D driver cuts me off I spelled my coffee

612
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:37,300
on my lap but I'm like all right and

613
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:40,090
then I'm like an asshole right but it's

614
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:42,129
about that person but then it happens

615
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:43,840
again the next week and this time like I

616
00:21:42,130 --> 00:21:45,040
dumped my papers all over because I was

617
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:46,899
like trying to put something back in my

618
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:48,639
bag and then I'm super flustered when I

619
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:50,080
get into work now I've reinforced that

620
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,400
judgment right like I'm like oh these

621
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:53,560
are already driver because I'm gonna get

622
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:55,360
them and then then I create a

623
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:56,980
self-fulfilling event I start cutting

624
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:58,929
off Audi drivers on the street I'm like

625
00:21:56,980 --> 00:22:02,200
haha I Drive a fast car too I'm gonna

626
00:21:58,930 --> 00:22:06,520
get you or I Drive a Honda Civic try me

627
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:08,920
bro right so and that behavior that

628
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:10,780
behavior then leads to reinforcing these

629
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:12,340
you know bad interactions so now I'm

630
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:13,928
engaging in confirmation bias and it's

631
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:15,789
not just confirmation bias

632
00:22:13,929 --> 00:22:17,289
I am creating a self-fulfilling prophecy

633
00:22:15,789 --> 00:22:18,940
where I set up these situations where

634
00:22:17,289 --> 00:22:20,980
outtie drivers are dictum fixed me and I

635
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:23,499
don't know why right I'm like oh my god

636
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:25,450
they're all terrible and then you know

637
00:22:23,499 --> 00:22:27,100
basically I'm perpetuating this terrible

638
00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:29,830
vicious cycle while thinking it's

639
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:31,178
completely justified and then you jump

640
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:35,289
you next you just keep doing this until

641
00:22:31,179 --> 00:22:38,440
you suck well you know so when you think

642
00:22:35,289 --> 00:22:40,149
about it people are interacting with one

643
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:42,210
another at a level that's far removed

644
00:22:40,149 --> 00:22:44,350
from your individual self right so like

645
00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:47,499
do you think anyone here cried this

646
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:49,389
morning what did you what did you eat on

647
00:22:47,499 --> 00:22:50,980
the way in do you know if anyone else is

648
00:22:49,389 --> 00:22:53,229
drinking a beer right now do you know

649
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:54,970
how other people feel around you you you

650
00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:57,190
probably don't right you're like Oh

651
00:22:54,970 --> 00:22:58,509
everyone's probably doing the same cuz

652
00:22:57,190 --> 00:22:59,860
that's what my model tells me yeah

653
00:22:58,509 --> 00:23:01,299
you're interacting with the projection

654
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:03,428
you made of them you know and maybe

655
00:23:01,299 --> 00:23:05,200
they're projecting something to you like

656
00:23:03,429 --> 00:23:08,379
man I hope I'm cool enough to be working

657
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:09,850
oh god I'm so nervous this is my first

658
00:23:08,379 --> 00:23:11,350
time this is not my first time but like

659
00:23:09,850 --> 00:23:13,360
I was nervous the first time I came and

660
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:15,009
you know when I tried to be too cool for

661
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:16,689
school that created a very different

662
00:23:15,009 --> 00:23:19,450
experience than when I was honest about

663
00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:21,850
being nervous you know because the real

664
00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:22,269
us we keep it on the inside we keep it

665
00:23:21,850 --> 00:23:25,928
secret

666
00:23:22,269 --> 00:23:27,129
we keep it safe and you know and that

667
00:23:25,929 --> 00:23:28,629
means that we're not really interacting

668
00:23:27,129 --> 00:23:30,580
with each other which means we're

669
00:23:28,629 --> 00:23:32,139
creating sort of all of these judgements

670
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:35,259
and assessments based on a really shitty

671
00:23:32,139 --> 00:23:36,850
data because it's cognitively convenient

672
00:23:35,259 --> 00:23:39,340
to do that you kind of have social

673
00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:41,199
morals of things like if I've got enough

674
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:44,080
rules then I will know exactly what I

675
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:45,789
need to do socially okay so these people

676
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:47,529
need to do this thing on Tuesday and on

677
00:23:45,789 --> 00:23:49,509
Wednesday the bank teller has to smile

678
00:23:47,529 --> 00:23:50,830
at me right we have social rules that

679
00:23:49,509 --> 00:23:52,659
are meant to sort of offload some of

680
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:55,029
this work you know in common value

681
00:23:52,659 --> 00:23:56,860
systems but you know those things are

682
00:23:55,029 --> 00:23:58,450
just meant to get people to do stuff

683
00:23:56,860 --> 00:24:01,360
together it's not meant to get you to be

684
00:23:58,450 --> 00:24:02,799
happy healthy less alone right you know

685
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:04,840
so we've got this catch-22 situation

686
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:06,490
where we can perceive the projection of

687
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:08,049
ourselves through how other people treat

688
00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:09,789
us if they're being honest sometimes

689
00:24:08,049 --> 00:24:12,610
people are assholes and they lie to you

690
00:24:09,789 --> 00:24:13,960
about who you are and we can see other

691
00:24:12,610 --> 00:24:16,418
people through this lens of our own

692
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:18,340
lived experience that includes all of

693
00:24:16,419 --> 00:24:20,559
these glitches shortcuts like did I eat

694
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:23,019
breakfast and with someone mean to me on

695
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:25,418
the train you know and you know through

696
00:24:23,019 --> 00:24:26,930
all of these distortions and biases and

697
00:24:25,419 --> 00:24:29,390
distorted self believes right

698
00:24:26,930 --> 00:24:31,040
and and that's like having a two bit

699
00:24:29,390 --> 00:24:32,420
multimeter as your only piece of test

700
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:34,610
equipment that you can use to explore

701
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:36,830
the world but the world is all 16-bit

702
00:24:34,610 --> 00:24:38,959
color right and if you want your your

703
00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:40,490
experience and the things you build in

704
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:41,660
this world to be based in reality you're

705
00:24:40,490 --> 00:24:43,550
gonna have to take a lot of measurements

706
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:46,130
you're gonna have to time average them

707
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:48,409
and it's gonna be held in a buck right

708
00:24:46,130 --> 00:24:49,480
because that's that's we are single

709
00:24:48,410 --> 00:24:52,640
points in time

710
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:55,640
moving along together existentialism

711
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:57,800
what I want so and that's the end of the

712
00:24:55,640 --> 00:25:01,880
introduction so I'm at twenty four

713
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:03,139
minutes twenty four minutes and uh and I

714
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:05,420
forget what I have next but we're gonna

715
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:07,370
discover together so the rest of this

716
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:08,750
talk is focused on the how and why you

717
00:25:07,370 --> 00:25:10,850
might be interested in doing the

718
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:13,280
following with a couple of tips like

719
00:25:10,850 --> 00:25:15,820
this is actually a whole whole large

720
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:18,500
discipline like I mentioned of

721
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:20,540
introspection and meditation and going

722
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:22,160
to therapy and doing what people call

723
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:24,280
the work right like this is why people

724
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:26,390
go to al-anon this is why people go to

725
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:28,190
Alcoholics Anonymous this is why people

726
00:25:26,390 --> 00:25:31,280
join groups this is why people do

727
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:32,660
Toastmasters people come to conferences

728
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:34,520
right to try things out with their

729
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:37,670
friends in a safe environment this is

730
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:39,530
Society this is a lifelong problem but

731
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:41,330
maybe you know you want to know a little

732
00:25:39,530 --> 00:25:43,639
bit now about what it's like to

733
00:25:41,330 --> 00:25:45,470
dismantle sort of this lens of

734
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:47,540
perception into a more accurate heads-up

735
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:48,980
display that allows you to separate out

736
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:51,020
things that are about other people

737
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:53,510
things that are out them from things

738
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:55,490
that are about you because then you can

739
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:57,080
start to say okay you know what I think

740
00:25:55,490 --> 00:25:58,490
this is because I need to have a

741
00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:00,290
smoothie right now in a five minute

742
00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:01,640
break and when I do that I'm actually

743
00:26:00,290 --> 00:26:04,550
going to be able to solve this problem

744
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:07,490
and you want to be able to separate out

745
00:26:04,550 --> 00:26:09,320
this is about me from this is about them

746
00:26:07,490 --> 00:26:10,900
in part so you can understand the

747
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:13,399
difference between yourself and your

748
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:14,900
projection right like it took me a long

749
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:16,550
time to realize that the way I got

750
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:18,050
through college was my establishing a

751
00:26:16,550 --> 00:26:19,790
persona that I called woz where

752
00:26:18,050 --> 00:26:21,470
everyone's like us could do it oh you

753
00:26:19,790 --> 00:26:22,909
need something done she's got it done

754
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:24,200
for you and I was actually like sitting

755
00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:25,160
there on the inside being like oh my god

756
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:27,530
when you're people going to start

757
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:29,240
helping me do things oh I'm really tired

758
00:26:27,530 --> 00:26:31,100
right you see this with like every

759
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:33,920
harried mother who's constantly you know

760
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:35,209
managing the entire family and then she

761
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:36,590
just wants her husband to volunteer to

762
00:26:35,210 --> 00:26:38,000
do something or a partner right like the

763
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:39,620
domestic partner is doing all of this

764
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,340
work they just want the other person to

765
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:41,840
step in and

766
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:43,549
them with the work and then the other

767
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:46,129
person says well you should have asked

768
00:26:43,549 --> 00:26:48,049
me to do it you know not realizing how

769
00:26:46,130 --> 00:26:51,020
much pressure the the domestic partner

770
00:26:48,049 --> 00:26:52,400
is on right and and and you might not

771
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:54,289
realize that you were kind of setting

772
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:55,580
the relationship up to be that way right

773
00:26:54,289 --> 00:26:56,960
because of your projection and your

774
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:57,889
thing is all I got man I got it I got to

775
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:59,870
get everything done I got to be the

776
00:26:57,890 --> 00:27:01,549
perfect parent right or I've got to be

777
00:26:59,870 --> 00:27:03,139
the perfect provider or I've got to be

778
00:27:01,549 --> 00:27:06,168
the perfect hacker or I've got to be the

779
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:06,919
mostly right and and then you also want

780
00:27:06,169 --> 00:27:08,510
to understand the difference between

781
00:27:06,919 --> 00:27:10,340
other people's projections and

782
00:27:08,510 --> 00:27:11,990
themselves which isn't to say you should

783
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:13,580
go around psychoanalyzing everybody you

784
00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:16,669
meet and be like hey I have your number

785
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:20,629
I bet your mom with a very nice lady

786
00:27:16,669 --> 00:27:21,980
right so but but you do want to you do

787
00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:23,480
want to acknowledge that everyone else

788
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:24,770
is sort of projecting because they've

789
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:26,059
got their own thing going on cuz you

790
00:27:24,770 --> 00:27:28,279
might want to get to know them for real

791
00:27:26,059 --> 00:27:29,590
because then you'll have a friend right

792
00:27:28,279 --> 00:27:32,570
and someone you can trust

793
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:33,980
so I'm gonna say a couple of things with

794
00:27:32,570 --> 00:27:36,049
conviction that you probably won't agree

795
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:38,120
with and you probably wouldn't say on

796
00:27:36,049 --> 00:27:40,820
your own or maybe you really do believe

797
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:43,399
these things these data beliefs may

798
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:44,840
drive you to react and I'll get into a

799
00:27:43,399 --> 00:27:47,120
little bit about that later I'm just

800
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:49,600
gonna pick some it at random like normal

801
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:51,590
people aren't as smart as hackers or

802
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:53,809
real hackers don't waste their time on

803
00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:55,639
self-care because you know that's not

804
00:27:53,809 --> 00:27:57,799
productive time you could be writing

805
00:27:55,640 --> 00:28:00,850
code computers do exactly what you tell

806
00:27:57,799 --> 00:28:02,990
them to my code is self documenting and

807
00:28:00,850 --> 00:28:06,080
you know the work is the only thing that

808
00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:07,820
matters and your hard work will be

809
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:11,750
rewarded if it's good enough because

810
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:12,889
this is a genuine meritocracy and things

811
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:15,169
like you know what we're all hackers

812
00:28:12,890 --> 00:28:20,870
we're technologists we're very rational

813
00:28:15,169 --> 00:28:23,029
and everyone should learn Linux and the

814
00:28:20,870 --> 00:28:25,428
person who wrote my codebase before me

815
00:28:23,029 --> 00:28:26,690
was an idiot there's only one way to do

816
00:28:25,429 --> 00:28:29,240
this and I can't believe they did it the

817
00:28:26,690 --> 00:28:30,470
stupid way I'm gonna have to rip this up

818
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:31,120
and start over for it to be worth

819
00:28:30,470 --> 00:28:33,620
anything

820
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:34,789
now if you if you agreed with something

821
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:37,939
I'm not going to be able to demonstrate

822
00:28:34,789 --> 00:28:40,429
this point but if you're like really or

823
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:41,570
if you're like oh hell no right then

824
00:28:40,429 --> 00:28:44,000
you're experiencing something called

825
00:28:41,570 --> 00:28:45,500
cognitive dissonance that drives you to

826
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,049
sort of figure out where you stand in

827
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:49,640
relation to this and that cognitive

828
00:28:48,049 --> 00:28:51,408
dissonance is a result of your lived

829
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:53,430
experience right and again if you've

830
00:28:51,409 --> 00:28:54,630
argued with people on the internet and

831
00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:55,710
someone is actually saying what they

832
00:28:54,630 --> 00:28:58,560
believe and you think they're just

833
00:28:55,710 --> 00:29:00,480
trolling but they are being sincere you

834
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:02,760
will have pretty no appreciation for how

835
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:03,690
different people's viewpoints are even

836
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:08,250
though they're all moving through the

837
00:29:03,690 --> 00:29:10,110
same meatspace so we're gonna take 30

838
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:12,090
seconds to mentally rewrite some of the

839
00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:14,129
statements just in your own head to

840
00:29:12,090 --> 00:29:15,500
remove judgment and reduce it to an

841
00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:19,620
actual fact

842
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:20,760
like I'm gonna pick oh I didn't say this

843
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:22,469
one I'm gonna pick one I've heard where

844
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:24,360
women aren't good enough to do tech and

845
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:28,440
so that one's gonna take a lot of

846
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:30,659
rewriting I'm gonna say women were some

847
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:32,820
of the earliest technologists back when

848
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:37,740
it wasn't considered socially desirable

849
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:39,899
to do that sort of work but tech can be

850
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:41,160
hard but women are people too and we all

851
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:44,280
have the same basic processing

852
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:46,470
capability and there's a lot of bias to

853
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:49,020
deal with to get to other people

854
00:29:46,470 --> 00:29:51,210
understanding that right because when we

855
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:53,370
say these things that we believe to be

856
00:29:51,210 --> 00:29:56,940
true a lot of times they're judgements

857
00:29:53,370 --> 00:29:59,370
and they're not facts so step one in

858
00:29:56,940 --> 00:30:01,230
like understanding what you've got going

859
00:29:59,370 --> 00:30:03,379
on in your heads up display that's sort

860
00:30:01,230 --> 00:30:06,030
of distorting your view of the world is

861
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:07,350
talking to yourself and seeing what sort

862
00:30:06,030 --> 00:30:09,000
of things you say and looking at what

863
00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:11,040
you write and looking at what you tweet

864
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,510
and looking at why you tweet it and then

865
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:15,240
say holy okay hold on can i

866
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:17,550
rephrase this in the form of Fred Rogers

867
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:20,040
right kindergarten rules kindergarten

868
00:30:17,550 --> 00:30:22,800
rules what if I for a day had to go

869
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:24,780
through and talk to people like I was

870
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:26,940
mr. Rogers right there's a really cool

871
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:28,310
paper called Fred --is-- the special

872
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:30,990
language mr. Rogers used with children

873
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:33,570
because he actually knew how children

874
00:30:30,990 --> 00:30:35,040
hear things literally and he wanted to

875
00:30:33,570 --> 00:30:37,439
make sure that no one got left behind

876
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:39,149
and he applied so he basically he had

877
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:40,560
like a model of how children view the

878
00:30:39,150 --> 00:30:42,360
world he had a model of their lens of

879
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:44,730
perception and he did a pre

880
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:46,800
transformation for everything he said

881
00:30:44,730 --> 00:30:49,560
and did on that show to make sure that

882
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:51,629
it focused what he said in a way that

883
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:53,730
they could get it right he wanted to

884
00:30:51,630 --> 00:30:56,040
pitch it to them he didn't care about

885
00:30:53,730 --> 00:30:58,590
adults he wanted to make sure that any

886
00:30:56,040 --> 00:31:01,590
child hearing what he had to say felt

887
00:30:58,590 --> 00:31:03,570
heard and seen and important and that

888
00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:05,159
they got the message right so he did a

889
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:07,230
pre translation that's a huge amount of

890
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:08,880
emotional labor and you

891
00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:10,530
do that for yourself to figure out when

892
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:12,390
you're sort of saying crappy things

893
00:31:10,530 --> 00:31:13,860
either to yourself like oh my god I'm so

894
00:31:12,390 --> 00:31:16,470
stupid I can't believe I procrastinated

895
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:18,540
I'm an idiot right that's not factual

896
00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:19,740
you're probably quite smart yes you did

897
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:24,330
procrastinate but that's not the whole

898
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:26,070
story so another thing is our states of

899
00:31:24,330 --> 00:31:30,360
mind influence how we interpret facts

900
00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:31,830
and situations so we're all familiar the

901
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:34,590
literature I get this from is mind

902
00:31:31,830 --> 00:31:36,360
mindfulness literature and they like to

903
00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:38,189
call this thinking mind but I prefer to

904
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:39,689
call it rationalizing mind so that's

905
00:31:38,190 --> 00:31:40,950
when you are in an engagement and you're

906
00:31:39,690 --> 00:31:42,450
like I am being technically correct

907
00:31:40,950 --> 00:31:44,669
which we know is the best form of

908
00:31:42,450 --> 00:31:46,740
correctness you know and then you've got

909
00:31:44,669 --> 00:31:48,330
emotional mind which is where someone is

910
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:49,799
super amped up and they are not

911
00:31:48,330 --> 00:31:51,090
listening they need to make their point

912
00:31:49,799 --> 00:31:53,610
they need to be heard and like it's all

913
00:31:51,090 --> 00:31:55,080
the feels right and the thing to

914
00:31:53,610 --> 00:31:56,399
remember about people who are in

915
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:58,020
emotional mind and also you and you're

916
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:59,190
an emotional mind is no one's gonna

917
00:31:58,020 --> 00:32:00,600
remember if you were right

918
00:31:59,190 --> 00:32:04,080
they're only gonna remember how you made

919
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:05,850
them feel you know and we spend 90% of

920
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:07,590
our time as human beings bouncing

921
00:32:05,850 --> 00:32:09,059
between these two you know we're either

922
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:11,549
being like super like but technically

923
00:32:09,059 --> 00:32:14,730
you know or we're just like BAM reacting

924
00:32:11,549 --> 00:32:16,200
fast right and in either one of these

925
00:32:14,730 --> 00:32:18,090
states in both of these states we're not

926
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:20,130
playing with a full deck we rely really

927
00:32:18,090 --> 00:32:22,139
heavily on bias and judgments in these

928
00:32:20,130 --> 00:32:23,460
states force us you know to pick those

929
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:25,080
really quickly whether it's like a

930
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:26,760
preconceived notion or it's just a

931
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:29,159
knee-jerk reaction those are being

932
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:32,730
driven by rationalizing and emotional

933
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:34,049
reactions and you know in both of these

934
00:32:32,730 --> 00:32:36,270
states if you need to handle something

935
00:32:34,049 --> 00:32:37,770
complicated you're probably not going to

936
00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:39,179
do an optimal job of it right because

937
00:32:37,770 --> 00:32:40,590
you're not playing with a full deck like

938
00:32:39,179 --> 00:32:42,360
you're you're already relying on every

939
00:32:40,590 --> 00:32:44,010
shortcut you have it's like the CPU load

940
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:45,479
is super high because someone's you know

941
00:32:44,010 --> 00:32:46,440
doing stuff in the background there

942
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:48,210
maybe they installed malware on your

943
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:51,540
computer except it's native because

944
00:32:48,210 --> 00:32:53,520
maybe you're a samsung phone so you know

945
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:54,960
one of the important things to do is to

946
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:57,000
try to figure out how to find the middle

947
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:59,160
space which in mindfulness they refer to

948
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,720
is wise mind or wisdom where you're

949
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:02,820
pulling information from both but you're

950
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:04,799
not being driven by either these very

951
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:07,020
intellectual or very emotional reactions

952
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:08,910
because then you have options then you

953
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:10,710
like then it's like you just unlocked a

954
00:33:08,910 --> 00:33:12,030
new portion of the map right and you can

955
00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:15,929
go exploring in it and make better

956
00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:17,940
decisions yeah so here's the here's the

957
00:33:15,929 --> 00:33:18,840
chart of the distribution of probability

958
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:20,610
of time you spend here

959
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:23,459
very very small

960
00:33:20,610 --> 00:33:26,428
you are being wise without trying really

961
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:28,980
hard and a good way to identify where

962
00:33:26,429 --> 00:33:30,929
you're at right now is sort of like look

963
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:34,320
at your thoughts and see what they're

964
00:33:30,929 --> 00:33:36,480
like are you cool is everything slow are

965
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:38,850
you rational or you task-focused are you

966
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:40,620
surgical do you have a plan r15 people

967
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:42,959
get a margin line for your plan you

968
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:46,439
might be rationalizing your loot ruled

969
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:48,750
by logic and pragmatics and otherwise if

970
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:51,960
you're an emotional mind you might just

971
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:56,100
feel super urgent you're like wow right

972
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:57,870
and and it's a very intense experience

973
00:33:56,100 --> 00:34:01,199
you know and you might have a lot of

974
00:33:57,870 --> 00:34:02,279
feelings come up during it and I'm not

975
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:04,710
one I don't want to say that these

976
00:34:02,279 --> 00:34:05,970
states are bad right and that you should

977
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:07,649
feel bad if you're doing one or the

978
00:34:05,970 --> 00:34:09,179
other they both have information and

979
00:34:07,649 --> 00:34:12,359
that's the point they both have a lot of

980
00:34:09,179 --> 00:34:13,770
information we are social organisms your

981
00:34:12,359 --> 00:34:16,139
feelings give you a lot of information

982
00:34:13,770 --> 00:34:17,550
like you can have a hunch that tells you

983
00:34:16,139 --> 00:34:18,720
well that person I don't want to be

984
00:34:17,550 --> 00:34:20,849
standing next to them because they're

985
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:22,589
just there's something about it and you

986
00:34:20,849 --> 00:34:25,020
don't understand why but you're like I

987
00:34:22,589 --> 00:34:26,609
don't feel safe there or you know what

988
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:27,750
that doesn't look right or hey you know

989
00:34:26,609 --> 00:34:30,899
what there's something wrong with that

990
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:32,190
that that pakad value died I'll know

991
00:34:30,899 --> 00:34:33,899
what it is in a minute these things are

992
00:34:32,190 --> 00:34:36,839
giving you tons of information sort of

993
00:34:33,899 --> 00:34:39,359
below the radar and you want to combine

994
00:34:36,839 --> 00:34:41,129
that information to have a very sort of

995
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:44,250
accurate reference point for this moment

996
00:34:41,129 --> 00:34:46,679
right like I'm surrounded by my friends

997
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:47,849
and this is really awesome and I'm

998
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:50,190
really happy to be here

999
00:34:47,849 --> 00:34:55,169
even though I'm nervous right that's the

1000
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:58,050
reality and you know so when Buddhists

1001
00:34:55,168 --> 00:35:00,180
talk about letting go of attachment they

1002
00:34:58,050 --> 00:35:01,380
talk about letting go of all of the

1003
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:02,700
things that you sort of assumed to be

1004
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:03,839
true when you're in one State or the

1005
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:05,549
other where you're like no I'm in this

1006
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:07,680
state and I've got to stay in this state

1007
00:35:05,550 --> 00:35:09,150
like you can invert this to have like

1008
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:10,589
sort of a well of activation energy if

1009
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:12,599
you're super emotional it's hard to calm

1010
00:35:10,589 --> 00:35:14,910
down and if you're super rational it's

1011
00:35:12,599 --> 00:35:16,800
hard to listen to other people right and

1012
00:35:14,910 --> 00:35:18,629
it takes a lot of energy to say I'm

1013
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:20,160
going to try to sit above this and be as

1014
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:22,380
fair as I can even though this feels

1015
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:23,848
terrible and it's exhausting right like

1016
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:25,650
if you're being the good parent as

1017
00:35:23,849 --> 00:35:31,930
opposed to the parent who's like ah I

1018
00:35:25,650 --> 00:35:33,820
quit kids of yours and you know so

1019
00:35:31,930 --> 00:35:35,379
that's attachment to be one way or

1020
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:36,880
another to be like this has to be the

1021
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:37,770
way as opposed to saying I can have more

1022
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:39,640
perspective

1023
00:35:37,770 --> 00:35:40,870
so when Buddhists talk about letting go

1024
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:42,220
of attachment they don't mean that you

1025
00:35:40,870 --> 00:35:43,839
shouldn't care and you shouldn't feel

1026
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:45,730
and you shouldn't think and you

1027
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:47,380
shouldn't have a belief they mean that

1028
00:35:45,730 --> 00:35:48,010
you should just be aware of where you're

1029
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:50,230
coming from

1030
00:35:48,010 --> 00:35:52,300
and aware of your own state of mind be

1031
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:54,460
able to see and identify where you're at

1032
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:55,810
be able to see and identify what things

1033
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:57,700
are judgements what things are

1034
00:35:55,810 --> 00:36:01,150
assumptions what things are facts and

1035
00:35:57,700 --> 00:36:03,640
then like name them and identify them

1036
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:05,560
like leaves in a stream so that you can

1037
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:06,129
let them go and go think about something

1038
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:07,840
else

1039
00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:09,040
and the Lori's gonna come back there's

1040
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:11,980
always going to be more stuff flowing

1041
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:13,540
past but when you let them go that's

1042
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:15,550
when you can problem-solve so this is

1043
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:17,650
like the sort of introspective

1044
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:18,850
equivalent of going for a walk because

1045
00:36:17,650 --> 00:36:20,230
you need to figure out how to solve a

1046
00:36:18,850 --> 00:36:21,370
problem you're giving yourself a break

1047
00:36:20,230 --> 00:36:22,930
and you're moving past what you're

1048
00:36:21,370 --> 00:36:24,549
focused on you're saying I'm gonna let

1049
00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:26,140
go of the focus I'm gonna walk away from

1050
00:36:24,550 --> 00:36:28,630
the terminal I'm gonna go to the vending

1051
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:30,220
machine I'm gonna solder some stuff I'm

1052
00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:31,780
gonna play some video games and then I'm

1053
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:33,430
gonna come back because you're trying to

1054
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:35,970
let go of the problems so that you can

1055
00:36:33,430 --> 00:36:38,410
come back to it and solve it right

1056
00:36:35,970 --> 00:36:39,459
because if you were to stay in front of

1057
00:36:38,410 --> 00:36:40,899
your terminal and not get that

1058
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:42,340
perspective you would just repeat the

1059
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:44,980
same mistake over and over and over and

1060
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:46,750
over and over again so the parable of

1061
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:50,800
the two Buddhist monks demonstrates this

1062
00:36:46,750 --> 00:36:52,930
does anyone know this one yay okay so

1063
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:54,580
the parable of the monks arm an older

1064
00:36:52,930 --> 00:36:56,799
monk and a younger monk are walking down

1065
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:59,319
the road and they hear a ruckus and

1066
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:00,310
screaming so they run out to where they

1067
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:02,380
hear it from and there's a woman

1068
00:37:00,310 --> 00:37:03,670
drowning in the lake and the younger

1069
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:04,720
monk is like I don't what to do and so

1070
00:37:03,670 --> 00:37:07,120
the older monk jumps into the water

1071
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:08,620
grabs the woman pulls her out of the

1072
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:10,930
lake she's super sodden he really has to

1073
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:12,940
like drag her up onto the beach then he

1074
00:37:10,930 --> 00:37:15,580
has to turn her over knock the water out

1075
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:17,140
of her lungs give her CPR and then he

1076
00:37:15,580 --> 00:37:19,390
sits with her for an hour to make sure

1077
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:20,560
that she's okay before he moves on the

1078
00:37:19,390 --> 00:37:22,569
younger monk doesn't do anything during

1079
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:23,710
this time so then they pick up they get

1080
00:37:22,570 --> 00:37:26,860
their stuff they keep going down the

1081
00:37:23,710 --> 00:37:27,880
road about five hours later the younger

1082
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:31,630
monk finally speaks

1083
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:32,350
and he says hmm brother I I have I have

1084
00:37:31,630 --> 00:37:34,120
some concerns

1085
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:36,100
the older monk is oh you tell me you

1086
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:38,140
tell me about your concerns and the

1087
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:39,490
younger one says you touched that woman

1088
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:41,710
back there and you know we're not

1089
00:37:39,490 --> 00:37:43,959
supposed to touch women and the first

1090
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:45,130
ones the first one the older one says I

1091
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:48,039
see

1092
00:37:45,130 --> 00:37:49,690
I may have touched her body but you've

1093
00:37:48,039 --> 00:37:53,440
been the one carrying her with us for

1094
00:37:49,690 --> 00:37:55,390
the past five hours or we can have the

1095
00:37:53,440 --> 00:38:00,160
parable of Alison Mallory and the new QC

1096
00:37:55,390 --> 00:38:01,868
system so basically Alice and Mallory

1097
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:04,210
work on the same team and Alice has just

1098
00:38:01,869 --> 00:38:05,380
been promoted to team lead and she's

1099
00:38:04,210 --> 00:38:06,789
like you know what we really need to do

1100
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:08,289
better we need to implement unit tests

1101
00:38:06,789 --> 00:38:10,000
we need to implement code coverage we're

1102
00:38:08,289 --> 00:38:12,099
gonna have a QC system you're gonna QC

1103
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,059
your stuff it's gonna get QC to tested

1104
00:38:12,099 --> 00:38:15,160
before it gets deployed to production

1105
00:38:13,059 --> 00:38:17,559
and this is how we're going to improve

1106
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:19,450
productivity I've got it all figured out

1107
00:38:17,559 --> 00:38:20,740
and she like drops the docs on everybody

1108
00:38:19,450 --> 00:38:22,390
she gives like one or two trading

1109
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:25,269
presentations and then she's like okay

1110
00:38:22,390 --> 00:38:26,740
everybody go and Mallory you know rolls

1111
00:38:25,269 --> 00:38:27,939
into work and keep sana keeps on

1112
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:29,709
breaking the production build she

1113
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:31,869
doesn't really know how to run the test

1114
00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:33,400
she doesn't you know she just keeps on

1115
00:38:31,869 --> 00:38:35,529
doing things the old way and Alice gets

1116
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:36,910
like really irate and just like keeps

1117
00:38:35,529 --> 00:38:37,869
keeps working on the system be like

1118
00:38:36,910 --> 00:38:39,549
Mallory you've got to do a better job

1119
00:38:37,869 --> 00:38:41,319
you know and Briggs are in for some

1120
00:38:39,549 --> 00:38:42,609
pretty tense one-on-ones where she's

1121
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:43,480
like why aren't you doing this and

1122
00:38:42,609 --> 00:38:45,279
Mallory's like I don't want to talk

1123
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:47,410
about it like you know this is really

1124
00:38:45,279 --> 00:38:48,490
you know this is just difficult and then

1125
00:38:47,410 --> 00:38:50,170
Mallory starts talking at the

1126
00:38:48,490 --> 00:38:52,359
watercooler man this really sucks this

1127
00:38:50,170 --> 00:38:54,039
like process isn't really good you know

1128
00:38:52,359 --> 00:38:56,049
I don't know what I'm like I want to do

1129
00:38:54,039 --> 00:38:57,369
it the right way but like you know Alice

1130
00:38:56,049 --> 00:38:58,750
doesn't know what she's doing and it's

1131
00:38:57,369 --> 00:38:59,740
like super tense I'm like why did

1132
00:38:58,750 --> 00:39:01,809
everything change when she got promoted

1133
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:03,069
all this really sucks you know when

1134
00:39:01,809 --> 00:39:05,890
before long you've got a classic

1135
00:39:03,069 --> 00:39:07,119
management set up to fail scenario Alice

1136
00:39:05,890 --> 00:39:09,400
puts Mallory on a performance

1137
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:12,579
improvement plan and Mallory quits and

1138
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:18,789
uh you know do we know what happened

1139
00:39:12,579 --> 00:39:20,799
there do you have some ideas because we

1140
00:39:18,789 --> 00:39:22,390
actually don't know at all what happened

1141
00:39:20,799 --> 00:39:23,619
there but if you have ideas and you have

1142
00:39:22,390 --> 00:39:24,940
strong opinions and those opinions are

1143
00:39:23,619 --> 00:39:27,369
already forming that tells you a lot

1144
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:29,440
about yourself so we don't know what

1145
00:39:27,369 --> 00:39:30,970
happened with Alice maybe Alice wasn't

1146
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:32,559
good at talking to people maybe her

1147
00:39:30,970 --> 00:39:34,118
presentations weren't clear maybe her

1148
00:39:32,559 --> 00:39:36,250
process was convoluted maybe it made

1149
00:39:34,119 --> 00:39:39,250
sense to her not nobody else maybe

1150
00:39:36,250 --> 00:39:40,930
Mallory didn't care right I was just

1151
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:42,640
dragging her feet or maybe Mallory cared

1152
00:39:40,930 --> 00:39:44,440
but couldn't do it we don't know right

1153
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:46,058
like it's like know what like the the

1154
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:48,339
scenario doesn't include all of those

1155
00:39:46,059 --> 00:39:49,599
sort of internal details because we

1156
00:39:48,339 --> 00:39:50,769
don't have those about other people but

1157
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:52,180
if you find yourself like making

1158
00:39:50,769 --> 00:39:54,549
assumptions about someone else's

1159
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:57,279
intentions without information those

1160
00:39:54,549 --> 00:39:58,280
that data is about you it's not about

1161
00:39:57,279 --> 00:39:59,960
them

1162
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:02,810
so that's one way to separate out is

1163
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:04,820
this me or is it them because if you can

1164
00:40:02,810 --> 00:40:09,980
get that information on nothing it's

1165
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:12,050
about you so related let's let's

1166
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:13,970
practice what noting is like so this is

1167
00:40:12,050 --> 00:40:15,710
called the four seven eight or relaxing

1168
00:40:13,970 --> 00:40:17,930
breathing exercise it's a very yoga

1169
00:40:15,710 --> 00:40:20,420
thing to do and it's basically really

1170
00:40:17,930 --> 00:40:22,669
simple we're gonna breathe in for four

1171
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:27,070
seconds hold it for seven and then

1172
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:27,070
breathe out for eight so breathe in

1173
00:40:31,330 --> 00:40:50,500
breathe out now do it again

1174
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:50,500
breathe in hold it now breathe out

1175
00:40:52,270 --> 00:40:57,470
keep breathing while I'm talking so I

1176
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:59,629
want you to exhale completely through

1177
00:40:57,470 --> 00:41:02,509
your mouth and for the fun of it do make

1178
00:40:59,630 --> 00:41:05,420
a whoosh sound so we're gonna take a few

1179
00:41:02,510 --> 00:41:07,880
seconds to stop and note and so while

1180
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:11,120
you're breathing in and breathing out

1181
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:13,820
slowly I want you to try to observe how

1182
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:17,540
you feel do you have any particular

1183
00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:20,570
sensation in your body right now are you

1184
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:24,050
experiencing any particular emotions

1185
00:41:20,570 --> 00:41:27,050
that you can identify keep breathing and

1186
00:41:24,050 --> 00:41:28,900
try to name those emotions if the

1187
00:41:27,050 --> 00:41:31,850
emotion comes with a physical sensation

1188
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:34,730
try to describe it to yourself maybe

1189
00:41:31,850 --> 00:41:36,680
your hands are tingly maybe your fingers

1190
00:41:34,730 --> 00:41:41,090
feel cold or you have tension in your

1191
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:44,299
shoulders keep breathing and see if the

1192
00:41:41,090 --> 00:41:47,660
emotion has any reaction or action urge

1193
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:50,120
that comes with it do you know what that

1194
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:53,480
urge is can you name it or is it not

1195
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:55,549
particularly specific as you keep

1196
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:58,340
breathing do you have any idea where

1197
00:41:55,550 --> 00:42:01,010
that urge might be coming from and can

1198
00:41:58,340 --> 00:42:05,390
you just name that without judging it

1199
00:42:01,010 --> 00:42:07,580
and then move on to the next feeling to

1200
00:42:05,390 --> 00:42:10,440
see that come through

1201
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:14,400
can you describe for yourself the way

1202
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:18,690
the air feels right now and then note

1203
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:27,600
any sounds either inside or outside the

1204
00:42:18,690 --> 00:42:32,820
dome breathe in and breathe out and when

1205
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:35,040
you feel ready come back to the room so

1206
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:37,110
that's that's a breathing and noting

1207
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:38,820
exercise and the things you know they're

1208
00:42:37,110 --> 00:42:41,000
just your thoughts and feelings they're

1209
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:43,230
not who you are you know that's not

1210
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:44,220
dictating where you're coming from or

1211
00:42:43,230 --> 00:42:45,600
where are you going today it's just

1212
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:47,580
stuff you're carrying around in your

1213
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:49,470
backpack cuz we're Magpies and we pick

1214
00:42:47,580 --> 00:42:50,790
up shiny and painful feelings and we put

1215
00:42:49,470 --> 00:42:55,200
them in our backpack and keep them with

1216
00:42:50,790 --> 00:42:58,470
us for whole time because your objective

1217
00:42:55,200 --> 00:43:00,930
in being an effective person it's trying

1218
00:42:58,470 --> 00:43:05,970
to get to the zone of Awesome where

1219
00:43:00,930 --> 00:43:09,419
you've got your side their side and the

1220
00:43:05,970 --> 00:43:11,040
truth and like I mentioned earlier one

1221
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:13,590
of the things that forced me to actually

1222
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:14,970
look at myself and improving myself so I

1223
00:43:13,590 --> 00:43:16,410
could be less of a dick to the people

1224
00:43:14,970 --> 00:43:18,600
around me because I was being super

1225
00:43:16,410 --> 00:43:20,220
perfectionistic and driving myself

1226
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:21,870
really hard and that made me drive other

1227
00:43:20,220 --> 00:43:23,160
people's really hard and made it not fun

1228
00:43:21,870 --> 00:43:24,569
to work with me on a team because I was

1229
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:27,120
taking everything too seriously because

1230
00:43:24,570 --> 00:43:28,560
oh my god I wanted to save babies right

1231
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:29,880
but that's not an effective way to save

1232
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:30,990
babies if people are constantly saying

1233
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:35,340
like screw you I don't want to work on

1234
00:43:30,990 --> 00:43:37,410
your project is it takes to to fight and

1235
00:43:35,340 --> 00:43:38,730
then I ran into a person in the grocery

1236
00:43:37,410 --> 00:43:41,600
line I learned awesome things from

1237
00:43:38,730 --> 00:43:45,180
strangers I I had one person tell me

1238
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:46,319
don't should all over yourself like if

1239
00:43:45,180 --> 00:43:47,609
you're constantly saying to yourself oh

1240
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:49,380
I should be doing this and I should be

1241
00:43:47,610 --> 00:43:51,660
doing that like stop and maybe say what

1242
00:43:49,380 --> 00:43:53,040
do I want to be doing cuz right now I'm

1243
00:43:51,660 --> 00:43:55,799
just go ting myself and making myself

1244
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:57,630
feel bad and the person in the grocery

1245
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:59,670
line said you know what there's always

1246
00:43:57,630 --> 00:44:01,110
three sides to every story your side

1247
00:43:59,670 --> 00:44:05,280
their side of the truth and I'm like oh

1248
00:44:01,110 --> 00:44:07,170
my god this is great because you really

1249
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:09,240
want to get to that like awesome zone of

1250
00:44:07,170 --> 00:44:10,890
wind because that's when you are aligned

1251
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:12,689
with the people next to you and you can

1252
00:44:10,890 --> 00:44:14,310
put your little flashlight so singular

1253
00:44:12,690 --> 00:44:14,700
perspective together and map out more of

1254
00:44:14,310 --> 00:44:18,350
the world

1255
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:20,370
that's effectiveness that's leverage and

1256
00:44:18,350 --> 00:44:21,150
and you know I don't want you to forget

1257
00:44:20,370 --> 00:44:24,749
that you're human

1258
00:44:21,150 --> 00:44:27,509
right so this stuff is not easy to do

1259
00:44:24,749 --> 00:44:29,549
you are constantly running a huge amount

1260
00:44:27,509 --> 00:44:31,710
of cognitive tasks you're doing 15

1261
00:44:29,549 --> 00:44:33,329
million things like you're running

1262
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:35,130
biological processes you might have

1263
00:44:33,329 --> 00:44:36,539
tissue that's damaged in healing you've

1264
00:44:35,130 --> 00:44:37,980
got a lot going on in your emotional

1265
00:44:36,539 --> 00:44:39,930
life you've got a lot going on with were

1266
00:44:37,980 --> 00:44:41,430
cute they're people you care about and

1267
00:44:39,930 --> 00:44:43,470
you wonder if you're going to be able to

1268
00:44:41,430 --> 00:44:46,169
help them right like there's in the

1269
00:44:43,470 --> 00:44:47,519
news all of these things you know put

1270
00:44:46,170 --> 00:44:49,529
cognitive load on you so that's why you

1271
00:44:47,519 --> 00:44:52,979
see President Obama our former President

1272
00:44:49,529 --> 00:44:54,539
Obama make shortcuts like he has or the

1273
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:57,390
fly let's talk about the fly let's keep

1274
00:44:54,539 --> 00:44:59,099
it nerdy his suits are all the same so

1275
00:44:57,390 --> 00:45:00,779
he doesn't have to think about it he's

1276
00:44:59,099 --> 00:45:03,420
like optimize I'm gonna spend that

1277
00:45:00,779 --> 00:45:09,210
brainpower on you know doing weird

1278
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:11,039
mutant so oh you know you uh so

1279
00:45:09,210 --> 00:45:13,410
you're like okay so you've given me this

1280
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:16,140
thing that scares me about myself and

1281
00:45:13,410 --> 00:45:18,089
how the do I you know get to the

1282
00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:19,499
real heart of somebody else given that

1283
00:45:18,089 --> 00:45:21,058
we're having all of these proxy

1284
00:45:19,499 --> 00:45:23,578
interactions right you just told me that

1285
00:45:21,059 --> 00:45:26,160
you never really know another person so

1286
00:45:23,579 --> 00:45:30,089
it's all done by proxy ah what do I do

1287
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:32,038
and you know at best you infer who you

1288
00:45:30,089 --> 00:45:34,190
are through introspection and try to

1289
00:45:32,039 --> 00:45:36,900
like shrink the size of your projection

1290
00:45:34,190 --> 00:45:38,130
down to yourself and that doesn't mean

1291
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:39,539
you have to be yourself with everybody

1292
00:45:38,130 --> 00:45:41,249
it means you control when you're

1293
00:45:39,539 --> 00:45:43,259
projecting something versus when you're

1294
00:45:41,249 --> 00:45:44,578
not right like if you've got to have the

1295
00:45:43,259 --> 00:45:46,410
work force onna because you work with a

1296
00:45:44,579 --> 00:45:48,980
bunch of terrible people okay but maybe

1297
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:52,529
you don't want to wear that at home and

1298
00:45:48,980 --> 00:45:54,390
you know and then similarly you try to

1299
00:45:52,529 --> 00:45:56,430
make accurate observations about other

1300
00:45:54,390 --> 00:45:58,440
people keeping in mind that your lens is

1301
00:45:56,430 --> 00:46:01,410
distorted so like sometimes that means

1302
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:03,450
calling it insane I really stubbed my

1303
00:46:01,410 --> 00:46:04,920
toe I have a twisted ankle I am going to

1304
00:46:03,450 --> 00:46:06,118
do all that it's productive with

1305
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:07,650
interacting with other people I am going

1306
00:46:06,119 --> 00:46:10,920
home I am eating ice cream and I'm

1307
00:46:07,650 --> 00:46:13,529
playing video games right you know so

1308
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:15,509
you can you can learn by noting about

1309
00:46:13,529 --> 00:46:17,160
yourself you can try to observe other

1310
00:46:15,509 --> 00:46:18,480
people you can practice separating those

1311
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:21,779
two things out until you get an accurate

1312
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:23,849
picture and this is also probably

1313
00:46:21,779 --> 00:46:26,400
usually pretty challenging for people in

1314
00:46:23,849 --> 00:46:28,680
Comp Sci and security based on everybody

1315
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:31,380
I know but practicing compassion is

1316
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:34,230
really hard but practicing compassion to

1317
00:46:31,380 --> 00:46:37,290
yourself practicing compassion to others

1318
00:46:34,230 --> 00:46:39,359
is being effective if you can't think of

1319
00:46:37,290 --> 00:46:43,230
anything nice about anybody else

1320
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:45,330
try saying I'm a good person I hold the

1321
00:46:43,230 --> 00:46:48,000
door open for other people sometimes and

1322
00:46:45,330 --> 00:46:49,140
I am kind to small animals because if

1323
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:51,750
those things are true it creates a

1324
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:53,460
little window right and if you don't

1325
00:46:51,750 --> 00:46:54,720
have that window or you want to know how

1326
00:46:53,460 --> 00:46:55,440
big your window is like do you have a

1327
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:56,490
big window

1328
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:57,990
do you have like floor-to-ceiling

1329
00:46:56,490 --> 00:47:00,299
windows are you looking out of a

1330
00:46:57,990 --> 00:47:02,759
periscope there's this thing called the

1331
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:04,530
self compassion score it's like 20

1332
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:06,480
questions and it's you know actually

1333
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:08,880
research driven and therapy driven but

1334
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:11,400
it gives you questions like when I'm

1335
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:14,010
really into to note on you know 1 2 5

1336
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:15,540
things like when I'm really struggling I

1337
00:47:14,010 --> 00:47:18,240
tend to feel like other people must be

1338
00:47:15,540 --> 00:47:19,950
having an easier time of it or I'm

1339
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:21,868
intolerant and impatient towards those

1340
00:47:19,950 --> 00:47:23,759
aspects of my personality that I don't

1341
00:47:21,869 --> 00:47:24,990
like in which case you might be shooting

1342
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:27,840
all over yourself all the time and

1343
00:47:24,990 --> 00:47:30,720
driving up the system load or you might

1344
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:32,369
actually say a 5 on I try to see my

1345
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:36,930
failings as part of the human condition

1346
00:47:32,369 --> 00:47:38,609
I don't always succeed but I try mmm

1347
00:47:36,930 --> 00:47:40,740
because if you can't hold yourself in

1348
00:47:38,609 --> 00:47:42,600
compassion you know and go through and

1349
00:47:40,740 --> 00:47:43,830
actually sort of give yourself the

1350
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:47,009
benefit of the doubt you're only playing

1351
00:47:43,830 --> 00:47:48,210
with a quarter of a deck and you're

1352
00:47:47,010 --> 00:47:50,340
going to have a really hard time giving

1353
00:47:48,210 --> 00:47:52,619
other people a fair shake like it's not

1354
00:47:50,340 --> 00:47:54,450
just about damming who you are and

1355
00:47:52,619 --> 00:47:56,100
taking care of everybody else you know

1356
00:47:54,450 --> 00:47:57,990
you've got to put on your own oxygen

1357
00:47:56,100 --> 00:47:59,930
mask before you put on somebody else's

1358
00:47:57,990 --> 00:48:02,339
because it is a reciprocal social

1359
00:47:59,930 --> 00:48:03,390
relationship and you know everybody

1360
00:48:02,340 --> 00:48:05,970
needs to be taking care of themselves

1361
00:48:03,390 --> 00:48:08,609
because just like you can't own other

1362
00:48:05,970 --> 00:48:10,140
people's stuff no one else can own yours

1363
00:48:08,609 --> 00:48:11,460
only you can really take care of

1364
00:48:10,140 --> 00:48:14,129
yourself and then put yourself in a good

1365
00:48:11,460 --> 00:48:16,140
position to help others or confound

1366
00:48:14,130 --> 00:48:17,609
others or smash the competition or

1367
00:48:16,140 --> 00:48:19,410
whatever it is you want to do like you

1368
00:48:17,609 --> 00:48:21,779
don't have to be altruistic to be

1369
00:48:19,410 --> 00:48:26,069
effective but you do have to take care

1370
00:48:21,780 --> 00:48:27,690
of yourself and you know the self care

1371
00:48:26,070 --> 00:48:29,460
of this mining for operational margin

1372
00:48:27,690 --> 00:48:32,220
which is you know actually way more

1373
00:48:29,460 --> 00:48:34,290
valuable than Bitcoin is you know driven

1374
00:48:32,220 --> 00:48:36,569
by stuff like it's hard it's hard right

1375
00:48:34,290 --> 00:48:38,100
it will bring up every insecurities you

1376
00:48:36,570 --> 00:48:39,570
have like there's a good article here

1377
00:48:38,100 --> 00:48:41,368
that I like because she actually lists

1378
00:48:39,570 --> 00:48:42,480
out why it's hard like you take care of

1379
00:48:41,369 --> 00:48:44,100
yourself and you feel like there's

1380
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:45,960
starving children in Africa why am I

1381
00:48:44,100 --> 00:48:47,620
getting the mani pedi you know cuz many

1382
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:49,450
pennies are self-care

1383
00:48:47,620 --> 00:48:51,279
maybe self-care is having breakfast

1384
00:48:49,450 --> 00:48:54,580
every day maybe self-care is taking time

1385
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:55,780
to see your friends right you know but

1386
00:48:54,580 --> 00:48:58,299
it's the only thing that'll take you

1387
00:48:55,780 --> 00:49:00,430
through and there's another article I

1388
00:48:58,300 --> 00:49:01,990
really like because I you know try to

1389
00:49:00,430 --> 00:49:03,609
find and identify with other people

1390
00:49:01,990 --> 00:49:07,089
going through things and there's an MIT

1391
00:49:03,610 --> 00:49:08,530
admissions blog entry about meltdown

1392
00:49:07,090 --> 00:49:10,750
where this young woman is basically

1393
00:49:08,530 --> 00:49:12,070
saying she was having a really hard time

1394
00:49:10,750 --> 00:49:14,050
she was thinking about dropping out of

1395
00:49:12,070 --> 00:49:17,560
school and everyone's like oh I think I

1396
00:49:14,050 --> 00:49:18,610
see your problem you only stay happy to

1397
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:20,590
the extent that it helps you be a better

1398
00:49:18,610 --> 00:49:22,450
scientist and you only take care of

1399
00:49:20,590 --> 00:49:24,610
yourself to the extent that it helps you

1400
00:49:22,450 --> 00:49:26,740
be a better scientist and that's not the

1401
00:49:24,610 --> 00:49:28,270
right reason to go on living right

1402
00:49:26,740 --> 00:49:30,939
you've got to actually take care of

1403
00:49:28,270 --> 00:49:32,290
yourself so I'm gonna run through the

1404
00:49:30,940 --> 00:49:33,910
last slides pretty quickly before I run

1405
00:49:32,290 --> 00:49:35,950
out of time but here are the tools you

1406
00:49:33,910 --> 00:49:39,160
use right so you've got tools to debug

1407
00:49:35,950 --> 00:49:41,169
yourself you can note and try to be

1408
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:42,339
compassionate and non-judgmental when

1409
00:49:41,170 --> 00:49:43,540
you think about where you're at where

1410
00:49:42,340 --> 00:49:46,030
you're coming from and where you want to

1411
00:49:43,540 --> 00:49:47,860
go and you know admittedly that process

1412
00:49:46,030 --> 00:49:49,990
is going to be scary and you can

1413
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:51,550
practice naming those feelings or doing

1414
00:49:49,990 --> 00:49:53,379
mindfulness practice like the exercise I

1415
00:49:51,550 --> 00:49:55,240
just walked through you can talk to a

1416
00:49:53,380 --> 00:49:56,560
friend about the situation so in the

1417
00:49:55,240 --> 00:49:58,299
work situation I talked to one of my

1418
00:49:56,560 --> 00:50:00,910
best friends I tried to outline

1419
00:49:58,300 --> 00:50:03,010
everything you know really reasonably to

1420
00:50:00,910 --> 00:50:05,440
her and her feedback to me was you are

1421
00:50:03,010 --> 00:50:07,570
being an asshole right she reflected me

1422
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:08,740
back to myself accurately right I was

1423
00:50:07,570 --> 00:50:09,880
honest with her and she's like here's

1424
00:50:08,740 --> 00:50:11,799
the truth about you you don't want to

1425
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:13,480
see it but you're being a dick and you

1426
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:17,170
need to go apologize which I did it

1427
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:19,360
didn't work but I did it you know and if

1428
00:50:17,170 --> 00:50:22,060
that's too much you can talk to a

1429
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:23,380
therapist this is their job right if you

1430
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:26,020
are working on things like cognitive

1431
00:50:23,380 --> 00:50:27,850
distortions then a cognitive behavioral

1432
00:50:26,020 --> 00:50:29,259
therapist can help you with that right

1433
00:50:27,850 --> 00:50:31,779
if you have to sort it thinking from

1434
00:50:29,260 --> 00:50:33,850
someone who's like just skewed your

1435
00:50:31,780 --> 00:50:35,680
worldview and you're like how do I get

1436
00:50:33,850 --> 00:50:38,620
to a different worldview given that this

1437
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:40,149
is where I'm at that's what CBT is if

1438
00:50:38,620 --> 00:50:42,580
you're working on things like man I get

1439
00:50:40,150 --> 00:50:44,020
angry at the drop of a hat or I'm just

1440
00:50:42,580 --> 00:50:45,880
so anxious all the time I can't even

1441
00:50:44,020 --> 00:50:47,770
think straight and that's usually the

1442
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:49,810
purview of dialectical behavioral

1443
00:50:47,770 --> 00:50:51,580
therapy or DBT which is usually done in

1444
00:50:49,810 --> 00:50:52,990
a group setting so that you can kind of

1445
00:50:51,580 --> 00:50:55,029
role model from all of the people around

1446
00:50:52,990 --> 00:50:56,560
you right like work on it with a group

1447
00:50:55,030 --> 00:50:58,240
and a care team

1448
00:50:56,560 --> 00:51:00,370
DBT helps people with borderline

1449
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:01,450
personality disorder be functional and

1450
00:51:00,370 --> 00:51:03,700
effective the founder

1451
00:51:01,450 --> 00:51:05,140
borderline personality disorder but you

1452
00:51:03,700 --> 00:51:07,000
know these things are you know good if

1453
00:51:05,140 --> 00:51:10,000
you have trauma they're good if you have

1454
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:11,980
PTSD they're good if you don't they're

1455
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:13,299
good if you just grew up lonely or if

1456
00:51:11,980 --> 00:51:14,829
you just don't know what you want and

1457
00:51:13,299 --> 00:51:16,540
you need like a little bit of help to

1458
00:51:14,829 --> 00:51:18,309
figure that out so that you can go

1459
00:51:16,540 --> 00:51:19,960
happily to Deline along on your way like

1460
00:51:18,309 --> 00:51:22,299
there's nothing wrong with getting help

1461
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:24,640
to have someone reflect you back to

1462
00:51:22,299 --> 00:51:27,759
yourself when you don't have a mirror in

1463
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:30,700
your apartment right and Tulsa debug

1464
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:32,530
others are things like you know the same

1465
00:51:30,700 --> 00:51:34,899
way you set up to solve an engineering

1466
00:51:32,530 --> 00:51:36,819
problem be clear when you go in about

1467
00:51:34,900 --> 00:51:37,329
what you're trying to do just be honest

1468
00:51:36,819 --> 00:51:39,609
with yourself

1469
00:51:37,329 --> 00:51:41,710
am I going into that office to make a

1470
00:51:39,609 --> 00:51:43,960
make a deal and like get a new person on

1471
00:51:41,710 --> 00:51:46,059
my team you know do I have a task or

1472
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:48,609
goal in mind am i going into that office

1473
00:51:46,059 --> 00:51:50,319
because I know that I really want that

1474
00:51:48,609 --> 00:51:51,578
person to work with me and I may not

1475
00:51:50,319 --> 00:51:53,829
think that they have the right answer

1476
00:51:51,579 --> 00:51:55,089
but their relationship is important and

1477
00:51:53,829 --> 00:51:57,130
I know that some day we're gonna do

1478
00:51:55,089 --> 00:51:58,900
better work together or am I going in

1479
00:51:57,130 --> 00:52:00,430
that office because I need to feel self

1480
00:51:58,900 --> 00:52:01,720
respect this person it's pushing me

1481
00:52:00,430 --> 00:52:02,558
around and god damn and I'm not gonna

1482
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:04,990
take it anymore

1483
00:52:02,559 --> 00:52:06,910
right what are your goals if you know

1484
00:52:04,990 --> 00:52:08,558
those and act in an integrity with them

1485
00:52:06,910 --> 00:52:09,940
you'll have an easier time whereas like

1486
00:52:08,559 --> 00:52:11,980
if you say I'm trying to get the task

1487
00:52:09,940 --> 00:52:14,440
done but really you just want to pick a

1488
00:52:11,980 --> 00:52:17,890
fight you're not gonna get the task done

1489
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:19,900
and if fights gonna go badly then you

1490
00:52:17,890 --> 00:52:22,390
know with other people you don't want to

1491
00:52:19,900 --> 00:52:23,710
put all of your stuff on them right if

1492
00:52:22,390 --> 00:52:26,529
you're asking someone for something

1493
00:52:23,710 --> 00:52:27,819
project that you're calm right try not

1494
00:52:26,530 --> 00:52:29,200
to be manipulative I mean I know that

1495
00:52:27,819 --> 00:52:30,819
this would be plus ten to social

1496
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:32,500
engineering but usually you are

1497
00:52:30,819 --> 00:52:34,990
effective in social engineering when you

1498
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:37,599
take the work off of somebody else right

1499
00:52:34,990 --> 00:52:41,259
so like spend a little time be confident

1500
00:52:37,599 --> 00:52:43,569
be calm be willing be open listen

1501
00:52:41,260 --> 00:52:45,730
actively like you have to learn about

1502
00:52:43,569 --> 00:52:46,960
other people by kind of situationally

1503
00:52:45,730 --> 00:52:48,910
observing them in different settings

1504
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:50,940
right if you're not paying attention

1505
00:52:48,910 --> 00:52:53,770
you're not learning anything about them

1506
00:52:50,940 --> 00:52:56,140
then you need to you know validate the

1507
00:52:53,770 --> 00:52:57,759
valid like active listening isn't I know

1508
00:52:56,140 --> 00:52:59,500
what you're gonna say and then tuning

1509
00:52:57,760 --> 00:53:02,440
them out maybe they'll surprise you

1510
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:03,849
people will surprise you make space

1511
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:05,829
during the interaction for things to

1512
00:53:03,849 --> 00:53:07,780
happen don't script everything in your

1513
00:53:05,829 --> 00:53:09,700
life because you're convinced it has

1514
00:53:07,780 --> 00:53:11,680
only one way to go that's very very

1515
00:53:09,700 --> 00:53:14,890
rational right but it's also very very

1516
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:17,319
narrow and I just

1517
00:53:14,890 --> 00:53:18,788
your tactics right like things are gonna

1518
00:53:17,319 --> 00:53:20,319
change people are gonna throw you four

1519
00:53:18,789 --> 00:53:22,119
curbs but you're smart you're flexible

1520
00:53:20,319 --> 00:53:25,990
and you can figure it out but you have

1521
00:53:22,119 --> 00:53:27,130
to stay on your feet this is why I like

1522
00:53:25,990 --> 00:53:29,589
when you're doing martial arts you stay

1523
00:53:27,130 --> 00:53:31,180
centered and calm again wisdom the best

1524
00:53:29,589 --> 00:53:32,890
of both worlds so that you can just sort

1525
00:53:31,180 --> 00:53:35,200
of move with what you have to do as

1526
00:53:32,890 --> 00:53:38,259
opposed to entrenched rigid and

1527
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:39,220
predetermined so I saw a pretty cool

1528
00:53:38,260 --> 00:53:40,839
tweet for a friend that demonstrates

1529
00:53:39,220 --> 00:53:43,689
this cuz you should do some low stake

1530
00:53:40,839 --> 00:53:45,430
team-building exercises like um try to

1531
00:53:43,690 --> 00:53:47,769
describe something you want your friend

1532
00:53:45,430 --> 00:53:49,960
to draw through a wall or you can play

1533
00:53:47,769 --> 00:53:52,209
games and uh we'll see I don't think I

1534
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:54,099
have time for this but the MIT mystery

1535
00:53:52,210 --> 00:53:56,289
hunt had a challenge two years ago where

1536
00:53:54,099 --> 00:53:59,859
you had to recite password strings to

1537
00:53:56,289 --> 00:54:01,480
another player it's at ten minutes on

1538
00:53:59,859 --> 00:54:02,619
the mystery hunt documentary I really

1539
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:03,970
recommend you watch it because it's

1540
00:54:02,619 --> 00:54:05,980
hilarious and it shows you how people

1541
00:54:03,970 --> 00:54:07,480
interact together and how they build a

1542
00:54:05,980 --> 00:54:08,829
rapport in a relationship in order to

1543
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:10,740
solve this problem with you know both

1544
00:54:08,829 --> 00:54:14,559
people passing the issue back and forth

1545
00:54:10,740 --> 00:54:16,839
you know and again this is a summary of

1546
00:54:14,559 --> 00:54:18,279
how much emotional work and emotional

1547
00:54:16,839 --> 00:54:20,619
labor all this is yes it is a lot of

1548
00:54:18,279 --> 00:54:22,240
work this is why managers get paid what

1549
00:54:20,619 --> 00:54:23,950
they do because they do this work for a

1550
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:25,169
team and as you go along one side it's

1551
00:54:23,950 --> 00:54:27,700
increasingly more like therapy

1552
00:54:25,170 --> 00:54:30,309
everything from pitching things like mr.

1553
00:54:27,700 --> 00:54:32,529
Rogers does to you know sorting out and

1554
00:54:30,309 --> 00:54:33,730
and fixing miscommunications by figuring

1555
00:54:32,529 --> 00:54:35,440
out where each person is coming from

1556
00:54:33,730 --> 00:54:38,349
even though they might not know right

1557
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:40,660
that's management's job but if your team

1558
00:54:38,349 --> 00:54:42,970
members do some of this thing like role

1559
00:54:40,660 --> 00:54:44,348
modelling right and setting values and

1560
00:54:42,970 --> 00:54:46,029
setting clear boundaries and being

1561
00:54:44,349 --> 00:54:47,680
consistent then the whole team will work

1562
00:54:46,029 --> 00:54:48,940
better together which is to say if

1563
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:50,379
you're very clear about where you're

1564
00:54:48,940 --> 00:54:51,759
coming from and why you'll have an

1565
00:54:50,380 --> 00:54:56,680
easier time interfacing with other

1566
00:54:51,759 --> 00:54:58,390
people's api's and you know again let go

1567
00:54:56,680 --> 00:55:00,788
of control you've got to be vulnerable

1568
00:54:58,390 --> 00:55:02,500
to build trust if people don't know who

1569
00:55:00,789 --> 00:55:04,059
you are they're not going to trust you

1570
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:05,289
they're not gonna listen to you

1571
00:55:04,059 --> 00:55:07,269
and you're not gonna see the real them

1572
00:55:05,289 --> 00:55:09,609
right so don't hold the reins of power

1573
00:55:07,269 --> 00:55:11,828
tightly if you get the chance to work

1574
00:55:09,609 --> 00:55:14,410
with people hold them loosely and give

1575
00:55:11,829 --> 00:55:17,309
them that open space to trust you and

1576
00:55:14,410 --> 00:55:19,868
help you in ways you might not expect

1577
00:55:17,309 --> 00:55:22,470
because this can make you a much better

1578
00:55:19,869 --> 00:55:26,250
developer and technologist

1579
00:55:22,470 --> 00:55:28,169
and it's a lifelong practice and you may

1580
00:55:26,250 --> 00:55:30,060
not have the skills yet and you may not

1581
00:55:28,170 --> 00:55:31,859
know what you want but you've got like

1582
00:55:30,060 --> 00:55:34,078
how many decades to work on it if you

1583
00:55:31,859 --> 00:55:35,339
want to this stuff can slow you down but

1584
00:55:34,079 --> 00:55:36,180
it can't stop you you're all way too

1585
00:55:35,339 --> 00:55:39,390
smart for that

1586
00:55:36,180 --> 00:55:41,640
and there are worse things to be than

1587
00:55:39,390 --> 00:55:43,440
human right it's actually pretty cool

1588
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:48,810
because then you get a friend it's

1589
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:49,770
dangerous to go along take this much

1590
00:55:48,810 --> 00:55:52,470
worse things to be

1591
00:55:49,770 --> 00:56:10,538
thank you very much

1592
00:55:52,470 --> 00:56:10,538
[Applause]
