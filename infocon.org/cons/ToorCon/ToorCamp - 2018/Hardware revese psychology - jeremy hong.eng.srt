1
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:59,120
there are some FPGA or

2
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:09,550
most of my background actually where I

3
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:12,669
actually worked on a quarterly report

4
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:15,789
and where it's just about the signal

5
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:18,340
integrity with the or a manager like

6
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:21,250
that those quite an eye-opening

7
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:24,310
experience it's like a combination of

8
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:27,580
our concepts and this is like

9
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:30,160
high-performance multi-layer PCB and

10
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:32,440
just Melanie all together making sure

11
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:34,810
nothing interferes with each other and

12
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:42,460
making sure they get to the point

13
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:46,149
I didn't learn at school if other times

14
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:48,220
I do electronics and cambria so what did

15
00:01:46,149 --> 00:01:54,130
one to say that my life completely

16
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:59,189
revolves around anyone going to take the

17
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:59,189
hand test after this good job guys

18
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:07,509
yeah so if any of you guys around the

19
00:02:04,329 --> 00:02:10,049
East Coast or a way to travel off last

20
00:02:07,509 --> 00:02:12,120
month was a state convention which is

21
00:02:10,049 --> 00:02:14,260
becoming to say the world's biggest

22
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:18,540
citation needed

23
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:21,280
Camarillo festival in the world

24
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:23,548
and it's pretty cool because that's

25
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,549
where

26
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:45,049
so yes so this is a workshop so I think

27
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:47,060
I originally sent this out of the yeah

28
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:50,780
especially for just wake up 50 minutes

29
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:52,940
and the other part was since I gave a

30
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:54,590
talk similar to this important but I

31
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:59,020
didn't want I try to stand quick

32
00:02:54,590 --> 00:03:01,490
recycling slides depression spike I

33
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:02,780
think the only person I see here that

34
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:10,760
would come flying through this time is

35
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:33,550
Joe grant is a very promising so here

36
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:33,549
I'm gonna be once again it's a sunny and

37
00:03:35,209 --> 00:03:53,379
americana title of tools and then

38
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:53,379
hopefully like there's some people that

39
00:03:56,409 --> 00:04:23,210
yeah in this in possible security

40
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:25,550
measures I haven't seen a design person

41
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:32,299
ship their profits which I wish they

42
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:36,099
would do that devices sometimes they

43
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:36,099
don't even didn't even do this work

44
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:55,940
yes so strange composition now but one

45
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:59,539
thing I have run into is this the hidden

46
00:04:55,940 --> 00:05:01,250
grouting is same pieces so some of you

47
00:04:59,539 --> 00:05:06,080
guys might have if you're attacking it

48
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:14,479
might involve architecture which I think

49
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:16,400
he is I think recently found that there

50
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:20,570
is a a snake in there that's been just

51
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:22,340
browning signals certainly a lot of

52
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:29,139
people thought if you plug in something

53
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:29,138
they distilled aboard but just

54
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:04,589
[Music]

55
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:21,390
and

56
00:06:33,999 --> 00:06:38,020
there's a nice beauty

57
00:06:39,409 --> 00:06:45,680
I like to look what that they actually

58
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:52,550
go he goes over secure JPEG which is

59
00:06:45,680 --> 00:07:20,379
only great performance but it's kind of

60
00:06:52,550 --> 00:07:20,379
just like hundreds

61
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:29,119
chapter 3 which kind of hits the point

62
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:31,520
of this caucus manual that hits a lot of

63
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:35,190
key points and harmonizes with PCBs

64
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:39,570
diagnose lay out this way obviously

65
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:39,570
there's a lot of treatment

66
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:48,490
sometimes those compromises can actually

67
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:48,490
meet those just like

68
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:16,479
[Music]

69
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:32,780
yeah

70
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:32,780
how many nice hot hair every workstation

71
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:36,529
[Music]

72
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:42,289
has anyone tried to be able to challenge

73
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:52,470
so I think tomorrow they're gonna be

74
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:55,380
assembling on drum soldering alert so

75
00:08:52,470 --> 00:09:05,940
feel like so the SME challenge exhaling

76
00:08:55,380 --> 00:09:08,160
history initially small supposedly I

77
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:12,190
think actually after every component you

78
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:15,769
solder you can't drink

79
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:19,730
eventually yeah I don't know how to that

80
00:09:15,769 --> 00:09:21,800
one I think someone was saying that that

81
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:28,010
one somebody was actually getting better

82
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:34,579
after every tree this is La La Mesa

83
00:09:28,010 --> 00:10:09,939
where classes so I just consumed in like

84
00:09:34,579 --> 00:10:09,939
I just

85
00:10:15,339 --> 00:10:21,019
and yeah invest in a different community

86
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:24,079
like I really really big fan of the

87
00:10:21,019 --> 00:10:29,480
beautiful area system really best

88
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:34,089
continuity test I don't know maybe guys

89
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:34,089
have switch

90
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:28,760
[Laughter]

91
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:40,269
yeah and so hopefully airports where

92
00:11:34,029 --> 00:11:45,360
there's hidden traces inner layers

93
00:11:40,269 --> 00:11:45,360
really obvious for the services

94
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:52,630
and so I thought invest is silver

95
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:54,910
eternity fabric so that's the thing

96
00:11:52,630 --> 00:12:13,840
that's a metric that you're probably not

97
00:11:54,910 --> 00:12:20,469
and group or smart wearables it's like a

98
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:22,810
signal wire and yeah

99
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:38,170
I'd save a ton of time assuming for

100
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:41,170
x-rays yes so this is I really one of my

101
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:43,750
best reverse engineering tools because

102
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:46,270
on the ruler theory they actually have

103
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:50,550
this nice purpose with pigeons that

104
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:53,890
connect reviews and so when you want to

105
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:54,990
let's say you want to yeah by the time

106
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:57,480
you are

107
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:59,910
it has a very small surface mount

108
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:04,300
connectors and instead of just like

109
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:06,610
piously wiring stem providers and

110
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:08,680
there why is it like to do these the

111
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:11,260
word business now this end up sourcing

112
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:17,459
thinkers just bit of stuff that were

113
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:17,460
trained compare which is my connector

114
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:33,250
yeah it also has footprints for many

115
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:36,670
areas how do you prepare with Linux is

116
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:40,770
nice we're back to the second unit the

117
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:53,800
DD image from a SD card like or you know

118
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:56,730
it's really nice yeah yeah so because

119
00:13:53,800 --> 00:14:01,599
most of stuff I do like help you

120
00:13:56,730 --> 00:14:03,880
extracting EGA MMC chips and we're sorry

121
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:06,160
for engaging experience event writing

122
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:12,689
goes out to a head because you can

123
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:12,689
actually read most of those parts I just

124
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:25,880
down and blush which is sometimes mixed

125
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:27,889
up with you have to sort of those chips

126
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:31,040
yet they actually get a controller chip

127
00:14:27,889 --> 00:14:34,860
which is not typically a source or the

128
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:40,260
fda's I think it's the Mt

129
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:42,800
to each shift actually actually it won't

130
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:42,800
fly

131
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:51,170
yeah yes computing she thinks that

132
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:55,730
approximate lying

133
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:55,729
have that chip extracted

134
00:14:56,840 --> 00:15:02,690
hopefully right it was thought to be the

135
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:05,560
skin tightness having test equipment

136
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:19,940
such as a logic analyzer like Sally a

137
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:25,400
work as some people might work yes yeah

138
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:32,690
so this one I think is Hillary

139
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:35,930
gratuitousness conditions yeah have you

140
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:42,140
nice power supplies that covers pretty

141
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:44,319
much up to like 36 unless you're working

142
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:44,319
with

143
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:04,099
yeah

144
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:07,800
the soccer is really nice very intuitive

145
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:09,540
thank you yeah yeah Sally a soft-bristle

146
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:11,790
kind of pretty knives they just know

147
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:14,910
that I think real time support for

148
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:18,209
analyzing logics we've also this kind of

149
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:24,199
nice feature very very expensive tool

150
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:27,780
yeah and they I had this really nice

151
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:29,270
all-around purpose tool and uh and as

152
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:31,530
it'll see in this case so thank you all

153
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:36,770
it's really compact it's really nice to

154
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:45,120
travel with I mean I have a ride home

155
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:55,140
yes yes you can actually run the

156
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:57,780
software yes yes so you just think this

157
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:59,310
is my USB key Raspberry Pi and this will

158
00:16:57,780 --> 00:17:02,060
run it so if you have the raspberry pie

159
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:05,359
recipe you've got a really nice portable

160
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:09,349
it's like a testicle or station without

161
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:20,688
you know actually it is yeah it's really

162
00:17:09,349 --> 00:17:23,928
this really no yes which is like a

163
00:17:20,689 --> 00:17:27,220
hundred or Lafayette and curls so I

164
00:17:23,929 --> 00:17:27,220
actually worth

165
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:40,470
so this one actually uses the was the

166
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:42,720
electronic explored word which is there

167
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:45,299
like higher-end tested Esther nation

168
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:49,260
that has Porcello Fitness like multiple

169
00:17:45,299 --> 00:17:52,710
eating area at work and that one well

170
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:54,629
before they were acquired by the

171
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:57,950
National Instruments was pretty cheap

172
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:57,950
with the speed discounts

173
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:10,719
yeah yeah this was really nice to travel

174
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:13,030
for a while yeah I hear you I believe in

175
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:16,210
32 bit of logic analyzer for Channel six

176
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:21,090
go to channel for arbitrary waveform

177
00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:21,090
generator and triple output power supply

178
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:28,899
all of us today are working so quick

179
00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:31,570
yeah yeah yeah so what a pleasant I did

180
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:33,340
a kid boggles actually this is a nice

181
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:38,220
and helican case television static

182
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:38,220
allocation with their expert - screen

183
00:18:42,750 --> 00:19:08,070
challenge then you know I discovered a

184
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:08,070
fight in July ok yeah

185
00:19:16,219 --> 00:19:24,960
yes so we have complaint experience so

186
00:19:22,379 --> 00:19:27,869
you've probably seen these maybe on I'll

187
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:29,099
evolve our eBay so these are some twenty

188
00:19:27,869 --> 00:19:32,009
dollars and my investigators like

189
00:19:29,099 --> 00:19:35,519
sliders inductors capacitors resistors

190
00:19:32,009 --> 00:19:48,239
and a couple of semiconductors I'll tell

191
00:19:35,519 --> 00:19:49,830
you what the pinatas is so I also is at

192
00:19:48,239 --> 00:19:54,149
work which this one's a little higher

193
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:57,299
head is naked semiconductor analyzer and

194
00:19:54,149 --> 00:19:59,998
so this is a being quite a few times

195
00:19:57,299 --> 00:20:03,149
because they're weird packages like six

196
00:19:59,999 --> 00:20:05,999
pins sewing packages that will have dual

197
00:20:03,149 --> 00:20:08,218
transistors on them and like initially

198
00:20:05,999 --> 00:20:10,109
little thing awesome it's just looks

199
00:20:08,219 --> 00:20:11,489
like a typical integrated circuit and

200
00:20:10,109 --> 00:20:14,759
alligator gets their Canadian to the

201
00:20:11,489 --> 00:20:16,499
Afghan for something but you look up the

202
00:20:14,759 --> 00:20:18,899
part number there's there's nothing

203
00:20:16,499 --> 00:20:23,399
remotely close to being a napkin there

204
00:20:18,899 --> 00:20:26,070
so you can just like pick up vehicle

205
00:20:23,399 --> 00:20:30,389
needs to all part of that six pins

206
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:34,979
sewing and there's a BJP there the

207
00:20:30,389 --> 00:20:38,428
MOSFET on the same die always the only

208
00:20:34,979 --> 00:20:42,039
immediately so my case has narrowed

209
00:20:38,429 --> 00:20:45,580
so just think about the part code is

210
00:20:42,039 --> 00:20:50,200
like an SME quick and believe is

211
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:52,418
accomplished there and then having the

212
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:56,740
sudden divider isn't programmed to like

213
00:20:52,419 --> 00:20:59,820
they can and ones can be nice Sicily for

214
00:20:56,740 --> 00:21:02,230
example like I have I have no ice

215
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:04,600
demographers that's kind of nice for

216
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:10,200
extracting from more easily thrown at

217
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:10,199
all devices yeah

218
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:24,760
so yeah so we're JTAG of course serious

219
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:29,049
like open source solutions like black

220
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:30,129
magic Pro and enjoy grants jtagulator

221
00:21:29,049 --> 00:21:32,920
this one

222
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:35,559
108 women's oasis that's really nice for

223
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:40,420
finding tighten up my tank importance

224
00:21:35,559 --> 00:22:12,668
and I think with Zhukov there's the

225
00:21:40,420 --> 00:22:22,110
crap can do yeah yeah anyway so yeah

226
00:22:12,669 --> 00:22:22,110
what you're finding is just like Google

227
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:36,710
yes some party consumables are really

228
00:22:34,550 --> 00:22:39,680
nice to have in the lab whatever reverse

229
00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:41,750
engineering something it's a small small

230
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:43,400
banner your lettuce Audrey like some of

231
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:48,280
the really thin stuff is really nice

232
00:22:43,400 --> 00:23:18,290
because if you use littering everyone's

233
00:22:48,280 --> 00:23:20,330
that was nice oh no that's okay you want

234
00:23:18,290 --> 00:23:22,460
to use too much that stuff does that

235
00:23:20,330 --> 00:23:25,100
work temperature solder it'll get all

236
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:33,770
the important people you're bored in the

237
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:36,199
career day for security things down or

238
00:23:33,770 --> 00:23:38,900
make sure your jumpers cut short when

239
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:42,220
they're breaking out James -

240
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:46,880
historically or you are pins for

241
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:51,070
anything because there are cases where

242
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:51,070
deep pocket or tea was not nicely

243
00:23:51,940 --> 00:24:00,890
if expression ship or just wireless so

244
00:23:58,309 --> 00:24:05,780
having isopropyl alcohol to clean things

245
00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:08,780
up like the gym time on kimwipes which

246
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:11,149
is like the Newlands wipes you can also

247
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:42,830
use microfiber cloths as wall head

248
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:45,260
anything as long as you use a yeah we'd

249
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:47,330
actually damaged up but tiny soft 23

250
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:49,429
microchip pic device that was being used

251
00:24:47,330 --> 00:24:51,110
for power up and the system was starting

252
00:24:49,429 --> 00:24:52,820
to behave weird like what is going on is

253
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:54,290
good you can't really don't shoot it and

254
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:56,540
we'd be captain to saw there was like

255
00:24:54,290 --> 00:24:59,240
actual all they BSU manage also died

256
00:24:56,540 --> 00:25:02,330
yeah well the other videos horrible yeah

257
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:04,760
we wish that many here yeah the worst is

258
00:25:02,330 --> 00:25:15,980
it like yeah that kiss when you abuse

259
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:53,620
our that's really something else okay

260
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:57,110
guys so by the wireless yes yes

261
00:25:53,620 --> 00:26:00,050
specifically having that it is really

262
00:25:57,110 --> 00:26:04,070
nice just so that if you're replacing

263
00:26:00,050 --> 00:26:11,320
parts or you happen to lose one of those

264
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:15,100
service mount parts in the incident and

265
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:15,100
you can easily source

266
00:26:16,770 --> 00:26:23,430
and politics

267
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:23,429
[Music]

268
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:45,360
and have a nice assortment of adapters

269
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:49,459
so it's very much yeah yeah what's

270
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:49,459
another actually combined experience

271
00:26:51,770 --> 00:26:58,940
so that three rows competitor is really

272
00:26:55,020 --> 00:27:00,090
nice easily connect things without

273
00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:05,160
directly

274
00:27:00,090 --> 00:27:08,280
sorry wires yeah it is what I like so

275
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:10,680
they talked myself into say Oh like

276
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:12,170
it'll get once you are something else

277
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:15,360
will be fine

278
00:27:12,170 --> 00:27:19,260
no it's gonna break yeah it's very

279
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:25,080
likely this is just having been using it

280
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:31,080
to make effective as you can see having

281
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:35,490
various a sparkling snapper throat award

282
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:39,990
so let's see in this grid these are all

283
00:27:35,490 --> 00:27:42,630
actually all just was perforated so you

284
00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:53,160
can snap those into the base pieces and

285
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:53,930
it's really nice for breaking stuff yeah

286
00:27:53,160 --> 00:28:04,500
exactly

287
00:27:53,930 --> 00:28:08,910
my name's like so and I said with the

288
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:11,070
component license probably yes so what

289
00:28:08,910 --> 00:28:14,040
you like to do is what if I run into

290
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:19,040
like bizarre likes not three six new

291
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:19,040
packages and so they are the six opinion

292
00:28:51,140 --> 00:29:02,109
[Music]

293
00:29:03,930 --> 00:29:34,240
yeah okay so but hey maybe that kid

294
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:37,740
that's like another kind of optics -

295
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:37,740
cool I'm not even paying them

296
00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:48,960
yes yeah oh yeah probably references so

297
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:52,530
as you get deeper into this if you if

298
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:54,750
you do run into like systems with crypto

299
00:29:52,530 --> 00:29:57,899
modules or various encryption argument

300
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:59,670
there is as funny said this morning the

301
00:29:57,900 --> 00:30:04,230
chip whispers which is a pretty cool

302
00:29:59,670 --> 00:30:06,450
cycle analysis tool it's it's kind of

303
00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:18,870
crazy how you can use all those kind of

304
00:30:06,450 --> 00:30:22,190
statistics big strategies I'm trying to

305
00:30:18,870 --> 00:30:22,189
see where for my cyclone slide

306
00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:29,250
so

307
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:35,010
so yeah when you're when you're a

308
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:38,010
designer and you have to realize that a

309
00:30:35,010 --> 00:30:46,680
wires not just a wire anymore it becomes

310
00:30:38,010 --> 00:30:50,400
a decidable and it will become ill start

311
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:55,680
to exhibit properties that is very

312
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:58,320
serious so yeah sure that you don't play

313
00:30:55,680 --> 00:31:00,390
your work properly so if designers put a

314
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:02,750
lot of effort to make sure that a lot of

315
00:31:00,390 --> 00:31:06,330
this stuff that's been a game before and

316
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:07,620
yeah it's all about optimizing for

317
00:31:06,330 --> 00:31:17,820
performance and reducing those

318
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:19,560
criticisms and yeah just knowing those

319
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:22,129
rules can reduce your time in design

320
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:27,629
already because there's a lot of cases

321
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:30,800
where you'll see that maybe you'll have

322
00:31:27,630 --> 00:31:33,480
two lines where it's a visual signal

323
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:36,320
yasur is a screen between so you can't

324
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:36,320
quite using constant

325
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:42,150
hello like the whole commuter will

326
00:31:39,150 --> 00:31:45,780
actually show that Oh like it's 120 ohms

327
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:47,700
here but it won't start eating and if

328
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:50,340
you if you use them have to know why I

329
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:54,330
say like clipping on some of the beads

330
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:55,560
on part and it kind of just using the

331
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:57,540
connection either gills something

332
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:59,639
supplying that goes into this resistor

333
00:31:57,540 --> 00:32:02,149
and that that was a stellar into that

334
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:04,800
resistor goes into another chip because

335
00:32:02,150 --> 00:32:08,190
one thing that they try to do is hand

336
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:09,990
off slow down the edges of those digital

337
00:32:08,190 --> 00:32:12,870
signals so that you know get experience

338
00:32:09,990 --> 00:32:15,960
are at the signals because that's easy

339
00:32:12,870 --> 00:32:19,639
nothing like that before

340
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:19,640
you know they're traces on your board

341
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:27,890
yeah

342
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:32,640
yeah the biggest hope or anything that

343
00:32:27,890 --> 00:32:35,460
hardware design is Lele our reference

344
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:39,620
designs and it's forever isn't here this

345
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:43,140
is also very useful cuttings typically

346
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:47,250
you'll see that the part wife's exactly

347
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:49,470
match some of these layouts like and yes

348
00:32:47,250 --> 00:32:54,210
it's cuz design amazed don't want to

349
00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:56,580
take you all risks and even look like

350
00:32:54,210 --> 00:32:59,299
gave something like eight I have even

351
00:32:56,580 --> 00:33:03,029
has a finite existence thinking right so

352
00:32:59,299 --> 00:33:04,408
less than five inches so that can on a

353
00:33:03,029 --> 00:33:06,690
bigger board that could probably reduce

354
00:33:04,409 --> 00:33:10,620
your time and try and find work in the

355
00:33:06,690 --> 00:33:12,860
Jeep authorities because that's a single

356
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:17,820
out right around 20 minutes so if you

357
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:19,168
properly lay that out that easily that

358
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:21,620
signal probably would make it to the

359
00:33:19,169 --> 00:33:21,620
connector

360
00:33:22,850 --> 00:33:31,199
that's the curse has become a little

361
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:33,180
hassle so yeah there is all this stuff

362
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:36,450
and data sheets really good stuff just

363
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:38,420
like hey make sure your adductors are

364
00:33:36,450 --> 00:33:40,070
closed make sure capacitors are closed

365
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:42,660
[Music]

366
00:33:40,070 --> 00:33:45,179
it's amazing because a lot of words as I

367
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:50,760
look at work they'll exactly ocular

368
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:52,560
references is like wow it's not the

369
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:54,720
designers were not creative or anything

370
00:33:52,560 --> 00:34:01,889
it's just that need to save so much time

371
00:33:54,720 --> 00:34:03,900
and avoid it avoid so many problems if

372
00:34:01,890 --> 00:34:06,090
someone will actually give you layer by

373
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:09,360
layer so this is actually protects

374
00:34:06,090 --> 00:34:12,650
pedestrians data sheet I think yellowing

375
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:12,650
devices also does a good job

376
00:34:17,850 --> 00:34:24,739
[Music]

377
00:34:25,250 --> 00:34:33,270
so anyone have any questions if you

378
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:35,400
perceive components embedded in boards

379
00:34:33,270 --> 00:34:37,980
either either physical components or the

380
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:39,810
board substrate and you know computers

381
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:41,610
don't you guys I have to say yes that

382
00:34:39,810 --> 00:34:44,909
Kazu be really cool to see one of those

383
00:34:41,610 --> 00:34:47,190
but no I think yeah the other thing that

384
00:34:44,909 --> 00:34:49,980
Katie points on this book is that that

385
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:51,780
is a very that's that's a very good

386
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:53,490
countermeasure against our variety is

387
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:56,220
actually embedding compressed within

388
00:34:53,489 --> 00:34:58,560
inner layers so like you'll actually

389
00:34:56,219 --> 00:35:00,419
have like all these passes or an ingrate

390
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:02,520
circuitously actually we've been like

391
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:06,290
your board so it's not I'm saying really

392
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:06,290
nice I worth dying for you later

393
00:35:06,770 --> 00:35:14,090
that's definitely a killer case yeah

394
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:14,090
what's with the Curie clearance yeah

395
00:35:16,550 --> 00:35:20,520
good try though so with all the stuff

396
00:35:19,170 --> 00:35:23,190
you forget all the stuff you've seen is

397
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:26,960
mostly that like the table of occupation

398
00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:26,960
of stuff from yes yeah

399
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:45,300
locations engineering sales people how

400
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:48,210
they assemble those really reports so do

401
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:49,800
that actually in the back here and close

402
00:35:48,210 --> 00:35:51,060
just like you know put down the epoxy

403
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:55,420
and just like totally off layer by layer

404
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:56,859
and so the interesting part is I learned

405
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:59,410
there's no warranty for that sort of

406
00:35:56,859 --> 00:36:05,430
things so if wondered warrants is like

407
00:35:59,410 --> 00:36:05,430
just that on the right a little bit 1080

408
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:16,200
there is minute graphics is like pads

409
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:18,400
and I worked heavily with hyperlinks

410
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:22,169
signal integrity and currently reading

411
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:30,069
tools and what's the driving choice to

412
00:36:22,170 --> 00:36:33,039
driving so observation or is it or never

413
00:36:30,069 --> 00:36:35,019
so does element filters or is it but

414
00:36:33,039 --> 00:36:37,150
just as far as there's a lot of things

415
00:36:35,019 --> 00:36:40,509
like that are that complicated

416
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:41,710
typically obfuscation is you know what's

417
00:36:40,510 --> 00:36:44,260
the only the last thing you think about

418
00:36:41,710 --> 00:36:47,230
but kind of like unintentionally you do

419
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:48,869
so so like oh like you think it's a

420
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:52,059
better than this advantage of your

421
00:36:48,869 --> 00:36:53,529
perverse engineer like it makes your job

422
00:36:52,059 --> 00:36:56,380
I really return reverse engineer report

423
00:36:53,529 --> 00:36:59,589
but in this case it was like a almost

424
00:36:56,380 --> 00:37:03,880
like a mm in like timing selector scale

425
00:36:59,589 --> 00:37:05,980
at PGA so yeah doing that like kind of

426
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:07,720
double-sided beautiful hotel sorry for

427
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:09,299
later board it is not possible there's

428
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:12,910
no way you're gonna bring down all those

429
00:37:09,299 --> 00:37:14,500
signals out and so what hacker cons are

430
00:37:12,910 --> 00:37:17,379
learn more like oh let's do the BGA's

431
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:22,150
have the BGA drunk soldering workshop

432
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:23,319
yeah what tools are they gonna use when

433
00:37:22,150 --> 00:37:27,190
they really want to get serious about

434
00:37:23,319 --> 00:37:29,130
using a high-density device like a high

435
00:37:27,190 --> 00:37:32,439
dose

436
00:37:29,130 --> 00:37:38,739
so they have to work kind of tools

437
00:37:32,439 --> 00:37:40,328
thanks ray yes ready America I think I

438
00:37:38,739 --> 00:37:42,189
won four when we got it down the

439
00:37:40,329 --> 00:37:44,799
recipient of sending back to them

440
00:37:42,189 --> 00:37:48,578
because I'm serious and yet but a pretty

441
00:37:44,799 --> 00:38:03,219
hefty fee that I don't know about it's

442
00:37:48,579 --> 00:38:10,049
probably the pony yet it's like I don't

443
00:38:03,219 --> 00:38:10,049
you'll see with all the things I said I

444
00:38:14,189 --> 00:38:19,479
mean it's it's highly doubtful that a

445
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:23,739
hug people kind of never doing the board

446
00:38:19,479 --> 00:38:25,598
that complicated but yeah I think yeah

447
00:38:23,739 --> 00:38:32,049
so most of the things like you'd yet do

448
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:34,359
it hi patty over the years I think even

449
00:38:32,049 --> 00:38:36,459
at that point yet like sourcing a fad

450
00:38:34,359 --> 00:38:38,880
and everything it's pretty expensive at

451
00:38:36,459 --> 00:38:38,879
that point

452
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:47,340
yes so yeah I have - any embedded

453
00:38:45,210 --> 00:38:49,670
components but it is that salsa medicine

454
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:53,369
to look at as a countermeasure

455
00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:55,830
most of the time I mean yeah like that's

456
00:38:53,369 --> 00:38:57,920
my design position sometimes more than

457
00:38:55,830 --> 00:39:00,509
that is a reverse engineer entire visor

458
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:04,680
it's just a convenience to have some of

459
00:39:00,510 --> 00:39:07,710
those components well at the same time

460
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:09,210
yeah a countermeasure I hear about it

461
00:39:07,710 --> 00:39:10,200
all the time but it never actually yeah

462
00:39:09,210 --> 00:39:14,369
I never running like that

463
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:18,600
yes Italy IP I mean I I think the only

464
00:39:14,369 --> 00:39:21,150
time I record it was like in school

465
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:23,790
because we're right next to Air Force

466
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:25,530
Research Lab in Dayton and I've heard

467
00:39:23,790 --> 00:39:27,420
that there are boards there that do

468
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:30,030
implement that kind of technology where

469
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:32,640
like they actually will put in that

470
00:39:30,030 --> 00:39:34,080
components and like literally circuit

471
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:35,580
board surgeries of thing on your China

472
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:37,319
service while it was it's like one of

473
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:40,170
those embedded components goes out she

474
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:41,760
actually I think I've heard that their

475
00:39:40,170 --> 00:39:42,900
stuff is ruined all like yeah the

476
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:45,270
lecture the boards

477
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:46,860
like try to fight a tool point and they

478
00:39:45,270 --> 00:39:49,560
have to like reassemble the cords like

479
00:39:46,860 --> 00:39:51,660
later up from there it's like it's

480
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:54,660
ridiculous I did really wish I could see

481
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:58,290
it quick you full screen back oh yeah

482
00:39:54,660 --> 00:40:01,710
yeah thank you yeah so this isn't I see

483
00:39:58,290 --> 00:40:05,820
a table it's what it is there some

484
00:40:01,710 --> 00:40:08,790
protection levels that you've that's you

485
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:11,160
my ready to so I mean most of the things

486
00:40:08,790 --> 00:40:15,720
these days they want to probably don't

487
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:18,210
even feel as far as like Warren Wyatt

488
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:21,439
basically is where like the manufacturer

489
00:40:18,210 --> 00:40:30,390
election and women crypto or something

490
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:33,210
or like wasn't boards with that said Joe

491
00:40:30,390 --> 00:40:36,660
yep I guess the thing that I guess and

492
00:40:33,210 --> 00:40:38,910
amenities we didn't have this special I

493
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:41,580
think it was that lecture back there

494
00:40:38,910 --> 00:40:44,240
like a capacitor between yes but in that

495
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:44,240
Baxter

496
00:40:46,220 --> 00:40:53,759
yeah definitely beyond that far for yeah

497
00:40:50,329 --> 00:40:55,650
yeah how are you able to figure out that

498
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:58,290
dielectric like are there markings on it

499
00:40:55,650 --> 00:41:03,410
that we had a very phrase just like that

500
00:40:58,290 --> 00:41:07,920
looks different than fr yeah yeah yeah

501
00:41:03,410 --> 00:41:26,040
yeah yeah that was great we're not then

502
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:28,470
ya know stuff like yeah I mean at this

503
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:31,529
point the local body you know support

504
00:41:28,470 --> 00:41:33,089
live typically that's like here the

505
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:34,130
people who attack those kinds of things

506
00:41:33,089 --> 00:41:36,830
they're like through the state

507
00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:39,890
laboratories

508
00:41:36,830 --> 00:41:45,380
[Music]

509
00:41:39,890 --> 00:41:49,700
that's kind of more into what horrifying

510
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:52,819
as I said there or like super complex

511
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:57,640
eight-six where they might have like

512
00:41:52,819 --> 00:41:57,640
some kind of tamper-resistant tank

513
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:15,799
yes things like this for

514
00:42:13,250 --> 00:42:34,820
you can clearly see where analog and

515
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:37,520
digital kind of or mark in here yeah it

516
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:39,590
has it almost like that it is kind of

517
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:42,140
agree may override it's just like puts

518
00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:46,010
you in that reverse psychology of being

519
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:52,098
like the design engineering and you can

520
00:42:46,010 --> 00:42:54,050
easily use those concepts because I mean

521
00:42:52,099 --> 00:42:57,140
I think yeah pretty much I mean to be

522
00:42:54,050 --> 00:42:59,240
reasonable you won't really look at a

523
00:42:57,140 --> 00:43:01,490
circuit for this Samuel you won't be

524
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:07,000
like whoa that's really complicated but

525
00:43:01,490 --> 00:43:07,000
they call I see power supply section we

526
00:43:07,150 --> 00:43:21,740
see this yeah that's an Amazon it's 40

527
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:23,839
bucks 40 bucks and the cool thing is

528
00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:26,330
knows that if you tell the author you

529
00:43:23,839 --> 00:43:28,549
block is what he'll if you deploy these

530
00:43:26,330 --> 00:43:33,200
other core resources are actually like

531
00:43:28,550 --> 00:43:36,040
SMTP very comprehensive it's Vizio

532
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:36,040
templates and

533
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:42,999
and yeah of course a there is no people

534
00:43:39,759 --> 00:43:50,829
copy those there doesn't work these

535
00:43:42,999 --> 00:43:54,609
subjects of piracy or anything yeah so

536
00:43:50,829 --> 00:43:57,430
once again like here he goes artisanal

537
00:43:54,609 --> 00:43:59,319
book but typically what life design

538
00:43:57,430 --> 00:44:01,210
engineers will want to do is between

539
00:43:59,319 --> 00:44:03,880
like different place they don't want

540
00:44:01,210 --> 00:44:06,759
paint still her life because little

541
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:10,269
cause sort of capacitance and scenario

542
00:44:06,759 --> 00:44:13,799
signals will won't be culpable which is

543
00:44:10,269 --> 00:44:17,220
really that really not desirable effects

544
00:44:13,799 --> 00:44:17,220
will be apparent

545
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:27,240
or something are you starting

546
00:44:25,170 --> 00:44:30,000
what is this Rory's presentation yeah

547
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:36,089
yeah just a lot of stuff like overlaps

548
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:42,420
oh yeah yes yeah they're going to look

549
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:45,020
like this so wait so other's names yes

550
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:45,020
there's that

551
00:44:46,620 --> 00:44:54,069
there's the book you know that's

552
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:55,750
priceless when I get your tool set up

553
00:44:54,070 --> 00:45:03,490
either go over anything o'clock sound

554
00:44:55,750 --> 00:45:06,850
textual oh I don't really like a

555
00:45:03,490 --> 00:45:08,410
signature and oh yeah yeah so funny

556
00:45:06,850 --> 00:45:10,990
mention that this morning I didn't even

557
00:45:08,410 --> 00:45:13,990
like to look like the guild groves yes

558
00:45:10,990 --> 00:45:16,779
so yeah I think once again looks like a

559
00:45:13,990 --> 00:45:19,120
specialized tool thank you it's nice

560
00:45:16,780 --> 00:45:23,430
depending on your application so I

561
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:23,430
haven't run into a problem

562
00:45:33,510 --> 00:45:38,350
yeah so Joe grunting look at our last

563
00:45:36,970 --> 00:45:40,149
conference that they're used to it may

564
00:45:38,350 --> 00:45:43,089
in fact could actually mean specifically

565
00:45:40,150 --> 00:45:47,770
a brush but I guess they stuff means the

566
00:45:43,090 --> 00:45:48,820
weight and weight 10s FDM years I mean

567
00:45:47,770 --> 00:45:50,380
it I don't know why you'd even

568
00:45:48,820 --> 00:45:52,720
discontinued such a great school

569
00:45:50,380 --> 00:46:05,080
yeah there's probably not that many

570
00:45:52,720 --> 00:46:07,359
people doing specialized yeah I really

571
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:09,990
really want the stretching because

572
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:09,990
that's well

573
00:46:10,410 --> 00:46:19,920
I happen to tell yes I used one that was

574
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:22,289
not as stretchy and so the problem is is

575
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:24,930
that if you try to push it down on it

576
00:46:22,289 --> 00:46:28,049
sort of pads or you just brush it you

577
00:46:24,930 --> 00:46:34,470
won't make good contact you won't get

578
00:46:28,049 --> 00:46:36,319
that nice pad sometimes you might have

579
00:46:34,470 --> 00:46:40,759
to clamp the or of work before I have

580
00:46:36,319 --> 00:46:40,759
isopropyl to get some glass
