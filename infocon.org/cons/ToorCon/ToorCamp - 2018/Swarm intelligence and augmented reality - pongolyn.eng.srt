1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:04,470
alright so next up a tour camp we've got

2
00:00:02,939 --> 00:00:07,109
swarm intelligence and augmented reality

3
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:08,340
with Pung Pung Gulen speaking with us so

4
00:00:07,109 --> 00:00:18,750
please welcome her to the tour camp

5
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:22,220
stage thank you everybody so any gamers

6
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:24,240
among us today awesome

7
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:28,769
anybody ever play any augmented reality

8
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:32,549
games great any ingress is among us

9
00:00:28,769 --> 00:00:38,460
today alright this is gonna be a great

10
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:40,290
talk alright so games specifically

11
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:43,290
strategy games have been part of our

12
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:45,000
culture for millennia here we have a go

13
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:47,610
board and one of the bests and oldest

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,170
known examples of a strategy game the

15
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:50,700
object of the game of course is to

16
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:53,340
capture territory from an opponent

17
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:57,120
signified by the presence of game pieces

18
00:00:53,340 --> 00:01:00,180
on the board so games can be fun and

19
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:01,709
they definitely should be engaging but

20
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:04,140
they also provide a unique opportunity

21
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:05,309
for simulating real world problems and

22
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:11,729
that's what we're going to talk about

23
00:01:05,309 --> 00:01:12,780
today so I'm Nancy in this world the

24
00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:14,729
world you and I are currently

25
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:16,950
interacting with I'm a systems analyst

26
00:01:14,729 --> 00:01:19,890
and web developer I study and develop

27
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:21,180
intelligent systems in the world of

28
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:23,220
augmented reality gaming

29
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:25,830
I'm agent Pangolin you can call me pongo

30
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:28,140
i'm pongal in on twitter you can find me

31
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:29,970
there and additionally at the end of

32
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:34,530
this talk you can probably find me

33
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:38,270
elsewhere you might even find me walking

34
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:38,270
around the campsite staring at my phone

35
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:43,170
so the game that I'd like to talk about

36
00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:46,829
today is an augmented reality game by

37
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:49,950
the name of ingress ingress was created

38
00:01:46,829 --> 00:01:51,389
in 2014 by a company called Niantic it's

39
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:53,159
the same company that would later go on

40
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:54,500
to create the immensely popular Pokemon

41
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:58,500
go

42
00:01:54,500 --> 00:02:01,289
so unlike Pokemon go ingress is PvP its

43
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:03,270
player versus player additionally it

44
00:02:01,289 --> 00:02:04,979
also has a very cyberpunk flavor that

45
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:07,048
tends to attract a lot of hackers and

46
00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:10,799
tech early adopters which is more or

47
00:02:07,049 --> 00:02:12,750
less by design ingress is both a

48
00:02:10,799 --> 00:02:14,610
collaborative and a competitive game

49
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:16,860
which we can think of as a lot like

50
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:19,920
capture the flag there are two teams

51
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:22,950
Green Team Blue Team if anybody asks I'm

52
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:24,899
on the Green Team the object of this

53
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:27,390
game is to capture these portals these

54
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:29,569
sites of interest generally they're

55
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:31,828
Civic art or public gathering places

56
00:02:29,569 --> 00:02:33,630
when you see the game happening in

57
00:02:31,829 --> 00:02:35,910
physical space it tends to look a lot

58
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:39,209
like this picture on the right a bunch

59
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:41,430
of nerds staring at their phones so in

60
00:02:39,209 --> 00:02:43,859
this game im a champion strategist and

61
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:46,579
raid leader in non game terms you'd

62
00:02:43,859 --> 00:02:49,019
probably call me a community organizer

63
00:02:46,579 --> 00:02:51,329
my area of influence is roughly the

64
00:02:49,019 --> 00:02:53,280
north western United States which

65
00:02:51,329 --> 00:02:55,200
comprises depending on who you ask

66
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,790
somewhere between several several

67
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,790
hundred and over a thousand active

68
00:02:56,790 --> 00:03:04,200
players in Washington California British

69
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:06,209
Columbia Montana and Idaho so as you can

70
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:12,060
imagine my daily game is primarily

71
00:03:06,209 --> 00:03:14,130
concerned with team building so just a

72
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:16,139
little bit about the game itself in the

73
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:18,359
game the way to score score points is to

74
00:03:16,139 --> 00:03:19,799
first capture and then connect three

75
00:03:18,359 --> 00:03:21,810
portals of your color to make a

76
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:25,440
triangular field as we have on the left

77
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:27,419
the bigger the field the more points but

78
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:29,639
here's the catch you can only make a

79
00:03:27,419 --> 00:03:32,790
field if there are no crossing links of

80
00:03:29,639 --> 00:03:34,349
either color obstructing them so to take

81
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:35,790
down links you have to successfully

82
00:03:34,349 --> 00:03:37,590
capture one of the linked portals and

83
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:39,450
additionally friendly links those made

84
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:41,970
by your own teammates require a special

85
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:43,828
item to take down just to give you an

86
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:46,019
idea of how complicated this can be

87
00:03:43,829 --> 00:03:47,609
here's an example of what the game board

88
00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:48,859
looks like in Washington right now on

89
00:03:47,609 --> 00:03:51,209
the right

90
00:03:48,859 --> 00:03:53,340
so you can see a lot of these triangular

91
00:03:51,209 --> 00:03:55,319
fields on the map most of these fields

92
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:57,150
are put up by solo players or very small

93
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:58,560
teams in the course of daily place

94
00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:05,069
sometimes on their commute

95
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:07,560
sometimes on day trips so smaller

96
00:04:05,069 --> 00:04:09,420
operations can be done solo bigger

97
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:12,870
operations on the other hand require

98
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:14,730
teamwork and organization operations of

99
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:17,759
this size sometimes called mega fields

100
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:20,488
require anywhere from 20 to maybe over a

101
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:22,019
hundred people to execute and once again

102
00:04:20,488 --> 00:04:24,090
this is a player versus player game

103
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:25,770
which means that there is always another

104
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:28,469
team that is actively trying to block

105
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:30,448
you from doing this so remember if

106
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:34,250
there's one blocking link anywhere on

107
00:04:30,449 --> 00:04:34,250
this lane the operation can't succeed

108
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:41,000
additionally many of these portals are

109
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:43,139
actually fairly difficult to access

110
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,240
there are portals on Islands

111
00:04:43,139 --> 00:04:47,190
such as this one there are portals on

112
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:49,500
top of mountains there are portals

113
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:51,180
inside secure facilities there are

114
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:53,240
portals where there that exists where

115
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:55,020
there is weak or even zero cell signal

116
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:56,639
sometimes you have to bring your own

117
00:04:55,020 --> 00:05:04,469
internet access such as the satellite

118
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:06,120
modem we see on the lower right so

119
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:07,740
fields of this size demand that every

120
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:10,440
player in the region act in perfect

121
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:12,930
cooperation precision and generally

122
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:14,940
secrecy as you've probably guessed if

123
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:17,130
you know about your enemy's plan it

124
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:19,949
becomes much easier to block it it just

125
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:22,320
takes one link so here's what we can say

126
00:05:19,949 --> 00:05:24,690
about these operations they're difficult

127
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:27,150
they have a chance of failure they're

128
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:30,360
being opposed at all times by another

129
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:32,758
team they require strategic movement in

130
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:36,509
physical space and they require

131
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:38,039
cooperation precision and secrecy has

132
00:05:36,509 --> 00:05:42,240
anybody ever tried to get a hundred

133
00:05:38,039 --> 00:05:43,280
people to keep a secret it's not easy so

134
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,419
I'm going to ask you to keep these

135
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:51,359
characteristics of the operation in mind

136
00:05:45,419 --> 00:05:53,280
as we move ahead so today I want to talk

137
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,440
about a very basic problem Xserve din

138
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:57,929
gaming which is how do we get people to

139
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:59,760
act as a team any gamer who's ever

140
00:05:57,930 --> 00:06:01,409
played a multiplayer game especially an

141
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:02,039
online one will be familiar with this

142
00:06:01,409 --> 00:06:03,690
problem

143
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:07,280
and even if you're not you've probably

144
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:10,310
heard of a character named Leroy Jenkins

145
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:13,950
anybody ever played with a Leroy Jenkins

146
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:17,040
anybody ever been a Leroy Jenkins yeah

147
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:20,370
it can be fun but it's a it can under

148
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:21,990
time undermine team play so it's not

149
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:23,820
surprising that this problem happens in

150
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:26,400
the real world as well because well of

151
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:29,570
course it does I mean how many people

152
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:33,090
here really truly enjoy group projects

153
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:34,620
yeah I don't either if you don't it

154
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:36,210
chances are it's because of that one

155
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:40,170
person on the team who doesn't cooperate

156
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:43,409
or in some cases all of them so in games

157
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:46,560
as in life the best rewards tend to

158
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:49,260
happen when people cooperate difficult

159
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:53,100
tasks require cooperation and sometimes

160
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:55,500
they need organization so enter the cat

161
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:58,140
herders they're the organizers or

162
00:06:55,500 --> 00:07:00,810
executives as we sometimes call them the

163
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:02,789
people who get stuff done if you're here

164
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:05,190
today chances are you're one of them and

165
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:07,200
you're facing a hard problem how do you

166
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:14,700
get intelligent free-willed individuals

167
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:17,039
to cooperate so the leaders that get

168
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:19,170
things done people this is usually this

169
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:21,420
first system that we try to build it's a

170
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:23,280
pyramid so we have our founders at the

171
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:26,520
top calling the shots and to be

172
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:27,960
perfectly honest that's usually us we

173
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:30,840
have our middle management in the middle

174
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:32,190
in the game these are usually veteran

175
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:33,929
players and they serve as sort of

176
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:35,750
gatekeepers for the people above them

177
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:38,100
and mentors for the people below them

178
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:40,080
they assume some of the management and

179
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:41,810
organizational duty is that the executor

180
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:44,729
zhh don't have the bandwidth to address

181
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:48,090
so they delegate but they still maintain

182
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:50,160
their authority and then at the bottom

183
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:53,159
of the pyramid we have the so called

184
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:54,990
rank and file in gaming these are

185
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:57,810
usually the new players sometimes

186
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:59,580
they're the casual players in non game

187
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:01,670
terms these could be entry level

188
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:04,050
employees or they could be volunteers

189
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:05,730
you could think of maybe if the people

190
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:07,980
at the top are the strategist figuring

191
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:09,360
out what needs to be done the people on

192
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:10,590
the bottom actually tend to be the

193
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:14,070
people who actually get the work done

194
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:16,520
and our information in this model flows

195
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:19,129
from the top down

196
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:21,930
so this approach it has some strengths

197
00:08:19,129 --> 00:08:24,360
it's very easy to understand it's very

198
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:26,120
intuitive there's that trope about the

199
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:28,860
triangle being the strongest shape and

200
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:31,590
in many ad-hoc situations particularly

201
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:33,270
emergency situations it's incredibly

202
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:37,020
useful for someone to know who's in

203
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:38,338
charge but let's take a moment to think

204
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:41,399
about this model from a security

205
00:08:38,339 --> 00:08:43,169
perspective since most of us are hackers

206
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:46,890
and we're used to approaching things in

207
00:08:43,169 --> 00:08:48,300
rather unorthodox ways when we're

208
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:49,890
thinking about attack vectors and how a

209
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:54,750
system might this might be compromised

210
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:57,870
this is one thing we might do we look at

211
00:08:54,750 --> 00:09:01,079
it this way suddenly it doesn't seem so

212
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:04,050
stable systems analysts describe this as

213
00:09:01,079 --> 00:09:06,449
a brittle system that is to say it lacks

214
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:09,779
flexibility it is very strong but it is

215
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:12,390
rigid it lacks the ability to adapt to

216
00:09:09,779 --> 00:09:14,880
changing needs when it encounters in

217
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:17,760
challenges outside its wheelhouse it

218
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:20,100
breaks this problem only gets more

219
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:21,660
pronounced at scale so what we know

220
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:24,709
about these brutal systems is that

221
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:24,709
they're vulnerable to attack

222
00:09:27,649 --> 00:09:31,649
so hacker do we see the system with a

223
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:33,779
giant target painted on it that says

224
00:09:31,649 --> 00:09:37,260
attack here and the whole system comes

225
00:09:33,779 --> 00:09:39,720
crashing down so if you happen to be

226
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:42,420
someone on offense this is just great

227
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:44,100
it's very convenient there are many many

228
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:46,829
strategies built around attacking this

229
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:48,690
model if anybody is familiar with social

230
00:09:46,829 --> 00:09:52,050
engineering the concept of spear fishing

231
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:53,760
or whaling is it sometimes called one

232
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:57,689
part of the system is directly targeted

233
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:59,040
the most important one now those of us

234
00:09:57,690 --> 00:10:00,959
playing on the blue team the defenders

235
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:03,870
of the system this is kind of a concern

236
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:05,550
it forces us to think a little bit more

237
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:08,370
creatively about how we organize things

238
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:15,089
so what if we could do something like

239
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:16,800
this so this is swarm intelligence at

240
00:10:15,089 --> 00:10:18,690
first glance this probably looks like an

241
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:20,279
unintelligent mob but in actuality

242
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:20,700
there's some crazy teamwork going on

243
00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:22,950
here

244
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:25,500
if for no other reason than gosh how do

245
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:29,310
they not all run into each other I mean

246
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:29,970
these are birds right so this is not a

247
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:32,518
nuke on

248
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:34,860
in fact these behaviors are patterns on

249
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:37,589
behaviors in the animal kingdom army

250
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:40,410
ants starlings any kind of flocking

251
00:10:37,589 --> 00:10:43,680
behaviors this is these are starlings

252
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:45,480
the group is called a murmuration so

253
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,979
from a security standpoint this is

254
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:48,990
pretty interesting because intact

255
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:50,819
attacking one part of the system does

256
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:53,329
absolutely nothing it's practically

257
00:10:50,819 --> 00:10:53,329
self-healing

258
00:10:55,550 --> 00:11:00,599
so what swarm intelligence it's defined

259
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:04,279
as the collective behavior of

260
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:04,279
individuals operating autonomously

261
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:10,050
they're still leaders in this structure

262
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:11,399
an organization as well however it tends

263
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:13,229
to look a lot different than that

264
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:15,600
traditional pyramid we were looking at a

265
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:18,180
moment ago it is a decentralized

266
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:20,040
approach which means it's sort of breaks

267
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:23,969
down that pyramid in favor of a more

268
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:25,949
dynamic structure so what a swarm does

269
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:27,389
in effect is it leverages and empowers

270
00:11:25,949 --> 00:11:29,040
those people at the bottom of the

271
00:11:27,389 --> 00:11:32,029
pyramid in addition to the leaders

272
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:35,279
executor x' mentors and gatekeepers as

273
00:11:32,029 --> 00:11:36,660
it happens it offers many solutions for

274
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:38,459
many of the vulnerabilities we just

275
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:41,009
talked about with the pyramid it's

276
00:11:38,459 --> 00:11:48,449
flexible it's robust and when it's done

277
00:11:41,009 --> 00:11:50,189
well it's frightening ly efficient swarm

278
00:11:48,449 --> 00:11:52,258
intelligence in human systems is not

279
00:11:50,189 --> 00:11:54,599
really a new concept either maybe the

280
00:11:52,259 --> 00:11:56,329
simplest example would be a flash mob we

281
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:58,949
see a pillow fight here

282
00:11:56,329 --> 00:12:00,750
many of these flash mobs look totally

283
00:11:58,949 --> 00:12:02,370
spontaneous and disorganized when in

284
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:04,290
actuality they're following some very

285
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:06,000
specific and basic rules that allow

286
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:06,949
these individuals to function as sort of

287
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,480
a hive mind

288
00:12:06,949 --> 00:12:11,490
so the Swedish Pirate Party founded by

289
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:13,709
Rick Falkvinge describes itself as a

290
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:14,910
swarm in fact Phalke ving wrote an

291
00:12:13,709 --> 00:12:16,439
excellent book on it which I highly

292
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:20,219
recommend we'll have the link at the end

293
00:12:16,439 --> 00:12:22,050
of this talk it shouldn't be surprising

294
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:24,750
that video games have also had some

295
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:26,219
successful examples of swarm as well if

296
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:28,740
anybody's familiar with the game EVE

297
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:32,040
Online there was a famous or infamous

298
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:34,009
group called the goon swarm which was

299
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:36,750
noted for sort of steam rolling their

300
00:12:34,009 --> 00:12:41,760
opposition with basically an army of new

301
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:43,170
players so these systems all leveraged

302
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,720
swarms and they all have one thing in

303
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:44,889
common

304
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:46,660
they tend to crush their up at

305
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:54,129
competition through numbers and sheer

306
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:56,709
enthusiasm so once again just going back

307
00:12:54,129 --> 00:12:58,629
to the qualities of a swarm it's

308
00:12:56,709 --> 00:13:01,719
flexible how is it flexible

309
00:12:58,629 --> 00:13:04,060
well methodology is reduced reaction

310
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:06,189
time by basically eliminating

311
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:09,729
bureaucratic overhead you're not going

312
00:13:06,189 --> 00:13:12,939
through a central authority for every

313
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:15,639
decision that you're making it's also

314
00:13:12,939 --> 00:13:17,769
robust as we talked about before it

315
00:13:15,639 --> 00:13:20,019
reduces a surface area for potential

316
00:13:17,769 --> 00:13:22,870
attacks it enables self repair and it

317
00:13:20,019 --> 00:13:25,259
overwhelms the competition with greater

318
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:29,319
resources whether that's time money or

319
00:13:25,259 --> 00:13:31,000
enthusiasm it's also efficient again it

320
00:13:29,319 --> 00:13:37,269
leverages the skill set of the entire

321
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:39,240
swarm not just the people on top so I

322
00:13:37,269 --> 00:13:41,199
want to go back to ingress first again

323
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:44,170
just to give an example of this

324
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:47,258
decentralized advantage so this image is

325
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:49,809
from a global tournament in 2017 as in

326
00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:53,290
Portland there were probably about 300

327
00:13:49,809 --> 00:13:54,790
players on each team the object of this

328
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:56,680
particular game was to create as many

329
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:59,290
small fields as possible in downtown

330
00:13:56,680 --> 00:14:00,550
Portland so this is a snapshot of what

331
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:02,050
the game board looked like just a few

332
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:04,269
minutes before the score met it was

333
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:06,430
score was measured so my team the green

334
00:14:04,269 --> 00:14:09,459
team used a swarming strategy for this

335
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:12,910
particular game and that's what it

336
00:14:09,459 --> 00:14:14,378
looked like 90 seconds later so using

337
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:16,529
swarm intelligence we were able to

338
00:14:14,379 --> 00:14:19,269
steamroll the competition in record time

339
00:14:16,529 --> 00:14:21,009
we ended up replicating this at several

340
00:14:19,269 --> 00:14:23,980
other tournaments as well and they all

341
00:14:21,009 --> 00:14:27,180
ended up like this so by now you may be

342
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:27,180
wondering how did we do it

343
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:37,269
so in programming the swarm there are

344
00:14:33,819 --> 00:14:38,949
some very basic steps to follow the

345
00:14:37,269 --> 00:14:42,220
first one is you have to establish your

346
00:14:38,949 --> 00:14:43,930
win condition all games have this this

347
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:45,970
is sometimes called a vision or a

348
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:50,758
purpose when we did this in the Portland

349
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:50,759
tournament it was make small triangles

350
00:14:50,939 --> 00:14:55,870
second you break it down you have to

351
00:14:54,189 --> 00:14:57,250
break it down as far as possible to

352
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:59,050
first principles things

353
00:14:57,250 --> 00:15:00,790
can be mastered and this is important

354
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:04,209
they have to be able to be mastered

355
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:05,680
autonomously in other words you want the

356
00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:07,870
members of your swarm to be able to

357
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:09,550
break down and accomplish these tasks

358
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:11,980
without you telling them what to do

359
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:15,130
we call this doing the right thing by

360
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:17,260
default now ingress as with most games

361
00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:19,120
is not really a difficult game it more

362
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:22,600
or less amounts to showing up on time

363
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:24,880
and pressing buttons on your phone so

364
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:26,470
when we did this in Portland what did we

365
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:28,360
say we said okay if you have a blue

366
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:29,950
portal we need you to make it green if

367
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:31,570
we have a green portal we need you to

368
00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:33,280
make it linkable if you have a linkable

369
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:37,300
portal we need you to link it make the

370
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:38,709
triangle and move on and the third thing

371
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:40,449
that you have to do is you have to

372
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:43,540
establish communication with the nearest

373
00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:45,340
neighbors in the swarm so it's not

374
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:46,630
really enough to make sure that you give

375
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:48,820
them all the information that they need

376
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:51,100
and then just turn them loose if you're

377
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:53,560
trying to steer swarm you have to get

378
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:56,320
people talking to each other not to you

379
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:58,900
this is where the real efficiency of the

380
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:01,480
swarm comes in it's fairly common to

381
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:04,360
have instructions for events like the

382
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:07,480
Portland tournament relayed by an

383
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:09,100
operator or dispatcher of some sort what

384
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:11,140
we actually did this time was we remove

385
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:12,490
them from the equation and we had people

386
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:16,060
just speaking to each other on the

387
00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:25,030
ground this enabled us to basically wipe

388
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:26,670
the board in 90 seconds so to catalyze

389
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:30,189
swarm intelligence in a game setting

390
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:31,870
when a swarm has strong purpose mastery

391
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:34,480
and communication with its neighbors

392
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:37,540
collective intelligent behaviors will

393
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:43,540
emerge and we can actually break this

394
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:46,480
down even further it's that simple play

395
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:47,860
the game so you got a break skills down

396
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:49,240
as far as possible to their first

397
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:52,570
principles that can be mastered

398
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:55,089
autonomously unconscious competence is

399
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:57,760
the minimum condition necessary for

400
00:16:55,089 --> 00:17:00,280
swarm intelligence the more we can do

401
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:02,050
autonomously the more mental mental

402
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:06,399
bandwidth we all have for focusing on

403
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:09,399
sort of higher level tasks and then talk

404
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:11,620
to each other so communication basically

405
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:13,389
needs to be effortless scene

406
00:17:11,619 --> 00:17:15,789
and a fast and efficient way of

407
00:17:13,388 --> 00:17:17,469
supporting the team again it is not

408
00:17:15,789 --> 00:17:19,240
enough to tell the swarm everything that

409
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:22,240
they need to know you need to get people

410
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:27,789
talking to each other ultimately what

411
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:29,860
they have to do is establish trust so a

412
00:17:27,789 --> 00:17:31,870
lot of times this can mean using a

413
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:34,059
common language to optimize your

414
00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:35,260
communication if you've ever listened to

415
00:17:34,059 --> 00:17:37,178
a group of hackers speak to one another

416
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:40,330
you probably noticed that we have our

417
00:17:37,179 --> 00:17:43,330
own language sometimes several this is

418
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:45,000
how we identify each other language is a

419
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:48,340
very powerful tool for efficiency

420
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:52,389
inclusion sometimes exclusion and social

421
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:53,769
engineering so talk to each other also

422
00:17:52,389 --> 00:17:55,779
means that you have to establish a

423
00:17:53,769 --> 00:17:58,269
healthy environment for feedback and be

424
00:17:55,779 --> 00:18:01,029
utterly fearless of criticism this can

425
00:17:58,269 --> 00:18:02,980
be scary to some traditionalists after

426
00:18:01,029 --> 00:18:05,830
every one of these operations success or

427
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:09,039
failure our team tends to do a thorough

428
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:10,689
debrief with the entire team if anybody

429
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:12,070
wants to talk about what went well what

430
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:13,659
to do better next time

431
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:14,860
or just wanted to get something off

432
00:18:13,659 --> 00:18:16,750
their chest that happen in the heat of

433
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:20,590
things they had a safe space to do so

434
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:22,659
anybody could criticize anybody and we

435
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:24,699
set aside specific time and space time

436
00:18:22,659 --> 00:18:26,860
and place for them to do so this

437
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:29,710
feedback loop is absolutely critical it

438
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:31,750
is literally the only way to know that

439
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:39,190
you are continuously improving your game

440
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:41,019
whatever game that might be so swarm

441
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:42,970
intelligence doesn't mean that we can't

442
00:18:41,019 --> 00:18:45,220
or should not have leadership or

443
00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:47,980
organization but the role of leadership

444
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:50,169
in a swarm is clear the first role of a

445
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:52,899
leader in a swarm is to reinforce the

446
00:18:50,169 --> 00:18:56,889
wind conditions this is also called

447
00:18:52,899 --> 00:18:58,229
maintaining the vision the next thing

448
00:18:56,889 --> 00:19:00,549
that a leader should be doing is

449
00:18:58,230 --> 00:19:02,289
motivating that skills mastery you're

450
00:19:00,549 --> 00:19:06,668
basically just teaching people to play

451
00:19:02,289 --> 00:19:08,470
the game and the last thing is you need

452
00:19:06,669 --> 00:19:10,630
to facilitate communication you need to

453
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:12,549
remove any obstacle to communication

454
00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:15,039
that is happening this basically goes

455
00:19:12,549 --> 00:19:16,870
back to talk to each other once again

456
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:18,940
not just you talking to them and them

457
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:23,350
talking to you everybody needs to be

458
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:24,850
speaking to each other so the thing is

459
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:25,928
if you're doing this

460
00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:27,549
and you're really striving to be

461
00:19:25,929 --> 00:19:29,649
successful at these things what you're

462
00:19:27,549 --> 00:19:31,960
really doing once again is you're

463
00:19:29,649 --> 00:19:35,320
building trust and this is of course

464
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:37,120
what social engineering is all about so

465
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:39,789
building trust whether that's to

466
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:43,658
persuade people to act for or against

467
00:19:39,789 --> 00:19:45,009
their own self-interests so there are

468
00:19:43,659 --> 00:19:47,580
many good resources for how to establish

469
00:19:45,009 --> 00:19:49,870
this trust many leaders in the industry

470
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:51,370
I'm gonna show you a framework that has

471
00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:59,439
been used by tribal structures for

472
00:19:51,370 --> 00:20:01,658
centuries to establish trust if you want

473
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:07,169
to leave a swarm your job is to be a

474
00:20:01,659 --> 00:20:09,639
party cat the best party cat you can be

475
00:20:07,169 --> 00:20:11,620
when it really comes down to it the

476
00:20:09,639 --> 00:20:14,469
lifeblood of a swarm is recruiting and

477
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:16,330
retention and the best way to do that is

478
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:21,100
to deliver a worthwhile experience to

479
00:20:16,330 --> 00:20:23,710
everybody involved this is the party now

480
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:25,330
party is a metaphor it doesn't have to

481
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:27,899
be a literal party it could be some

482
00:20:25,330 --> 00:20:30,908
other kind of worthwhile experience and

483
00:20:27,899 --> 00:20:33,070
each swarms definition and individuals

484
00:20:30,909 --> 00:20:34,809
within the swarm may have their own

485
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:38,139
particular idea of what's a worthwhile

486
00:20:34,809 --> 00:20:40,360
experience once you've identified your

487
00:20:38,139 --> 00:20:43,629
swarms definition of a party it's your

488
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:47,139
job to keep it rolling your goals are to

489
00:20:43,629 --> 00:20:49,120
build trust and identify reward this is

490
00:20:47,139 --> 00:20:51,008
the fuel for the party machine and once

491
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:56,620
again you have to keep that party

492
00:20:51,009 --> 00:20:59,399
machine rolling so when we're chasing

493
00:20:56,620 --> 00:21:01,570
trust and reward there's sort of a bio a

494
00:20:59,399 --> 00:21:03,729
biological component to this there are

495
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:05,769
several chemicals in the brain that

496
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:09,250
we're seeking to activate to in

497
00:21:05,769 --> 00:21:12,009
particular the first is oxytocin which

498
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:15,509
is fundamental to trust and bonding this

499
00:21:12,009 --> 00:21:18,309
is where the party comes in the other is

500
00:21:15,509 --> 00:21:20,639
dopamine which controls our reward

501
00:21:18,309 --> 00:21:25,928
systems and defines what we think of as

502
00:21:20,639 --> 00:21:27,490
worthwhile experiences so as human

503
00:21:25,929 --> 00:21:29,679
beings we've actually discovered a few

504
00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:33,730
very reliable ways to activate dopamine

505
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:35,790
reward centers in the brain and it's not

506
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:42,030
the one you're thinking of

507
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:44,070
and it's not money either it's gaming so

508
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:47,580
games have a built in win condition

509
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:50,220
that's what games are games remove

510
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:52,560
obstacles for communication by providing

511
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:56,310
opportunities to take risks and show

512
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:58,139
vulnerabilities games have been shown in

513
00:21:56,310 --> 00:22:01,530
many cases to be more reliable than

514
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:02,850
money or many other things to get people

515
00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:06,210
to act for or against their own

516
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:08,159
self-interests so when we create games

517
00:22:06,210 --> 00:22:10,380
that promote mastery of these skills

518
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:11,070
we're also reinforcing the swarms win

519
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:13,200
conditions

520
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:14,700
we're promoting communication by

521
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:19,140
establishing meaningful connections

522
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:22,110
between people we're building trust so

523
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:24,360
what makes a good game so going back to

524
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:26,820
what we said in the beginning this is a

525
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:29,070
game that is difficult it has a chance

526
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:30,990
of failure and it's may be adversarial

527
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:32,990
there might be somebody who is trying to

528
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:35,490
stop you from doing this thing

529
00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:37,890
it requires strategic movement in

530
00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:39,900
physical space now the physical space

531
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:43,170
component is actually pretty important I

532
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:44,820
mean most of us are used to living a

533
00:22:43,170 --> 00:22:47,670
good deal of our lives on the internet

534
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:49,669
or through technology there's a certain

535
00:22:47,670 --> 00:22:52,770
secret sauce and physical proximity

536
00:22:49,670 --> 00:22:57,300
there's an old saying that space is what

537
00:22:52,770 --> 00:23:01,110
makes us human and again this requires

538
00:22:57,300 --> 00:23:02,820
cooperation precision and secrecy these

539
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:09,959
are all things that will help us build

540
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:13,379
trust going back to the party cat

541
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:15,870
because it's still very important so in

542
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:17,700
ingress we often refer to tournament

543
00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:21,060
play as a process of planning a wedding

544
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:22,440
as well as a war that is you have to

545
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:25,080
take care of the strategy you got to

546
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:26,550
pass the war you you have to win the

547
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:29,070
game and do the things to win the game

548
00:23:26,550 --> 00:23:31,169
but your first job in in winning that

549
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:33,500
war is to make sure the army shows up

550
00:23:31,170 --> 00:23:37,620
that's the wedding

551
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:39,480
so in ingress as well as I believe many

552
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:41,399
other augmented reality games

553
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:44,820
tournaments are run largely by the

554
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:46,860
players they don't get paid generally

555
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:47,850
they just doing it because they want to

556
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:50,050
win

557
00:23:47,850 --> 00:23:54,639
there's a very important lesson in here

558
00:23:50,050 --> 00:23:57,040
about crowdsourcing so hotels after

559
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:58,960
parties emergent gameplay this is all

560
00:23:57,040 --> 00:24:01,450
organization for the purposes of getting

561
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:08,140
people to do to the place to do the

562
00:24:01,450 --> 00:24:10,270
thing so you can win the game and it's

563
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:12,730
very important to remember that swarms

564
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:15,490
particularly in any kind of volunteer

565
00:24:12,730 --> 00:24:17,680
situation will always always gravitate

566
00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:19,750
toward the people who are visibly having

567
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:28,930
the most fun they will go out of their

568
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:31,330
way to avoid the people who are not now

569
00:24:28,930 --> 00:24:32,920
swarm intelligence airs on the site of

570
00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:36,070
trust and inclusion and access to

571
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:38,230
information the main reason for this is

572
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:40,899
because a tool that is not shared cannot

573
00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:44,550
actually be benefited enemies are

574
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:46,870
expensive bad actors are also expensive

575
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:48,310
you may think you have a Leroy Jenkins

576
00:24:46,870 --> 00:24:52,050
and it turns out you have an Edward

577
00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:55,330
Snowden these are hard problems if

578
00:24:52,050 --> 00:24:57,250
you're in a swarm and you have a

579
00:24:55,330 --> 00:24:59,080
specific goal in mind you will often

580
00:24:57,250 --> 00:25:00,640
find yourself making decisions that will

581
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:02,260
make you uncomfortable or appear to

582
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:03,360
compromise your control over the

583
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:06,310
situation

584
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:13,740
choosing trusts is difficult it's

585
00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:15,940
generally worthwhile back to party cat

586
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:17,590
here's where we start to see how we can

587
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:19,450
use games as a way not just to teach

588
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:22,840
skills mastery but to cultivate and

589
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:26,050
validate trust we start small with small

590
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:28,929
projects small numbers as we deliver

591
00:25:26,050 --> 00:25:32,290
worthwhile experiences we plan parties

592
00:25:28,930 --> 00:25:33,880
we gain trust that trust can become a

593
00:25:32,290 --> 00:25:38,710
kind of social capital that we can

594
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:40,090
reinvest into larger adventures so you

595
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:42,490
continue reinforcing your wind

596
00:25:40,090 --> 00:25:44,500
conditions building skills mastery and

597
00:25:42,490 --> 00:25:46,780
helping people create meaningful

598
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:50,770
connections with each other this is how

599
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:52,600
your swarm will become a tribe so by now

600
00:25:50,770 --> 00:25:54,790
I hope you are probably already thinking

601
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:57,189
about how to apply swarm intelligence to

602
00:25:54,790 --> 00:25:59,500
your own projects it's been a pleasure

603
00:25:57,190 --> 00:26:00,910
to here to present here at tour camp and

604
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:03,120
I hope to speak with you all again very

605
00:26:00,910 --> 00:26:03,120
soon

606
00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:22,810
[Applause]

607
00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:28,150
anybody have any questions you want to

608
00:26:22,810 --> 00:26:29,710
play a game pretty much there's this

609
00:26:28,150 --> 00:26:31,750
idea that a swarm gravitates around a

610
00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:34,120
wind condition it's an idea it's a goal

611
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:36,310
and it could be a spit could be a

612
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:42,699
literal game but it could be some sort

613
00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:44,110
of any sort of goal let's go to Mars so

614
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:45,790
in general when you were recruiting for

615
00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:48,070
swarm you're looking for people who are

616
00:26:45,790 --> 00:26:50,020
interested in this goal and that they're

617
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:54,040
going to be committed to this goal games

618
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:55,720
are a very easy way of getting that win

619
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:59,740
condition and getting people involved

620
00:26:55,720 --> 00:27:01,510
but generally speaking it's hey we're

621
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:04,710
doing this cool thing do you want to do

622
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:04,710
you want to be a part of it

623
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:29,720
absolutely yes yes actually uh let's see

624
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:34,450
here this wasn't me personally but a

625
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:37,670
friend of mine had recently been to a

626
00:27:34,450 --> 00:27:41,300
sort of a grassroots political

627
00:27:37,670 --> 00:27:44,930
organization recently and reported that

628
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:47,149
this was actually how many of these many

629
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:49,760
of the organizers were using to activate

630
00:27:47,150 --> 00:27:52,010
new cells basically using a

631
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:53,600
decentralized approach and saying here

632
00:27:52,010 --> 00:27:58,370
are the tools that you need to do this

633
00:27:53,600 --> 00:28:02,360
and letting them loose so really any

634
00:27:58,370 --> 00:28:05,560
sort of volunteer organization once

635
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:10,219
again the the Swedish Pirate Party is

636
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:11,990
also describes itself as a swarm but

637
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:15,050
yeah just about any sort of situation

638
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:17,110
where you have volunteers who are free

639
00:28:15,050 --> 00:28:19,520
will to individuals who may all have

640
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:21,729
slightly different ideas about how to do

641
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,730
things

642
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:44,059
that's an excellent question how do you

643
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:45,740
avoid becoming a pyramid for me

644
00:28:44,059 --> 00:28:48,020
personally I think it is also always

645
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:50,420
come back to the other members of the

646
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:52,400
swarm I think the feedback loop is a

647
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:56,090
very important way of making sure that

648
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:57,410
you stay honest if somebody doesn't like

649
00:28:56,090 --> 00:28:59,449
what you're doing certainly they can

650
00:28:57,410 --> 00:29:01,370
walk away but if you have a healthy

651
00:28:59,450 --> 00:29:02,450
swarm with a good feedback loop then a

652
00:29:01,370 --> 00:29:03,800
lot of times you'll be able to catch

653
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:06,010
these problems before they become

654
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:06,010
problems

655
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:24,240
if you're an authoritarian hold a little

656
00:29:21,789 --> 00:29:24,240
walk away

657
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:33,860
any other questions

658
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:43,998
excellent thank you so much

659
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:43,999
[Applause]
