1
00:00:00,889 --> 00:00:04,860
as I said earlier we went from one

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:06,298
really great talk to another we've got

3
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:07,860
Rob up here who's gonna be talking about

4
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:09,360
in the NF a brocation and this is gonna

5
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:16,460
be a wonderful talk so please welcome

6
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:20,189
him to the tour camp stage hi everybody

7
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:22,530
thanks for coming if you were at tour

8
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:23,760
camp a couple of years ago you would

9
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:26,040
have seen me on the stage talking about

10
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,570
this crazy ancient microscope that I

11
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:30,299
inherited

12
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:32,698
it's a scanning electron microscope it

13
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:35,489
was made in the 1980s I was right around

14
00:00:32,698 --> 00:00:39,358
1980 I was alive but I was not that old

15
00:00:35,489 --> 00:00:40,678
in 1980 it had a lot of problems I

16
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:41,879
talked about all the crazy problems that

17
00:00:40,679 --> 00:00:44,429
I had to go through to get this thing

18
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:45,960
working again and immediately after tour

19
00:00:44,429 --> 00:00:48,149
camp it ran into another really

20
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:49,859
difficult problem and so that's what I

21
00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:52,589
want to tell you about which is this

22
00:00:49,859 --> 00:00:53,909
kind of scope is can I just see a show

23
00:00:52,589 --> 00:00:55,949
of hands who here has any experience at

24
00:00:53,909 --> 00:00:58,199
all on scanning electron microscopy see

25
00:00:55,949 --> 00:00:59,608
this is why I love to work at my god and

26
00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:00,780
it's not just people in my hackerspace

27
00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:03,089
it was played with this scope I mean

28
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:05,960
like there's there's people out here so

29
00:01:03,089 --> 00:01:08,280
hands up if you've used a thermionic

30
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:09,720
hands if you know what a thermionic is

31
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:11,700
maybe we'll start there okay okay I'll

32
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:14,070
get into the differences here if you

33
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:16,500
have played with the scope in in school

34
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:18,059
at college whatever the most by far the

35
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:19,440
most common kind of electron emitter is

36
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:22,680
a thermionic emitter it's basically a

37
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:24,810
light bulb you have a little loop of

38
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:27,350
tungsten wire you pass a current through

39
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:29,970
it and it emits photons and electrons

40
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:31,979
this scope is a different countries as

41
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:36,780
different kind of technology called NF

42
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:40,050
eg an Fe G is a field emission electron

43
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:41,520
gun so in your thermionic this is

44
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:43,320
represents a little loop of tungsten

45
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,880
just like a filament in a light bulb

46
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:47,639
that's that's the that's a really common

47
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:49,800
kind pass a current it makes a beam of

48
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:51,240
electrons it makes a cloud of electrons

49
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:53,330
you use electro magnetics to perform it

50
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:55,919
into a beam and looks and accelerated

51
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:59,130
but the tighter you can get this little

52
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:02,460
hairpin the smaller you can make the

53
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:03,720
effective spot so there are other kinds

54
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:05,279
of technologies that will make tighter

55
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:07,408
and tighter spots another kind of

56
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,509
technology is a lab six lanthanum

57
00:02:07,409 --> 00:02:12,330
hexafluoride crystal where you're

58
00:02:09,508 --> 00:02:13,390
actually using the edge of a crystal

59
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:17,290
that was grown

60
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:19,630
to to emit electrons and then down at

61
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:22,929
the other end here we get the fe g the

62
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:25,510
fe g is a single crystal of tungsten

63
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:27,970
that has been etched to be atomically

64
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:30,160
thin at the end to provide the smallest

65
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:33,130
possible point and therefore the

66
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:34,870
greatest possible magnification so that

67
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:37,630
like the difference in technology here

68
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:40,030
is vast like this I take a piece of you

69
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:42,010
know 0.1 millimeter tungsten I bend it

70
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:44,890
in a loop I spot welded on to an emitter

71
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:49,030
and I'm good this is a five thousand

72
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:51,040
dollar piece of machined tungsten so my

73
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:54,310
challenge after tour camp was my emitter

74
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:56,260
died so what am I going to do now with

75
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:59,980
this thing that I've sunk a year into

76
00:02:56,260 --> 00:03:01,630
and well you know this is a this is what

77
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:03,940
the emitter module looks like when

78
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:05,769
you've removed it from the scope this

79
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:07,269
was a very heart-rending exercise

80
00:03:05,769 --> 00:03:10,600
because I knew that as soon as I cracked

81
00:03:07,269 --> 00:03:13,510
the the copper seal that holds this

82
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:14,650
thing in place I was in for a very

83
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:15,190
expensive repair if I couldn't do it

84
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:17,650
myself

85
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:20,940
so so so this thing like to give you a

86
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:26,950
sense of scale it's about the size of

87
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:31,690
the the tip here is it's very smoothly

88
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:34,570
polished it's an anode it's in the in

89
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:37,090
the in the thermionic it's it's called

90
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:38,950
the vanilla you have let me just go back

91
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:40,150
for a second you have all of these

92
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:43,450
basically work in the same kind of

93
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:46,900
principle you have something that makes

94
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:51,548
electrons happen and then you have this

95
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:53,709
then L to this surrounding piece and

96
00:03:51,549 --> 00:03:55,480
there's a high voltage potential between

97
00:03:53,709 --> 00:03:58,570
the two this whole thing is in a vacuum

98
00:03:55,480 --> 00:04:00,700
and the an acceleration happens between

99
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:03,700
these two points so the electrons move

100
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:04,899
down the column and you know when I say

101
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:07,298
column the column is actually quite tall

102
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:10,450
in here the FEG is up here at the top so

103
00:04:07,299 --> 00:04:12,310
there's a little tiny point for an Fe G

104
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:13,720
you need to be an ultra high vacuum so

105
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:17,168
this is a ten to the minus nine tour

106
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:18,190
which is very difficult to achieve I'm

107
00:04:17,168 --> 00:04:19,779
not going to get into all of that that

108
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:21,070
was the last talk this talk is about how

109
00:04:19,779 --> 00:04:24,130
what the hell do you do when the thing

110
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:26,409
is broken so you have your electrons or

111
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:27,190
emitted here they're accelerated down a

112
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:29,950
tube

113
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:33,390
there are various electromagnetic coils

114
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:36,130
that steer and focus the beam your

115
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:37,870
sample is down here the electrons hit

116
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:39,159
the sample they reflect off into sensors

117
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:42,640
and then that's what that's what turns

118
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:45,310
into your picture so what I had to do

119
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:47,800
first was rip this thing out so you've

120
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:51,130
got this is all porcelain this is a

121
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:52,860
razor-sharp edge that is a knife edge

122
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:55,210
that's gonna dig into a copper gasket

123
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:57,670
that is the only thing that's strong

124
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:58,870
enough to withstand the atmospheric

125
00:04:57,670 --> 00:05:01,330
pressure to keep you at ultra-high

126
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:04,420
vacuum the whole thing the whole system

127
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:06,820
has to be baked to remove the water

128
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:08,620
vapor and strain extraneous air

129
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:10,360
molecules out of the system it's is

130
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:11,980
really difficult to get the vacuum back

131
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:13,390
once you've cracked this so once once it

132
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:15,370
was open like well you know I got

133
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:17,370
nothing to lose now let's keep digging

134
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:19,960
let's let's see what's inside of it so

135
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:22,360
if I take the top of the vent hole off

136
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:26,739
so if I unscrew this thing what you end

137
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:28,390
up with is this so this is a little loop

138
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:31,330
of tungsten wire that's 1/10 of a

139
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:33,700
millimeter thick and on top of it is

140
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:35,620
this little tiny stick here and on top

141
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:37,510
of that there's a little tiny point and

142
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:39,430
that point is one or two atoms of

143
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:42,640
tungsten thick if it were a good emitter

144
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:44,710
this one is a broken emitter so just to

145
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:46,840
give you a sense of scale that's how big

146
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:48,549
it is we've got eight millimeters across

147
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:50,440
we've got a tenth of a millimeter here

148
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:54,700
we've got one millimeter here and then

149
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:57,580
it goes down to well it goes down to 500

150
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:59,349
picometers on the end of that yeah so

151
00:05:57,580 --> 00:06:02,740
half a nanometer is what we're trying to

152
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:04,600
go for I called a couple of different

153
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:06,400
places saying hi will you take pity on

154
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:08,680
me I really need one of these modules

155
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:10,239
they they don't really make cold cathode

156
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:11,890
Fe G's anymore they're kind of finicky

157
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,740
and it's a lot easier to use the lab

158
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:17,349
sixes because generally you're not going

159
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:19,960
down to 600,000 X magnification on a day

160
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:21,340
to day kind of basis and you want your

161
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:23,500
grad students to be able to just turn

162
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:25,630
the machine on and do the thing right so

163
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:27,220
lab 6 will get you down to you know 50

164
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:28,180
maybe even a hundred thousand X which is

165
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:30,310
more than enough for most people's

166
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:33,070
application and it's not as finicky but

167
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:34,300
me I like I I want to you know push it

168
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:35,440
as far as I could possibly go so of

169
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:37,360
course I want to manufacture one of

170
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:39,010
these things no one would talk to me no

171
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,660
one like they thought I was a terrorist

172
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:42,670
because I was not you know attached to

173
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:45,070
University like I don't know it was very

174
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:46,480
difficult to convince people that yes I

175
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:51,030
am a good person and I just want to fix

176
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:53,860
my microscope so I was kind of on my own

177
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:56,799
so the first thing I had to learn how to

178
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:59,080
do was spot weld tungsten wire and this

179
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:01,960
was my first attempt I needed a spot

180
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:04,419
welder so I made a spot welder we ripped

181
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:08,349
a microwave oven transformer out of a

182
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:10,210
microwave I had some help from my shop

183
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:11,860
mates this used to be thousands of

184
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:14,260
windings of copper and we chiseled the

185
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:17,830
thing out of there and put in some

186
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:19,719
double-aught copper so this became a

187
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:21,909
step down transformer instead of civic

188
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:23,860
up to you know 3000 volts it steps down

189
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:26,410
to about a volt you know many many many

190
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:29,350
amps and we stuck a you know foot switch

191
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:31,240
on it it comes out here to a couple of

192
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:32,650
tungsten electrodes and I figured okay

193
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:34,390
I'll clamp my thing in there and I'll

194
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:35,890
hit it and we'll see what happens so

195
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:37,690
this is a magnification of those two

196
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:39,280
tungsten electrodes coming together and

197
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:40,840
then this is the loop of wire and this

198
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:42,309
is the little tiny one millimeter piece

199
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:44,530
and that's an infrared and you could see

200
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:46,240
you know okay I'm spot welding tungsten

201
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:47,590
great well what I was really doing

202
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:50,950
though was I was making a whole lot of

203
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:53,200
tungsten oxide and destroying the piece

204
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:55,090
that I was trying to weld

205
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:56,530
so I I couldn't even start at a tenth of

206
00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:58,299
a millimeter it was way too small like

207
00:07:56,530 --> 00:08:00,729
that's like you know human hair is right

208
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:01,780
you know so this is a quarter of a

209
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:03,400
millimeter because I thought I would

210
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:05,950
start easy you know start with something

211
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:09,400
like in at least see and I couldn't do

212
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:11,530
it it was terrible it forms a very

213
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:13,539
brittle weld this is the original

214
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:18,309
emitter for for scale so you can see

215
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:20,680
it's twice as thick the weld the yeah

216
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:22,390
the tungsten would just break I tried

217
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:23,740
using shield gas because the part of the

218
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:25,270
tungsten oxide was of course it's

219
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:26,830
getting very hot and the tungsten is

220
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:28,930
reacting with oxygen in the air so I

221
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:30,159
used argan as a shield gas and it was a

222
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:32,110
mess this was a terrible idea

223
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,310
and after a little bit more research it

224
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:34,599
turns out it's because it's completely

225
00:08:33,309 --> 00:08:37,179
the wrong approach because I was putting

226
00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:39,580
way too much power over much too long at

227
00:08:37,179 --> 00:08:41,890
a time on a very small piece so what I

228
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:43,870
needed was a capacitive discharge welder

229
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:46,180
were you charged of a capacitor bank and

230
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:49,930
then you quickly discharged it the

231
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:51,790
problem is a CVD is about a $3,500

232
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:54,579
device that I knew that I would use a

233
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:56,469
couple of times I did I called around

234
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:57,820
no anybody actually had one I looked

235
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:59,170
into actually making one I know a little

236
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:03,460
bit about capacitors in high voltage

237
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:06,370
it's a sort of a side-lying hobby but I

238
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:08,230
didn't I didn't really want to design a

239
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:09,790
switch that would be reliable enough

240
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:12,160
within the timings that I needed it was

241
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:14,439
just it was just too much and besides I

242
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:16,060
could take advantage of eBay so they're

243
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:17,290
there any drone enthusiasts in the in

244
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:19,089
the audience I just want to say

245
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:21,040
personally thank you for making market

246
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:25,120
forces such that I could go onto eBay

247
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:28,420
and find $100 cvd welder because you

248
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:31,660
need a capacitive discharge in order to

249
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:32,920
weld tabs onto the battery terminals on

250
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:34,300
lithium ion packs because you can't

251
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:35,800
solder them because of course you'll you

252
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:38,349
know make a lithium fire if you try to

253
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:40,240
do that so you need to CVD welder so

254
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:41,920
this thing showed up from you know

255
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,480
mainly in China about you know two weeks

256
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:45,610
after I ordered it not only had to take

257
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:47,890
it apart twice the first time I plugged

258
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:49,660
it in it just tripped the breaker likely

259
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:53,710
okay something is clearly wrong in here

260
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:55,660
and I took it apart and their method of

261
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:58,900
assembly was really interesting they had

262
00:09:55,660 --> 00:10:00,640
a PC board wedged up against a piece of

263
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:01,720
sheet metal that was just instantly

264
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,920
shorting look I don't even know how it

265
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:05,410
was supposed to work in the first place

266
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:07,300
like what are you guys doing so I

267
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:09,339
ordered some parts I repaired the CVD

268
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:10,839
welder so okay so to be fair it was a

269
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:14,200
hundred dollars plus you know ten bucks

270
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:16,240
in another week but I got working so at

271
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:18,640
that point this little guy has a foot

272
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:20,830
switch in a tiny little anvil I just

273
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:22,569
kind of made and then boom I could I

274
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:23,560
could spot weld tungsten to tungsten

275
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:27,160
okay great

276
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:28,869
this is a laser cut out like this is to

277
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:30,850
scale that little loop of wire with the

278
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:33,400
one millimeter thing on the top of you

279
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:35,080
might remember so this was my first ever

280
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:36,819
attempt to spot weld and it totally

281
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:40,380
worked and didn't didn't turned into

282
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:42,970
nasty oxides so once I had that I

283
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:45,310
realized that I couldn't just spot weld

284
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:47,410
tungsten wire I had to spot weld a mono

285
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:49,000
crystal of tungsten mono crystalline

286
00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:52,689
tungsten is available through different

287
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:55,030
scientific markets but it's extremely

288
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:58,330
expensive and expensive because it's

289
00:10:55,030 --> 00:11:01,630
extremely fragile the problem is that a

290
00:10:58,330 --> 00:11:03,160
mono crystal is brittle so you can make

291
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:04,270
mono crystalline tungsten and you need a

292
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:06,819
moniker still let me just take a step

293
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:08,319
back tungsten wire you can get it on

294
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:09,730
eBay all day long because people may

295
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,380
old fashioned light bulbs out of it and

296
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:14,350
the way that they make it is they Center

297
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:16,510
tungsten powder so you heat up tungsten

298
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:17,920
powder you force it through a die and so

299
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:20,200
you end up with this kind of like packed

300
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:22,510
granule kind of structure it's not a

301
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:24,130
single crystal it's it's lots and lots

302
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:26,020
of little tiny grains all pointed in

303
00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:27,370
different directions so if you try to

304
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:29,829
edge that you're gonna end up with a

305
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:31,390
point that's lots of little granules in

306
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:33,850
little you know little tiny points it's

307
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:36,819
not gonna work so I found a paper online

308
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:38,680
for generate for creating your own mono

309
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:42,370
crystal in tungsten in the lab so what

310
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:45,310
this is this is a piece of Pyrex tubing

311
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:47,050
that you use for like in a chem lab for

312
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:48,550
making drains out of it's it's basically

313
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:52,540
a piece of tubing with gaskets on either

314
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:54,609
side so rings got a piece of aluminum on

315
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:57,189
the top and the bottom I drilled a

316
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:59,320
couple holes and put spark plugs inside

317
00:11:57,190 --> 00:12:00,790
and it's important if you're gonna do

318
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:02,380
this at home if you want to make one of

319
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:05,800
these there are two kinds of spark plugs

320
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:07,930
those with the EMF limiting resistors in

321
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:09,130
them and those without and we're all in

322
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:10,689
the States supposed to be used the EMF

323
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:12,280
limiting resistors like take those like

324
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:13,900
you can either remove the resistors or

325
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:16,120
you can find you know from India

326
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:19,300
basically yeah

327
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:21,550
no no resistor plugs so do that hook up

328
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:23,199
a very AK and away you go you make

329
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:25,120
effectively a great big light bulb you

330
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,950
hang a weight on the bottom of it you

331
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:28,930
turn the current up until it's nice and

332
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:30,850
orange and then you let it sit for a

333
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:33,069
couple of hours and slowly that

334
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:36,910
polycrystalline tungsten will melt and

335
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:38,950
relax and then there you go you got your

336
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:40,089
you got your mono crystal so you take it

337
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:44,470
out of there and what you end up with is

338
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:46,000
two very sharp very thin pieces of very

339
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:47,200
brittle tungsten that the first time you

340
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,250
pick it up it's going to break and fall

341
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,680
under the ground and you ever gonna see

342
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:55,060
it again so then you make another one

343
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:58,689
and and then yeah then you got your mono

344
00:12:55,060 --> 00:13:00,250
crystal so after I did that this is kind

345
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:01,450
of what I ended up with rather than

346
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:03,010
trying to make one of these from scratch

347
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:05,110
this is part of my problem this little

348
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:06,790
ceramic base this is the only one that I

349
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:09,910
have it's the you know it's the work the

350
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:11,380
working one and I didn't have it

351
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:13,510
together to try to make one of these yet

352
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:15,850
that's kind of a backburner project at

353
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:18,250
this point but instead of trying to make

354
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:20,080
the loop what I ended up doing was this

355
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:21,610
is the original emitter and I and I

356
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:23,380
picked off the

357
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:25,779
the little tiny point and then I

358
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:29,019
spot-welded my thing on there so I just

359
00:13:25,779 --> 00:13:33,730
sort of recycled it so once you've got

360
00:13:29,019 --> 00:13:35,980
that this is a picture of a spot weld

361
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:37,510
that I did before I've removed the the

362
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:39,160
emitter so this is with the old broken

363
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:41,860
emitter this is a piece of

364
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:43,719
polycrystalline tungsten spot welded to

365
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:45,250
a mono crystal and so I could inspect

366
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:47,110
the the weld and it's it was quite good

367
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:51,459
I got good wedding so I knew I was on

368
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:53,950
the right track so then how do you make

369
00:13:51,459 --> 00:13:55,420
it even sharper a tenth of a millimeter

370
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:57,970
is nowhere near five orders of magnitude

371
00:13:55,420 --> 00:14:00,160
off six orders of magnitude off so how

372
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:01,660
are you going to get it sharp there were

373
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:03,160
lots of people suggested different

374
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:04,510
methods for making it sharp some people

375
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:07,390
said just cut it with a sharp pair of

376
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:08,380
tweezers or a pair of pliers that's sure

377
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:10,990
I mean it's sharp enough to go into your

378
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:13,720
finger but that's it makes it worse than

379
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:15,430
when you started because cutters will

380
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:18,190
spread the edge so you know it looks

381
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:19,569
kind of flat you can somebody suggested

382
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:21,339
pulling it just take it and pull it

383
00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:23,620
really fast and while that's true you

384
00:14:21,339 --> 00:14:25,240
know you can get a pinch you can't I did

385
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:27,370
a bunch of experiments and you can't get

386
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:29,199
it reliably to a point and even then

387
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:33,130
you're still off by about ten thousand

388
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:35,019
times so the method that I found that

389
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:38,560
works really well is to electro edge it

390
00:14:35,019 --> 00:14:43,990
in lye so you make about a three molar

391
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:45,459
solution of NaOH of lye you this is just

392
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:47,380
a screw

393
00:14:45,459 --> 00:14:49,569
we've got my little popsicle stick here

394
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:52,000
in a little loop in the and the point I

395
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:54,160
just screw the screw down until there's

396
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,720
you know about millimeters or so of

397
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:57,730
tungsten hanging down into the bottom of

398
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:59,519
the solution and then you pass a current

399
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:03,220
through it so you're passing a current

400
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:05,920
through the point into the solution you

401
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:09,880
get a sacrificial anode of sacrificial

402
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:14,019
cathode of carbon inside the solution

403
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:14,860
and I found this method fortunately

404
00:15:14,019 --> 00:15:17,649
there was at least one paper there

405
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:22,300
wasn't behind a paywall that this is a

406
00:15:17,649 --> 00:15:25,480
thesis from annasophia Lussier from 2004

407
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:26,859
and she was writing about you know she's

408
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:29,260
a grad student and they have similar

409
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:33,420
problems to me they had no budget so

410
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:35,310
they need to make

411
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:37,439
tungsten points for various different

412
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:39,030
kinds of machinery not necessarily for

413
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,280
an SEM but I thought that the method

414
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:43,620
might be applicable and it totally was

415
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:45,480
so the the physical thing that's

416
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:47,340
happening here is when you pass a

417
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:49,860
current this represents the piece of

418
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:51,390
tungsten and then this is the top of the

419
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:53,820
solution and there's a meniscus and the

420
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:55,710
meniscus wicks up the sides of the

421
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:57,960
tungsten as you start to pass current

422
00:15:55,710 --> 00:16:00,930
through it it will preferentially etch

423
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:03,750
at the meniscus that's where all of the

424
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:05,400
action is happening so as it continues

425
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:07,410
it forms this kind of a like an

426
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:08,550
hourglass shape and it's incredible you

427
00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:09,540
can watch it as the current is passing

428
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:10,920
through it it just gets thinner and

429
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:12,089
thinner and thinner it's bubbling and

430
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:14,670
you can see it getting really really

431
00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:17,250
thin and then eventually at some point

432
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:19,020
it becomes so thin that it breaks and in

433
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:20,940
that instant that it breaks you have

434
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:23,280
atomically thin tungsten on both of

435
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:24,840
these in fact some people design special

436
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:26,640
little catchers in the bottom in order

437
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:28,380
to preserve the second point so you can

438
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:30,030
make twice as many of them I didn't

439
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:33,420
think it was really that necessary I

440
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:36,329
just made more but it's really wild to

441
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:37,680
watch this thing this thing work so the

442
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:40,020
first time I tried to do that this is

443
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:43,290
what I got I'm off by about an order of

444
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:45,120
10 to the fifth I think yeah it's I mean

445
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:47,880
that's clearly like a 2 micron point

446
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:52,290
this is the end of that mono crystal and

447
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:54,180
it's nice and round and well what did I

448
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:56,849
do wrong well what I did wrong is that

449
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:59,250
when this drop off happens I said at the

450
00:16:56,850 --> 00:17:01,290
instant that it breaks you have a mono

451
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:03,030
crystal but then in the very next

452
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:04,740
instant you're continuing the etching

453
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:06,510
process so the longer that the current

454
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:08,550
is applied the rounder and rounder this

455
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:09,690
point is going to get which actually

456
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:11,369
makes an argument for making the catcher

457
00:17:09,690 --> 00:17:14,970
because this one stops etching because

458
00:17:11,369 --> 00:17:16,889
there's no current but luckily the

459
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:18,360
timings aren't really that bad you

460
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:19,800
really just need to turn off the current

461
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:24,389
within you know a couple hundred

462
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:27,419
nanoseconds or something but fortunately

463
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:30,060
a 555 timer will do that job for you if

464
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:32,700
you make your selections of are sees

465
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:36,379
carefully enough so that's exactly what

466
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:38,640
I did this is from another paper on

467
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:43,270
manufacturing sharp pointy bits of

468
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:46,750
tungsten this one was from 2000

469
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:48,190
so all this thing is I mean I you know I

470
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:50,440
wired this thing up in you know an hour

471
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:52,720
in my shop I mean it's a 555 timer a

472
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:55,720
couple of resistors and a well-chosen

473
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:57,520
capacitor and what you end up with is a

474
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:59,380
circuit that you can apply you know

475
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:03,280
anywhere from five to you know let's say

476
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:05,200
30 volts DC and the secret sauce in why

477
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:07,149
these things cost five thousand dollars

478
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:09,250
and are a well guarded industrial secret

479
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:10,390
are in specifically in the to the choice

480
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:12,130
of voltages and timings and

481
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:13,960
concentrations of sodium hydroxides so

482
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:16,980
all I had to do was you know iterate on

483
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:19,900
that a little bit and and there you go

484
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:23,290
so this was one of my next experiments

485
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:25,270
it's much sharper if we zoom in on that

486
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:26,740
a little we can see now we're at ten

487
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:29,680
thousand X so we're much less than a

488
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:31,930
micron and keep in mind this is still

489
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:34,060
with the old emitter so I couldn't get

490
00:18:31,930 --> 00:18:35,740
really good focus at this point because

491
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:39,250
the emitter was dying as I was trying to

492
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:40,780
you know trying to do this and so yeah

493
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:42,460
at fifty thousand x week this is about

494
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:43,840
the best I could go and and I missed a

495
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:45,460
meeting I'm probably at about ten

496
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:47,230
nanometers or maybe smaller which is

497
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:49,000
within an order of magnitude right like

498
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:51,220
I'm like like maybe maybe two orders of

499
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,750
magnitude I'm getting really close so

500
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:55,510
here's the problem with the chicken in

501
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:57,040
the egg now like I want to make one I

502
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:58,660
went to inspect it and make sure that it

503
00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:01,720
is correct and then I want to install it

504
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:03,580
and I can't so I just went for it and I

505
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:05,590
guessed you know like I did it I made a

506
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:10,540
couple they look like I had a process

507
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:11,500
and so 48 hours later and it's 48 hours

508
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:13,750
because you remember that ultra high

509
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:15,130
vacuum I mentioned before so once you

510
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:18,900
have cracked the top off of this

511
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:21,730
microscope you need to okay do your etch

512
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:24,040
clean it off how do you clean atomically

513
00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:25,590
thin it's not even gonna get into it but

514
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:28,659
you know there can't be anything on it

515
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:30,070
and then you reassemble it and then you

516
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:31,630
realign it because the top of that venno

517
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:33,340
has a little hole in it and that hole

518
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:35,410
has to be perfectly aligned with the

519
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:37,000
center of the okay so i do all of that

520
00:19:35,410 --> 00:19:39,040
optically and i hope that it's good

521
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,570
enough and then i don't exactly have a

522
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:43,060
procedure for this i'm just making it up

523
00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:45,490
right so so then you reinstall it you

524
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:46,870
bolt it all down and then you heat the

525
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:48,520
whole thing up it's much the whole

526
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:50,379
microscope is wrapped in nichrome wire

527
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:51,879
so you pass a current through that you

528
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:54,760
get it to a couple hundred degrees you

529
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:55,929
bake it I sleep over because I don't

530
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:57,399
trust that the scope is

531
00:19:55,929 --> 00:19:59,230
not gonna burn my shop down while I'm at

532
00:19:57,399 --> 00:20:01,809
home so I'm sleeping on the couch and

533
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:04,590
then the next day you cool it

534
00:20:01,809 --> 00:20:06,610
and because Boyle's law we got PV NRT

535
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:08,139
after the vacuum system is removed

536
00:20:06,610 --> 00:20:09,998
enough of the intervening material when

537
00:20:08,139 --> 00:20:11,559
it's hot as it cools the pressure drops

538
00:20:09,999 --> 00:20:14,230
down because you're maintaining volume

539
00:20:11,559 --> 00:20:16,960
so if you're lucky and you don't have

540
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:19,240
any breaks in your copper gasket you

541
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:23,379
will get a very very very sharp pull

542
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:25,119
down to UHP so then you can turn the

543
00:20:23,379 --> 00:20:27,248
machine on and see if you get a spot and

544
00:20:25,119 --> 00:20:29,830
hopefully you do because otherwise you

545
00:20:27,249 --> 00:20:32,200
get to repeat all of that and I got

546
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:39,639
really lucky and it turns out that it

547
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:41,529
worked so thank you so so you'll notice

548
00:20:39,639 --> 00:20:42,879
that this is a very different kind of

549
00:20:41,529 --> 00:20:44,110
kind of thing like this almost looks

550
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:46,090
like math I look at this and I think

551
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:47,799
this is like abstract you know I mean

552
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:50,019
this is this is a beautiful Bajor curve

553
00:20:47,799 --> 00:20:51,759
right no this is this is electric

554
00:20:50,019 --> 00:20:55,240
machine tungsten like someone made this

555
00:20:51,759 --> 00:20:57,399
this is the original emitter so when I

556
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:59,139
head remember I told you I recycled the

557
00:20:57,399 --> 00:21:01,449
little loop and I popped off the old

558
00:20:59,139 --> 00:21:03,998
emitter I put it on a tab because I

559
00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:05,619
wanted to be able to inspect it and it

560
00:21:03,999 --> 00:21:06,879
looks like it goes down into infinity

561
00:21:05,619 --> 00:21:09,119
right like it goes down here down here

562
00:21:06,879 --> 00:21:13,240
down here and then like there's nothing

563
00:21:09,119 --> 00:21:14,889
and I mean at this point we're at 10

564
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:16,330
micro if this is a 10 micron line like

565
00:21:14,889 --> 00:21:18,699
you're already smaller than light will

566
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:20,379
let you see I mean like even if you had

567
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:23,559
a good optical scope you couldn't see

568
00:21:20,379 --> 00:21:27,850
the tip there's no way not with light so

569
00:21:23,559 --> 00:21:29,279
if we zoom down with electrons there's

570
00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:31,629
your problem

571
00:21:29,279 --> 00:21:33,820
that's what all this was about this was

572
00:21:31,629 --> 00:21:36,850
about a you know it's about a micron

573
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:39,549
chunk of random gunk and that was that

574
00:21:36,850 --> 00:21:40,809
that's so inside the vacuum system even

575
00:21:39,549 --> 00:21:42,429
though it's as clean as you can make it

576
00:21:40,809 --> 00:21:44,049
they're still random crap that floats

577
00:21:42,429 --> 00:21:46,149
around you know you're you're hitting an

578
00:21:44,049 --> 00:21:48,039
organic sample with an electron beam and

579
00:21:46,149 --> 00:21:49,360
bits of it fly off and eventually it

580
00:21:48,039 --> 00:21:51,490
finds its way up the beam and then

581
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:52,928
attaches itself to the emitter and then

582
00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:54,249
it you have to cook the emitter in order

583
00:21:52,929 --> 00:21:55,869
to get that crap back off of it that's

584
00:21:54,249 --> 00:21:57,309
why these effigies are finicky because

585
00:21:55,869 --> 00:21:59,470
there's this constant interplay between

586
00:21:57,309 --> 00:22:03,668
keeping the tip clean and using the tip

587
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:06,820
to image so this represents random junk

588
00:22:03,669 --> 00:22:09,009
bits of tungsten atoms that have

589
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:09,290
migrated downward over time you know and

590
00:22:09,009 --> 00:22:10,460
it'll

591
00:22:09,290 --> 00:22:11,690
a little bullfrog on the end of your

592
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:15,290
thing that's supposed to be atomically

593
00:22:11,690 --> 00:22:15,800
thin so now I have a new emitter okay

594
00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:18,740
great

595
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:20,870
so I went kind of nuts this last six

596
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:22,070
months taking pictures and now I have a

597
00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:24,260
bunch of them blown up and hang up on

598
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:26,450
the wall so that's what I wanted to make

599
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:28,850
the rest of the talk about I guess I'm

600
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:30,530
not doing pretty good on time so I'm

601
00:22:28,850 --> 00:22:32,719
gonna just talk about like stuff we took

602
00:22:30,530 --> 00:22:34,460
pictures of from here on out so before I

603
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:45,770
go on there any technical questions

604
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:47,240
about the manufacturer yes yeah it's

605
00:22:45,770 --> 00:22:48,590
very very good questions as possible to

606
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:50,930
recycle this tip and make appointee

607
00:22:48,590 --> 00:22:52,459
again not with the meniscus method

608
00:22:50,930 --> 00:22:54,590
unfortunately because part of the

609
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:56,510
component of making that drop happen is

610
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:58,550
that you have a couple of millimeters of

611
00:22:56,510 --> 00:23:00,350
tungsten hanging below the meniscus and

612
00:22:58,550 --> 00:23:01,970
there's just not enough material here

613
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:04,040
you know that the popsicle stick is too

614
00:23:01,970 --> 00:23:05,510
short so it's already about a millimeter

615
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:07,639
and I don't know how the hell you could

616
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:09,080
I mean maybe you could get a half a

617
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:10,250
millimeter now I don't think you could I

618
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:12,320
think the meniscus is probably bigger

619
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:13,610
than a half a millimeter even so I don't

620
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:15,679
think that you have enough hanging down

621
00:23:13,610 --> 00:23:17,570
to make the pinch happen

622
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:18,770
unfortunately I guess you could start

623
00:23:17,570 --> 00:23:20,120
longer I mean there's no reason why you

624
00:23:18,770 --> 00:23:21,650
couldn't start with a longer tip and

625
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:30,080
then you know slowly at you're way down

626
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:33,020
it's a it's a BLT s length

627
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:35,629
the critical dimension is that the top

628
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:37,460
of the tip must be quite near to the end

629
00:23:35,630 --> 00:23:39,050
of the vent out so as long as you can

630
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:40,670
move the rest of that module up and down

631
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:41,780
I don't see why you couldn't have a long

632
00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:44,480
one and then she slowly make it shorter

633
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:47,240
and shorter like a candle but I did not

634
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:48,470
do that this time I was trying to go for

635
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:49,640
something as close as possible to the

636
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:53,410
original because I had no idea that you

637
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:53,410
can work yes

638
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:58,930
ah yes good question the trigger for

639
00:23:56,890 --> 00:24:02,230
when to stop with a 555 so I didn't

640
00:23:58,930 --> 00:24:04,210
point it out earlier but the 555 senses

641
00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:06,850
changes in current through the circuit

642
00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:08,320
so it has its own trigger you have a

643
00:24:06,850 --> 00:24:11,770
little potentiometer that you can pick

644
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:14,050
so I just chose a voltage that I chose a

645
00:24:11,770 --> 00:24:15,760
position that made it close as close to

646
00:24:14,050 --> 00:24:17,169
the drop-off as I could see and then I

647
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:19,120
looked at a few under the microscope and

648
00:24:17,170 --> 00:24:20,200
then once I saw where it was close

649
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:22,840
enough that's where I left the

650
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:23,980
potentiometer said yeah you tricked you

651
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:28,419
hit a button to turn it on and then it

652
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:29,800
turns off automatically what does the

653
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:32,440
end of the new table click I wish I

654
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:35,649
could tell you because unfortunately

655
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:38,890
it's not possible to image it with its

656
00:24:35,650 --> 00:24:41,050
itself I am now now that it's been

657
00:24:38,890 --> 00:24:41,830
another year since I did this it's time

658
00:24:41,050 --> 00:24:43,930
to make another one

659
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:45,280
so after torque am now I'm gonna go home

660
00:24:43,930 --> 00:24:58,150
and make another one and pull the old

661
00:24:45,280 --> 00:25:01,060
tip off and we'll do this again but to a

662
00:24:58,150 --> 00:25:03,340
degree yes the the curvature is is

663
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:05,620
proportional to but it's more than just

664
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:09,429
the concentration of the lie it's the

665
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:10,750
it's the chosen edging voltage is way

666
00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:13,300
more important

667
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:15,520
in fact this first this first tip that I

668
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:16,840
showed you here you might notice that

669
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,820
there's there's two curves here there's

670
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:20,679
this curve and then it gets a lot

671
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:23,110
sharper and that's because I didn't know

672
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:25,060
which input voltage to use I was just

673
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:28,389
guessing and this was taking way too

674
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:30,129
long and I was like okay this is like it

675
00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:32,140
was at 12 volts I think I'm like well

676
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:33,760
it's just it's going and going I'm just

677
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:36,160
gonna crank it up to 15 and as soon as I

678
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:44,890
did it but it was done so I think the

679
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:46,030
voltage has way more to do yes fairly

680
00:25:44,890 --> 00:25:47,900
strong wouldn't want to get it in your

681
00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:52,850
eye

682
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:56,600
sorry III had such a good question I I

683
00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:58,639
don't know if I at first I chose I chose

684
00:25:56,600 --> 00:26:00,050
one molar and it didn't really seem to

685
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:02,290
do much and three molar seem to be

686
00:26:00,050 --> 00:26:13,010
plenty active and I didn't go past that

687
00:26:02,290 --> 00:26:14,750
yes how do you direct yes ah ah yes the

688
00:26:13,010 --> 00:26:17,660
question is how do you Daddy position it

689
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:21,770
once you've installed it the module

690
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:23,780
itself this whole thing sits in a small

691
00:26:21,770 --> 00:26:26,120
holder that has set screws that you can

692
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:28,040
finally position so ya you move the

693
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:29,149
whole base the tip the tip is where the

694
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:32,440
tip is and you hope it's straight up

695
00:26:29,150 --> 00:26:41,810
because you can't do anything about that

696
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:43,430
yes it's a very good question I think

697
00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:45,260
it's a refinement of this process but I

698
00:26:43,430 --> 00:26:47,690
haven't been able to find that out I I

699
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:49,730
don't I don't really know as far as I

700
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:52,610
can tell it's a it's a fairly well

701
00:26:49,730 --> 00:26:53,960
protected industrial secrets people

702
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:55,850
generally don't make their own FEG tips

703
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:58,700
and when they come from the manufacturer

704
00:26:55,850 --> 00:27:01,129
typically what you're supposed to do is

705
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:02,180
have an arrangement with the

706
00:27:01,130 --> 00:27:03,890
manufacturer and they come out and

707
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:05,480
service the machine so they don't have

708
00:27:03,890 --> 00:27:18,590
any incentive to have an aftermarket for

709
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:21,860
four components yes yes yes you can see

710
00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:26,389
the difference in imaging I think I have

711
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:28,610
a picture this no actually I don't

712
00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:30,950
really well you can almost sort of see

713
00:27:28,610 --> 00:27:32,090
it here you do a thorough inspection I

714
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:34,340
don't have another way to do it except

715
00:27:32,090 --> 00:27:36,350
to look at it under the microscope but

716
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:38,179
the region out here it's kind of hard to

717
00:27:36,350 --> 00:27:39,409
see I know it looks a little bit more

718
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:41,990
granular but by the time you get out

719
00:27:39,410 --> 00:27:43,100
here it gets a lot smoother and you can

720
00:27:41,990 --> 00:27:44,230
see the difference between this kind of

721
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:46,969
rough even though it's blurry

722
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:49,070
versus versus this this is a very good

723
00:27:46,970 --> 00:27:50,810
mono crystal I do not yet know if I have

724
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:52,370
achieved a very good mono crystal but I

725
00:27:50,810 --> 00:27:53,780
know that in the different samples that

726
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:56,510
I've made I have had better and worse

727
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:59,120
examples of it and you can really tell

728
00:27:56,510 --> 00:28:00,960
by the just by the way that it breaks

729
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:03,360
when you when you when you

730
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:05,279
on it the mana crystal is extremely

731
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:07,320
brittle and other pets of it are not as

732
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:33,630
I don't know how to describe it

733
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:43,139
otherwise yep one more I did it under

734
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:43,860
vacuum and I had no yeah so for high

735
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:45,840
vacuum

736
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:54,658
I was probably only at about ten to the

737
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:55,860
minus four ish I would say that's

738
00:28:54,659 --> 00:28:57,720
exactly what I used yeah use the

739
00:28:55,860 --> 00:29:00,799
roughing pump with large gaskets

740
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:00,799
[Music]

741
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:17,720
yeah the weight the weight makes a big

742
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:19,220
difference yep yeah yeah I think I think

743
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:21,620
ten to the minus four minus five seems

744
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:23,540
to be plenty for it like I let it glow

745
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:30,649
for a couple of hours and then I crank

746
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:32,330
the voltage until it broke forget the

747
00:29:30,650 --> 00:29:33,770
argon you have insufficient vacuum

748
00:29:32,330 --> 00:29:40,100
that's your problem where can you vacuum

749
00:29:33,770 --> 00:29:42,379
system all right I'm gonna move on to

750
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:43,280
the some of the imagery now and we'll

751
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:46,010
see if there's some more time for

752
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:47,360
questions at the end I wanted to start

753
00:29:46,010 --> 00:29:49,879
with something that I thought that you

754
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:53,689
all would appreciate this is a the

755
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:55,490
insides of Ayub icky security key this

756
00:29:53,690 --> 00:29:56,540
is not the Yubikey this just I wanted to

757
00:29:55,490 --> 00:29:58,640
give you a sense of scale because the

758
00:29:56,540 --> 00:30:00,440
prop the problem with imagery is you're

759
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:01,610
gonna be constantly lost here so unless

760
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:03,050
you know what the scale is you have no

761
00:30:01,610 --> 00:30:06,139
idea what you're looking at this is a

762
00:30:03,050 --> 00:30:07,610
bond wire pad so I see some people

763
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:09,080
nodding if you've ever tried to look at

764
00:30:07,610 --> 00:30:10,340
a bond wire pad they're too small to see

765
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:12,199
with your eye right like you need some

766
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:14,360
magnification they're really really tiny

767
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:16,220
this is the pad so everything that we're

768
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:18,110
gonna look at now is about 5,000 times

769
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:19,550
or 10,000 times smaller than this pad

770
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:21,429
which is the thing that you can barely

771
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:25,399
see okay just it be just to be clear so

772
00:30:21,430 --> 00:30:28,820
this is what happens if you dissolve a

773
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:30,800
you Baqi in strong acid they don't like

774
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:33,919
people like me trying to do this kind of

775
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:35,990
thing and they there is a whole

776
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:37,340
shielding layer that's on top of the

777
00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:39,710
actual circuitry so what we're looking

778
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:42,709
at is the discarded remnants of this

779
00:30:39,710 --> 00:30:44,150
tattered tapestry of RF and optical

780
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:46,630
shielding to prevent you from looking at

781
00:30:44,150 --> 00:30:49,310
reverse engineering the stuff underneath

782
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:50,630
this was our first attempt at ever doing

783
00:30:49,310 --> 00:30:52,040
this we didn't make a serious already

784
00:30:50,630 --> 00:30:54,290
attempt this was just like hey you know

785
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:56,480
can we do it so once you scrape that

786
00:30:54,290 --> 00:31:00,409
crap out of the way you can see

787
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:01,490
individual circuits I I'm not a circuit

788
00:31:00,410 --> 00:31:02,810
designer so I don't know what I'm

789
00:31:01,490 --> 00:31:04,520
looking at but I know it looks

790
00:31:02,810 --> 00:31:06,320
capacitive and really interesting it's

791
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:08,510
storing some state there I I don't know

792
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:09,919
but there's banks and banks and banks of

793
00:31:08,510 --> 00:31:13,210
this stuff let me tell you it goes on

794
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:13,210
like Tron for miles

795
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:19,370
so this is a 10,000 acts once you

796
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:21,709
scraped that top surface away these are

797
00:31:19,370 --> 00:31:22,820
like bus bars I don't know I don't know

798
00:31:21,710 --> 00:31:24,620
how else to describe that but this is

799
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:26,120
like power distributions so the actual

800
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:28,070
circuits sit on top of this and

801
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:30,169
interconnect different pieces and some

802
00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:32,178
of them are very clearly you know plus

803
00:31:30,170 --> 00:31:37,720
and minus but I don't know it just looks

804
00:31:32,179 --> 00:31:43,580
like really cool wallpaper it's amazing

805
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:46,370
poly-silicon yeah so man-made stuff

806
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:48,139
looks really geometric and now I'm gonna

807
00:31:46,370 --> 00:31:49,600
give you the insect alerts so if you are

808
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:51,830
at anyway you know triggered by

809
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:53,090
disturbing pictures of insects now is

810
00:31:51,830 --> 00:32:00,678
your chance to close your eyes because

811
00:31:53,090 --> 00:32:02,090
here's a spider so this guy he's smiling

812
00:32:00,679 --> 00:32:04,429
at you and look it up this is an optical

813
00:32:02,090 --> 00:32:08,270
picture this is not the SEM it was

814
00:32:04,429 --> 00:32:11,179
Christmas Day and I had gone and gotten

815
00:32:08,270 --> 00:32:12,379
a Christmas tree and it was a cute

816
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:14,330
little tree but I noticed it was kind of

817
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:15,950
dry that year I don't know why we just

818
00:32:14,330 --> 00:32:18,260
couldn't really keep it alive but we're

819
00:32:15,950 --> 00:32:19,640
going to a Christmas party and and my

820
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:21,710
wife Phoebe says hey what's that on your

821
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:24,679
hair and there's a little spider oh

822
00:32:21,710 --> 00:32:26,330
that's that's weird yeah we came home

823
00:32:24,679 --> 00:32:28,730
from the Christmas party and the tree

824
00:32:26,330 --> 00:32:30,980
had hatched and there were spiders all

825
00:32:28,730 --> 00:32:32,809
over the apartment but they were babies

826
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:34,250
I don't know that I don't know okay I'm

827
00:32:32,809 --> 00:32:35,960
also gonna say I'm not a biologist I'm

828
00:32:34,250 --> 00:32:36,770
not a taxon amidst I'm talking about a

829
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,910
whole lot of things I don't know

830
00:32:36,770 --> 00:32:39,800
anything about but I could take pictures

831
00:32:37,910 --> 00:32:43,070
of them so these are these are little

832
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:45,139
bitty baby spiders and so this guy this

833
00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:47,389
is actually a focus stack of 20 images

834
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:49,700
he's only about I'd put him at about a

835
00:32:47,390 --> 00:32:53,030
millimeter and a half tall so very very

836
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:55,640
small and I was impressed at how liquid

837
00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:56,720
they are you know when they're when

838
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:59,780
they're babies especially they're like

839
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:01,280
little bags of jelly covered in hairs

840
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:02,690
that's the best that I could do looking

841
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:04,639
at it under an optical scope any more

842
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:08,860
than that and you really couldn't see it

843
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:10,940
so here's your SEM of happy smiling

844
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:12,590
spider it's kind of dark in here yeah

845
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:15,080
I'm sorry I apologize for the glare but

846
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:17,270
this guy here I'll go back one you can

847
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:19,610
see he's got like one two three four or

848
00:33:17,270 --> 00:33:21,950
five six little seven eight little eyes

849
00:33:19,610 --> 00:33:25,729
and you can zoom in on each one of those

850
00:33:21,950 --> 00:33:29,390
guys so this is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7

851
00:33:25,730 --> 00:33:32,810
eight little eyes this scale this is at

852
00:33:29,390 --> 00:33:34,340
about 2,000 X or so I would say but you

853
00:33:32,810 --> 00:33:36,440
know each individual hair has lots of

854
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:38,990
little barbs on it and like here's a leg

855
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:41,150
like check out those Barb's those Barb's

856
00:33:38,990 --> 00:33:43,250
are on the nanometers candle like these

857
00:33:41,150 --> 00:33:45,260
guys operate in a completely different

858
00:33:43,250 --> 00:33:48,950
physical universe than you and I are

859
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:51,920
used to you know interacting in could I

860
00:33:48,950 --> 00:33:54,800
train them to do that's an excellent

861
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:56,560
suggestion I I think I need a spider

862
00:33:54,800 --> 00:34:01,460
army of minions

863
00:33:56,560 --> 00:34:04,700
possibly so if spiders don't squeak you

864
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:06,890
out enough here's a mosquito so

865
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:09,050
mosquitoes have a very different kind of

866
00:34:06,890 --> 00:34:10,700
you know kind of like if if spiders are

867
00:34:09,050 --> 00:34:12,980
like the serial killers of the insect

868
00:34:10,699 --> 00:34:15,529
world like these guys are just I don't

869
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:18,290
know they're like the deserter yeah yeah

870
00:34:15,530 --> 00:34:20,720
you know so here's dozens of eyes right

871
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:22,009
with little tiny hairs in between the

872
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:23,989
eyes

873
00:34:22,010 --> 00:34:27,350
the whole thing is very hairy this is

874
00:34:23,989 --> 00:34:29,089
the pro discus here these were the first

875
00:34:27,350 --> 00:34:30,500
couple of images that I took with the

876
00:34:29,090 --> 00:34:35,330
new emitter I was still kind of getting

877
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:36,560
the hang of it so so I'm gonna move on

878
00:34:35,330 --> 00:34:37,819
to this and I wish I could take it a

879
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:39,230
better picture of what this actually is

880
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:40,550
this is another optical picture it's

881
00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:42,440
another focus stack it's like another

882
00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:44,950
dozen pictures or something so it's it's

883
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:47,270
quite small this is a moths head and

884
00:34:44,949 --> 00:34:48,319
specifically this is the dividing line

885
00:34:47,270 --> 00:34:51,800
in the middle of the head and this is

886
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:54,110
one eye so a moth has compound eyes it

887
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:57,260
has two large sort of hemisphere kind of

888
00:34:54,110 --> 00:34:59,240
globes of eyes and I was amazed at what

889
00:34:57,260 --> 00:35:01,220
what what happened next with this

890
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:04,209
because I knew that compound eye has

891
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:06,200
many cells and you know each cell

892
00:35:04,210 --> 00:35:06,860
interacts with the light in interesting

893
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:08,270
ways

894
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:09,620
because each one is like a little part

895
00:35:08,270 --> 00:35:12,700
of a honeycomb every one of these little

896
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:15,910
dots is like a part of a honeycomb so

897
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:18,560
like a radio telescope array that is

898
00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:20,930
keep that in mind as we continue down

899
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:24,740
the rabbit hole here yes it's a lot like

900
00:35:20,930 --> 00:35:27,379
an array of antennas I just didn't

901
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:29,569
realize how much so if we start with

902
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:33,200
this little this little box here this is

903
00:35:29,570 --> 00:35:35,870
going to be this so we just zoomed in

904
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:39,049
many thousand times and here are your

905
00:35:35,870 --> 00:35:41,000
individual you know honeycomb

906
00:35:39,050 --> 00:35:43,520
your hexagons and well the first thing I

907
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:46,070
noticed when I got down at this level I

908
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:47,690
can't focus on it it's the weirdest

909
00:35:46,070 --> 00:35:49,550
thing and like you I'm not even gonna

910
00:35:47,690 --> 00:35:52,280
get into the issues of focusing in FEG

911
00:35:49,550 --> 00:35:53,770
we can talk offline about how this is

912
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:59,050
not a camera this is an interactive

913
00:35:53,770 --> 00:36:01,730
performance art display of a human being

914
00:35:59,050 --> 00:36:03,860
desperately trying to make an electron

915
00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:05,540
beam interact with a surface it is not

916
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:07,640
photography it is something else

917
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:08,900
entirely it's a lot of fun if you ever

918
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:10,790
want to come down to the shop but I

919
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:12,050
could not focus um I could focus on this

920
00:36:10,790 --> 00:36:14,390
stuff you can see this is perfectly

921
00:36:12,050 --> 00:36:17,420
sharp here's a little hair those are

922
00:36:14,390 --> 00:36:20,569
disturbing between the cells lots of

923
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:22,520
random debris and crap but the the the

924
00:36:20,570 --> 00:36:24,350
hexes themselves I could not focus on

925
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:26,120
and it could be because the you know the

926
00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:27,650
sample is holding too much charge is

927
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:29,240
generally the problem and you know

928
00:36:27,650 --> 00:36:31,490
because the beam interferes with itself

929
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:32,899
you have a negative beam shooting onto a

930
00:36:31,490 --> 00:36:34,640
surface that holds a negative charge you

931
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:35,900
can't hit it it's gonna deflect the beam

932
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:38,750
but that wasn't it

933
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:41,090
if I just couldn't focus on it so if we

934
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:45,680
take this Square and we're gonna go down

935
00:36:41,090 --> 00:36:47,060
onto that now here's what I saw so I was

936
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:50,660
not expecting this I thought it would be

937
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:53,120
a surface of a cell and what it was it

938
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:55,490
has lots of little cells ok well that's

939
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:57,170
interesting I know nothing about insects

940
00:36:55,490 --> 00:37:00,410
but wow this is really weird it's like

941
00:36:57,170 --> 00:37:02,600
an array of little antennas so we're now

942
00:37:00,410 --> 00:37:05,660
we're at 10,000 X so this line

943
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:07,700
represents one micron which I mean you

944
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:09,770
breathe 10 micron particles and don't

945
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:11,600
even notice it so these are very small

946
00:37:09,770 --> 00:37:14,120
and so that's clearly much smaller than

947
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:16,069
that I wanted to point out that these

948
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:17,900
pictures are actually much larger than

949
00:37:16,070 --> 00:37:20,420
the screen will let you see these are 13

950
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:21,980
megapixel images each so if we don't

951
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:24,560
even do many more I'm just going to

952
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:26,450
upscale here so you can see the same

953
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:28,130
number of pixels here's what we're

954
00:37:26,450 --> 00:37:32,299
looking at so here's your one micron

955
00:37:28,130 --> 00:37:33,860
line 10,000 X this stuff over here I've

956
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:35,960
seen enough stuff to tell you that this

957
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:39,890
is probably grass pollen it had a little

958
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:42,260
little pollen on its eye but these

959
00:37:39,890 --> 00:37:45,589
little things were intriguing so to get

960
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:47,750
down further magnification to get you

961
00:37:45,590 --> 00:37:50,750
know sharper what we're gonna do is I'm

962
00:37:47,750 --> 00:37:53,000
gonna take this little square and we're

963
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:54,230
going to go in but one thing that

964
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,220
you constantly do with the scanning

965
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:58,070
electron microscope is you're

966
00:37:55,220 --> 00:38:00,109
sacrificing resolution for zoom because

967
00:37:58,070 --> 00:38:01,760
the faster you can scan the deeper you

968
00:38:00,110 --> 00:38:03,530
can go because the less energy you're

969
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:06,400
putting on the sample but if you try to

970
00:38:03,530 --> 00:38:09,320
go slow you're depositing overall more

971
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:12,230
more charge onto the sample so when you

972
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:13,520
go faster you can go deeper but the

973
00:38:12,230 --> 00:38:16,880
resolution is not going to be as good

974
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:18,680
so just for warned there is so now weird

975
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:19,910
about NTSC resolution this isn't 13

976
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:22,069
megapixel thing where this is all today

977
00:38:19,910 --> 00:38:24,770
that's all the dots but you can see this

978
00:38:22,070 --> 00:38:27,650
is a 100 nanometer line we're at 65,000

979
00:38:24,770 --> 00:38:30,770
X down here and these are tiny little

980
00:38:27,650 --> 00:38:33,560
hairs on the tiny little cells on the

981
00:38:30,770 --> 00:38:35,030
tiny little head so we could just go one

982
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:37,100
more just for the fun of it so if we

983
00:38:35,030 --> 00:38:40,880
take that and we go down now we're at

984
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:42,920
200,000 X so we're looking at hairs that

985
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:45,140
are probably maybe a hundred nanometers

986
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:47,000
long maybe 20 nanometers across and each

987
00:38:45,140 --> 00:38:48,259
of those hairs is still smaller than the

988
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:50,960
smallest dye that we know how to

989
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:55,070
manufacture for a single hair on a

990
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:56,210
single cell on a single eye of it it's a

991
00:38:55,070 --> 00:38:59,300
universe is what I'm trying to get

992
00:38:56,210 --> 00:39:03,680
through to you people like I I don't

993
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:05,210
know how to express how bizarre the

994
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:06,950
sense of scale through the universe is

995
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:09,230
because like it it blew my mind the

996
00:39:06,950 --> 00:39:10,819
first time that I had this scope and I

997
00:39:09,230 --> 00:39:12,170
figured out how to use it and I start

998
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:14,720
like zooming down and zooming down the

999
00:39:12,170 --> 00:39:17,510
zooming down and focusing and keeping

1000
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:19,129
the whole thing quiet and level and

1001
00:39:17,510 --> 00:39:21,230
turning off the fans and turning off the

1002
00:39:19,130 --> 00:39:23,930
music and waiting for the trains out

1003
00:39:21,230 --> 00:39:25,400
back to go away because the slightest

1004
00:39:23,930 --> 00:39:28,339
breath is going to make the screen do

1005
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:30,050
this you know and you do that for hours

1006
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:31,640
in the dark staring at the screen and

1007
00:39:30,050 --> 00:39:32,810
then like you okay I'm done and you step

1008
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:35,960
outside you look up and then there are

1009
00:39:32,810 --> 00:39:40,640
the stars and I just broke my brain a

1010
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:43,850
little bit I think I like that so yes so

1011
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:45,259
this was the the moth eye and if you

1012
00:39:43,850 --> 00:39:47,900
want to see DNA you still got to go

1013
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:50,660
quite a bit deeper DNA we're talking

1014
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:52,970
about two nanometers in diameter about a

1015
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:55,040
third of a nanometer between the bases

1016
00:39:52,970 --> 00:39:56,359
or you know roughly on the order of the

1017
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:59,590
size of the probe that had to be

1018
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:59,590
manufactured to show you this picture

1019
00:40:03,620 --> 00:40:09,299
can moths see ultraviolet now here's the

1020
00:40:06,810 --> 00:40:10,500
thing I'm not I'm just complaining about

1021
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:12,390
insects so I don't know how to answer

1022
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:14,460
your question but I strongly suspect

1023
00:40:12,390 --> 00:40:18,839
that there's not an optical thing going

1024
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:21,030
on here we are sub sub like even even UV

1025
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:28,200
so like they're gonna be seeing some

1026
00:40:21,030 --> 00:40:32,550
crazy interference patterns 210 to 400

1027
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:35,609
nanometers so each hair is okay okay

1028
00:40:32,550 --> 00:40:38,160
yeah yeah yeah maybe they're into UV

1029
00:40:35,610 --> 00:40:40,140
yeah I don't know but there's gonna be

1030
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:42,750
something strange going on in their

1031
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:44,460
brain with individual hairs lighting up

1032
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:50,220
as quantum effects are happening on the

1033
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:50,820
surface of their eyeball oh sorry that's

1034
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:53,279
the wrong one

1035
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:53,880
there we go so let's well I have a few

1036
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:56,010
minutes left

1037
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:57,300
yeah I got a few minutes left any

1038
00:40:56,010 --> 00:41:00,000
guesses at what kind of creature this

1039
00:40:57,300 --> 00:41:02,010
would this would be this is we're back

1040
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,420
to is it a blood cell that's a good

1041
00:41:02,010 --> 00:41:05,790
question that's it looks kind of similar

1042
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:08,910
I'll give you another okay I'll give you

1043
00:41:05,790 --> 00:41:10,410
another example there's a looks like it

1044
00:41:08,910 --> 00:41:14,609
came out of Star Wars kind of down in

1045
00:41:10,410 --> 00:41:16,980
the crack in pit thing sorry fungus good

1046
00:41:14,610 --> 00:41:18,750
good question is it a spore now or yeah

1047
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:20,670
we're getting closer so like I say

1048
00:41:18,750 --> 00:41:22,500
without the scale you have no idea what

1049
00:41:20,670 --> 00:41:25,620
we're looking at right this actually

1050
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:28,710
turns out to be pollen and what happens

1051
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:31,830
with pollen it's like a little you know

1052
00:41:28,710 --> 00:41:33,660
hard case that holds genetic material

1053
00:41:31,830 --> 00:41:35,220
and then you go and be really cruel to

1054
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:38,100
it you stick it in a vacuum and when

1055
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:40,470
that happens it explodes sometimes so

1056
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:43,290
these are this is ordinarily pretty

1057
00:41:40,470 --> 00:41:45,359
smooth and then this is a the chunk of

1058
00:41:43,290 --> 00:41:46,890
it that blew off and flipped over and

1059
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:49,470
you know it's the inside of the pollen

1060
00:41:46,890 --> 00:41:51,230
but it probably took an hour to figure

1061
00:41:49,470 --> 00:41:53,850
out what the hell I was looking at

1062
00:41:51,230 --> 00:41:55,140
because you need to know the scale and

1063
00:41:53,850 --> 00:41:56,549
you need to know what you think you put

1064
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:57,629
in there and then there's a very good

1065
00:41:56,550 --> 00:41:59,250
chance that you're just looking at

1066
00:41:57,630 --> 00:42:00,810
random contamination on the stub which

1067
00:41:59,250 --> 00:42:03,630
is only you know five millimeters across

1068
00:42:00,810 --> 00:42:04,590
to begin with anyway but it does look

1069
00:42:03,630 --> 00:42:06,000
really neat look there's some kind of

1070
00:42:04,590 --> 00:42:07,050
crystalline thing going on down here I

1071
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,580
don't even know what it is this is

1072
00:42:07,050 --> 00:42:11,190
probably a Spore because there were

1073
00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:13,110
mushroom spores on the same sample and

1074
00:42:11,190 --> 00:42:14,400
that's about the right size I was amazed

1075
00:42:13,110 --> 00:42:15,970
at how much mushroom spores at least

1076
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:18,040
this specific

1077
00:42:15,970 --> 00:42:20,290
species of mushroom look like white

1078
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:21,880
blood cells their red blood cells excuse

1079
00:42:20,290 --> 00:42:25,930
me they're about the right shape and

1080
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:28,780
size here's some unbroken pieces of that

1081
00:42:25,930 --> 00:42:33,250
same pollen they just like you know that

1082
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:36,430
is no moon kind of thing so here's

1083
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:37,990
another piece so this came from a tree I

1084
00:42:36,430 --> 00:42:39,069
don't know what kind of tree I just walk

1085
00:42:37,990 --> 00:42:42,879
along and then I really been collected

1086
00:42:39,070 --> 00:42:44,680
some pollen this is a very regular kind

1087
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:46,180
of geometric shape I love the baby

1088
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:49,060
pollen it looks like a little raspberry

1089
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:50,319
or something I don't know it's 100 times

1090
00:42:49,060 --> 00:42:51,759
smaller than the piece of pollen that

1091
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:56,740
contains all the genetic material for

1092
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:58,660
the tree and then and then finally I'm

1093
00:42:56,740 --> 00:43:00,520
gonna end on on this guy which is

1094
00:42:58,660 --> 00:43:04,299
another piece of the same kind of tree

1095
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:06,070
pollen the stuff on the top and bottom

1096
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:09,040
the way that I collected this pollen

1097
00:43:06,070 --> 00:43:11,740
there were it was like a husk that had a

1098
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:13,570
whole bunch of pollen in it and so the

1099
00:43:11,740 --> 00:43:15,129
brown kind of husk material where the

1100
00:43:13,570 --> 00:43:17,530
where the pollen comes out of that's

1101
00:43:15,130 --> 00:43:19,000
what the top and bottom is and so there

1102
00:43:17,530 --> 00:43:22,300
were you know thousands of pieces of

1103
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:23,530
pollen inside of I mean scale is

1104
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:26,859
relative so what can I say it was too

1105
00:43:23,530 --> 00:43:28,720
small to see and so that's little bits

1106
00:43:26,859 --> 00:43:31,660
of husk holding it together wherever the

1107
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:33,069
pollen came from so now I sound like a

1108
00:43:31,660 --> 00:43:35,080
babbling idiot because like I say I

1109
00:43:33,070 --> 00:43:38,020
don't know what I'm looking at I I

1110
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:41,319
I made a probe that can show you this

1111
00:43:38,020 --> 00:43:45,700
stuff it's a lot of fun to take pictures

1112
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:46,960
of it and I'm based in Seattle so if any

1113
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:49,868
of you all have things you would like to

1114
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:51,580
see on a very very very deep

1115
00:43:49,869 --> 00:43:54,150
magnification scope please bring the by

1116
00:43:51,580 --> 00:43:57,670
and we would be happy to take pictures

1117
00:43:54,150 --> 00:44:01,410
that's all I got so any more questions

1118
00:43:57,670 --> 00:44:01,410
before we wrap

1119
00:44:01,819 --> 00:44:06,499
how did i diagnosed the emitter was bad

1120
00:44:03,859 --> 00:44:09,400
there is a you get a sense of beam

1121
00:44:06,499 --> 00:44:11,448
stability when you are taking images

1122
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:13,430
here's what happens there's a there's a

1123
00:44:11,449 --> 00:44:14,839
curve that happens you do this thing

1124
00:44:13,430 --> 00:44:16,969
called flashing the emitter you hit a

1125
00:44:14,839 --> 00:44:19,219
button the button passes current through

1126
00:44:16,969 --> 00:44:20,869
that loop that gets the emitter hot and

1127
00:44:19,219 --> 00:44:22,219
when you do that it ejects all of the

1128
00:44:20,869 --> 00:44:24,019
crap that's something emitted at the end

1129
00:44:22,219 --> 00:44:25,999
of the emitter off then you let it cool

1130
00:44:24,019 --> 00:44:27,890
and you can image with it for hours it's

1131
00:44:25,999 --> 00:44:29,689
rock solid and stable and then

1132
00:44:27,890 --> 00:44:30,709
eventually you get more crap on the end

1133
00:44:29,690 --> 00:44:32,180
of the emitter and then you have to

1134
00:44:30,709 --> 00:44:33,469
flash it again and usually you can go

1135
00:44:32,180 --> 00:44:36,410
like you know a day or two without

1136
00:44:33,469 --> 00:44:37,609
having to flash it as it starts to break

1137
00:44:36,410 --> 00:44:39,589
down that time gets shorter and shorter

1138
00:44:37,609 --> 00:44:40,788
and then eventually you cannot maintain

1139
00:44:39,589 --> 00:44:42,440
a stable beam and it's really

1140
00:44:40,789 --> 00:44:43,640
heartbreaking because you'll you'll be

1141
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:44,989
down there you'll be zoomed all the way

1142
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:47,779
in everything is great and you go to

1143
00:44:44,989 --> 00:44:50,269
take a slow scan photo and you'll get

1144
00:44:47,779 --> 00:44:52,849
varying levels of brightness as the

1145
00:44:50,269 --> 00:44:54,019
emitter intensity is wavering so that's

1146
00:44:52,849 --> 00:44:55,849
how you know it's it's starting to go

1147
00:44:54,019 --> 00:45:01,189
and that's where I'm at now so I'm gonna

1148
00:44:55,849 --> 00:45:02,299
make another one how do you get stuff in

1149
00:45:01,190 --> 00:45:05,749
without breaking the vacuum good

1150
00:45:02,299 --> 00:45:13,038
question we have an airlock and in fact

1151
00:45:05,749 --> 00:45:16,808
I have right here there we go there it

1152
00:45:13,039 --> 00:45:19,579
is this guy actually has two airlocks so

1153
00:45:16,809 --> 00:45:21,229
there is a gradation of vacuum you go

1154
00:45:19,579 --> 00:45:23,209
ten to the minus nine here we've got ten

1155
00:45:21,229 --> 00:45:25,249
to the minus six here separated by a

1156
00:45:23,209 --> 00:45:27,828
physical valve and then you have ten to

1157
00:45:25,249 --> 00:45:32,269
the minus five ish down here inside here

1158
00:45:27,829 --> 00:45:33,949
you've got a an airlock so you put your

1159
00:45:32,269 --> 00:45:36,379
sample on the end of this stick that has

1160
00:45:33,949 --> 00:45:38,719
a seal you shove that in here and it

1161
00:45:36,380 --> 00:45:40,579
goes through a cycle that it injects

1162
00:45:38,719 --> 00:45:42,440
some nitrogen to clear out the moisture

1163
00:45:40,579 --> 00:45:43,819
and then evacuates all that back out and

1164
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:46,130
then you're at ten to the minus four

1165
00:45:43,819 --> 00:45:48,549
behind the seal used to get in there and

1166
00:45:46,130 --> 00:45:51,229
then reverse to blow back out again and

1167
00:45:48,549 --> 00:45:53,329
this guy was actually a actually has two

1168
00:45:51,229 --> 00:45:56,989
airlocks because this was originally

1169
00:45:53,329 --> 00:46:00,440
intended to be a an inspection scope for

1170
00:45:56,989 --> 00:46:01,910
seagate so they manufactured silicon so

1171
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:03,469
like this guy will take a whole silicon

1172
00:46:01,910 --> 00:46:04,670
wafer in the side and you can go and

1173
00:46:03,469 --> 00:46:07,519
inspected but I don't know why you would

1174
00:46:04,670 --> 00:46:10,369
do that because a single like a single

1175
00:46:07,519 --> 00:46:13,339
circuit on on a silicon wafer would take

1176
00:46:10,369 --> 00:46:15,480
me months to properly analyze let alone

1177
00:46:13,339 --> 00:46:16,950
hundreds on a wafer like I don't

1178
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:18,000
even I'm not instance other kind

1179
00:46:16,950 --> 00:46:19,770
manufacturer so I don't know how they

1180
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:22,520
used it but yeah they were into looking

1181
00:46:19,770 --> 00:46:30,600
at lots of things

1182
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:32,609
any other questions up one more thoughts

1183
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:36,210
on desktop SVM's we should talk about

1184
00:46:32,609 --> 00:46:37,600
line completely different beast alright

1185
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:46,730
thanks everybody

1186
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:46,730
[Applause]
