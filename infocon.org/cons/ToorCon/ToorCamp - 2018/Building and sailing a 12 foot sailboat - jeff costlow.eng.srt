1
00:00:01,610 --> 00:00:07,170
and go alright it's not my pleasure to

2
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:09,269
introduce building and sailing a 12-foot

3
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:10,559
sailboat that Jeff Costello here is

4
00:00:09,269 --> 00:00:13,610
going to be talking to us so please

5
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:19,650
welcome him to the to our camp stage

6
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:23,810
thank you so indeed my name is Jeff

7
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:26,640
Koslow I am a software engineer by trade

8
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:28,049
about 10 to 15 years into writing code I

9
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:31,560
realized that I just really liked

10
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:33,540
building things lots of things and so I

11
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:35,280
started to do some woodworking and I

12
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:37,980
started to just do lots of projects on

13
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:40,079
the side I didn't plan on saying this

14
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:43,199
but one of the the reason that kind of

15
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:44,879
made me get the boat was I was all into

16
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,559
electric cars when the leaf first came

17
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:47,940
out right I was I was like I got I got

18
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:50,250
to build myself an electric car

19
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:51,839
so I bought a out ett with the sole

20
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:54,120
purpose of like ripping the engine out

21
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,980
of it mating on an electric engine to it

22
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:57,180
and welding up some battery boxes and

23
00:00:55,980 --> 00:01:00,629
putting everything together and building

24
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:03,180
this and then I realized that it was an

25
00:01:00,629 --> 00:01:05,610
$8,000 car and I was about to dump 25

26
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:07,229
grand into it for a battery pile about

27
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:10,500
15 grand on the battery pile and 10

28
00:01:07,229 --> 00:01:13,200
grand on the on the electronics for it

29
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:15,390
and I just couldn't do that I just could

30
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,220
not do that I just as a throwaway thing

31
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:18,689
I just couldn't do it so I end up

32
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:22,289
selling that car and then I found myself

33
00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:26,008
going I have no project this is not me I

34
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:27,659
need a project and I've spotted this

35
00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:29,400
sailboat so I fell in love with this

36
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:31,770
this little portly boat right here you

37
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:33,329
can actually see it down in Otter Cove

38
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:35,520
down here it's it's parked out there

39
00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:36,899
I've been staying on it each night since

40
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,630
let's see Wednesday night I've been

41
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:41,460
staying on it each night the moorage

42
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:45,658
here is not so great so I'm like getting

43
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:48,298
wet every time I walk out to my boat so

44
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:49,560
this talk goes through I've got like

45
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:51,869
three or four different chapters we'll

46
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:53,909
see how much time I get towards the end

47
00:01:51,869 --> 00:01:56,070
first of all we'll just talk about how I

48
00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:57,780
built the boat and then I want to talk

49
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:59,699
about epoxy construction techniques

50
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:02,219
because we're all builders and makers

51
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:03,390
here and so I want to talk about epoxy

52
00:02:02,219 --> 00:02:05,070
is something that you can learn you can

53
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:07,439
do it yourself it's really amazing to

54
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:09,449
watch a little honey syrup like sort of

55
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:11,700
thing turn into a plastic that's

56
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:13,350
waterproof plastic and it's really fun

57
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:14,700
to work with so

58
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:18,900
so we're gonna talk a little bit about

59
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:20,310
the boat first of all this the the model

60
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:22,920
name of the boat is called a scamp it's

61
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:24,990
a small craft advisory een small craft

62
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:28,829
advisory magazine is yes a magazine

63
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:30,390
still alive in twenty twenty eighteen it

64
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:33,360
they run out of Port Townsend by a guy

65
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:35,130
named Josh he's a he's a great guy he

66
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,920
went out looking and he said alright I

67
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:39,480
have some design considerations I want

68
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:42,720
to make a I want to build sell some

69
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:44,760
plans and have some CNC cut I would that

70
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,050
somebody can make into a boat but

71
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:47,340
there's some requirements for it right

72
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:49,200
let's make this thing less than twelve

73
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:51,150
feet long that requirement comes from

74
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:53,220
some lakes where like eleven eleven is

75
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:55,800
or twelve foot is like the highest boat

76
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:57,780
you can make I'm not sure that actually

77
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:59,760
makes a lot of sense because if that

78
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:01,350
Lake is that small then you really may

79
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:04,440
not need a sailboat in that lake but

80
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:06,690
whatever there's an eight foot they

81
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:09,000
wanted an eight foot sleeping sleeping

82
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:10,410
space on it and so from right here up

83
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,330
until this is a what's called a cuddy

84
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:14,310
cabin from right here is about eight

85
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:17,670
feet long so I can I can sleep I sleep

86
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:21,090
like a baby on my boat light and easy to

87
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:22,440
build this one's kind of peculiar to

88
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:24,060
this there's a mass box here it's about

89
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:25,859
three feet tall so you step the mast

90
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:28,140
down into that and that means the mast

91
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:30,090
is has about three feet of guide on

92
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:32,339
either side so it can't fall over too

93
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:33,810
far so you don't need wire stays that

94
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:37,110
complicates the rigging of the boat

95
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:39,450
quite a bit I guess I did say that and

96
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:41,400
then easy to sail so these were the

97
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:43,410
requirements and Josh went out and he

98
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:45,360
found this New Zealand New Zealand er by

99
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:47,760
the name of John Wells furred

100
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:50,820
John Wilkes furred would fit in totally

101
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:52,859
here he he claimed to me that he like

102
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:56,700
he's probably like sixty five maybe even

103
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:58,650
seven years old tough old coot he

104
00:03:56,700 --> 00:04:00,149
claimed that he like failed out of high

105
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:01,650
school couldn't figure out what to do

106
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:03,660
with his life became a diesel mechanic

107
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:05,640
and then some years later on into his

108
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:07,440
life he started drawing and designing

109
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:09,929
boats and now he's kind of a semi

110
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:11,940
world-famous designer he's designed the

111
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:14,850
navigator Pathfinder and the scamp and a

112
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:16,529
few other boats interesting fella we got

113
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:19,230
a picture of him later

114
00:04:16,529 --> 00:04:23,580
so scamp number one was built in Port

115
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:25,140
Townsend from his plans in 2011 that

116
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:26,490
that is a picture you know I thought

117
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:27,210
when I downloaded this that that was a

118
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:29,130
picture of scam

119
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:30,530
number one it's not actually but that

120
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:33,360
doesn't matter

121
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:35,250
in 2014 I bought whole number two

122
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,569
hundred two hundred eighty four so

123
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:38,639
that's the number that's printed on my

124
00:04:36,569 --> 00:04:39,930
sale out there we are traditionally on

125
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:42,030
your sailboat you put your whole number

126
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:46,110
on your sailboat or on your sail rather

127
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:47,190
but that changes a little bit I figure

128
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:49,830
they're probably less than two hundred

129
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:52,050
of these on the planet right now so been

130
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:54,599
a very small kind of club with these

131
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:56,190
people and just like a community builds

132
00:04:54,599 --> 00:04:58,349
here a community builds around the scamp

133
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:59,969
we have a yearly thing near Port

134
00:04:58,349 --> 00:05:01,740
Townsend where I get to go and spend a

135
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:05,310
few more nights out of my boat in a

136
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:07,680
couple of weeks the other thing that's

137
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:09,539
interesting about this is this is built

138
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:13,530
from twelve four by eight sheets of

139
00:05:09,539 --> 00:05:15,840
plywood and it's surprisingly thin six

140
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:17,580
millimeter plywood is a quarter inch

141
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,840
just slightly larger than a quarter inch

142
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:21,240
quarter inch is five point two

143
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:22,830
millimeters and then nine millimeter

144
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:24,990
which is very close to 3/8 inch plywood

145
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:27,289
and that's really only on the sole on

146
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:29,699
the bond on the very bottom of it and

147
00:05:27,289 --> 00:05:32,310
part of that part of it part of the

148
00:05:29,699 --> 00:05:33,870
reason why that can be so thin is the

149
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:38,789
epoxy and the fiberglass thing and we'll

150
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:40,320
get to that part later oh there's also

151
00:05:38,789 --> 00:05:43,469
something interesting there which is the

152
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:45,509
the BS 1088 british standard 1088 is a

153
00:05:43,469 --> 00:05:46,889
standard for voiceless plywood you're

154
00:05:45,509 --> 00:05:48,630
all a little bit smarter now you know

155
00:05:46,889 --> 00:05:49,889
that the british have a standard by

156
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:52,110
which they can build their plywood

157
00:05:49,889 --> 00:05:55,919
voiceless I just found that really

158
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:57,570
interesting so here's the if you're a

159
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:59,460
CNC nerd and I know there's a few of

160
00:05:57,570 --> 00:06:01,669
them out there here's all the cut plans

161
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:04,229
for all the twelve sheets that I have

162
00:06:01,669 --> 00:06:05,669
you'll notice like can you see this

163
00:06:04,229 --> 00:06:07,440
right here you see some little kind of

164
00:06:05,669 --> 00:06:08,940
jiggly joints there there's a few more

165
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:11,880
here on some of these that are gonna be

166
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:12,990
the decks those are called finger joints

167
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:14,729
and I'm gonna get back to those a little

168
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:16,650
bit just kind of an interesting little

169
00:06:14,729 --> 00:06:22,289
thing to try to fit together all these

170
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:22,710
pieces so the design is a flat bottom

171
00:06:22,289 --> 00:06:24,870
boat

172
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:26,340
she's very wide at the beam the beam is

173
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:29,370
the measurement across the boat she's

174
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:30,780
very wide there she's got a pram bow

175
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:32,009
which I didn't really get a good picture

176
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:35,309
here but you saw that earlier the the

177
00:06:32,009 --> 00:06:36,659
front the pram front the reason why that

178
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:39,990
pram front is on there I get this

179
00:06:36,659 --> 00:06:40,990
question a lot if you're gonna take it's

180
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:42,340
hard for me to do this with my

181
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:44,500
the microphone but if you're gonna take

182
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:47,859
wood and you're gonna bring it all up to

183
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:49,419
a point then you're kind of torturing

184
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:52,210
that plywood which is what I'm doing

185
00:06:49,419 --> 00:06:54,669
down here right now but I'm it's kind of

186
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:56,109
at a lower level and so you're doing if

187
00:06:54,669 --> 00:06:57,758
your torture if you're turning it this

188
00:06:56,110 --> 00:07:00,370
way and turning it this way then you're

189
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:01,780
gonna have problems with it so it's

190
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:05,050
easier just to chop the front off and

191
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:07,809
throw a piece of plywood on there it's

192
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:09,490
built with an egg carton design maybe we

193
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:12,400
should call it like a like a beer beer

194
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:14,440
kind container design but it's it's it's

195
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,758
where they slot together you know like

196
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:18,009
the pieces of paper and your beer cans

197
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:20,289
slot together the good news about that

198
00:07:18,009 --> 00:07:22,180
is that's very very strong right they

199
00:07:20,289 --> 00:07:24,070
it's hard for to move laterally it's

200
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:26,440
hard to move sideways it's it's hard to

201
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:27,789
get any sort of shear on that the bad

202
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:29,139
news about that is when you're EPOC

203
00:07:27,789 --> 00:07:31,479
seeing you have to run what's called a

204
00:07:29,139 --> 00:07:33,250
fill it on each of those and so that

205
00:07:31,479 --> 00:07:35,680
means a lot of epoxy and a lot of

206
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:39,039
sanding and we'll get to what a fill it

207
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:40,720
is in a little while I already said that

208
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:42,639
I had eight foot of sleeping space so

209
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,930
there's an offset center board would you

210
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:45,430
think center board would be in the

211
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:47,169
center but it's not it's off to the side

212
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:50,289
as far as I can tell it makes no

213
00:07:47,169 --> 00:07:52,030
difference to the sailing of it very

214
00:07:50,289 --> 00:07:53,979
lightweight and trailer balai I've been

215
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:56,440
told that they weigh about a 450 pounds

216
00:07:53,979 --> 00:07:59,430
I don't have a scale that weighs 450

217
00:07:56,440 --> 00:08:01,750
pounds but like you know I believe that

218
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:03,070
there's a water ballast in the bottom

219
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:06,400
and we already kind of discovered the

220
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:07,570
mass box the other thing that's

221
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:10,570
interesting about her if you're a

222
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:12,130
sailboat nerd is on the left hand side

223
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:13,719
there is most of the sailboats that you

224
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:15,940
ever see this is commonly called the

225
00:08:13,719 --> 00:08:18,870
Bermuda rig or sometimes the Marconi rig

226
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:21,009
but it's it's this main sole right here

227
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:22,449
which is very triangular and it's

228
00:08:21,009 --> 00:08:24,849
attached to the mast and how you're

229
00:08:22,449 --> 00:08:27,009
hauls the hauls it up to the top and

230
00:08:24,849 --> 00:08:29,740
then you've got a head so often called a

231
00:08:27,009 --> 00:08:31,509
jib or sometimes a Genoa and and that

232
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:32,740
kind of helps balance out and kind of

233
00:08:31,509 --> 00:08:35,950
gives you some steerage through the

234
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:38,320
through the water the balance lug rig oh

235
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:40,240
when you have this you have you not only

236
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,620
do you have adjustments for this sail

237
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,029
right here but you've got adjustments

238
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:45,430
for this sail right here to bring it

239
00:08:43,029 --> 00:08:47,079
through the wind there's also a

240
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:49,120
disadvantage to that which is if you

241
00:08:47,079 --> 00:08:51,160
what's called jibe where normally you

242
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,959
turn and if the wind is coming this way

243
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:54,850
you try to turn your bow into the wind

244
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:57,699
but if you don't do that and you

245
00:08:54,850 --> 00:09:00,220
turn back this way then the wind comes

246
00:08:57,699 --> 00:09:02,170
whipping across and what happens is this

247
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:03,790
is called the boom right here this boom

248
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:05,680
will whip across from one side to the

249
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:07,300
other and if that smokes you in the head

250
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,800
you're either dead or in the water and

251
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:09,250
if you're in the water you're probably

252
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:13,449
dead

253
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:14,949
so that does those are you can raise

254
00:09:13,449 --> 00:09:18,519
them up high enough but it can be very

255
00:09:14,949 --> 00:09:20,258
dangerous so the balance lug rig is it's

256
00:09:18,519 --> 00:09:22,300
balanced because it's got a little bit

257
00:09:20,259 --> 00:09:25,000
of offset here on the front of the boat

258
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:26,560
and and this is not a scamp diagram this

259
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,120
is just kind of a generic diagram I

260
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:30,008
think there's a little bit more space

261
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:31,899
the scamp has a hundred square foot of

262
00:09:30,009 --> 00:09:34,149
sail space and I think about twenty or

263
00:09:31,899 --> 00:09:36,190
thirty of it or in the front there so

264
00:09:34,149 --> 00:09:38,079
you don't have nearly the the Jive

265
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:40,829
effect it can still happen but you don't

266
00:09:38,079 --> 00:09:43,120
hear up nearly it's not nearly as bad

267
00:09:40,829 --> 00:09:46,959
okay so now we're getting into the

268
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:48,490
construction of this I wanted to show

269
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:52,180
this and it might be a little bit hard

270
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:54,699
to see there's eight bulkheads starting

271
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:56,529
right here the bow is a bulkhead there's

272
00:09:54,699 --> 00:09:58,479
one right here and then there's one

273
00:09:56,529 --> 00:09:59,860
right here and you I have doors in mine

274
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,079
so you can actually get into this front

275
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:03,519
space there's one right here and they

276
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:05,589
call this the cuddy cabin because you

277
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:08,319
can sort of sit and just kind of hold

278
00:10:05,589 --> 00:10:09,910
yourself out of the weather there and

279
00:10:08,319 --> 00:10:12,639
then there's one here that you can't see

280
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:15,509
very well and one in the back and then

281
00:10:12,639 --> 00:10:17,620
the final one is the stern the transom

282
00:10:15,509 --> 00:10:20,110
so I've got some animation here check

283
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:22,209
this out so that's the centreboard slot

284
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:23,709
right on the on the starboard side here

285
00:10:22,209 --> 00:10:28,060
yeah on the starboard side there's a

286
00:10:23,709 --> 00:10:30,069
centre board slot and then I tried to

287
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:32,229
mark here's the tool in ears like we

288
00:10:30,069 --> 00:10:34,479
talked about that that high strength egg

289
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:37,750
shell egg carton design those are

290
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:39,250
running there and then I didn't draw I

291
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:41,170
didn't mark in green all of them but

292
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:44,829
those are all the the bulkheads running

293
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:46,839
the opposite direction okay now we start

294
00:10:44,829 --> 00:10:48,819
picture time and so you're all victims

295
00:10:46,839 --> 00:10:50,290
now I got your attention and now you're

296
00:10:48,819 --> 00:10:53,079
gonna have to sit through 600 pictures

297
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:55,599
of slides no that's not true I've only

298
00:10:53,079 --> 00:10:57,489
got about 10 or 15 slides here and then

299
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,389
we'll move on to the epoxy so I just I

300
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:01,120
felt like this was a really interesting

301
00:10:58,389 --> 00:11:03,790
build to watch it turn from a pile of

302
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:05,079
CNC cut plywood in here this by the way

303
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:06,670
this is called the building jig it's

304
00:11:05,079 --> 00:11:08,469
it's to give you a nice give you the

305
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:11,110
correct rocker on

306
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:13,240
the bottom hole so we had all these

307
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:15,370
setup and you can see this is my dad

308
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:17,710
here did I say that I went and I lived

309
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:20,260
in Port Townsend for two weeks in 2014

310
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:22,150
with my 18 year old son and my 68 year

311
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:23,110
old dad at the time it just so happens

312
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:26,170
that I was right in the middle of age

313
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:28,240
from him and we lived in Port Townsend

314
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:29,560
for two weeks and just built the hole up

315
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,000
when I drove away well you'll see a

316
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:33,670
picture of what the boat looked like

317
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,770
when I drove out of Port Townsend so you

318
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:37,630
can see the linear here coming in and

319
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:41,260
you can see these bulkheads we break

320
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:43,180
these down in a minute I think yeah so

321
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:45,310
here we are gluing gluing everything

322
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:46,630
down the seat tops are on but that we're

323
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:49,150
gluing it down with weights those are

324
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:51,370
buckets of bricks or boxes of bricks and

325
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:53,230
now we've got the stern on and we're

326
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:54,730
starting to get some of the front and we

327
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:58,660
keep going with more of the bulkheads in

328
00:11:54,730 --> 00:12:00,280
the front there and it starts to but

329
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:02,469
this one is interesting because we're

330
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:04,060
starting to put the planks on so this

331
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:05,830
bottom plank is called the gar bird

332
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:08,380
plank and then you just plank your way

333
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:10,240
up up the sides here we're putting on

334
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:13,210
the gunnels which are just reinforcers

335
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:16,210
for the for the along the sides of the

336
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:17,500
boat and this is just a shot it was

337
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:19,300
really clear that you can see the

338
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:21,340
eggshell design in there and you can see

339
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:24,849
that there's a lot of strength in

340
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:27,130
putting this together okay so there's

341
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:28,300
what she looked like when I when I towed

342
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:29,890
her out of port towns I'm kind of proud

343
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:31,359
of that picture because I not everybody

344
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:33,910
gets to tow their boat to the backside

345
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:35,770
of the Center for marine wooden boats

346
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:37,959
there and so I was able to take this

347
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:39,490
picture and then a year later I was able

348
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:43,450
to take a very similar picture so you'll

349
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:45,010
see that one in a little while okay so

350
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:46,930
again I said picture time I actually

351
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:49,050
went through a ton of pictures that I

352
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:51,880
had and I had to make some choices here

353
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:53,920
this picture is the center board and

354
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:55,330
there's two interesting things about

355
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:57,040
this only one of which you can see the

356
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:59,050
first one you can see is I've stacked

357
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:00,730
some tile in two buckets full of water a

358
00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:02,920
bucket full of water a 5-gallon bucket

359
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:05,470
full of water weighs what about 40

360
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:07,719
pounds yeah so I'm holding this down I

361
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:09,310
put epoxy in there I glued it you can

362
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:11,710
see the clamps around the edge this

363
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:13,599
thing's not coming apart right the

364
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:15,610
second interesting thing about this is

365
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,890
that there's 22 pounds of lead in there

366
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:19,330
and I didn't even know this until I went

367
00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:21,910
to go build a boat but you can just walk

368
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:22,160
into a Ledge store and buy lead they

369
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:23,899
don't

370
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:25,550
I don't remember how much it cost but it

371
00:13:23,899 --> 00:13:27,649
wasn't very much and they're like and I

372
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:30,410
you know I like walk in with gloves and

373
00:13:27,649 --> 00:13:31,730
the guys are like looking at me and I'm

374
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:34,490
like I want to buy some lid they're like

375
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:36,589
yeah okay come with us and we went in

376
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:38,089
the back room and the guy lifted up a

377
00:13:36,589 --> 00:13:41,029
heavy sheet of lead and dropped it on a

378
00:13:38,089 --> 00:13:43,069
band saw me out shot it off and I got a

379
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:45,829
half inch sheet of lead weighing 24

380
00:13:43,069 --> 00:13:48,229
pounds I drove it home and and some

381
00:13:45,829 --> 00:13:52,339
essentially cemented or epoxied it into

382
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:57,350
into the center board just funny thing

383
00:13:52,339 --> 00:14:00,110
LED LEDs are us I guess maybe the second

384
00:13:57,350 --> 00:14:03,500
interesting thing about the this boat is

385
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:04,939
that this is since this is custom I put

386
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:07,910
in an electrical system so this was a

387
00:14:04,939 --> 00:14:09,949
wiring diagram that I built up if you're

388
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:12,350
a real electrical engineer then you

389
00:14:09,949 --> 00:14:14,209
could pick this apart but it doesn't

390
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:15,439
matter I I built this because I wanted

391
00:14:14,209 --> 00:14:17,209
to understand what it was that I was

392
00:14:15,439 --> 00:14:20,269
doing and I'm not an electrical engineer

393
00:14:17,209 --> 00:14:23,479
by trade so I put this together the end

394
00:14:20,269 --> 00:14:25,730
result is that messy wiring up there

395
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:27,139
that messy wiring right there and this

396
00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:30,019
is the really interesting part this is

397
00:14:27,139 --> 00:14:31,850
essentially a cavitation mount trolling

398
00:14:30,019 --> 00:14:34,430
motor mount it upside down

399
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:36,050
it's got 55 pounds of thrust and I can't

400
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:37,099
equate that to a horsepower rating I

401
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:38,719
don't know what that would be probably

402
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:42,110
like a quarter to two-thirds of a horse

403
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:43,910
or something I don't know exactly but it

404
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:45,889
propels the boat pretty much at hull

405
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:47,630
speed when I turn it on at about a third

406
00:14:45,889 --> 00:14:50,389
of the third of the power of the motor

407
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:52,519
so I know a couple years later I

408
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:53,810
actually installed a battery state of

409
00:14:52,519 --> 00:14:55,250
charge meter remember I was talking

410
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:58,339
about electric cars know a little bit

411
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:59,420
about this I installed the state of

412
00:14:58,339 --> 00:15:01,069
charge meter because I was I was

413
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:02,180
paranoid that I would turn on my motor

414
00:15:01,069 --> 00:15:04,099
and I would drive somewhere and then I

415
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:05,779
would kill the motor out or I've killed

416
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:08,600
the battery out and then I would be

417
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:09,709
stranded or stranded somewhere so a

418
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:11,899
state of charge meter was a nice

419
00:15:09,709 --> 00:15:13,250
insurance thing okay there's there's

420
00:15:11,899 --> 00:15:15,380
actually something interesting about the

421
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:18,410
pictures on the left there anybody care

422
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:20,269
to kind of look at those anybody hear an

423
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:21,649
electrical engineer or maybe an

424
00:15:20,269 --> 00:15:22,459
automotive engineer would probably

425
00:15:21,649 --> 00:15:26,600
notice this right away

426
00:15:22,459 --> 00:15:30,079
alright there's two buses here there's a

427
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:31,309
negative bus and a positive bus it's a

428
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:33,500
little bit easier to see here this is a

429
00:15:31,309 --> 00:15:35,149
negative bus and there's no ground

430
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:36,019
I can't ground to the boat right it's

431
00:15:35,149 --> 00:15:37,970
all wood

432
00:15:36,019 --> 00:15:39,949
I can't ground to the boat so I have to

433
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:41,779
actually have a bus that leads all the

434
00:15:39,949 --> 00:15:42,979
way back to the to the and that's kind

435
00:15:41,779 --> 00:15:44,839
of why I made that wiring diagram

436
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:49,399
because I couldn't just do it the one

437
00:15:44,839 --> 00:15:52,489
way I had to do okay the other

438
00:15:49,399 --> 00:15:54,799
interesting thing is that I had to flip

439
00:15:52,489 --> 00:15:57,350
it over so I had this thing in my garage

440
00:15:54,799 --> 00:15:58,970
I had to flip it over so that I could do

441
00:15:57,350 --> 00:16:00,199
the fiberglass thing and this is we'll

442
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:01,549
talk a little bit about fiberglassing

443
00:16:00,199 --> 00:16:03,679
later this is a shot of the fiberglass

444
00:16:01,549 --> 00:16:05,600
that's a shot of me half half flipped

445
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:08,299
over and then this is a shot when I was

446
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:10,009
all done I had to build these Scaggs I

447
00:16:08,299 --> 00:16:12,230
actually burned out a jigsaw trying to

448
00:16:10,009 --> 00:16:16,579
build these Scaggs out of red oak which

449
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:19,369
is quite hard the other interesting

450
00:16:16,579 --> 00:16:21,109
thing about it is that it's black and

451
00:16:19,369 --> 00:16:23,629
the reason why I did that we'll talk

452
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:25,489
about epoxy additives it's black because

453
00:16:23,629 --> 00:16:27,290
I added graphite powder the same stuff

454
00:16:25,489 --> 00:16:29,709
you use to lubricate a lock when you

455
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:32,329
when you when you're about to go pick it

456
00:16:29,709 --> 00:16:34,518
well we all know what sort of conference

457
00:16:32,329 --> 00:16:36,199
this is maybe if you're just like your

458
00:16:34,519 --> 00:16:39,559
key is broken in the lock or something

459
00:16:36,199 --> 00:16:40,998
you need to get it out that's that's

460
00:16:39,559 --> 00:16:43,819
graphite powder and the graphite powder

461
00:16:40,999 --> 00:16:45,679
adds a lot of a lot of abrasion

462
00:16:43,819 --> 00:16:47,329
resistance right it's kind of like

463
00:16:45,679 --> 00:16:48,769
carbon fiber in a way but it's not it's

464
00:16:47,329 --> 00:16:51,019
it's a poor man's version of carbon

465
00:16:48,769 --> 00:16:52,309
fiber but it does add some abrasion

466
00:16:51,019 --> 00:16:55,490
resistance and that's a good thing for

467
00:16:52,309 --> 00:16:57,920
the bottom of a boat to have here she is

468
00:16:55,490 --> 00:17:00,049
on the trailer you can see the black

469
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:02,299
quite well this is before I started

470
00:17:00,049 --> 00:17:02,779
doing all the finishing work I like this

471
00:17:02,299 --> 00:17:04,189
one

472
00:17:02,779 --> 00:17:06,079
and the reason again I'm not trying to

473
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:07,850
talk you through 600 pictures here but I

474
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:10,039
like this one because you can see where

475
00:17:07,849 --> 00:17:11,928
I was sanding it down right it's no

476
00:17:10,039 --> 00:17:13,699
longer that shiny black so I had to sand

477
00:17:11,929 --> 00:17:15,980
it down before I painted it and that's

478
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:18,770
kind of what that results in that's me

479
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:21,409
painting on the boot stripe there now

480
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:23,148
she's red and here I rigged her in my

481
00:17:21,409 --> 00:17:26,270
car I rigged her in my front yard one

482
00:17:23,148 --> 00:17:29,090
sunny day in late May of let's see that

483
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:30,350
would have been 2015 I had no idea what

484
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:31,879
I was doing I had never rigged a

485
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:33,799
sailboat like this before it took me

486
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:35,750
forever but when I finally got it I was

487
00:17:33,799 --> 00:17:37,250
like I'm an engineer right so I'm like

488
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:39,440
okay I did that once let me do it again

489
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:41,779
the second time exactly the same way all

490
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:42,980
right that works right and then I went

491
00:17:41,779 --> 00:17:44,899
out and doing it on the water and I've

492
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:47,929
learned some since then but that's the

493
00:17:44,899 --> 00:17:49,309
point is yeah okay the other other

494
00:17:47,929 --> 00:17:50,000
interesting thing and this is the last

495
00:17:49,309 --> 00:17:52,340
one

496
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,930
is that summer I knew I was gonna spend

497
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:56,300
at least a few nights on her and so I

498
00:17:53,930 --> 00:17:57,860
built myself a tent and I was terrible I

499
00:17:56,300 --> 00:18:00,470
didn't know anything about sewing I

500
00:17:57,860 --> 00:18:03,560
hadn't sewed in years so I left a lot of

501
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:06,200
these ragged edges and and it looked bad

502
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:08,570
and I've got I redid that then yeah so I

503
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:10,910
redid it just this spring I dragged out

504
00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:12,980
a sewing machine and I made some nice

505
00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:14,870
cut nice tight cuts around here and I

506
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:16,370
installed little button snaps all over

507
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:19,820
the boat so that I can sleep under that

508
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:21,469
and and again sleeping on it is really

509
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:24,230
nice I actually made two of these tents

510
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:26,240
one of them I made out of just cotton or

511
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:28,670
duck canvas like this the second one I

512
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:30,380
made out of an old tarp because I was

513
00:18:28,670 --> 00:18:32,030
like paranoid that this would leak you

514
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:34,490
have to be very taut the idea behind a

515
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:36,410
duck canvas is that the cotton will

516
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:38,900
swell and then once the water hits it

517
00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:40,910
will just run right off but that means

518
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:43,480
you have it really taut and tight and I

519
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:45,890
don't really have this all that tight so

520
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:48,830
so that's the last of my pictures I

521
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:51,320
think oh there you go the bonus of of me

522
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:56,449
taking it and on the center for wooden

523
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:58,040
boats in Port Townsend a year later okay

524
00:18:56,450 --> 00:18:59,480
so this might be more interesting to a

525
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:01,430
few more people is how to work with

526
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:03,500
epoxy I find the epoxy fascinating to

527
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:05,180
work with like I said earlier you mix

528
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:06,710
together a couple of liquid Oh most

529
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:08,000
people think of epoxy they think of the

530
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:09,560
five minute kind that comes in the

531
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,060
syringes you sort of stir it up and then

532
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:12,649
you jam it onto something and hopefully

533
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:15,070
it'll stick forever and it doesn't and

534
00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:17,120
it breaks it so me an opportune time

535
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:19,370
when a when a boatbuilder

536
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:20,780
thinks about epoxy this is what they

537
00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:22,129
usually think of there's a lot of brand

538
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:25,580
names and they all compete against each

539
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:26,930
other don't I'm not endorsing these guys

540
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:30,260
they're pretty good they're they're

541
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:32,060
actually interesting but so the

542
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:35,480
important bit that you need to know here

543
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:37,970
I already talked about this it hardens

544
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:41,450
to a plastic in four to six hours it's a

545
00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:43,370
resin and a hardener the ratios are

546
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:46,370
usually by volume somewhere around one

547
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:49,520
to two the stuff that I use is 1 to 4

548
00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:52,250
volume on that so usually the way you do

549
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:53,629
this is you have little hand pumps that

550
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:55,280
go in the jar and they actually showed

551
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:58,280
that they're they showed that little

552
00:19:55,280 --> 00:20:00,020
hand pumps there it's really important

553
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:03,440
because if you mix it up and you say one

554
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:03,889
two oh I forgot I need do I need

555
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:06,380
one

556
00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:08,330
or two pumps of the hardener so you

557
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:10,429
alternate just just little techniques

558
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:12,350
right that it boxy guys really do this

559
00:20:10,429 --> 00:20:14,270
really work with us a lot the other

560
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:17,689
really really interesting thing about

561
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:19,639
about epoxy is that it's exothermic so

562
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:22,880
as its curing it's putting out heat

563
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:24,530
however it also cures with heat right

564
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:27,350
this is not an oxygen thing it's not a

565
00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:28,340
glue it's not a water in the atmosphere

566
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:30,919
or anything there's a lot of ways that

567
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:32,780
glues work but this is purely a chemical

568
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:35,150
reaction it gives off heat and it cures

569
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:36,649
faster with heat so there's one really

570
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:39,140
interesting thing my son did this he did

571
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:42,410
like four pumps fry one two three four

572
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:45,230
pumps actually one one two two three and

573
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:47,210
as we were and he had to wait for a

574
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:48,110
little while and he started all of a

575
00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:50,330
sudden he kind of started going like

576
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:52,428
this and I was like what's going on and

577
00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:54,799
I I grabbed the bag from him a lot of

578
00:20:52,429 --> 00:20:56,780
times what you do is you put you mix it

579
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:59,320
up because you mix it up with additives

580
00:20:56,780 --> 00:21:01,910
to make it thicker or harder or whatever

581
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:03,559
and I sort of squished it a little bit I

582
00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:06,020
could feel a hard ball in the center

583
00:21:03,559 --> 00:21:08,149
this is the concept of what do they say

584
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:10,370
nuclear bombs like a critical mass right

585
00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:13,010
it hit a critical mass and the heat

586
00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:14,840
because heat radiates in 360 degrees so

587
00:21:13,010 --> 00:21:17,210
where's the hottest point exactly at the

588
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:19,760
center that part cured into a hard

589
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:22,640
little ball and it started spreading out

590
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:25,040
even further and so he eventually had to

591
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:27,770
take that that mix and set it outside

592
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:29,210
and just let it cool outside and and it

593
00:21:27,770 --> 00:21:32,540
boiled over a little bit and it made a

594
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:34,220
huge mess but but I've been that really

595
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:36,500
fascinating right it's like it cures by

596
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:38,000
its own heat so you have to be work with

597
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:41,990
it really carefully and if it's a hot

598
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:43,970
day then you only have you know maybe 20

599
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:46,130
minutes a shelf time if even that

600
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:47,750
as a matter of fact you'll notice that

601
00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:50,870
on this page right here oh you can't

602
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:52,640
read that it's as fast hardener a lot of

603
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:55,729
times they have fast and slow or maybe

604
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:59,480
fast medium and slow hardeners to mix

605
00:21:55,730 --> 00:22:02,179
with these quite often oops

606
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:04,760
quite often it is used with fiberglass

607
00:22:02,179 --> 00:22:07,370
which I was astounded to read really

608
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:08,900
truly is glass fiber that they spin

609
00:22:07,370 --> 00:22:10,729
because it's very flexible I have some

610
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:12,530
down by the little boat project if you

611
00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:14,179
want to come down and take a look at it

612
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:16,460
Kevlar Kevlar has an interesting

613
00:22:14,179 --> 00:22:17,159
properties of being able to spread out

614
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:18,450
when

615
00:22:17,159 --> 00:22:20,129
force hits it it kind of spreads out

616
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:22,440
which makes it a nice bulletproof thing

617
00:22:20,129 --> 00:22:24,330
or carbon fiber which is not good for

618
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:26,700
bulletproof stuff it is however good for

619
00:22:24,330 --> 00:22:29,879
abrasion resistance it will it will just

620
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:30,869
deflect the energy to the side well

621
00:22:29,879 --> 00:22:35,149
actually that kind of sounds like the

622
00:22:30,869 --> 00:22:37,439
same thing doesn't it but that's that so

623
00:22:35,149 --> 00:22:39,840
we've been through some of these I guess

624
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:43,109
the good and bad properties of an epoxy

625
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:44,459
they're flexible it can crack under

626
00:22:43,109 --> 00:22:47,129
stress if you have a lot of it really

627
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:49,679
really thick it can it can be a little

628
00:22:47,129 --> 00:22:50,998
bit brittle it's it's very easy to work

629
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:53,549
although you do have a limited shelf

630
00:22:50,999 --> 00:22:55,979
time limited mix time limited time with

631
00:22:53,549 --> 00:22:58,830
it but when you get it it's you can work

632
00:22:55,979 --> 00:23:00,629
with it there's a little bit of vo C

633
00:22:58,830 --> 00:23:02,908
volatile organic compounds that come out

634
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:04,109
of it but it's not toxic the first time

635
00:23:02,909 --> 00:23:06,539
I tried to work with it I was like

636
00:23:04,109 --> 00:23:08,820
prepared to put on a respirator you do

637
00:23:06,539 --> 00:23:10,619
need a respirator but not for that part

638
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:12,330
you but you need the respirator for is

639
00:23:10,619 --> 00:23:13,949
sanding because if you're sanding

640
00:23:12,330 --> 00:23:16,499
anything down if you make runs or drips

641
00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:17,999
or anything like that you really really

642
00:23:16,499 --> 00:23:19,799
don't want that plastic in your lungs

643
00:23:17,999 --> 00:23:22,669
especially if you've added additives to

644
00:23:19,799 --> 00:23:24,869
it I guess we say that over here

645
00:23:22,669 --> 00:23:26,840
additives make it really versatile we'll

646
00:23:24,869 --> 00:23:29,070
go through some of those additives

647
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:30,449
oftentimes it's stronger than wood so a

648
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:32,039
lot of people say that when you make the

649
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:33,779
bond you know the wood on the either

650
00:23:32,039 --> 00:23:36,570
side is going to crack before the epoxy

651
00:23:33,779 --> 00:23:38,999
does one thing that's never happened to

652
00:23:36,570 --> 00:23:40,499
me is skin allergies once you developed

653
00:23:38,999 --> 00:23:43,109
a skin allergy to some of this epoxy

654
00:23:40,499 --> 00:23:46,559
resin you just can't work with it

655
00:23:43,109 --> 00:23:49,590
anymore you don't want the sanding dusk

656
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:50,908
in your lungs sanding is really common

657
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:53,428
and really boring I mentioned those

658
00:23:50,909 --> 00:23:54,960
Phillips earlier you could spend a lot

659
00:23:53,429 --> 00:23:57,149
of time doing that my wife was very

660
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:59,249
angry with me for having a even having a

661
00:23:57,149 --> 00:24:01,168
tent in my garage where I kept the boat

662
00:23:59,249 --> 00:24:04,559
with all the sanding dust that came out

663
00:24:01,169 --> 00:24:07,859
of it and then finally it's it's rather

664
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:09,090
expensive ish certainly expensive enough

665
00:24:07,859 --> 00:24:10,978
that if you're building a boat with it

666
00:24:09,090 --> 00:24:12,509
that you don't want to sink you want to

667
00:24:10,979 --> 00:24:14,419
invest some money in it but it's it's a

668
00:24:12,509 --> 00:24:16,349
it's a tad on the expensive side

669
00:24:14,419 --> 00:24:18,029
versatile so that we were talking about

670
00:24:16,349 --> 00:24:19,918
this first of all just if you coat wood

671
00:24:18,029 --> 00:24:21,269
with it so plastic so it's a waterproof

672
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:22,409
coating make sure you do it a couple

673
00:24:21,269 --> 00:24:24,179
three times to make sure you get all

674
00:24:22,409 --> 00:24:27,239
through there it can be used like a very

675
00:24:24,179 --> 00:24:30,149
very strong glue the usual additive for

676
00:24:27,239 --> 00:24:30,990
this is a silica dust and that makes it

677
00:24:30,149 --> 00:24:32,370
very strong

678
00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:34,950
it's however does add some brittleness

679
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:35,909
to it butts of a good strong glue we

680
00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:40,320
already talked a little bit about the

681
00:24:35,910 --> 00:24:42,630
fill it's I've got a diagram for that so

682
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:44,520
let's think about this fill it filler to

683
00:24:42,630 --> 00:24:46,170
hold fasteners but not too brittle so if

684
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:47,670
you have a really brittle like think

685
00:24:46,170 --> 00:24:49,920
about would you put a screw into wood

686
00:24:47,670 --> 00:24:52,380
and it sort of holds that screw in there

687
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:53,730
and you can't pull it back out but if

688
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:54,960
wood were more brittle you could just

689
00:24:53,730 --> 00:24:56,250
pull it out and then you've got a screw

690
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,930
hole you can't do anything else with

691
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:59,820
right so so there's some additives

692
00:24:57,930 --> 00:25:02,370
actually wood flour is a great additive

693
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:03,960
just sawdust really really fine sawdust

694
00:25:02,370 --> 00:25:06,419
you add that and now you've got a very

695
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:10,320
powerful or a very good substance that

696
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:13,470
you can drive a screw into cattle

697
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:15,659
archive burn fiber the brothers who

698
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:17,520
invented that Wes system got into

699
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:19,920
whether wind vanes the big ones that you

700
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:22,889
see out in the prairies they got into

701
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:24,450
building those for a while and so most

702
00:25:22,890 --> 00:25:27,930
of those are now built with the epoxy

703
00:25:24,450 --> 00:25:29,970
over carbon fiber and then chemically

704
00:25:27,930 --> 00:25:31,830
wise I find this one fascinating the

705
00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:34,230
epoxy is hard within about four to six

706
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:35,610
hours but it's still chemically active

707
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:37,830
for something on the order of 72 hours

708
00:25:35,610 --> 00:25:39,959
so if you need to add a second coat on

709
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:41,490
top of it add it within 72 hours and

710
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:44,130
it'll just chemically bond to the other

711
00:25:41,490 --> 00:25:45,870
one because it's terrible if epoxy

712
00:25:44,130 --> 00:25:48,330
delaminates right you've got two layers

713
00:25:45,870 --> 00:25:49,739
and probably just pops off because it

714
00:25:48,330 --> 00:25:51,389
didn't have enough chemical bite to the

715
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:52,920
other one

716
00:25:51,390 --> 00:25:54,900
you can't sand that and you can get it

717
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:57,240
to stick but it's better just to do it

718
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:59,370
within 72 hours we talked about the

719
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:02,130
mixing of the resin and I guess I kind

720
00:25:59,370 --> 00:26:04,939
of went through these let's see chopped

721
00:26:02,130 --> 00:26:08,010
glass fiber strong terrible to sand

722
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:10,710
glass dust like literally glass dust you

723
00:26:08,010 --> 00:26:13,710
can add in there never bothered to do

724
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:15,120
that micro balloons these little little

725
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:17,040
teeny balloons that have just a little

726
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:19,399
teeny air pocket in them so it expands

727
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:21,720
the volume without adding a whole lot of

728
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:25,200
just expands the volume and that makes

729
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:26,940
it really easy to sand also some Ferenc

730
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,800
mixture fairing is the process of taking

731
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:32,750
a surface and making it nice and smooth

732
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:32,750
and so that's a sanding thing as well

733
00:26:32,870 --> 00:26:37,199
graphite we already talked a little bit

734
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:40,050
about the graphite silica powder I've

735
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:42,720
got that some down below strong brittle

736
00:26:40,050 --> 00:26:44,490
glue we talked a little bit about this

737
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:45,840
the open time is how much time you

738
00:26:44,490 --> 00:26:47,700
and again I find this really fascinating

739
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:49,260
when we started working with the epoxy

740
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:52,260
the guys were like oh you got open time

741
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:54,150
you got set they goes off is that

742
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:55,740
phenomena where the you know the center

743
00:26:54,150 --> 00:26:58,620
just gets too hot and all of a sudden it

744
00:26:55,740 --> 00:27:01,200
starts getting firming up a green epoxy

745
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:02,760
is is not quite cured and very flexible

746
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:05,370
you can cut it with a knife if you want

747
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:07,320
to and then they have the whole

748
00:27:05,370 --> 00:27:08,850
vocabulary about consistency mix me up

749
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:10,860
some peanut butter or mix me up some

750
00:27:08,850 --> 00:27:12,270
some honey or mix me up something and

751
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:14,659
everybody will know what you're talking

752
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:17,550
about okay

753
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:19,980
so I find this also really interesting

754
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:21,810
so this is just think of this like in a

755
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:24,090
plank right so a plank you're gonna put

756
00:27:21,810 --> 00:27:27,419
on the side of the boat your CNC your

757
00:27:24,090 --> 00:27:30,240
4x8 CNC machine can't cut you a 12-foot

758
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:32,010
piece of piece of wood you just can't do

759
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:34,410
that so how are you gonna join together

760
00:27:32,010 --> 00:27:37,020
two pieces of wood to make of 12 foot

761
00:27:34,410 --> 00:27:39,360
plank from a 4 foot 8 plywood sheet well

762
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:41,850
you could blend it together right you

763
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:43,740
could take your epoxy right here mix up

764
00:27:41,850 --> 00:27:45,389
some with some glue additive shove it

765
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:47,160
together and then put fiberglass on the

766
00:27:45,390 --> 00:27:50,340
top and the bottom seems like a decently

767
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:52,920
strong decently strong thing and it is

768
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:56,220
but there's not a lot of glue in there

769
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:57,690
and so some people started to use scarf

770
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:59,070
joints and scarf joints are easy you

771
00:27:57,690 --> 00:28:00,090
stack these on top of each other you can

772
00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:02,220
take a plane and you're playing them

773
00:28:00,090 --> 00:28:04,050
down on the side and then you've got the

774
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:05,670
same angle and you can turn one over and

775
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:09,149
put them together you've got a lot of

776
00:28:05,670 --> 00:28:11,220
glue in there so this nice strong bond

777
00:28:09,150 --> 00:28:13,170
you put the fiberglass on top of it it's

778
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:16,650
probably not gonna break but it's a lot

779
00:28:13,170 --> 00:28:18,210
it's a lot of work and so I wanted to

780
00:28:16,650 --> 00:28:20,310
call out I mentioned those puzzle joints

781
00:28:18,210 --> 00:28:21,510
earlier and I should have sumed in on

782
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:23,639
this just a little bit but you can see a

783
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:25,470
puzzle joint right here and it's these

784
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:27,510
fingers I can't do it with my fingers

785
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:31,800
but they sort of interlock like that and

786
00:28:27,510 --> 00:28:33,210
now you've you've you've eliminated if

787
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:34,830
you talk if you think about the surface

788
00:28:33,210 --> 00:28:37,500
area that's in that you've eliminated

789
00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:39,750
the the lack of surface area right

790
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:41,730
you've got this curve that's all there

791
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:42,930
and it's fit together I think this I

792
00:28:41,730 --> 00:28:44,430
think this is an area where see and see

793
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:46,800
guys like totally made this because

794
00:28:44,430 --> 00:28:48,930
nobody before CNC machines would have

795
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:51,270
cut these finger joints nobody would

796
00:28:48,930 --> 00:28:54,540
have done that but it's totally

797
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:56,490
plausible with a with a CNC machine and

798
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:57,690
so nobody hardly uses skarf joints

799
00:28:56,490 --> 00:29:02,390
anymore in

800
00:28:57,690 --> 00:29:05,580
Woodworking see the puzzle joints okay

801
00:29:02,390 --> 00:29:07,200
so I have a little demo boat build that

802
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:08,790
I'm doing right down by the maker tent

803
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:11,040
down there stop by and watch me for a

804
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:14,850
little while what happens if you have to

805
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:15,960
make a butt joint at an angle so what

806
00:29:14,850 --> 00:29:18,120
I'm doing down there has been using a

807
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:20,070
technique called stitch and glue so I

808
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:21,989
drilled some holes and I put some wires

809
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:23,460
through the holes and then I twist them

810
00:29:21,990 --> 00:29:25,020
off down here and that binds it together

811
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:26,580
real well it's kind of loose in this

812
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:31,590
picture but it binds them together very

813
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:33,360
well and then what I do is I push those

814
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:36,750
wires down as far as I can to kind of

815
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:38,429
push them in there and then I build to

816
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:39,750
fill it over the top of that and this is

817
00:29:38,430 --> 00:29:41,580
what I talked about earlier the fill it

818
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:43,290
goes all the way here so you've got a

819
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:44,610
lot of bonding strengths on that wood

820
00:29:43,290 --> 00:29:46,260
right there you've got a lot of bonding

821
00:29:44,610 --> 00:29:47,639
strength over here it's very hard to

822
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:49,440
share it this way it's very hard to

823
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:50,760
share it that way it's very hard to bend

824
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:55,410
it this way because you've got all this

825
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:57,480
right there makes sense let's see and

826
00:29:55,410 --> 00:29:59,610
then you go ahead and you you fill that

827
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:00,870
in with I've just got some syringes down

828
00:29:59,610 --> 00:30:03,570
there so you just go ahead and fill in

829
00:30:00,870 --> 00:30:04,949
that little gap there by the way that

830
00:30:03,570 --> 00:30:06,600
takes a lot of sanding and smoothing

831
00:30:04,950 --> 00:30:08,130
over and things like that and then

832
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:12,030
finally you go ahead and lay your layer

833
00:30:08,130 --> 00:30:13,530
sheet of fiberglass tape over that and

834
00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:15,540
you run that all along the whole joint

835
00:30:13,530 --> 00:30:17,160
and now you've got a very very strong

836
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:18,360
joint that's probably not going to crack

837
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:19,740
on that again you're probably gonna

838
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:25,469
crack the wood or you're gonna you're

839
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:26,910
gonna break something else okay we're

840
00:30:25,470 --> 00:30:28,740
coming to the end of this so if you ever

841
00:30:26,910 --> 00:30:31,170
work with epoxy I already mentioned

842
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:33,810
count your measured pumps work quickly

843
00:30:31,170 --> 00:30:36,450
or your batch will go off on you we're

844
00:30:33,810 --> 00:30:37,440
cleanly if you get lots of drips and

845
00:30:36,450 --> 00:30:40,050
things you're gonna have to sand all

846
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:42,450
those drips and unfortunately wood is

847
00:30:40,050 --> 00:30:44,760
soft and epoxy is hard so if your

848
00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:46,890
sanding like this you're just gonna like

849
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:48,780
take off all the wood around the drip

850
00:30:46,890 --> 00:30:50,700
and maybe take a little bit more off the

851
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:53,070
little bit off the epoxy so just be

852
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:57,150
cautious with that cabinet scrapers work

853
00:30:53,070 --> 00:31:00,960
really well if your woodworker precoat

854
00:30:57,150 --> 00:31:02,940
wood with raw epoxy you never just put

855
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:04,920
additives there epoxy that has additives

856
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:07,050
on it to the wood because it doesn't

857
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:08,520
doesn't sink well into the wood so you

858
00:31:07,050 --> 00:31:11,520
want the wood to absorb as much as you

859
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:13,740
can so you pre-code it

860
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:14,940
you can use a heat gun to seed heat up

861
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:16,650
the eat box see if it's really really

862
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:20,610
messy and then you can scrape it with a

863
00:31:16,650 --> 00:31:22,170
like a like a paint scraper for the

864
00:31:20,610 --> 00:31:24,959
reason the same heat reason the heat

865
00:31:22,170 --> 00:31:26,700
heat with a heat gun later on

866
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:29,520
it makes the heat boxing much softer and

867
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:31,200
so don't pay an epoxy black because

868
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:35,280
it'll absorb all the sunlight and then

869
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:37,650
it'll soften itself up it's the last one

870
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:39,290
Oh wear a respirator when sanding don't

871
00:31:37,650 --> 00:31:41,970
forget that part

872
00:31:39,290 --> 00:31:47,850
okay chapter three sailing this is

873
00:31:41,970 --> 00:31:51,360
sailing for engineers safety first so

874
00:31:47,850 --> 00:31:54,719
this was this was a summer camp that

875
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:56,850
some of the scamp nerds put on and this

876
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:58,650
guy here is John wells for the designer

877
00:31:56,850 --> 00:32:00,780
of the boat and this guy here is my

878
00:31:58,650 --> 00:32:01,770
friend Howard and I'll if I have enough

879
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:04,649
time we'll talk a little bit about

880
00:32:01,770 --> 00:32:07,710
Howard here I'm gonna try to wrap it up

881
00:32:04,650 --> 00:32:09,660
this is capsize testing right so know

882
00:32:07,710 --> 00:32:11,520
how when your boat goes over that you

883
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:13,200
can get back into it and in this case

884
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:14,430
it's pretty easy you've got a center

885
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,690
board on the other side so you swim

886
00:32:14,430 --> 00:32:17,910
around you grab the center board you

887
00:32:15,690 --> 00:32:20,430
drag it down it'll pop the boat will pop

888
00:32:17,910 --> 00:32:21,960
right back up and then what you have to

889
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:24,090
do is get yourself get your body back

890
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:25,680
into it's got fairly tall sides so

891
00:32:24,090 --> 00:32:28,050
there's a lot a lot of ways to do that

892
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:29,460
but essentially I've got a rope along

893
00:32:28,050 --> 00:32:31,320
the side that I can just put my feet on

894
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:33,270
sort of spread my legs a little bit and

895
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:39,360
then drop my drop my body over the over

896
00:32:33,270 --> 00:32:42,750
the the gunnels so safety first and

897
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:44,340
that's it that's all right safety first

898
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:45,870
on this one there's there's a lot of

899
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:48,230
other sailing tips but that's not really

900
00:32:45,870 --> 00:32:51,510
where we're gonna go with this this one

901
00:32:48,230 --> 00:32:53,370
so this is I don't really do anything

902
00:32:51,510 --> 00:32:55,920
but if you go down to the maker stage

903
00:32:53,370 --> 00:32:59,429
I've got a boat build going in progress

904
00:32:55,920 --> 00:33:00,930
down there this was the 4-foot sheet 4x8

905
00:32:59,430 --> 00:33:03,240
sheet of plywood that I cut this from

906
00:33:00,930 --> 00:33:05,400
and you can sort a picture how there's

907
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:08,340
one piece one piece one piece one piece

908
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:09,690
one piece and then to half pieces you

909
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:11,159
put them all together I did the all that

910
00:33:09,690 --> 00:33:12,810
part at home I cut all those parts

911
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:14,460
because I knew I wasn't gonna have power

912
00:33:12,810 --> 00:33:16,980
tools here and I have power tools at

913
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:19,770
home so so I cut all those pieces out

914
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:21,720
and then and brought him here just like

915
00:33:19,770 --> 00:33:25,040
that the only thing I had done previous

916
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:26,720
to this was gluing these

917
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:28,550
together because I just didn't want to

918
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:33,830
do that in the field I just did it at

919
00:33:28,550 --> 00:33:35,240
home okay yeah it looks like we do have

920
00:33:33,830 --> 00:33:39,500
some time so that that friend of mine

921
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:41,360
Howard so Howard was there John Wells

922
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:44,240
furred the designer of the boat flew up

923
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:47,270
for this camp as well as this guy named

924
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:49,490
Howard rice that I never heard of Howard

925
00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:51,680
in 1989 there's Howard right there on

926
00:33:49,490 --> 00:33:54,890
the Left John Wells furred is a design

927
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:58,220
of the guy on the right in 1989 Howard

928
00:33:54,890 --> 00:33:59,690
rice got in a 17-foot he calls it a

929
00:33:58,220 --> 00:34:01,430
sailing canoe we would probably call it

930
00:33:59,690 --> 00:34:03,590
a kayak here in the Pacific Northwest it

931
00:34:01,430 --> 00:34:05,090
has a little bit more open cut which

932
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:08,330
makes it technically a canoe but

933
00:34:05,090 --> 00:34:10,699
whatever he got in that sailing canoe

934
00:34:08,330 --> 00:34:14,449
and he went around Tierra del Fuego

935
00:34:10,699 --> 00:34:17,359
right South America I've got a picture

936
00:34:14,449 --> 00:34:18,560
yeah so he was sailing so you're kind of

937
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:19,910
familiar with this right here's the

938
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:22,310
Strait of Magellan where all the ships

939
00:34:19,909 --> 00:34:24,080
go through and then they come back out

940
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:25,159
this way and they go up that way to get

941
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:27,290
to your unless they're going through the

942
00:34:25,159 --> 00:34:29,029
Panama Canal so Howard did something

943
00:34:27,290 --> 00:34:31,310
that very very few humans on this planet

944
00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:33,890
have done he went down into this and

945
00:34:31,310 --> 00:34:36,168
into this national park down here which

946
00:34:33,889 --> 00:34:38,150
there's a lot of shaking of heads this

947
00:34:36,168 --> 00:34:42,620
is like incredibly dangerous right this

948
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:45,490
is tierra del fuego land of fire it's

949
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:49,219
wind storms galore and all these little

950
00:34:45,489 --> 00:34:51,469
actually let me zoom in one here oops

951
00:34:49,219 --> 00:34:54,649
there so here

952
00:34:51,469 --> 00:34:56,600
to give you perspective Puntarenas was

953
00:34:54,650 --> 00:34:58,280
the town that he he came out of for this

954
00:34:56,600 --> 00:35:00,350
latest venture I don't know about his

955
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:03,860
earlier one and so I'm gonna zoom in to

956
00:35:00,350 --> 00:35:06,049
about this area right here so what

957
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:09,230
Howard did was Howard was about 40 days

958
00:35:06,050 --> 00:35:11,030
out 45 days out and he was somewhere

959
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:12,620
down I've never been quite clear but he

960
00:35:11,030 --> 00:35:15,260
was in one of these little bays down

961
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:16,520
here south of Isla Dawson he was down in

962
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:20,270
one of these little bays and he got

963
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:22,700
caught for three days in 80 to 90 mile

964
00:35:20,270 --> 00:35:24,410
per hour Willie waz and I Willie wah you

965
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:25,819
look at you can see how they have got

966
00:35:24,410 --> 00:35:27,350
the little teeny Bay's there you can

967
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:29,600
think of it like fjords right they're

968
00:35:27,350 --> 00:35:31,250
very tall but then the wind comes

969
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:33,259
whipping down and Howard got caught in

970
00:35:31,250 --> 00:35:35,900
those for three days before he could

971
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:37,160
finally get himself out and in the boat

972
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:39,740
actually caps I

973
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:42,200
and so Howard had to self rescue himself

974
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:44,149
he got himself washed up on shore his

975
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:46,009
boat was over on the side and luckily

976
00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:47,270
there was some fishermen nearby that he

977
00:35:46,010 --> 00:35:50,180
was able to get to with the radio and

978
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:52,940
they came and picked him up he easily

979
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:55,669
could have died he's amazing and

980
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:58,579
individual but I guess I started this

981
00:35:55,670 --> 00:36:00,290
story by saying 1989 he sailed amongst

982
00:35:58,579 --> 00:36:03,260
all this stuff down here and he did it

983
00:36:00,290 --> 00:36:04,820
for about three months living on his own

984
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:06,650
as a matter of fact he said one of his

985
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:08,930
goals of this latest trip was to go back

986
00:36:06,650 --> 00:36:10,820
because he had buried some some food or

987
00:36:08,930 --> 00:36:12,500
some supplies on one particular Island

988
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:14,390
that he's dead certain are still there

989
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:17,210
because because nobody ever goes out to

990
00:36:14,390 --> 00:36:20,660
this area because it kills you right so

991
00:36:17,210 --> 00:36:22,099
nobody ever goes there so the

992
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:24,259
interesting thing about this whole story

993
00:36:22,099 --> 00:36:25,339
is not not my friend Howard the injured

994
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:27,920
well actually he's kind of an

995
00:36:25,339 --> 00:36:30,020
interesting guy but the fact that he

996
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:30,500
took the exact same boat that I have out

997
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:32,420
here

998
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:35,060
and modified it slightly what you'll

999
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:36,230
notice is he put this isn't this isn't

1000
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:37,549
the Bermuda rig that I talked about

1001
00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:40,130
earlier is called a gaff ray but it

1002
00:36:37,550 --> 00:36:41,359
doesn't matter he's got a jib on here

1003
00:36:40,130 --> 00:36:44,300
and a gaff rig and then this is called

1004
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:46,040
the y'all back here and he chose that

1005
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:48,140
particular layout but other than that

1006
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:49,730
the boat is pretty much exactly the same

1007
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:51,710
as mine although he didn't have a motor

1008
00:36:49,730 --> 00:36:54,710
he had oars that's all he had was oars

1009
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:56,510
and sail and he spent well his plan was

1010
00:36:54,710 --> 00:37:00,560
to spend up to 90 days down there

1011
00:36:56,510 --> 00:37:02,569
in around the same area so I think where

1012
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:03,920
I want to leave with that and and this

1013
00:37:02,569 --> 00:37:06,349
is pretty much the end of the deck and

1014
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:08,119
I'm happy to take questions but kind of

1015
00:37:06,349 --> 00:37:11,210
where I want to leave with that is a

1016
00:37:08,119 --> 00:37:13,190
good design John wolves fur has even

1017
00:37:11,210 --> 00:37:16,160
said that of all his designs of all his

1018
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:17,750
boats the scamp design is the what he

1019
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:20,720
feels is the best for the purpose that

1020
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:22,839
it was designed for now his design was

1021
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:25,640
not to go safe around Tierra del Fuego

1022
00:37:22,839 --> 00:37:27,980
but nonetheless he feels like it's a

1023
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:31,848
very good design boat for a 12-foot boat

1024
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:34,160
which is what Howard liked about it and

1025
00:37:31,849 --> 00:37:36,140
so I think that's as a as an engineer as

1026
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:38,210
a as a software dude and things like

1027
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:40,310
that I like to think about good solid

1028
00:37:38,210 --> 00:37:41,839
time-tested designs and this is not a

1029
00:37:40,310 --> 00:37:43,490
boat that you would look at and say yeah

1030
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:44,900
that's a solid time-tested design it

1031
00:37:43,490 --> 00:37:48,259
doesn't look like a lot of other boats

1032
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:50,390
she's kind of portly you know it's kind

1033
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:50,760
of beanie it's a small thin little boat

1034
00:37:50,390 --> 00:37:53,009
it's

1035
00:37:50,760 --> 00:38:00,480
something you're gonna spend four nights

1036
00:37:53,010 --> 00:38:02,160
on oops yeah it's just the design is if

1037
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:03,810
it's effective then it's effective it

1038
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:06,060
may not be what you expect but it's an

1039
00:38:03,810 --> 00:38:08,960
effective design and it works and I

1040
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:13,140
really do enjoy sailing my little boat

1041
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:14,930
yeah oh there's a picture of Howard in

1042
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:17,940
his boat he named it the Southern Cross

1043
00:38:14,930 --> 00:38:19,620
you can tell he's he he's a big fan of

1044
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:21,300
organization he would he would make a

1045
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:22,380
good software engineer he he puts

1046
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:25,020
everything and it's been where it

1047
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:26,820
belongs he he knows that when he writes

1048
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:30,390
malik he has to check he has to write

1049
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:31,830
free somewhere else and he you know he's

1050
00:38:30,390 --> 00:38:33,870
got everything well designed out these

1051
00:38:31,830 --> 00:38:35,190
are his self rescue slings right here

1052
00:38:33,870 --> 00:38:37,170
along the side so if he goes overboard

1053
00:38:35,190 --> 00:38:41,640
he grabs one of those does the same

1054
00:38:37,170 --> 00:38:43,320
thing where he flops himself over yeah

1055
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:45,120
he had he had to build a couple extra

1056
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:47,610
things he had to build this this these

1057
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:49,740
spars out here on the bow and on the

1058
00:38:47,610 --> 00:38:55,350
stern for his for his particular sailing

1059
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:58,109
rig and so that's my friend Howard he he

1060
00:38:55,350 --> 00:39:01,710
is alive he did he did make it back I

1061
00:38:58,110 --> 00:39:04,380
saw him what did I see him I saw him in

1062
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:06,060
September last year yeah so and I

1063
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:07,980
haven't seen him since but he's an

1064
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:10,680
interesting guy okay so that's the end

1065
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:13,950
of my slide deck I when I was building

1066
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:16,049
the boat I have a blog these guys have

1067
00:39:13,950 --> 00:39:18,629
building supplies this is the small

1068
00:39:16,050 --> 00:39:20,700
craft advisor where where I have my

1069
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:23,670
where what I have the community scamp

1070
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:25,319
players gig harbor boats if you're

1071
00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:27,270
interested not in building a boat but

1072
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:30,090
having the same boat gig harbor boats

1073
00:39:27,270 --> 00:39:31,530
makes it makes a fibreglass one and then

1074
00:39:30,090 --> 00:39:32,880
Howard's blog is down there and I don't

1075
00:39:31,530 --> 00:39:35,550
think he's updated his blog in a while

1076
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:39,000
but that's what I have I love to take

1077
00:39:35,550 --> 00:39:40,860
any questions or play play my play my

1078
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,910
slide deck I did have a whole bunch of

1079
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:43,400
pictures in here because I didn't know

1080
00:39:41,910 --> 00:39:46,759
how good the internet was gonna be so

1081
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:46,760
two questions

1082
00:39:52,890 --> 00:40:00,910
no the centreboard is not asymmetrical

1083
00:39:56,320 --> 00:40:02,620
in any way it is it is there's a there's

1084
00:40:00,910 --> 00:40:05,250
a design again

1085
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:07,480
I like the BS 1088 thing there's a

1086
00:40:05,250 --> 00:40:09,280
organization called NACA and I can't

1087
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:12,040
tell you what it stands for but they're

1088
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:13,990
the guys who essentially bless every

1089
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:15,550
sort of foil design because essentially

1090
00:40:13,990 --> 00:40:16,870
that's what it is it's a foil as it

1091
00:40:15,550 --> 00:40:20,560
moves through the water it has lift

1092
00:40:16,870 --> 00:40:22,420
properties like a like an airfoil and so

1093
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:24,370
I do know that it's measured out to NACA

1094
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:27,130
some sort of NACA curve that's well

1095
00:40:24,370 --> 00:40:28,420
approved but it's it's totally symmetric

1096
00:40:27,130 --> 00:40:29,920
on both sides as a matter of fact that's

1097
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:32,200
kind of interesting you saw the picture

1098
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:35,320
of the two halves being glued together

1099
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:37,390
as far as I can tell those were two

1100
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:40,630
completely I mean they just took the

1101
00:40:37,390 --> 00:40:44,379
same same piece and made two of them on

1102
00:40:40,630 --> 00:40:47,920
the CNC mill that by the way was a lot

1103
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:51,970
more than nine millimeter plywood that

1104
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:54,180
was I don't think you're gonna be able

1105
00:40:51,970 --> 00:40:57,580
to get a view of it from here

1106
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:59,319
yeah I you can see the ply there's apply

1107
00:40:57,580 --> 00:41:01,660
there apply there apply there apply

1108
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:03,700
there apply there so it's it's it's very

1109
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:06,009
smooth like that when I got it

1110
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:08,020
CNCs are good at a lot of things but

1111
00:41:06,010 --> 00:41:10,000
like making totally angled things at

1112
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:11,620
least the ones that they had so it was

1113
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:15,490
kind of rough I just sanded it down a

1114
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:17,049
little bit the rudder was the same way I

1115
00:41:15,490 --> 00:41:18,520
didn't put any pictures in here but the

1116
00:41:17,050 --> 00:41:20,380
rudder is exactly the same way by the

1117
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:23,140
way I had to cut that 24 pound piece of

1118
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:24,460
lead into two pieces and the guys at the

1119
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:25,870
lead shop were like yeah I just use your

1120
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:26,530
jigsaw and then wash your hands

1121
00:41:25,870 --> 00:41:30,160
afterwards

1122
00:41:26,530 --> 00:41:33,010
I'm like but I can't buy a house without

1123
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:34,629
licking the walls or you know with

1124
00:41:33,010 --> 00:41:36,940
worrying about lead-based paint and

1125
00:41:34,630 --> 00:41:38,500
you're just telling me that I can I can

1126
00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:42,040
just cut it with my jigsaw and then wash

1127
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:46,870
my hands I still don't really get that

1128
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:48,430
but but ya know the the foils are same

1129
00:41:46,870 --> 00:41:49,690
way one side or the other as far as I

1130
00:41:48,430 --> 00:41:54,480
can tell it makes no difference to the

1131
00:41:49,690 --> 00:41:54,480
sailing of it any other

1132
00:41:55,210 --> 00:42:02,540
um so the the course - with Howard and

1133
00:42:00,230 --> 00:42:04,040
in in John wells for it was about two

1134
00:42:02,540 --> 00:42:07,550
grand I think for me to stay in Port

1135
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:09,920
Townsend or and to take that course the

1136
00:42:07,550 --> 00:42:13,070
kit itself cut from plywood was twenty

1137
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:15,230
two hundred bucks and that's actually

1138
00:42:13,070 --> 00:42:17,570
not that expensive because those sheets

1139
00:42:15,230 --> 00:42:19,580
of BS 1088 plywood or a four by eight

1140
00:42:17,570 --> 00:42:20,780
sheet at six mill is last time I looked

1141
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:23,200
about eighty to a hundred bucks

1142
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:24,859
so there's twelve of them there right

1143
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:26,450
granted they're probably getting a

1144
00:42:24,859 --> 00:42:28,759
little bit better discount at the CNC

1145
00:42:26,450 --> 00:42:33,410
mill so I didn't feel like that was a

1146
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:35,869
bad cost and then my time I never added

1147
00:42:33,410 --> 00:42:38,629
it up fully but I know that I have more

1148
00:42:35,869 --> 00:42:40,070
than a thousand hours of building on it

1149
00:42:38,630 --> 00:42:42,890
I sort of get manic on things like that

1150
00:42:40,070 --> 00:42:44,900
so like the last speaker here right you

1151
00:42:42,890 --> 00:42:46,368
you're thinking about you had to step

1152
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:47,690
away from it the night before and so

1153
00:42:46,369 --> 00:42:49,100
you're gonna go back the next day and I

1154
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:51,290
had a plan for everything I wanted to

1155
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:53,240
get done it often went wrong but at

1156
00:42:51,290 --> 00:42:55,369
least I you know did something I pretty

1157
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:58,069
much did something most nights and most

1158
00:42:55,369 --> 00:43:00,010
weekends for a whole year to put it

1159
00:42:58,070 --> 00:43:03,859
together so a thousand hours in a year

1160
00:43:00,010 --> 00:43:05,990
yeah yeah so if you ever have a thousand

1161
00:43:03,859 --> 00:43:08,500
spare hours on your hands good build a

1162
00:43:05,990 --> 00:43:08,500
boat what the hell

1163
00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:18,980
what was what I did specifically was I

1164
00:43:17,060 --> 00:43:21,470
came in here dropped off some of my boat

1165
00:43:18,980 --> 00:43:24,170
building supplies and then drove down to

1166
00:43:21,470 --> 00:43:27,609
Libre Haven and it's it's about a two

1167
00:43:24,170 --> 00:43:31,100
and a half mile sail up here so

1168
00:43:27,609 --> 00:43:32,840
unfortunately I can only get to my boat

1169
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:34,700
when it's when it's low tide right now

1170
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:36,560
unless I feel like getting wet and

1171
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:38,379
getting wet at ten o'clock before I go

1172
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:41,000
to bed or 11:00 or midnight or whatever

1173
00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:42,680
not really very appealing to me so I'm

1174
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:46,430
actually gonna go out there tonight and

1175
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:47,750
sail back down tomorrow morning and then

1176
00:43:46,430 --> 00:43:48,950
I can then I can be here because I

1177
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:52,520
haven't been able to party any night

1178
00:43:48,950 --> 00:43:55,939
that I've been here so I gotta fix that

1179
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:57,830
problem yeah yeah so I'll do that

1180
00:43:55,940 --> 00:43:59,540
tomorrow that was the plan was to do

1181
00:43:57,830 --> 00:44:01,310
that on Sunday but that whole getting

1182
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:06,790
wet thing every evening is really not

1183
00:44:01,310 --> 00:44:06,790
not my bag is there something else yes

1184
00:44:11,930 --> 00:44:17,069
I'm not familiar with the monocoque

1185
00:44:14,370 --> 00:44:19,200
process I know that you're using you're

1186
00:44:17,070 --> 00:44:21,060
using the structure of the materials to

1187
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:23,609
structure other materials around them

1188
00:44:21,060 --> 00:44:27,360
and I can't I can't really give any

1189
00:44:23,610 --> 00:44:30,240
insight into that I it kind of does in a

1190
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:32,700
way a lot of that structure was in the

1191
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:34,140
egg shelling but then it's interesting

1192
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:36,930
because of the planks that stretched

1193
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:38,310
along each side they really only had I

1194
00:44:36,930 --> 00:44:40,080
said I said there were eight bulkheads

1195
00:44:38,310 --> 00:44:42,120
they really only had eight attachment

1196
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:43,770
points at each one of those and so you

1197
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:45,750
just put and they didn't we didn't even

1198
00:44:43,770 --> 00:44:47,040
make a big fill it on those or anything

1199
00:44:45,750 --> 00:44:49,740
you just sort of put them on there

1200
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:52,890
attach them on there this was

1201
00:44:49,740 --> 00:44:58,069
interesting when you attach them to that

1202
00:44:52,890 --> 00:45:00,569
six millimeter plywood for the bulkheads

1203
00:44:58,070 --> 00:45:03,330
there's some new plastic nails on the

1204
00:45:00,570 --> 00:45:05,520
market you can either use a stainless

1205
00:45:03,330 --> 00:45:07,529
steel nail which will never rust right

1206
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:09,060
or you can use a plastic but if however

1207
00:45:07,530 --> 00:45:11,190
you hit a stainless steel nail with your

1208
00:45:09,060 --> 00:45:12,900
plane you have to go back and redo

1209
00:45:11,190 --> 00:45:13,950
everything or straight into sand a

1210
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:17,280
seamless steel nail is kind of

1211
00:45:13,950 --> 00:45:18,689
ridiculous so the new plastic nails I

1212
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:20,340
did not use any of those plastic nails

1213
00:45:18,690 --> 00:45:23,160
but I'm very interested in trying some

1214
00:45:20,340 --> 00:45:24,630
of those for various applications so I

1215
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:27,240
can't really compare monocoque

1216
00:45:24,630 --> 00:45:30,620
construction to this but I have a

1217
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:33,209
feeling there's some similarities yeah

1218
00:45:30,620 --> 00:45:36,489
all right thank you

1219
00:45:33,210 --> 00:45:36,489
[Applause]
