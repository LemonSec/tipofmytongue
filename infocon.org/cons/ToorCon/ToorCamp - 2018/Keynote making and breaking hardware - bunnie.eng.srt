1
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:14,460
lot of announcements but real quick to

2
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:15,129
the 12 year old out there that just got

3
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:18,080
your

4
00:00:15,129 --> 00:00:22,610
pineapple yeah that's cute

5
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:24,229
stop it but I guess without further ado

6
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:26,000
we'll get started this morning

7
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:27,770
it's my unique pleasure to be able to

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,259
introduce a longtime friend of ours up

9
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:32,418
here bunny has been with us for a long

10
00:00:30,259 --> 00:00:33,710
time but absent also for a long time

11
00:00:32,418 --> 00:00:36,680
unfortunately due to things like

12
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:38,960
geography and whatnot but we're space

13
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:40,580
and time but we're so happy to have them

14
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,930
kick off our conference it's a great

15
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:51,500
start for the cons so please welcome

16
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:53,210
bunny to the stage everybody thanks

17
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:55,940
thanks for having me I'm like super

18
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:59,449
excited to be back and and with good

19
00:00:55,940 --> 00:01:01,309
friends and in a great location they've

20
00:00:59,449 --> 00:01:03,890
asked me to sort of come up with a talk

21
00:01:01,309 --> 00:01:05,840
about sort of harder hacking sort of

22
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:08,180
essentially like the hardware hacker

23
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,860
book but in a talk and so I started

24
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:11,810
thinking about any suggested the title

25
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:13,640
making and breaking hardware order the

26
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:15,470
hacker ethos and it kind of turned into

27
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:17,780
more of like why I like hardware hacking

28
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:19,670
and how you can get into if you haven't

29
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:20,869
gotten to already how many people here

30
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:22,130
would say that they are like kind of a

31
00:01:20,869 --> 00:01:23,450
hardware hacker or play around a bit

32
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:24,859
with heart or that sort of thing okay so

33
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:27,020
actually a really good number of people

34
00:01:24,859 --> 00:01:28,130
are into it and how many people would

35
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:30,890
say that they're more of a software

36
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:34,329
hacker okay also a good number of people

37
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:36,469
yeah so so I mean just to get started

38
00:01:34,329 --> 00:01:38,719
there's a valid question of like this

39
00:01:36,469 --> 00:01:41,439
it's hard to even matter anymore because

40
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:44,359
we have super beers in our pocket and

41
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:46,969
what we can't put in the pocket we can

42
00:01:44,359 --> 00:01:48,859
go to the cloud and you know get ahead

43
00:01:46,969 --> 00:01:52,219
and get whole supercomputers essentially

44
00:01:48,859 --> 00:01:55,908
at least you know sort of through the

45
00:01:52,219 --> 00:01:58,520
internet via the cloud if if we could

46
00:01:55,909 --> 00:01:59,960
containerize a teaspoon somehow we would

47
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:01,249
have no more mountains because people

48
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:04,609
would terraform for the fun of it it

49
00:02:01,249 --> 00:02:06,770
seems at the end of the day and so like

50
00:02:04,609 --> 00:02:08,780
you know there is a sort of illusion of

51
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:11,000
possibility that comes from from

52
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:12,230
software right this sort of it's a bit

53
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,480
of a fractal thing it's like you have an

54
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:16,549
infinite surface area to explore there's

55
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,899
a bunch of things you can do but the

56
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:20,240
truth actually you know as with a

57
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:22,010
fractal is despite the infinite surface

58
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:24,200
area you're there's also finite volume

59
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:27,140
that volume is bounded by the hardware

60
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:28,109
that that you're given so if you were to

61
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:29,640
have you know an

62
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:31,320
army of men you could take over

63
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:32,700
countries you could build pyramids all

64
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:34,620
this sort of stuff but they couldn't do

65
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:36,119
the most basic thing for species

66
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:37,860
survival which is to have a baby because

67
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:39,900
they don't have the right hardware to

68
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:41,690
have a baby so don't forget that the

69
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:44,010
heart is actually extremely important

70
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:46,200
there's some things you can't do without

71
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:47,970
the right hardware so this is this here

72
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:49,799
is a picture of an infrared view of a

73
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:52,050
circuit board I use this often times to

74
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:53,670
see if I have a problem you can find hot

75
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:55,920
spots and so without that infrared

76
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:57,989
sensor you don't have visibility into

77
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:00,450
that spectrum of light and that's a very

78
00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:02,580
helpful thing to have just to have that

79
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:04,679
one sensor so this is this an extension

80
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:06,239
to what you might have on a normal

81
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:08,430
camera and there some things are just

82
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:09,870
easier to do with the right hardware so

83
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:11,550
you know if you're trying to hack a

84
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:13,230
system and you have some cryptic keys

85
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:14,730
you're trying to extract I mean you

86
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:16,440
could build a supercomputer and hook up

87
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:17,940
to hydro plant and wait many many years

88
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:20,040
or you could build a piece of hardware

89
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:23,370
drop it into there and sort of pull out

90
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:25,709
the actual keys themselves so there's

91
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:27,540
kind of two big reasons when I was

92
00:03:25,709 --> 00:03:30,050
thinking about it for why you would want

93
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:32,130
to hack Hardware there's basically a

94
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:33,810
security reason so maybe you want to

95
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:35,160
extract some secrets and there's another

96
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:36,810
one which is sort of the interaction

97
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:39,090
reason so this sort of like extending

98
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:40,920
the capability of a piece of hardware

99
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:43,230
beyond its existing capability so I'm

100
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:45,450
going to talk about both of those facets

101
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:48,209
a little bit so let's start off with the

102
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:49,859
security side of things so why would you

103
00:03:48,209 --> 00:03:51,780
want to go ahead and hack harder from

104
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:53,970
the security side so people have gotten

105
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:55,560
better over the years at protecting

106
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:57,630
secrets and hardware from hardware

107
00:03:55,560 --> 00:04:00,870
security modules to sort of like

108
00:03:57,630 --> 00:04:03,299
whatever Bitcoin wallets simcards people

109
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:05,190
now sort of putting stuff at the chip

110
00:04:03,299 --> 00:04:09,030
level burning things into e fuses these

111
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:10,470
are sort of like micrographs of what the

112
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:12,260
the fuses now look like they're two

113
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:14,700
hiding secrets inside of a chip and so

114
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:16,620
now that people are getting good really

115
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:18,630
good at burying the secret keys inside

116
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:21,298
of silicon and inside epoxy that sort of

117
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:24,600
thing sometimes it feels like the only

118
00:04:21,298 --> 00:04:26,219
option you have to get those secrets out

119
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:27,660
would be to build a big supercomputer

120
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:29,370
and a hydro plan and wait a billion

121
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:31,410
billion years to sort of brute force it

122
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:32,550
out and that's the point at which you

123
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:34,260
want to go ahead and you want to take

124
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:36,419
the red pill and change the rules right

125
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:38,849
like you know we you if you exist within

126
00:04:36,419 --> 00:04:40,650
the rules of the hardware you can't you

127
00:04:38,849 --> 00:04:40,960
can't you're you just up against a you

128
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:44,500
know

129
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:46,599
a sort of a impossible computational

130
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:48,400
task to get the get the the keys out so

131
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:50,650
there's a whole bunch of things you can

132
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:53,380
do don't worry about the the list I'll

133
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:56,169
talk through it in pictures to try to

134
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:57,550
extract hardware secrets so the most

135
00:04:56,169 --> 00:04:59,289
obvious thing to do is like direct

136
00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:00,669
observation you can go ahead and you can

137
00:04:59,289 --> 00:05:03,009
take a microscope or a scanning electron

138
00:05:00,669 --> 00:05:05,109
microscope and look at the piece of

139
00:05:03,009 --> 00:05:06,699
hardware and the cool thing about sort

140
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:08,289
of atoms is you can't encrypt them you

141
00:05:06,699 --> 00:05:10,900
can try to obfuscate them but that's

142
00:05:08,289 --> 00:05:12,219
very different from encryption and so if

143
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:14,650
you get a better microscope you can

144
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:17,979
basically always find the secrets on the

145
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:19,508
inside actually at torque on about

146
00:05:17,979 --> 00:05:21,430
twelve years ago or something like this

147
00:05:19,509 --> 00:05:22,990
I was here with a probe station and we

148
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:24,520
had chips and we took them apart and

149
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:26,500
show people how to get the keys out and

150
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:28,780
that sort of thing it's actually it's

151
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:31,930
actually as easy as knowing where to

152
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:34,809
look the problem is is that when we did

153
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:37,120
the chip at at the last torque on we

154
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:37,960
printed like a 10 by 10 for a sort of

155
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,310
picture of it and you could actually

156
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:41,080
hold all their you can actually point

157
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:42,520
out the transistors of course today with

158
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:44,169
a billion transistors on a chip

159
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:45,639
it would be like the size of a city

160
00:05:44,169 --> 00:05:47,289
block and you'd really have to walk

161
00:05:45,639 --> 00:05:50,080
around it for days before you could find

162
00:05:47,289 --> 00:05:52,360
where the security keys are and so there

163
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:54,039
are other ways they're easier to get it

164
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:56,500
out for example a direct measurement so

165
00:05:54,039 --> 00:05:58,330
this is a throwback to a hack I did a

166
00:05:56,500 --> 00:06:00,430
long time ago where I pulled the keys

167
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:01,750
out of the Microsoft Xbox on the

168
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:05,289
left-hand side of the picture here this

169
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:07,930
is the Xbox motherboard and there's a

170
00:06:05,289 --> 00:06:09,219
system securities that were held inside

171
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:12,400
the south bridge chip there I said to

172
00:06:09,219 --> 00:06:15,070
the CPU and at the time you know we

173
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:17,440
weren't sure how to you know basically

174
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:19,539
brute force the keys out so I built a

175
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:21,130
little circuit board that was that sat

176
00:06:19,539 --> 00:06:23,199
on top of the bus and just sniffed the

177
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:25,270
keys out as they went by and so that's

178
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:27,580
an example of a passive mint so there's

179
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:29,560
no we haven't really directly modified

180
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:31,719
the function of the computer we just

181
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:33,250
observed the traffic as it went by and

182
00:06:31,719 --> 00:06:34,659
so this is a little very simple board

183
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:38,199
that we built and we're able to pull out

184
00:06:34,659 --> 00:06:40,150
the the keys that way there other sort

185
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:42,490
of really cool passive techniques so it

186
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:44,799
turns out that a transistor whenever it

187
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:47,919
switches emits a photon in the infrared

188
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:49,810
spectrum it's a very it's a very small

189
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:52,219
amount of light but detectable and so

190
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:53,900
there's a paper that was done which

191
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:55,820
is a picture of a chip in the optical

192
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:57,530
range and this is a picture of the chip

193
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:59,390
in the infrared range and as the

194
00:06:57,530 --> 00:07:01,400
transistors switch during computation

195
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:03,650
you actually can see them turning on and

196
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:05,599
off and so they had demonstrated that

197
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:07,669
they were running an AES algorithm and

198
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:09,470
they're able to actually pull out the

199
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:10,880
keys by observing the pattern of lights

200
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:13,310
coming out of the transistors as they

201
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,960
switched on and off this requires a

202
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:15,920
little bit of like a manipulating of the

203
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:18,409
silicon they have to grind off the

204
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:20,390
backside till it's very very thin but it

205
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:22,100
gives you an idea of sort of the power

206
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:23,360
that they have now to sort of extract

207
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:25,160
secrets from chips as they're running

208
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:28,010
through these sort of passive optical

209
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:30,110
emissions if you don't have access to

210
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:31,640
the crazy you know microscopes and stuff

211
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:33,170
like that there's other things you can

212
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:34,729
do like just observing the amount of

213
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:37,790
power that a chip uses during a

214
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:39,590
computation so this is a example of so

215
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:41,300
if you have it if you have a chip and

216
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:43,369
it's doing a computation if it has more

217
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:45,710
computation it draws more power right

218
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:47,480
and so if you have a round of AES or

219
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:49,609
public key algorithm you're running

220
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:50,870
depending upon which s box you're doing

221
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:51,980
in which part of the key you're doing

222
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:54,250
you'll have a different signature of

223
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:56,480
power and this here is an actual sort of

224
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:57,620
picture of a the trace of the power

225
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,970
going through as it goes through

226
00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:00,140
different rounds you can actually see

227
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:01,760
they have a different length of a

228
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:04,610
signature and so you can actually

229
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:05,900
extract the secret through observation

230
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:07,820
of a power sight channel and then and

231
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:09,049
this is actually becoming so commonplace

232
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:11,150
now you can actually just pick up a

233
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:12,590
piece of hardware the chip whisperer and

234
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:14,719
it has great docks online and teaches

235
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:17,539
you how to do that

236
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:20,720
there's also RF side channels so chips

237
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:23,120
in addition to having power fluctuations

238
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:25,760
and photons being emitted they'll emit

239
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:28,160
stuff in the radio wave domain and these

240
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:29,950
sort of round things here are RF probes

241
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:32,719
you can buy them they're actually

242
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:34,098
they're called near-field probes and you

243
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:36,050
just hook them up to a small amplifier

244
00:08:34,099 --> 00:08:38,330
an oscilloscope and you get similar

245
00:08:36,049 --> 00:08:39,978
traces to the ones you saw of the power

246
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:41,570
if the if you can essentially get the

247
00:08:39,979 --> 00:08:42,740
chip quiet enough so it's doing just the

248
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:44,420
computation or I can do a ton of

249
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:45,710
averaging that's another thing you can

250
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:48,620
do if you can get a good trigger on it

251
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:50,780
and so there's a paper here of a sort of

252
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:52,670
people pulling out encrypted keys for

253
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:55,400
Sonic's bit streams and that's where I

254
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:57,110
pulled the picture from so if you if you

255
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:58,880
if all else fails on the passive side

256
00:08:57,110 --> 00:09:00,530
you can start to get active so the

257
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:03,080
ultimate active thing to do is call the

258
00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:04,220
focus ion beam it's a fib that's this is

259
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:05,750
what it looks like sort of like a little

260
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:09,620
desk top size

261
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:11,360
machine and it fires atoms of gallium at

262
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:13,190
the surface of the silicon and if the

263
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,420
atoms are at a high enough energy

264
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:16,220
they'll hit the silicon and knock it

265
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:17,719
away if it's low enough energy to add

266
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:19,940
gallium atoms will settle onto the

267
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:21,680
surface and create the metallic film and

268
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:24,050
it can inject other gases and at the

269
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:25,969
same time to do deposition and so you

270
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:27,469
can see an example here this is actually

271
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:29,450
a micrograph of a chip where they've

272
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:32,120
actually cut holes into the chip itself

273
00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:34,100
and the jumpered wired over it

274
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:35,960
rewired the chip to do something

275
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:37,220
different so this is actually an example

276
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:38,360
this was actually wasn't a security

277
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:39,890
example this is someone who just

278
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:43,310
designed a chip and done up and

279
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:45,080
they had to fix it and in the end and

280
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:46,489
they went ahead and rewired it so didn't

281
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:48,860
have to go ahead and like pay millions

282
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:50,060
of dollars for the math set but this

283
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:51,860
type of technology was actually

284
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:53,270
originally developed because making

285
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:55,310
chips is hard in developing chips hard

286
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:58,730
turns out that same technology can be

287
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:59,839
used to rewire your chips if you want to

288
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:03,230
go ahead and have them divulge the

289
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:05,090
secrets when they're not supposed to if

290
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:07,880
you don't have access to a fit there's

291
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:10,730
other ways to sort of actively modify

292
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:12,920
the way a chip runs you can glitch the

293
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:15,140
power you can glitch the clock you can

294
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:16,490
glitch other pins like the reset you can

295
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:18,860
actually you know how I said the

296
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:20,420
transistors emit light physics has this

297
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:21,770
duality property things that emit light

298
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:23,540
can also be sensitive to it you can

299
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:25,220
actually like shoot a laser at the chip

300
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:27,980
at a very focused location and flip a

301
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:29,060
bit if you want to these are all these

302
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:30,380
are all possibilities they don't the

303
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:32,449
only problem with light is that actually

304
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:34,070
photons are really big so like the

305
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:35,510
infrared photons are about a micron in

306
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:37,880
size and it because you're well aware of

307
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:39,830
transistor now like 28 nanometers and so

308
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:41,120
when you now today when you want to

309
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:43,430
glitch at chip you're actually glitching

310
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:47,050
like a whole field of transistors is

311
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:49,939
which but fault injection itself is

312
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:51,699
interesting and you know if the whole

313
00:10:49,940 --> 00:11:03,589
idea is that you go ahead and you just

314
00:10:51,700 --> 00:11:09,470
have a chip question let me see if I

315
00:11:03,589 --> 00:11:11,870
can't reposition this okay so the idea

316
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:14,089
is that you want to try to modify or

317
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:16,250
corrupt the memory or code in some

318
00:11:14,089 --> 00:11:17,390
predictable type of way so a lot of

319
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:18,649
times like for example when you're

320
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:20,809
powering it on you'll go

321
00:11:18,649 --> 00:11:22,069
and as a coat is being pulled into the

322
00:11:20,809 --> 00:11:23,839
cash you just sort of glitch power a

323
00:11:22,069 --> 00:11:25,189
little bit any male flip some bits of

324
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:26,329
code that was supposed to be secure that

325
00:11:25,189 --> 00:11:28,309
was going to compute like a branch

326
00:11:26,329 --> 00:11:29,719
target or something like this another

327
00:11:28,309 --> 00:11:31,519
thing is as you're doing the actual

328
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:36,619
cryptographic algorithm itself if you

329
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:38,209
King this just like you can get residues

330
00:11:36,619 --> 00:11:40,129
out of the cryptographic algorithm that

331
00:11:38,209 --> 00:11:43,179
can leak portions of the secret key so

332
00:11:40,129 --> 00:11:44,869
this is a common attack against RSA

333
00:11:43,179 --> 00:11:46,639
particularly implementations that use

334
00:11:44,869 --> 00:11:48,290
the Chinese remainder theorem or you can

335
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:50,029
just change the reset so like you know

336
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:51,829
you can just say instead of running code

337
00:11:50,029 --> 00:11:53,389
from the intended location it goes from

338
00:11:51,829 --> 00:11:55,279
some other place and this this picture

339
00:11:53,389 --> 00:11:57,379
here is actually the the it's literally

340
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:59,600
called the tweezers hack this is on the

341
00:11:57,379 --> 00:12:02,149
Nintendo Wii where they have the tweezer

342
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:04,579
between ground and the address pins and

343
00:12:02,149 --> 00:12:05,839
during reset hold it and so what happens

344
00:12:04,579 --> 00:12:07,429
is that the code that was meant to be

345
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:09,639
secured gets loaded into another address

346
00:12:07,429 --> 00:12:12,860
big and then they can go ahead and

347
00:12:09,639 --> 00:12:14,569
execute different code as a result of

348
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:16,160
the of that hack so it's sort of like a

349
00:12:14,569 --> 00:12:16,729
small injection can be actually very

350
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,839
simple

351
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:20,300
here's a pair of tweezers at the right

352
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:23,199
time hitting reset can get you to the

353
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:27,559
point where you want to be there's also

354
00:12:23,199 --> 00:12:29,839
some serve in between active and passive

355
00:12:27,559 --> 00:12:31,309
for example coupling is a new thing

356
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:34,189
that's come out and there's this thing

357
00:12:31,309 --> 00:12:37,399
called brohamer pretty interesting if

358
00:12:34,189 --> 00:12:39,439
you were to look at a DRAM chip so this

359
00:12:37,399 --> 00:12:42,110
is a micrograph of a DRAM chip these are

360
00:12:39,439 --> 00:12:43,849
the these are the row the row wires that

361
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:46,759
the data is sort of like being read out

362
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:48,230
across and it we're looking at one tiny

363
00:12:46,759 --> 00:12:49,519
portion of chip this wire actually will

364
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:51,589
they go from one end of the camp

365
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:52,970
whether it's like super super long so

366
00:12:51,589 --> 00:12:54,999
when you have two wires or this long

367
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:56,269
next to each other they're parallel no

368
00:12:54,999 --> 00:12:59,839
go ahead

369
00:12:56,269 --> 00:13:01,429
in in if affect each other and so this

370
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:03,379
is that this is an attack we can go

371
00:13:01,429 --> 00:13:05,929
ahead and if you have access to two

372
00:13:03,379 --> 00:13:07,220
wires or adjacent to one that holds

373
00:13:05,929 --> 00:13:08,420
something that you want to modify you

374
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:10,089
swing them up and down you can go ahead

375
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:11,899
and crop bits on a page of memory

376
00:13:10,089 --> 00:13:14,839
through something like this and so this

377
00:13:11,899 --> 00:13:16,220
is a relatively new form of sort of

378
00:13:14,839 --> 00:13:18,949
active attack and I think there are

379
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:20,389
probably other row hammer like attacks

380
00:13:18,949 --> 00:13:22,008
out there that exists it pretty good as

381
00:13:20,389 --> 00:13:23,749
you start to push into these deep sub

382
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:25,879
man or sub nanometer processes the

383
00:13:23,749 --> 00:13:28,129
margins get thinner and thinner so that

384
00:13:25,879 --> 00:13:31,160
should be interesting area to watch in

385
00:13:28,129 --> 00:13:32,450
the future I mean is a kind of an

386
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:33,949
analogy I guess for real hair

387
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:36,290
happens in NAND flash but because NAND

388
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:38,450
flash has so much ECC on it typically

389
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:40,280
those things get scrubbed out before

390
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:42,140
they cause into trouble so that's sort

391
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:43,910
of like the the security half like

392
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:45,319
that's a the the quick summary of why

393
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:47,839
you might want to hack Hardware if you

394
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:49,850
want to get secrets out but actually a

395
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:51,410
lot of my time recently has but not been

396
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:53,090
so much focused on the security side but

397
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:54,980
more about extending what computers can

398
00:13:53,090 --> 00:13:56,420
do sort of on the interaction side what

399
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:58,130
can you make computers do that they

400
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:59,719
couldn't do before I mean if you

401
00:13:58,130 --> 00:14:01,280
remember you without the right hardware

402
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:03,050
there's some things you just can't do so

403
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:05,209
you really want to try to put more

404
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:08,870
Hardware capability into computers just

405
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:11,500
things you can't be aware of and so and

406
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:13,820
in terms of thinking about you know what

407
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:15,620
you could do with a computer I came up

408
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:17,690
with a sort of ontology of things I'm

409
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:20,810
sorry it gets a little bit academic but

410
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:23,570
that's like sort of my my tendency so

411
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:25,520
there's three major areas that I think

412
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:27,920
that you know you can divide the the

413
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:29,329
realm of interaction to this computer's

414
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:31,310
interacting with other computers so

415
00:14:29,330 --> 00:14:32,810
that's the the top bubble here that

416
00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:34,550
would be you know things like the

417
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:36,290
internet your computer interacted or the

418
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:39,859
computers Wi-Fi Bluetooth that sort of

419
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:40,579
thing there's computers interacting with

420
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:43,280
physical matter

421
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:45,200
that's this bubble over here and I've

422
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:47,120
written sort of like the 7 SI units

423
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:49,400
position time mass current intensity

424
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:52,640
temperature and mole which is sort of an

425
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:54,800
odd one but the there there are sensors

426
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:57,410
and actually as we can use to go ahead

427
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:59,510
and affect physical quantities so you

428
00:14:57,410 --> 00:15:02,209
know your earphones turn current into

429
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:03,650
the motion of air a robot arm turns a

430
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:06,230
lot you know electrical impulses into

431
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:08,270
position and mass we have GPS that tells

432
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:09,860
us position in time we have optical

433
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:11,420
sensors that can detect the intensity of

434
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:13,880
light over time so and so forth those

435
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:15,290
form your base set of sensors and it's

436
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:16,670
really interesting when people develop a

437
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:19,670
brand new sensor like an infrared sensor

438
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:22,010
or or something like this that can can

439
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:23,750
unlock a whole brand-new set of

440
00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:26,480
functions for computers that wasn't

441
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:28,610
available before and then on this bubble

442
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:32,150
here is sort of society how computers

443
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:33,950
interact with society itself the ways

444
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:37,630
computers can change society's for

445
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:39,950
example crypto currency or surveillance

446
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:42,590
artificial intelligence changing the way

447
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:44,600
we feel about other people

448
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:46,279
there's self-driving cars which can

449
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:48,230
change the way we compute there are sex

450
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:49,579
robots that change the way we have sex

451
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:52,639
and interact with other human beings

452
00:15:49,579 --> 00:15:53,899
there's cryptography that can limit the

453
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:55,550
what we can do with our own hardware

454
00:15:53,899 --> 00:15:57,709
through the sort of the norms that we

455
00:15:55,550 --> 00:16:00,649
agree in society and then you know maybe

456
00:15:57,709 --> 00:16:02,660
not too distant future the actual direct

457
00:16:00,649 --> 00:16:03,829
human-computer interfaces where

458
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:05,629
computers are like literally plugged

459
00:16:03,829 --> 00:16:09,979
into our brain and that will be sort of

460
00:16:05,629 --> 00:16:12,829
a very interesting time indeed but you

461
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:14,600
know when I was looking at sort of the

462
00:16:12,829 --> 00:16:16,160
space of things you can do and an

463
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:18,920
observation came up which is that

464
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:20,779
computers are basically defined by not

465
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:22,748
by the CPU but by the sensors and a

466
00:16:20,779 --> 00:16:25,550
peripheral as you put in it so for every

467
00:16:22,749 --> 00:16:27,259
base just kind of like three tiers of

468
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:28,639
computation I kind of put out here this

469
00:16:27,259 --> 00:16:29,959
sort of like the Arduino level thing

470
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:31,939
which is embedded microcontrollers

471
00:16:29,959 --> 00:16:33,410
there's sort of like the mobile level

472
00:16:31,939 --> 00:16:34,969
which is sort of like represent my

473
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:36,889
Raspberry Pi but also if you look at the

474
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:39,800
Raspberry Pi in in like an iPhone

475
00:16:36,889 --> 00:16:41,959
they're basically the same sock memory

476
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:44,149
sort of combination on the inside and

477
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:46,040
they have sort of the the desktop server

478
00:16:44,149 --> 00:16:47,420
class motherboards so between those

479
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:48,620
three levels if you're a hardware

480
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:49,729
engineering leader you're designing it

481
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:51,050
your schematics you're going to start

482
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:53,240
from basically the same spot every

483
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:54,800
single time and then really it's all

484
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:56,120
about the center's you put it about it's

485
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:58,370
all about the interaction so these are

486
00:16:56,120 --> 00:17:01,189
two different products to actually use

487
00:16:58,370 --> 00:17:02,779
the exact same CPU a px a 168 from

488
00:17:01,189 --> 00:17:05,418
Marvel I didn't know this at the time

489
00:17:02,779 --> 00:17:07,880
but the PX a 168 is using the Xbox

490
00:17:05,419 --> 00:17:10,250
Kinect which in is also used in a

491
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:11,750
product I designed called any TV so and

492
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:13,939
you guys all know what the Kinect does

493
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:18,470
the any TV is a device that allows you

494
00:17:13,939 --> 00:17:20,149
to put sort of your own your inject your

495
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:22,010
own content on top of a encrypted video

496
00:17:20,148 --> 00:17:23,719
so it's a sort of experiment to see what

497
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:25,280
we can how can how you can get around

498
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:28,459
sort of the roadblock that the MSA puts

499
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:30,049
on your ability to manipulate video they

500
00:17:28,459 --> 00:17:31,940
both use the same socks so that's the

501
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:33,590
that's SOC that's the Marvell sock they

502
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:35,600
both have the same kind of DRAM

503
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:39,049
architecture they might even run the

504
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:40,939
same flavor of Linux who knows but then

505
00:17:39,049 --> 00:17:42,590
the sense is it that we put on this on

506
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:44,929
the side of that it really changed the

507
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:46,129
the product overall I put an FPGA that

508
00:17:44,929 --> 00:17:48,190
allows me to interact with encrypted

509
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:50,390
video feeds they put some amazing

510
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:51,980
sensors allow you to sort of you know

511
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:53,809
sort of look at the you know sort of

512
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:55,760
space and measure the distance people

513
00:17:53,809 --> 00:17:56,960
are from the camera and so that it's all

514
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:59,090
about that it's all about the

515
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,169
interaction layer that changes kind of

516
00:17:59,090 --> 00:18:02,869
defines what a computer

517
00:18:00,169 --> 00:18:05,149
does another example is you know there

518
00:18:02,869 --> 00:18:08,178
are tween Omega this product is in both

519
00:18:05,149 --> 00:18:10,399
of these devices one is a power supply

520
00:18:08,179 --> 00:18:12,169
the other one's a 3d printer it's all

521
00:18:10,399 --> 00:18:14,719
about sort of you know what they do in

522
00:18:12,169 --> 00:18:17,059
addition to the core computer at the end

523
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:19,340
of day or like for example accessories

524
00:18:17,059 --> 00:18:20,899
so adding or extending interaction so if

525
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:22,428
you have a phone which is like this

526
00:18:20,899 --> 00:18:24,109
amazing supercomputer in your pocket and

527
00:18:22,429 --> 00:18:25,159
it has sensors and it has stuff there's

528
00:18:24,109 --> 00:18:26,749
some things they can't do like if you

529
00:18:25,159 --> 00:18:27,950
want to measure the wind you have to get

530
00:18:26,749 --> 00:18:28,940
a little thing to plug in the commission

531
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:30,919
of the wind if you want to measure your

532
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:32,600
body there's some sensors that let you

533
00:18:30,919 --> 00:18:34,549
interface your phone to your body and

534
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:36,199
measure that it could be as simple as

535
00:18:34,549 --> 00:18:37,730
like a selfie stick right so a selfie

536
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:39,049
stick is not a fancy piece of hardware

537
00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:40,909
but the fact that you can now take a

538
00:18:39,049 --> 00:18:42,340
phone and put it in a position where you

539
00:18:40,909 --> 00:18:44,389
can take a picture of you and a friend

540
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:45,949
unlocked a whole bunch of new social

541
00:18:44,389 --> 00:18:48,350
interaction capability with the phone

542
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:50,210
itself so there are there I mean you

543
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:51,590
know kind of hardware hacking can take

544
00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:52,940
some very subtle things that just

545
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:54,619
changed the way the computers where

546
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:56,840
they're located or how they're how they

547
00:18:54,619 --> 00:19:00,439
interact with humans and can create sort

548
00:18:56,840 --> 00:19:02,689
of new social interaction themes so

549
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:05,210
interaction is is where it's at there's

550
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:07,820
an incubator called hacks that I mentor

551
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:10,220
for in Shenzhen every few a couple

552
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:12,769
months I see about 12 startups and I

553
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:15,259
would say like 70% of the startups that

554
00:19:12,769 --> 00:19:16,999
go through all hinge on the existence of

555
00:19:15,259 --> 00:19:19,429
a new sensor or an actuator so they're

556
00:19:16,999 --> 00:19:21,409
not about like oh we're going to you

557
00:19:19,429 --> 00:19:22,850
know do a new microprocessor core or

558
00:19:21,409 --> 00:19:25,639
something like this it's more about like

559
00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:27,168
hey we have you know we have this new

560
00:19:25,639 --> 00:19:28,369
actuator that's actually really good for

561
00:19:27,169 --> 00:19:29,869
people who can't walk so we're gonna

562
00:19:28,369 --> 00:19:32,119
build like prostheses or we're going to

563
00:19:29,869 --> 00:19:34,158
we have a new sort of sensor that's good

564
00:19:32,119 --> 00:19:35,509
for measuring the you know sort of the

565
00:19:34,159 --> 00:19:37,159
temperature of humans build a fertility

566
00:19:35,509 --> 00:19:39,139
monitor these sorts of things these are

567
00:19:37,159 --> 00:19:41,450
the sorts of stuff that are the focus of

568
00:19:39,139 --> 00:19:42,949
of that group and then I also am a

569
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:45,619
researcher Phillie at the MIT Media Lab

570
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:47,239
and 90% of the research they're so

571
00:19:45,619 --> 00:19:49,100
involved sort of computer hardware human

572
00:19:47,239 --> 00:19:50,480
interaction again so that extending

573
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:54,199
computers a space of what they can do

574
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:55,669
and what's interesting about computers

575
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:57,499
and if you look at this ontology they

576
00:19:55,669 --> 00:19:59,450
put together a lot of these buzzwords

577
00:19:57,499 --> 00:20:01,309
and hardware that you that we all talk

578
00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:03,710
about are at the intersections of these

579
00:20:01,309 --> 00:20:05,418
three circles so between other computers

580
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:08,149
and physical matter there's the Internet

581
00:20:05,419 --> 00:20:10,070
of Things between other computers in

582
00:20:08,149 --> 00:20:11,299
society there's all this AI and machine

583
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:14,049
learning hullabaloo

584
00:20:11,299 --> 00:20:16,629
you know both manipulation and whatnot

585
00:20:14,049 --> 00:20:18,940
there's a physical matter in society

586
00:20:16,629 --> 00:20:20,738
that's like you know you know people 3d

587
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:22,480
printing and or drones moving things

588
00:20:20,739 --> 00:20:25,239
around our autonomous cars pushing

589
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:26,860
things around so you know what happens

590
00:20:25,239 --> 00:20:30,429
here at the middle of this is it is it

591
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:32,769
the robot revolution what happens you

592
00:20:30,429 --> 00:20:34,210
know actually it's it's the the right

593
00:20:32,769 --> 00:20:35,860
hardware at the right pace can be very

594
00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:36,999
simple but I think it's sort of like

595
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:38,678
over you know kind of hit that

596
00:20:36,999 --> 00:20:41,499
perfection of getting all those

597
00:20:38,679 --> 00:20:42,970
different things you can actually you

598
00:20:41,499 --> 00:20:44,470
know create something very meaningful

599
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:45,850
but it doesn't have to be very

600
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:49,119
complicated so this this here is a

601
00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:50,799
square which now it takes a phone allows

602
00:20:49,119 --> 00:20:52,359
it to interact with physical matter that

603
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:55,059
couldn't be for it the ie your credit

604
00:20:52,359 --> 00:20:57,189
card did to other computers and in

605
00:20:55,059 --> 00:20:59,109
changes the way we do payment right and

606
00:20:57,190 --> 00:21:01,419
this very simple piece of hardware

607
00:20:59,109 --> 00:21:02,949
because it sort of hits these three

608
00:21:01,419 --> 00:21:04,659
different areas changes interactions

609
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:07,629
society and physical matter and

610
00:21:04,659 --> 00:21:09,220
networking has unlocked sort of a new

611
00:21:07,629 --> 00:21:11,519
business model a new way that people can

612
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:14,499
can other people can do business so

613
00:21:11,519 --> 00:21:16,299
given that you don't have to you know

614
00:21:14,499 --> 00:21:17,529
build a robot revolution to do something

615
00:21:16,299 --> 00:21:19,299
interesting why aren't there more

616
00:21:17,529 --> 00:21:20,409
hardware hackers right if it's so

617
00:21:19,299 --> 00:21:22,749
compelling how come there aren't more

618
00:21:20,409 --> 00:21:23,919
hackers well going back to that analogy

619
00:21:22,749 --> 00:21:25,269
of the red pill and the blue pill the

620
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:28,210
problem is when you take the red pill

621
00:21:25,269 --> 00:21:30,070
you know you end up coming out in this

622
00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:32,139
like goopy world the desert of the real

623
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:33,820
right it's not it's not like you you're

624
00:21:32,139 --> 00:21:35,379
coming out of that wonderful sim and the

625
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:38,230
dream of the things are and the thing is

626
00:21:35,379 --> 00:21:40,689
the desert is literally real right so

627
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:42,190
like you know if you you know are in

628
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:44,499
software you want to get rid of stuff

629
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:46,989
arm there's our star great it's all gone

630
00:21:44,499 --> 00:21:49,480
right this and then there are actually

631
00:21:46,989 --> 00:21:51,039
places in the world where like it looks

632
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:53,230
like this because of e-waste this is an

633
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:55,570
e-waste processing facility in Africa

634
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:57,580
where they have you know a desert that

635
00:21:55,570 --> 00:21:59,049
is covered with the stuff that we threw

636
00:21:57,580 --> 00:22:01,359
away we have this abstraction called a

637
00:21:59,049 --> 00:22:03,220
garbage can that we throw things into it

638
00:22:01,359 --> 00:22:04,928
seems to just disappear where did things

639
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:07,779
go well they have to go somewhere their

640
00:22:04,929 --> 00:22:10,359
atoms they don't just arm - our star and

641
00:22:07,779 --> 00:22:12,879
so atoms are difficult and they actually

642
00:22:10,359 --> 00:22:14,379
a lot of times you try to abstract atoms

643
00:22:12,879 --> 00:22:15,908
we mean the more we can abstract in the

644
00:22:14,379 --> 00:22:17,498
value that's what Amazon is and the sort

645
00:22:15,909 --> 00:22:18,999
of an abstraction of atoms can just

646
00:22:17,499 --> 00:22:22,059
appear at my house that's amazing but

647
00:22:18,999 --> 00:22:23,980
there's like a huge amount of overhead

648
00:22:22,059 --> 00:22:25,480
and a lot of cost that's involved with

649
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:26,600
creating that abstraction that we that

650
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:29,330
we all love

651
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:31,370
and use everyday so the problem with

652
00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:35,149
harder is it's made out of atoms and M's

653
00:22:31,370 --> 00:22:37,459
are really annoying so atoms are owned

654
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:39,289
by people people like to say that these

655
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:40,520
are my atoms or these are your atoms and

656
00:22:39,289 --> 00:22:41,780
I have to protect these atoms and we

657
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:42,918
have to buy these atoms and trade these

658
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:45,320
atoms that's actually one of the most

659
00:22:42,919 --> 00:22:46,549
annoying parts about atoms is that it's

660
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:48,049
not like a computer where I need more

661
00:22:46,549 --> 00:22:50,120
computation resources I go spit up

662
00:22:48,049 --> 00:22:51,379
another cloud instance and whatever it

663
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:53,178
is and then if I don't need it I just

664
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:55,580
turn off and it goes away at you know if

665
00:22:53,179 --> 00:22:57,740
I need more you know if you need more

666
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:59,658
minerals or whatever it is you have to

667
00:22:57,740 --> 00:23:02,539
go and mine it and and and make it

668
00:22:59,659 --> 00:23:06,049
available to to build your to build your

669
00:23:02,539 --> 00:23:08,870
things atoms are imperfect right so in

670
00:23:06,049 --> 00:23:10,940
nature they don't exist as perfect

671
00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:12,379
crystals of silicon and so there's a lot

672
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:14,270
of effort that we have to go through to

673
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:15,500
align them position them put them in the

674
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:17,210
right place to create the things that we

675
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:19,820
want and after you've gone through all

676
00:23:17,210 --> 00:23:21,500
the effort of buying atoms in and

677
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:22,730
perfecting them and refighting them they

678
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:24,890
just don't move around in their own

679
00:23:22,730 --> 00:23:26,480
right you can have just warehouses full

680
00:23:24,890 --> 00:23:28,940
of atoms that do nothing if you can't

681
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:31,789
get them to the place that people want

682
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:34,100
them to be on their hand on the other

683
00:23:31,789 --> 00:23:35,960
hand bits are perfect and way more

684
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:39,168
profitable this is you know this is in

685
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:41,000
the Nasdaq you know so valuation the

686
00:23:39,169 --> 00:23:42,770
dot-com boom if you guys remember that

687
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:47,330
you know back in the days of like coasts

688
00:23:42,770 --> 00:23:50,270
and Akamai AltaVista the days right and

689
00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:52,970
so what happened during that time of

690
00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:54,200
serve the dot-com boom is that we end up

691
00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:56,750
people were like bits are way more

692
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:58,309
profitable hardware sucks there's a lot

693
00:23:56,750 --> 00:24:00,860
of outsourcing mania that happened

694
00:23:58,309 --> 00:24:04,070
during that period of time so the 1990

695
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:05,870
to 2008 range they're sort of like this

696
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:07,490
notion of why would you go in a

697
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:09,350
pick-and-place machine when you can rent

698
00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:10,730
one right so this you know if I have a

699
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:13,189
thickened place machine that's building

700
00:24:10,730 --> 00:24:15,440
blackberries and another person has a

701
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:17,600
pick-and-place machine building motorola

702
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:19,429
razors and if you know supply and demand

703
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:21,199
isn't balanced on them well if we both

704
00:24:19,429 --> 00:24:22,820
rented the same machine they actually

705
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:24,260
are both busy all the time and so we get

706
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:25,340
more economy of scale by not actually

707
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:27,830
having to own that pick-and-place

708
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:29,240
machine and there's also some some

709
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:30,439
accounting benefits this is actually

710
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:32,419
sort of essentially in sort of see the

711
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:35,080
valuation of Foxconn you know kind of

712
00:24:32,419 --> 00:24:37,760
rise up with the with with the

713
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:39,199
outsourcing go there they're there

714
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:40,220
certain accounting of benefits actually

715
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:42,529
to actually really draw

716
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:44,450
seeing as well I want to talk a little

717
00:24:42,529 --> 00:24:46,129
bit more about that so there's a cycle

718
00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:49,460
that a business goes through where they

719
00:24:46,129 --> 00:24:51,769
take money you buy parts right then you

720
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:53,360
put the parts together you ship them

721
00:24:51,769 --> 00:24:54,950
around the world you sell the parts you

722
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:57,019
get more money and you buy more parts

723
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:58,429
right that's a very it seems to be the

724
00:24:57,019 --> 00:25:00,860
intuitive cycle that you expect for

725
00:24:58,429 --> 00:25:02,750
hardware and this is like a twenty to

726
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:04,250
sixty day cycle and investors who are

727
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:05,990
very clever people like to make metrics

728
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:07,460
and they say you know what are your days

729
00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:09,110
of inventory and was your interval

730
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:11,179
turnover and that's a measure of the

731
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:12,678
healthier company well it turns out that

732
00:25:11,179 --> 00:25:14,450
during the outsourcing boom people

733
00:25:12,679 --> 00:25:17,629
figure out a hack on this where they say

734
00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:19,639
okay if we don't own the parts and we

735
00:25:17,629 --> 00:25:21,199
don't own the SMT machines we just buy

736
00:25:19,639 --> 00:25:23,029
them as they come out of the factory and

737
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:25,879
then we just ship them to customers we

738
00:25:23,029 --> 00:25:27,620
can make it look like like our inventory

739
00:25:25,879 --> 00:25:30,110
supply chains are really really really

740
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:32,199
really lean and so at sort of Apple's

741
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:35,719
height they actually had a three day

742
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:37,159
turn of inventory so it's a fiction made

743
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:39,350
it look like you know they could take

744
00:25:37,159 --> 00:25:41,029
somehow snap their fingers and three

745
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:42,500
days later all the inventories moved

746
00:25:41,029 --> 00:25:44,570
actually it turns out all they did is

747
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:45,830
that they would they would buy the stuff

748
00:25:44,570 --> 00:25:46,908
from the factories they would hold them

749
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:49,490
in the place in Shenzhen very

750
00:25:46,909 --> 00:25:51,289
temporarily and you would then buy it

751
00:25:49,490 --> 00:25:53,509
online and because of the way the

752
00:25:51,289 --> 00:25:55,669
counting rules work if if a tracking

753
00:25:53,509 --> 00:25:57,679
number is emitted that's the point which

754
00:25:55,669 --> 00:25:58,970
they can say the inventory has been has

755
00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:00,919
been shipped out so actually the

756
00:25:58,970 --> 00:26:03,110
inventory didn't move it was brought in

757
00:26:00,919 --> 00:26:04,429
to a truck into their facility they

758
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:06,199
signed some paperwork that said that we

759
00:26:04,429 --> 00:26:07,850
now own the inventory three days later

760
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:09,259
you bought it online they could still be

761
00:26:07,850 --> 00:26:10,519
sitting there in their in their factory

762
00:26:09,259 --> 00:26:12,409
but because they sent you a tracking

763
00:26:10,519 --> 00:26:13,879
number they realise the revenue and and

764
00:26:12,409 --> 00:26:17,210
so on so far so like this this is how

765
00:26:13,879 --> 00:26:20,149
sort of how much the outsourcing has has

766
00:26:17,210 --> 00:26:22,070
moved in terms of you know sort of the

767
00:26:20,149 --> 00:26:23,689
accounting cycle and why people want to

768
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:26,000
get rid of all the hardware it's not

769
00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:27,379
currently an apple like you know sitting

770
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,970
at eleven days worth of inventory in the

771
00:26:27,379 --> 00:26:30,709
industries it still at seventy days

772
00:26:28,970 --> 00:26:34,190
because people some people still own

773
00:26:30,710 --> 00:26:35,539
pick-and-place machines so there's a

774
00:26:34,190 --> 00:26:36,769
whole bunch of outsourcing that happen

775
00:26:35,539 --> 00:26:39,320
people want to get rid of all their

776
00:26:36,769 --> 00:26:40,639
hardware and in in 2001 there was a sort

777
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:43,279
of strange coincidence it's going back

778
00:26:40,639 --> 00:26:45,590
to the xbox hack I did I was sitting in

779
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:47,480
a IRC chatroom and we're pondering about

780
00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:49,730
how do we get these secret keys out and

781
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:51,289
literally there's like the question like

782
00:26:49,730 --> 00:26:51,860
does anyone here remember how to solder

783
00:26:51,289 --> 00:26:54,240
anymore

784
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:55,678
like we put those soldering irons

785
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:57,360
about a decade ago and we all went to

786
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:58,559
start our companies does anyone know how

787
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,939
to solder I like to raise my hand like

788
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:02,100
hey yeah I know how to solder I can I

789
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:03,900
can maybe come up with something and and

790
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:07,379
and that ended up leading to this hack

791
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:09,240
which led me to write a book which got

792
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:10,980
me a little bit of notoriety and then

793
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:12,929
there's this irony of I went to an

794
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:15,360
emerging technology conference because

795
00:27:12,929 --> 00:27:17,580
of the work I did there this in 2004

796
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:19,379
where they wanted me to tell people

797
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:23,850
about this emerging technology of

798
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:25,410
hardware hacking I'm like okay I mean

799
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:27,209
like I've been doing this all along it's

800
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:31,080
not really emerging you guys just forgot

801
00:27:27,210 --> 00:27:33,059
about it but in but you know a guy named

802
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:35,280
Dale Dougherty was at my talk in 2004

803
00:27:33,059 --> 00:27:36,510
and he says that this was one of the

804
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:38,820
talks he saw today on the floor that

805
00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:40,590
encouraged him to do you know the make

806
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:41,610
magazine which I need to the Maker Faire

807
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:44,340
which should have brought out the sort

808
00:27:41,610 --> 00:27:47,340
of this whole tight of like make demonym

809
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:50,070
whatever it is and then Maker Faire gets

810
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:51,600
big and goes to Shenzhen and then

811
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:52,919
there's this huge criticism that

812
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:55,949
happened in the first year in Shenzhen

813
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:57,660
that no this the Chinese there they're

814
00:27:55,950 --> 00:27:59,309
not real that it's too much like a trade

815
00:27:57,660 --> 00:28:01,380
show right like you know what's going on

816
00:27:59,309 --> 00:28:02,790
with this this maker you know Chinese

817
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:05,010
don't get maker they're just using as a

818
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:06,629
trade show that kind of thing and then

819
00:28:05,010 --> 00:28:08,879
you know I sit there and I'm like is

820
00:28:06,630 --> 00:28:10,679
this know is a tail not wagging the dog

821
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:12,240
now at this playing time that we're like

822
00:28:10,679 --> 00:28:14,370
criticizing you know the Chinese

823
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:17,400
ecosystem for not you know being maker

824
00:28:14,370 --> 00:28:20,760
enough and so and so just just to sort

825
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:21,960
of calibrate some expectations about for

826
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:24,350
the Shenzhen I'm going to spend a couple

827
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:27,480
slides just talking about the the area

828
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:31,050
this is a picture of electronics

829
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:32,130
district in Shenzhen and I guess a lot

830
00:28:31,050 --> 00:28:34,169
of people haven't been there yet but

831
00:28:32,130 --> 00:28:36,420
this is if you can see it these are like

832
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:37,830
tall buildings that go back for city

833
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:40,260
blocks and every single one of these

834
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:43,889
tall buildings is from like ground floor

835
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:46,379
to the spire full of companies are

836
00:28:43,890 --> 00:28:48,300
involved in hardware and little small

837
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:50,420
businesses like mom-and-pop businesses

838
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:52,950
they're involved in the trade design and

839
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:54,300
manufacture of hardware if you were to

840
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:56,160
go into one of the buildings this would

841
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:58,409
be a very typical scene yeah rows and

842
00:28:56,160 --> 00:29:00,570
rows of stalls like this and each of

843
00:28:58,410 --> 00:29:01,980
these little stalls is kind of like it's

844
00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:03,470
actually modeled on the old thing where

845
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:05,120
you would buy fish and

846
00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:07,070
and take a wet market a Chinese wet

847
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:08,870
market except people are now instead of

848
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:11,270
like hacking up pork they're hacking up

849
00:29:08,870 --> 00:29:13,219
iPhones and and they'll sell you parts

850
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:14,690
and stuff like that and and there's like

851
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:17,539
tens of thousands of these little stalls

852
00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:19,520
you can walk in there and you can just

853
00:29:17,539 --> 00:29:20,960
you know with five bucks walk out with

854
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:23,750
ten thousand resistors and go to

855
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:25,610
production whatever it is carry a tray

856
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:27,740
of chips whatever it is is these are all

857
00:29:25,610 --> 00:29:29,870
this is like sort of sort of the density

858
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:32,270
in the sort of the fecundity of it the

859
00:29:29,870 --> 00:29:33,620
ecosystem this is a very typical scene

860
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:35,750
there's a guy here with a bunch of

861
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:37,399
iPhones on his desk and he's just you

862
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:39,260
know fixing and reworking iPhones this

863
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:40,940
is not this is like not a thing that you

864
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:42,140
you you always imagine if you're gonna

865
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:43,580
work on an iPhone and be like in the

866
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:45,169
clean room because those things look so

867
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:47,480
immaculate where is this is this is

868
00:29:45,169 --> 00:29:49,850
actually what it looks like when people

869
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:51,409
work on that stuff out there and it's to

870
00:29:49,850 --> 00:29:53,120
the point where it is like literally in

871
00:29:51,409 --> 00:29:55,039
the street there's like use a little

872
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:56,928
mobile phone it's like pouring out of a

873
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:58,610
bag out into the street and people are

874
00:29:56,929 --> 00:30:00,260
in it's a waste and people are going

875
00:29:58,610 --> 00:30:02,510
into those things I'm pulling out parts

876
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:04,010
and figure out ways to recycle and we

877
00:30:02,510 --> 00:30:05,600
sell those bits and pieces so that's

878
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:09,049
that's kind of the the density of

879
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:10,399
electronics in that ecosystem and and it

880
00:30:09,049 --> 00:30:11,720
turns out that when you have that kind

881
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:13,610
of density of electronics you can

882
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:15,679
actually like dumpster dive for

883
00:30:13,610 --> 00:30:17,629
factories in that in it this is a this

884
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:20,210
is a picture I took while I was driving

885
00:30:17,630 --> 00:30:21,950
on the highway this is a SMT line that's

886
00:30:20,210 --> 00:30:24,140
on the back of a truck and they just

887
00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:26,299
sort of like put danger tape around it

888
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:30,049
to secure it to the truck piece whatever

889
00:30:26,299 --> 00:30:31,549
it's just an SMT line and it turns out

890
00:30:30,049 --> 00:30:33,559
that like you know if you think about it

891
00:30:31,549 --> 00:30:35,990
you know you know maybe rim width there

892
00:30:33,559 --> 00:30:38,418
you know 15 years ago put a million

893
00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:40,640
dollars in to buy on top of the line

894
00:30:38,419 --> 00:30:43,340
assembly equipment they got business

895
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:44,750
that gets sold a scrap for $100,000 he

896
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:46,610
was later the next guy goes a business

897
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:48,049
sells scrap for $10,000 and so now

898
00:30:46,610 --> 00:30:49,490
yeah these tiny little factories are

899
00:30:48,049 --> 00:30:51,280
picking up with things that could build

900
00:30:49,490 --> 00:30:54,799
mobile phones for like super super cheap

901
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:56,809
and turns out that when it's easy to

902
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:59,240
have a factory any one has a factory

903
00:30:56,809 --> 00:31:01,309
this is a picture of a vendor that I

904
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:03,200
actually was working with - I wrote a

905
00:31:01,309 --> 00:31:04,428
book about a guy to Shenzhen and on the

906
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:06,650
backside that I want to put these little

907
00:31:04,429 --> 00:31:07,820
card holders so you can put your samples

908
00:31:06,650 --> 00:31:11,179
and business cards and so I had to get

909
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:12,710
these custom sort of plastic sheets that

910
00:31:11,179 --> 00:31:14,179
were stamped and molded and so I

911
00:31:12,710 --> 00:31:15,960
actually went to the guys factory and

912
00:31:14,179 --> 00:31:17,640
it's like this old gentleman here owned

913
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:19,260
these machines and the young guy in the

914
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:20,900
front owns the printing presses and so

915
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:23,040
forth and so all these guys just have

916
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:25,320
factories and they just whatever you can

917
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:27,210
go into them and it'll eat it led me to

918
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:30,090
sort of like this insight that the

919
00:31:27,210 --> 00:31:31,830
difference between what we have here in

920
00:31:30,090 --> 00:31:34,290
America or in the West and what we have

921
00:31:31,830 --> 00:31:35,399
going on inside an area lection then is

922
00:31:34,290 --> 00:31:39,000
the difference between inventory and

923
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:40,380
capability so to a little illustrating a

924
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,660
bit more let's take the hypothetical

925
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:44,640
case that you want a USB cable and you

926
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:45,450
want to USB cable that's 1.8 meters long

927
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:47,700
exactly

928
00:31:45,450 --> 00:31:49,350
1.8 meters long for whatever reason and

929
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:50,880
you go into Best Buy or wherever it is

930
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:52,439
and you talk to the gentlemen you say

931
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:54,420
how I'd like to buy one point meter USB

932
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:56,490
cable it says well we have two meter USB

933
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:57,990
cables and one meter USB cables how how

934
00:31:56,490 --> 00:31:59,580
about you buy the two meter cable and

935
00:31:57,990 --> 00:32:01,110
just wrap up the little piece you don't

936
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:03,659
need put a little twist on it and call

937
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:06,179
it a notation like no I want a 1.8 meter

938
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:07,200
cable can you make one for me right and

939
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:09,360
the guy will look at you like you're

940
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:11,700
crazy and says I have inventory of 2

941
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:13,979
meter cables you should buy my inventory

942
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:16,110
right so it sits so basically your your

943
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:18,060
space of possibility is defined by what

944
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:19,800
this what the retailers have inventoried

945
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:21,270
are willing to sell you however if you

946
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:22,950
go to an ecosystem like Shenzhen you

947
00:32:21,270 --> 00:32:24,600
have people who have wrought wire and

948
00:32:22,950 --> 00:32:26,280
they have cable endings have this

949
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:28,230
machine here which is the overloading

950
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:30,720
machine and it cuts the cable me alone

951
00:32:28,230 --> 00:32:33,480
you know dial your pad you can punch in

952
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:34,590
1.8 they'll cut the cable length put the

953
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:36,150
moldings on the ends and you can have

954
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:37,709
your 1 point 8 meter Cape one point 8

955
00:32:36,150 --> 00:32:40,050
meter cable so this is a sort of

956
00:32:37,710 --> 00:32:41,700
ecosystem we can actually go to a guy

957
00:32:40,050 --> 00:32:43,530
and say like hi I want a one-play meter

958
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:45,540
cable I want to be blue I don't have

959
00:32:43,530 --> 00:32:47,010
these endings I want to do it ok sure

960
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:48,840
how many want like you want ok just a

961
00:32:47,010 --> 00:32:50,280
few okay come back tomorrow and we'll

962
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:52,620
have right so that's the difference

963
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:55,260
between an inventory ecosystem and a

964
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:58,080
capability ecosystem so this sort of

965
00:32:55,260 --> 00:33:01,290
notion that hardware's hard is part is

966
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:03,270
driven a lot in large part because the

967
00:33:01,290 --> 00:33:05,190
right tools aren't necessarily available

968
00:33:03,270 --> 00:33:07,190
for the job so this is a picture of

969
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:10,020
someone trying to pull off a BGA

970
00:33:07,190 --> 00:33:11,430
which is so VGA soldering and that sort

971
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:13,470
of thing right and and there's like

972
00:33:11,430 --> 00:33:14,520
blobs of solder and also our Stephon

973
00:33:13,470 --> 00:33:16,560
gonna have to do a lot of work on the

974
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:18,060
board to clean it up well you know how

975
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:20,970
do they remove BJ's in China well they

976
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:22,860
built these little CNC machines that you

977
00:33:20,970 --> 00:33:24,990
can put your motherboard into and

978
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:26,250
correct for a sort of de tilt of the

979
00:33:24,990 --> 00:33:27,900
board they just literally take a bit

980
00:33:26,250 --> 00:33:28,720
down and they mill out this the chip

981
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:30,190
because it was a bad

982
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:32,620
Schiff anyways why did you want to one

983
00:33:30,190 --> 00:33:34,270
save it right and they mail out the chip

984
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:35,469
and you're left with like a clean they

985
00:33:34,270 --> 00:33:36,760
mail it just to the point where the

986
00:33:35,470 --> 00:33:38,170
solder balls are visible so you now have

987
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:40,060
the old solder those there you don't

988
00:33:38,170 --> 00:33:41,590
even have to stencil on you solder and

989
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:43,240
you just put the new chip on top and you

990
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:44,860
go ahead and you Denny refloat so it's

991
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:46,360
like it's like it's actually a pretty

992
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:49,659
cool machine to watch if you can check

993
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:50,889
out the YouTube video on it that's you

994
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:52,930
know if you have the right tools it's

995
00:33:50,890 --> 00:33:55,180
not that bad you just have to have that

996
00:33:52,930 --> 00:33:56,560
tool or another example is like if you

997
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:58,210
have your phone and you broke your

998
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:59,590
screen people say oh I broke my screen

999
00:33:58,210 --> 00:34:00,850
actually you didn't break your screen

1000
00:33:59,590 --> 00:34:02,830
you broke a touchscreen right if you

1001
00:34:00,850 --> 00:34:05,110
notice like the screens actually okay

1002
00:34:02,830 --> 00:34:06,730
most of the time 99% of time you broke

1003
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:07,990
on the touchscreen when you go ahead and

1004
00:34:06,730 --> 00:34:09,190
replace it they want to charge like two

1005
00:34:07,990 --> 00:34:10,960
hundred bucks because they're gonna sell

1006
00:34:09,190 --> 00:34:12,610
you another perfectly good screen to go

1007
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:14,889
with your five dollar piece of glass it

1008
00:34:12,610 --> 00:34:16,480
was on the touchscreen well now they're

1009
00:34:14,889 --> 00:34:16,989
you know you don't waste any part of the

1010
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,340
cow

1011
00:34:16,989 --> 00:34:20,589
you also don't waste any part of the

1012
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:22,300
phone you know if you go to China they

1013
00:34:20,590 --> 00:34:23,980
have these machines that is this is a

1014
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:25,390
heated back in chuck plate you put the

1015
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:26,620
screen down it heats it up to the point

1016
00:34:25,389 --> 00:34:27,909
where the heats of the soft you have

1017
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:29,139
these things that look like nunchucks I

1018
00:34:27,909 --> 00:34:31,659
have a wire on it and you pulled across

1019
00:34:29,139 --> 00:34:34,810
and it splits the adhesive off between

1020
00:34:31,659 --> 00:34:36,699
the the LCD and the touchscreen and then

1021
00:34:34,810 --> 00:34:39,310
now you have this you know sort of

1022
00:34:36,699 --> 00:34:40,960
screen you have to bond your your LCD on

1023
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:42,580
top and they're Lea little bubbles

1024
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:45,040
inside of it so they have this little

1025
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:46,960
vacuum chamber you can put it into that

1026
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:48,759
pulls out the air and then voila you

1027
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:51,040
have for five dollars even now have

1028
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:52,660
fixed your touch screen on your on your

1029
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:54,279
on your phone and it's and it's because

1030
00:34:52,659 --> 00:34:55,569
they have like this sort of the right

1031
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:57,280
the client pull right you equipment you

1032
00:34:55,570 --> 00:34:59,050
can these are these are things you can

1033
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:00,370
go to those markets I was showing you

1034
00:34:59,050 --> 00:35:02,530
before you just buy it cash and carry

1035
00:35:00,370 --> 00:35:03,970
like it's like 30 bucks for the screen

1036
00:35:02,530 --> 00:35:05,590
mover and like a hundred bucks for the

1037
00:35:03,970 --> 00:35:07,089
vacuum TV or something like this cheaper

1038
00:35:05,590 --> 00:35:10,960
than buying the whole assembly together

1039
00:35:07,090 --> 00:35:13,960
with anyways so one other thing is this

1040
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:15,820
like another example so chip on board if

1041
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:17,830
you've looked at the backside of some

1042
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:20,020
circuit boards you have like these black

1043
00:35:17,830 --> 00:35:22,150
blobs of epoxy they're not actually

1044
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:25,270
chips the black blobs of epoxy those

1045
00:35:22,150 --> 00:35:26,890
blobs of epoxy are covering an actual

1046
00:35:25,270 --> 00:35:28,120
silicon chip that's unbonded directly to

1047
00:35:26,890 --> 00:35:30,580
the board with little wires that go to

1048
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:32,830
it and this is this is done to save

1049
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:34,600
costs because packages are expensive

1050
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:36,790
right so if the super super low end of

1051
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:39,279
things they do this to save cost and if

1052
00:35:36,790 --> 00:35:41,259
you try to do wire bonding in the United

1053
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:42,400
States it's super super expensive but

1054
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:43,720
then if you do it out there

1055
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:46,809
it's really cheap and sort of the secret

1056
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:50,230
to it is that if I can get this video to

1057
00:35:46,809 --> 00:35:53,079
play is that they have humans that just

1058
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:54,490
go ahead and take the chips and put them

1059
00:35:53,079 --> 00:35:56,529
on to the board before they do the wire

1060
00:35:54,490 --> 00:35:57,669
bonding right it's and if you can see

1061
00:35:56,529 --> 00:36:00,490
here there's actually literally a pair

1062
00:35:57,670 --> 00:36:02,079
of chopsticks and part of a it this is a

1063
00:36:00,490 --> 00:36:03,879
box cutting blade it's actually not even

1064
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:04,960
like in what they did is they just

1065
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:06,700
wrapped it in tape so they don't cut

1066
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:07,990
themselves when they use it and they and

1067
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:09,819
they go ahead and they slice off the

1068
00:36:07,990 --> 00:36:11,169
chopstick to the right angle and it has

1069
00:36:09,819 --> 00:36:12,609
enough surface tension that it can serve

1070
00:36:11,170 --> 00:36:14,589
like you know pick and place them onto

1071
00:36:12,609 --> 00:36:16,029
the board and that sort of thing

1072
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:18,069
and so a lot of people I show this to

1073
00:36:16,029 --> 00:36:19,690
people and people go like like what it's

1074
00:36:18,069 --> 00:36:21,880
not all done by robots

1075
00:36:19,690 --> 00:36:23,890
I mean freaking Tony Stark has a robot

1076
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:26,770
to put his robot armor on so like why

1077
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:29,379
don't we have like you know robots doing

1078
00:36:26,770 --> 00:36:30,970
this sort of thing in terms of that you

1079
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:32,109
know manual skills are still skilled

1080
00:36:30,970 --> 00:36:34,868
with you know this is another this is

1081
00:36:32,109 --> 00:36:39,160
another picture of a woman who's

1082
00:36:34,869 --> 00:36:40,990
building prototypes for for me and she's

1083
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:42,220
just taking BGA's and putting them onto

1084
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:44,589
the board by hand she just sort of

1085
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:45,879
sticks it down looks at it and then puts

1086
00:36:44,589 --> 00:36:48,520
into the BJ down sort of nonchalantly

1087
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:50,589
and I and before I actually saw this

1088
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:53,288
with my own two eyes I was like there's

1089
00:36:50,589 --> 00:36:54,940
no way right this is not something a

1090
00:36:53,289 --> 00:36:57,250
human can do and then and then I was

1091
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:58,869
like okay maybe I should try it right

1092
00:36:57,250 --> 00:37:00,819
and I try it it's actually she's

1093
00:36:58,869 --> 00:37:03,609
surprisingly easy to do it's not so hard

1094
00:37:00,819 --> 00:37:07,630
to put BJ's on and to reflow them down

1095
00:37:03,609 --> 00:37:09,038
and so you know not everything has to be

1096
00:37:07,630 --> 00:37:12,369
done by robots a lot of it can be done

1097
00:37:09,039 --> 00:37:14,740
by humans and having this big huge base

1098
00:37:12,369 --> 00:37:16,809
of people who can do stuff is really

1099
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:19,058
important to create a diverse ecosystem

1100
00:37:16,809 --> 00:37:20,890
so if you look at sort of the sort of

1101
00:37:19,059 --> 00:37:23,829
ecosystem in China it started as a bunch

1102
00:37:20,890 --> 00:37:25,299
of raindrops right billion the people of

1103
00:37:23,829 --> 00:37:26,799
one percent of them went to go work as

1104
00:37:25,299 --> 00:37:29,049
assembly laborers who then became

1105
00:37:26,799 --> 00:37:30,490
technicians and engineers one percent of

1106
00:37:29,049 --> 00:37:31,930
them become managers and designers and

1107
00:37:30,490 --> 00:37:33,729
then now today we're looking at like oh

1108
00:37:31,930 --> 00:37:35,470
my god where did show me in Penson and

1109
00:37:33,730 --> 00:37:38,140
Taba and Alibaba came came up nowhere

1110
00:37:35,470 --> 00:37:39,848
right you know this is crazy China it's

1111
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:42,180
just that they have this enormous

1112
00:37:39,849 --> 00:37:44,890
ecosystem of people to support this

1113
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:46,480
capability whereas what happened if you

1114
00:37:44,890 --> 00:37:48,279
would look at analogous timeline in the

1115
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:49,839
United States he had these engineers who

1116
00:37:48,279 --> 00:37:51,339
we invested a lot of money in a cold war

1117
00:37:49,839 --> 00:37:53,980
to create cuz we had to fight you know

1118
00:37:51,339 --> 00:37:56,500
the evil Russian powers or wherever it

1119
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:58,120
is and they built amazing things we

1120
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:59,470
and you know people to the moon and

1121
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:01,000
stuff like this and then the dot-com

1122
00:37:59,470 --> 00:38:02,230
boom happened and we're like well screw

1123
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,940
the soldering irons we're gonna go and

1124
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:05,830
make money you know selling computers

1125
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:07,840
and there's this sort of like decade of

1126
00:38:05,830 --> 00:38:09,700
where we tried really hard to push

1127
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:11,290
everything to China and then we you know

1128
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:14,290
sort of this rediscovery of the maker

1129
00:38:11,290 --> 00:38:16,990
movement happening and people say like a

1130
00:38:14,290 --> 00:38:18,310
hard word it's hard but it turns out

1131
00:38:16,990 --> 00:38:21,490
that actually it's not hardly the right

1132
00:38:18,310 --> 00:38:23,440
ecosystem so these wonderful phones that

1133
00:38:21,490 --> 00:38:25,270
you see we we oftentimes focus on the

1134
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:26,950
system integrator like an apple or a

1135
00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:29,320
Foxconn or something event we think that

1136
00:38:26,950 --> 00:38:31,569
yeah Apple makes the phone of Foxconn

1137
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:34,000
makes the phone actually Foxconn puts

1138
00:38:31,570 --> 00:38:35,860
the phone together right the and maybe

1139
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,090
they put the parts on the board but like

1140
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:38,380
you know there's people who do the metal

1141
00:38:37,090 --> 00:38:40,300
stamping for them people who do the

1142
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:41,860
injection molding people who do the test

1143
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:46,180
jig people do all these different pieces

1144
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:48,250
is a huge network of factories that feed

1145
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:50,980
into it that go through sort of that

1146
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:54,280
traded district of electronics area to

1147
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:56,620
feed the the factory to go ahead and do

1148
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:58,480
these sorts of things and so you need to

1149
00:38:56,620 --> 00:39:01,390
have that sort of rich mulch just to

1150
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:03,430
have a you know a healthy forest at the

1151
00:39:01,390 --> 00:39:05,799
end of day now the problem with

1152
00:39:03,430 --> 00:39:08,080
ecosystem losses that is that if you are

1153
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:10,450
in an ecosystem that's lost capability

1154
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:11,890
you can't even describe what things look

1155
00:39:10,450 --> 00:39:13,210
like so you know what good job what do

1156
00:39:11,890 --> 00:39:14,859
dinosaurs look like they've been extinct

1157
00:39:13,210 --> 00:39:17,110
for a long time a lot of time long time

1158
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:18,520
we thought they were scaly creatures but

1159
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:20,350
maybe actually they have feathers right

1160
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:22,450
we don't know we actually can't even

1161
00:39:20,350 --> 00:39:23,920
draw what a dinosaur looks like we can't

1162
00:39:22,450 --> 00:39:25,120
we all have the canonical thing that we

1163
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:26,590
think it looks like these are Jurassic

1164
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:28,600
Park but that may can be completely

1165
00:39:26,590 --> 00:39:30,130
detached from the reality but actually

1166
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:32,589
did the dinosaurs work or for example

1167
00:39:30,130 --> 00:39:34,420
like you know dodo birds right here's a

1168
00:39:32,590 --> 00:39:36,310
picture which one of these birds is the

1169
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:38,230
dodo bird right we haven't seen a dodo

1170
00:39:36,310 --> 00:39:39,970
bird in years we don't know which one a

1171
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:41,410
dodo bird it is turns out the one on the

1172
00:39:39,970 --> 00:39:42,490
left is the dodo bird but a lot of

1173
00:39:41,410 --> 00:39:46,480
people think it's the one on the right

1174
00:39:42,490 --> 00:39:47,770
and so and so ultimately the issue is

1175
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:49,060
ecosystem us in it for the situation

1176
00:39:47,770 --> 00:39:50,230
here is like well of course everything's

1177
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:52,120
done by robots because that's what we

1178
00:39:50,230 --> 00:39:53,230
see in the movies and that's our

1179
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:54,670
impression of how things should be done

1180
00:39:53,230 --> 00:39:55,900
and therefore like you know hardware is

1181
00:39:54,670 --> 00:39:57,850
hard we don't have the robots whatever

1182
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:59,980
it is and it's actually you just need to

1183
00:39:57,850 --> 00:40:01,480
sort of practice and get your skills up

1184
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:02,890
and you can you can you can do it

1185
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:04,390
and of course the other problem of

1186
00:40:02,890 --> 00:40:06,819
ecosystem loss is a few people who are

1187
00:40:04,390 --> 00:40:08,859
playing in the area can go ahead and

1188
00:40:06,819 --> 00:40:11,049
create a monopoly around it and create

1189
00:40:08,859 --> 00:40:14,679
further barriers for people to go ahead

1190
00:40:11,049 --> 00:40:17,829
and even get started so but despite all

1191
00:40:14,679 --> 00:40:19,179
that the really good news for people who

1192
00:40:17,829 --> 00:40:21,309
want to get into hardware is that

1193
00:40:19,179 --> 00:40:24,189
however kind of doesn't change physics

1194
00:40:21,309 --> 00:40:27,130
hasn't changed since a very very long

1195
00:40:24,189 --> 00:40:29,529
time there's no like physics 2.0 that

1196
00:40:27,130 --> 00:40:31,719
has forced me to go ahead and reformat

1197
00:40:29,529 --> 00:40:33,219
my oscilloscope and my soldering iron

1198
00:40:31,719 --> 00:40:34,869
and I have to like throw it all the way

1199
00:40:33,219 --> 00:40:41,079
because I'm not compatible new physics

1200
00:40:34,869 --> 00:40:42,759
ABI and you know humans which is the

1201
00:40:41,079 --> 00:40:44,589
other half of why we build hardware they

1202
00:40:42,759 --> 00:40:46,779
also haven't changed fundamentally I

1203
00:40:44,589 --> 00:40:49,089
mean we you know we store two arms and

1204
00:40:46,779 --> 00:40:51,429
two legs and we have our desires in our

1205
00:40:49,089 --> 00:40:53,288
in our fears and so the good news is if

1206
00:40:51,429 --> 00:40:54,549
you consider you know the study of

1207
00:40:53,289 --> 00:40:55,989
hardware and how it interacts with

1208
00:40:54,549 --> 00:40:57,009
humans is there's a there's a limit of

1209
00:40:55,989 --> 00:40:58,630
space of things you actually have to

1210
00:40:57,009 --> 00:41:00,819
learn and it's it's cumulative it just

1211
00:40:58,630 --> 00:41:02,109
goes up so like if you look at the

1212
00:41:00,819 --> 00:41:04,919
programming language I've had to learn

1213
00:41:02,109 --> 00:41:07,749
write basic C assembly of various layers

1214
00:41:04,919 --> 00:41:10,089
assembly of various flavors C++ Pascal

1215
00:41:07,749 --> 00:41:11,439
Perl Java Python JavaScript rustboro

1216
00:41:10,089 --> 00:41:13,419
obvious you've asked oh yeah it just

1217
00:41:11,439 --> 00:41:15,489
goes on and on it so it seems like every

1218
00:41:13,419 --> 00:41:17,140
freaking year I turn around second

1219
00:41:15,489 --> 00:41:18,579
another framework that I have to learn

1220
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:21,219
another language like that what are the

1221
00:41:18,579 --> 00:41:22,959
cool kids doing today you know the

1222
00:41:21,219 --> 00:41:24,640
equations I had to learn for hardware I

1223
00:41:22,959 --> 00:41:26,259
learned in college and they haven't

1224
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:27,969
changed as Maxwell's equations I

1225
00:41:26,259 --> 00:41:29,349
actually had this compressed down to

1226
00:41:27,969 --> 00:41:31,749
just Maxwell's and ficks first love I

1227
00:41:29,349 --> 00:41:33,069
said be generous and then like Maxwell's

1228
00:41:31,749 --> 00:41:36,428
it's four equations Gauss's law

1229
00:41:33,069 --> 00:41:38,140
Faraday's law you learned those and the

1230
00:41:36,429 --> 00:41:39,489
it turns out Ohm's law and Kirchhoff's

1231
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:41,169
current law just derivatives of

1232
00:41:39,489 --> 00:41:44,650
Maxwell's and ficks first law which

1233
00:41:41,169 --> 00:41:47,049
teaches how carriers diffused through

1234
00:41:44,650 --> 00:41:48,189
silicon and so you you learn those two

1235
00:41:47,049 --> 00:41:49,659
things together now you know how to

1236
00:41:48,189 --> 00:41:51,549
transistor works and then everything

1237
00:41:49,659 --> 00:41:53,019
builds up from there right you just it's

1238
00:41:51,549 --> 00:41:54,729
hard to learn those things but once you

1239
00:41:53,019 --> 00:41:57,098
learn them they've served me for my

1240
00:41:54,729 --> 00:42:00,098
entire life I had there's no Maxwell 2.0

1241
00:41:57,099 --> 00:42:02,079
there's no you know things that change

1242
00:42:00,099 --> 00:42:03,519
on these sorts of things and so like you

1243
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:05,109
know also the hardware tools I had to

1244
00:42:03,519 --> 00:42:07,899
learn hasn't really changed much either

1245
00:42:05,109 --> 00:42:10,779
like software tools it's like in a day

1246
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:14,739
systemd busybox openembedded make pip

1247
00:42:10,779 --> 00:42:16,599
app Kondo dr. Jenkins Travis github all

1248
00:42:14,739 --> 00:42:19,059
the all these different frameworks like

1249
00:42:16,599 --> 00:42:20,470
you know I can't even keep track of the

1250
00:42:19,059 --> 00:42:23,260
frameworks that I have to learn

1251
00:42:20,470 --> 00:42:24,910
to keep a simple web server running

1252
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:27,220
these days right it seems like like

1253
00:42:24,910 --> 00:42:28,990
every every year I all I want is I want

1254
00:42:27,220 --> 00:42:30,669
to have a web page that shows some

1255
00:42:28,990 --> 00:42:32,049
static content or something and I'm

1256
00:42:30,670 --> 00:42:35,080
constantly having to go back and take

1257
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:37,180
care of that thing you know Harvard

1258
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:40,299
tools I learned how to solder I learned

1259
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:41,589
a hot air gun that's basically the tools

1260
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:43,869
you have to learn and learn how to use

1261
00:42:41,590 --> 00:42:45,190
them well I got generous and said yo so

1262
00:42:43,869 --> 00:42:46,810
you know how to use a microscope an

1263
00:42:45,190 --> 00:42:49,060
oscilloscope and a spectrum analyzer and

1264
00:42:46,810 --> 00:42:51,460
that's kind of like it for the actual

1265
00:42:49,060 --> 00:42:52,660
bench tools and then if you want to

1266
00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:54,070
actually design the hardware and some

1267
00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:56,049
software packages you need to know and

1268
00:42:54,070 --> 00:42:57,490
those things are surprising stable too

1269
00:42:56,050 --> 00:42:59,260
so when you're designing pick your pick

1270
00:42:57,490 --> 00:43:02,529
your poison Altium ego whatever it is

1271
00:42:59,260 --> 00:43:03,760
but it's not like you know Altium isn't

1272
00:43:02,530 --> 00:43:05,020
good enough and you have to switch it so

1273
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:05,950
all these different packages you pick

1274
00:43:05,020 --> 00:43:07,570
when you stay with it and they're good

1275
00:43:05,950 --> 00:43:09,399
enough for you to go with SolidWorks for

1276
00:43:07,570 --> 00:43:10,780
3d design if you want to do actual

1277
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:12,310
silicon design maybe there's cadence

1278
00:43:10,780 --> 00:43:14,920
magic and synopsis and that's that's

1279
00:43:12,310 --> 00:43:16,570
like it like I've kind of described the

1280
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:19,090
world of hardware tools that you've had

1281
00:43:16,570 --> 00:43:20,200
to learn so it may be a little bit

1282
00:43:19,090 --> 00:43:21,670
difficult the learning curve may be

1283
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:23,770
little bit hard but once you walk up the

1284
00:43:21,670 --> 00:43:25,180
curve you actually get up the mountain

1285
00:43:23,770 --> 00:43:35,230
so it's you know hardware might be hard

1286
00:43:25,180 --> 00:43:37,390
beliefs is not specific right you know

1287
00:43:35,230 --> 00:43:39,280
the old story of Sisyphus where he's

1288
00:43:37,390 --> 00:43:40,720
cursed to carry up a rock to the top of

1289
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:42,040
a hill only to watch it roll down again

1290
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:43,149
that's what I feel like every single

1291
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:46,210
time we have to learn a software

1292
00:43:43,150 --> 00:43:47,710
framework at least when I you know do my

1293
00:43:46,210 --> 00:43:49,810
hardware stuff I'm like okay today I'm

1294
00:43:47,710 --> 00:43:52,839
going to learn how to revolve EGA you

1295
00:43:49,810 --> 00:43:55,509
know that I did that took me a day and a

1296
00:43:52,839 --> 00:43:56,890
few bad BGA's and now I know how to reap

1297
00:43:55,510 --> 00:43:59,550
all of EJ it hasn't changed

1298
00:43:56,890 --> 00:44:01,810
maybe Jay can do it again 10 years later

1299
00:43:59,550 --> 00:44:03,550
so getting started the basics is

1300
00:44:01,810 --> 00:44:05,710
surprisingly cheap this is a snapshot of

1301
00:44:03,550 --> 00:44:08,080
my workbench my wonderfully messy

1302
00:44:05,710 --> 00:44:09,940
workbench in Singapore basically

1303
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:12,790
everything in that in that photograph I

1304
00:44:09,940 --> 00:44:14,470
got on a trip to Shenzhen put it into my

1305
00:44:12,790 --> 00:44:17,140
suitcase and checked it and carried it

1306
00:44:14,470 --> 00:44:19,270
for about 500 bucks including the

1307
00:44:17,140 --> 00:44:20,410
microscope the hot-air gun so that's the

1308
00:44:19,270 --> 00:44:22,480
microscope the hot-air gun

1309
00:44:20,410 --> 00:44:24,399
soldering iron there's a little hot air

1310
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:26,500
plate that I used to serve as cheap mode

1311
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:28,030
this one here is expensive this is a

1312
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:29,589
multimeter but that's because I really

1313
00:44:28,030 --> 00:44:31,839
like lots of digits of precision of my

1314
00:44:29,589 --> 00:44:34,770
multimeter you don't need five digits of

1315
00:44:31,839 --> 00:44:37,390
precision it's just I have an obsession

1316
00:44:34,770 --> 00:44:38,470
with very precise measurements there's

1317
00:44:37,390 --> 00:44:40,779
some cool things you can do with it talk

1318
00:44:38,470 --> 00:44:42,459
to me later but you know we that's this

1319
00:44:40,780 --> 00:44:47,830
that's that's that's for me to sort of

1320
00:44:42,460 --> 00:44:49,060
my porn so so and then getting him

1321
00:44:47,830 --> 00:44:50,200
started in hardware so you want to sort

1322
00:44:49,060 --> 00:44:51,610
of start playing on stuff

1323
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:53,259
dumpster-diving is a really good way to

1324
00:44:51,610 --> 00:44:55,000
get your hand on things and of course as

1325
00:44:53,260 --> 00:44:57,640
I alluded to in China it's very easy but

1326
00:44:55,000 --> 00:45:00,640
there's facilities and in this ecosystem

1327
00:44:57,640 --> 00:45:03,609
like eBay and Craigslist to have lots of

1328
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:05,770
stuff you can equipment you can buy plus

1329
00:45:03,610 --> 00:45:07,630
local universities and institutions tend

1330
00:45:05,770 --> 00:45:11,200
to throw a lot of really amazingly good

1331
00:45:07,630 --> 00:45:13,600
stuff um you know when I was at MIT I

1332
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:14,560
would sort of routinely cruise the reuse

1333
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:15,700
lists where they would throw away

1334
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:18,640
equipment and you would get like

1335
00:45:15,700 --> 00:45:20,169
top-notch you know multimeters and and

1336
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:21,910
soldering irons to the lab just a the

1337
00:45:20,170 --> 00:45:23,770
grad student graduated left the

1338
00:45:21,910 --> 00:45:24,460
equipment behind and now they're

1339
00:45:23,770 --> 00:45:26,470
throwing it away

1340
00:45:24,460 --> 00:45:29,260
so guess what like you you can you can

1341
00:45:26,470 --> 00:45:30,910
have it too so the dumpster-diving cycle

1342
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:33,280
basically is this virtual cycle you get

1343
00:45:30,910 --> 00:45:34,750
equipment you fix the equipment you

1344
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:36,790
learn how to use the equipment right

1345
00:45:34,750 --> 00:45:38,470
then you get more equipment that might

1346
00:45:36,790 --> 00:45:39,700
be a little bit harder but then it may

1347
00:45:38,470 --> 00:45:41,140
be a little bit barks you fix the

1348
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:42,310
equipment and now you can use the

1349
00:45:41,140 --> 00:45:45,100
equipment to fix even better equipment

1350
00:45:42,310 --> 00:45:46,240
and so in again it's it wraps up it's

1351
00:45:45,100 --> 00:45:47,650
not like an investment that goes away

1352
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:49,569
it's not like I'm going to write a

1353
00:45:47,650 --> 00:45:50,890
framework to make another framework to

1354
00:45:49,570 --> 00:45:52,840
do another framework and then someone

1355
00:45:50,890 --> 00:45:54,850
tells you oh we left those frameworks

1356
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:57,220
behind a long time ago it's now the cool

1357
00:45:54,850 --> 00:46:00,250
thing is now whatever distro they you

1358
00:45:57,220 --> 00:46:02,439
know pick you know today so it does

1359
00:46:00,250 --> 00:46:03,610
ratchet up and also in the process of

1360
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:05,890
fixing things you can learn through

1361
00:46:03,610 --> 00:46:07,330
reverse engineering so this is my blog

1362
00:46:05,890 --> 00:46:08,950
for nice news comment about a

1363
00:46:07,330 --> 00:46:11,170
competition called name that we're and

1364
00:46:08,950 --> 00:46:13,299
the reason why I do that as I want to

1365
00:46:11,170 --> 00:46:15,370
people to encourage people to look at

1366
00:46:13,300 --> 00:46:17,080
hardware people say how do you get

1367
00:46:15,370 --> 00:46:18,370
started and hire it seem so hard the

1368
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:20,110
first thing you do is just look at it

1369
00:46:18,370 --> 00:46:21,250
right I mean there's there patterns you

1370
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:22,330
can learn those things that are really

1371
00:46:21,250 --> 00:46:23,830
interesting things you can get out of it

1372
00:46:22,330 --> 00:46:26,650
you may not understand it today but

1373
00:46:23,830 --> 00:46:29,049
because the the themes the motifs are

1374
00:46:26,650 --> 00:46:31,240
consistent if you get those those

1375
00:46:29,050 --> 00:46:32,170
patterns in your head when you see

1376
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:33,640
something's different

1377
00:46:32,170 --> 00:46:35,470
you have your eyes drawn to and you say

1378
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:37,690
why so like you know there's this really

1379
00:46:35,470 --> 00:46:38,830
weird white thing sticking out here this

1380
00:46:37,690 --> 00:46:40,820
is actually a picture of the inside of

1381
00:46:38,830 --> 00:46:43,340
my five digit multimeter

1382
00:46:40,820 --> 00:46:45,350
and and that's that that is that is the

1383
00:46:43,340 --> 00:46:48,440
that's the really ultra high position

1384
00:46:45,350 --> 00:46:51,080
resistor they use for for setting as a

1385
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:52,490
reference standard for for for the

1386
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:54,200
measurements and so and so you see

1387
00:46:52,490 --> 00:46:55,310
you're drawn to these things you look it

1388
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:56,509
up and you learn about these things you

1389
00:46:55,310 --> 00:46:58,880
say oh that's a really cool technique

1390
00:46:56,510 --> 00:47:00,080
that's how they do it and then now it's

1391
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:01,100
another little fact you putting your

1392
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:03,080
head you hang it in the tree and it

1393
00:47:01,100 --> 00:47:05,509
stays there and it doesn't have to go

1394
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:07,400
away or go bad the next thing is there's

1395
00:47:05,510 --> 00:47:08,900
the fear of failure right people often

1396
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:11,090
like but what if I break it right what

1397
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:12,800
if I avoid the warranty what if I you

1398
00:47:11,090 --> 00:47:14,870
know this sort of stuff thing is the

1399
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:17,060
truth is I break hardware all the

1400
00:47:14,870 --> 00:47:19,670
freaking time right so if I'm gonna hack

1401
00:47:17,060 --> 00:47:21,740
something my rule is I get one to break

1402
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:24,470
when a hack and one to test right and so

1403
00:47:21,740 --> 00:47:25,970
you you want to get a piece of hardware

1404
00:47:24,470 --> 00:47:27,859
that you can just completely trash take

1405
00:47:25,970 --> 00:47:29,870
all the parts off whatever it is at the

1406
00:47:27,860 --> 00:47:31,880
other day so if I'm gonna hack a phone

1407
00:47:29,870 --> 00:47:34,310
or something like this I'll go to ebay

1408
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:35,870
find a broken one and then I'll just

1409
00:47:34,310 --> 00:47:37,940
start taking the parts off like you know

1410
00:47:35,870 --> 00:47:39,920
where you know where are the parts that

1411
00:47:37,940 --> 00:47:42,680
I shouldn't be putting my probes that

1412
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:44,420
would break things right later on down

1413
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:46,069
the road oftentimes all you need is just

1414
00:47:44,420 --> 00:47:47,630
one sample like that and you just you

1415
00:47:46,070 --> 00:47:49,850
just completely trash it right you learn

1416
00:47:47,630 --> 00:47:52,190
a lot doing that so now you now that

1417
00:47:49,850 --> 00:47:53,420
you've you've learned what not to do you

1418
00:47:52,190 --> 00:47:55,550
get the piece that you actually do the

1419
00:47:53,420 --> 00:47:57,620
hat on right so this is back to that

1420
00:47:55,550 --> 00:47:59,090
piece of it where I installed that that

1421
00:47:57,620 --> 00:48:00,920
motherboard it that there the tap board

1422
00:47:59,090 --> 00:48:03,110
inside the Xbox so when I had the Xbox I

1423
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:05,090
had one Xbox from a broken one that I

1424
00:48:03,110 --> 00:48:06,890
took all the parts off of this or figure

1425
00:48:05,090 --> 00:48:08,270
out and I measured where the trace pitch

1426
00:48:06,890 --> 00:48:11,390
was and then all I had to do is build

1427
00:48:08,270 --> 00:48:13,910
one on the Xbox I actually had a kit and

1428
00:48:11,390 --> 00:48:15,920
then I could always find a friend's Xbox

1429
00:48:13,910 --> 00:48:17,750
to just check to make sure things are

1430
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:19,250
going well if things weren't working on

1431
00:48:17,750 --> 00:48:20,600
my side so and it's important to have

1432
00:48:19,250 --> 00:48:21,740
one to check because you know a lot of

1433
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:23,960
times it's easy for you to think that

1434
00:48:21,740 --> 00:48:24,919
you're crazy or you're not you're not

1435
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:27,350
thinking straight you just wanna say

1436
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:29,180
okay is it working or is it just me

1437
00:48:27,350 --> 00:48:31,009
right and so there's a rule of freeze

1438
00:48:29,180 --> 00:48:33,259
for hacking one to break so serve

1439
00:48:31,010 --> 00:48:35,120
minimize that fear of failure the fear

1440
00:48:33,260 --> 00:48:36,470
of loss when the hack we do the

1441
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:38,359
experimentation on and when to check

1442
00:48:36,470 --> 00:48:40,850
sort of the base a baseline to ground

1443
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:43,940
your experiments for making there's a

1444
00:48:40,850 --> 00:48:45,860
kind of a similar pattern to it so you

1445
00:48:43,940 --> 00:48:48,560
know you look at a phone you take it

1446
00:48:45,860 --> 00:48:50,720
apart like wow it's like so immaculate

1447
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:53,509
and put together and so perfect like it

1448
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:54,379
seems impossible to build these things

1449
00:48:53,510 --> 00:48:56,480
of such complex

1450
00:48:54,380 --> 00:48:58,640
it turns out they it's a multi-stage

1451
00:48:56,480 --> 00:49:00,530
process two phones start not as tiny

1452
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:02,029
little phones they started really big

1453
00:49:00,530 --> 00:49:04,040
boards this is an example of a qualcomm

1454
00:49:02,030 --> 00:49:06,500
dev works this is just a bezel with the

1455
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:09,200
screen right and then this is the actual

1456
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:10,490
CPU that's on a card you can swap in and

1457
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:11,750
out in case you break it or something

1458
00:49:10,490 --> 00:49:13,790
like this or you want to change it to

1459
00:49:11,750 --> 00:49:15,590
another one and you have this huge array

1460
00:49:13,790 --> 00:49:17,660
of connectors for yourself to plug in

1461
00:49:15,590 --> 00:49:19,940
diagnostics and peripherals and all that

1462
00:49:17,660 --> 00:49:21,740
sort of stuff so you know there's a

1463
00:49:19,940 --> 00:49:24,410
multi-stage process to making these

1464
00:49:21,740 --> 00:49:26,990
complicated things as well there's a in

1465
00:49:24,410 --> 00:49:30,890
the industry there's a terminology for

1466
00:49:26,990 --> 00:49:33,319
it the EBT dbt pvt process so B T stands

1467
00:49:30,890 --> 00:49:35,180
for valuation test the e is engineering

1468
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:38,000
so the first step is does it catch fire

1469
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:39,740
right if it doesn't catch fire then you

1470
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:41,930
have a design and say it does design

1471
00:49:39,740 --> 00:49:43,549
meet our requirements right it meets

1472
00:49:41,930 --> 00:49:45,290
requirements great let's try to produce

1473
00:49:43,550 --> 00:49:48,410
it does it yield right that's sort of

1474
00:49:45,290 --> 00:49:50,210
the three basic stages and the

1475
00:49:48,410 --> 00:49:53,120
observation is that like the build

1476
00:49:50,210 --> 00:49:54,830
materials stays 80% the same through all

1477
00:49:53,120 --> 00:49:57,319
of stages ideally and hopefully you're

1478
00:49:54,830 --> 00:49:58,670
not like you know at stage two in a

1479
00:49:57,320 --> 00:50:00,620
product manager comes in this is

1480
00:49:58,670 --> 00:50:02,650
actually we need to like put up you know

1481
00:50:00,620 --> 00:50:05,270
a coffee maker inside your phone so now

1482
00:50:02,650 --> 00:50:08,000
great throw everything away start over

1483
00:50:05,270 --> 00:50:11,360
again so that accepting you know sort of

1484
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:13,010
Dilbert mode sort of changes things

1485
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:16,220
don't change too much so usually what

1486
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:17,870
you do is you buy 10 or 20 parts at the

1487
00:50:16,220 --> 00:50:19,310
beginning and keep in mind that parts

1488
00:50:17,870 --> 00:50:21,799
are Cheaper by the Dozen so you're not

1489
00:50:19,310 --> 00:50:23,360
actually buying you know 10x 20x amount

1490
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:25,130
of costs and a lot of it's a setup fee

1491
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:28,550
and so if I'm if I'm going to do like an

1492
00:50:25,130 --> 00:50:30,200
IOT style like a single book you know

1493
00:50:28,550 --> 00:50:32,270
embedded microprocessor kind of project

1494
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:34,129
at the EB stage I'll build a minimum of

1495
00:50:32,270 --> 00:50:36,800
three because you want to have one to

1496
00:50:34,130 --> 00:50:38,120
break you know when to test when to

1497
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:39,620
check right so that you're actually kind

1498
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:41,630
of at the very procedure hacking your

1499
00:50:39,620 --> 00:50:44,180
own design gives you it's not working

1500
00:50:41,630 --> 00:50:45,980
okay what I do okay well let's try to

1501
00:50:44,180 --> 00:50:47,779
reverse engineer my thought process and

1502
00:50:45,980 --> 00:50:49,310
figure out and you detach the JTAG

1503
00:50:47,780 --> 00:50:50,870
debugger and you finally get code

1504
00:50:49,310 --> 00:50:52,160
loading and you're actually kind of

1505
00:50:50,870 --> 00:50:55,069
owning your own hardware at the very

1506
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:56,600
beginning because it's not booting so

1507
00:50:55,070 --> 00:50:58,520
that's sort of like the it doesn't catch

1508
00:50:56,600 --> 00:50:59,960
fire stage and then once you to that

1509
00:50:58,520 --> 00:51:01,070
point you want to build a few of them so

1510
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:02,810
you can start handing them to other

1511
00:51:01,070 --> 00:51:04,430
people to you know check your design

1512
00:51:02,810 --> 00:51:04,610
assumptions and also put them in you

1513
00:51:04,430 --> 00:51:06,140
know

1514
00:51:04,610 --> 00:51:08,900
machines to bake them and shake them and

1515
00:51:06,140 --> 00:51:10,250
then to the production side you want to

1516
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:11,450
build as many as you can afford so you

1517
00:51:10,250 --> 00:51:13,370
can like give it to friends and actually

1518
00:51:11,450 --> 00:51:15,470
do like a soft beta see how they're

1519
00:51:13,370 --> 00:51:17,509
going so this is some exactly actual

1520
00:51:15,470 --> 00:51:20,689
examples of how this comes along there's

1521
00:51:17,510 --> 00:51:22,520
a product I made a long time ago called

1522
00:51:20,690 --> 00:51:25,190
the chumby it's basically a squishy

1523
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:26,360
little internet-of-things alarm clock at

1524
00:51:25,190 --> 00:51:27,970
the end of day this is what it looked

1525
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:32,660
like at the end but it started as like

1526
00:51:27,970 --> 00:51:35,240
this large board on my desk and then to

1527
00:51:32,660 --> 00:51:38,270
see if it would catch fire literally

1528
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:40,009
we've got some squishy pillows in some

1529
00:51:38,270 --> 00:51:41,630
Hello Kitty things and cut them open and

1530
00:51:40,010 --> 00:51:43,100
then like put the circuit boards on the

1531
00:51:41,630 --> 00:51:45,410
inside and ran them for a long time so

1532
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:49,640
it literally doesn't catch fire was like

1533
00:51:45,410 --> 00:51:51,710
the the EBT stage of the project right

1534
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:53,270
okay great it doesn't catch fire let's

1535
00:51:51,710 --> 00:51:55,460
go ahead and try to refine the design

1536
00:51:53,270 --> 00:51:56,990
and stick into something and then we

1537
00:51:55,460 --> 00:51:58,820
figure out like actually the you know

1538
00:51:56,990 --> 00:52:00,319
this original design was bad like the

1539
00:51:58,820 --> 00:52:02,630
electronics would fall out there's all

1540
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:04,520
kind of small problems and then finally

1541
00:52:02,630 --> 00:52:06,680
once you hammer out those kinks we get

1542
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:08,900
to the production stuff we end up being

1543
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:10,819
photographed in people that's what

1544
00:52:08,900 --> 00:52:12,740
people talk about but like there's a lot

1545
00:52:10,820 --> 00:52:15,110
of but it was a process getting to there

1546
00:52:12,740 --> 00:52:16,399
right and so well define process and the

1547
00:52:15,110 --> 00:52:18,380
key thing is it doesn't happen if you

1548
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:21,260
don't try you just need to sort of get

1549
00:52:18,380 --> 00:52:21,770
started and give it a try to make it

1550
00:52:21,260 --> 00:52:25,130
happen

1551
00:52:21,770 --> 00:52:26,690
so in another example of a project I

1552
00:52:25,130 --> 00:52:29,540
work on is chibi Tronics so chibi

1553
00:52:26,690 --> 00:52:31,880
Tronics is a project where we put

1554
00:52:29,540 --> 00:52:34,310
electronics onto paper it's sort of a

1555
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:36,830
sort of physical matter and people to

1556
00:52:34,310 --> 00:52:38,360
get see how people can learn and create

1557
00:52:36,830 --> 00:52:40,730
differently if they have electronics

1558
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:41,300
integrated with paper it kind of looks

1559
00:52:40,730 --> 00:52:43,070
like this

1560
00:52:41,300 --> 00:52:45,440
you have stickers that we can slip down

1561
00:52:43,070 --> 00:52:47,150
onto paper and we have like clippable

1562
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:49,550
microcontrollers and go on the edge of a

1563
00:52:47,150 --> 00:52:52,280
page if you can like and then draw on

1564
00:52:49,550 --> 00:52:54,470
top of it do art that sort of thing so

1565
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:55,910
it you know there's a lot of problems

1566
00:52:54,470 --> 00:52:57,620
that we had to solve getting to that in

1567
00:52:55,910 --> 00:53:00,830
the very first prototypes were literally

1568
00:52:57,620 --> 00:53:02,509
just like a large flux PCB then we just

1569
00:53:00,830 --> 00:53:04,990
put everything that we could think of it

1570
00:53:02,510 --> 00:53:07,220
on it like just stupid stuff we had like

1571
00:53:04,990 --> 00:53:09,140
accelerometers and microphones and boost

1572
00:53:07,220 --> 00:53:11,569
regulators and battery all the sort of

1573
00:53:09,140 --> 00:53:13,700
stuff right and and huge chains of

1574
00:53:11,570 --> 00:53:14,840
high-power LEDs and we saw like what

1575
00:53:13,700 --> 00:53:16,850
caught fire and what didn't catch fire

1576
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:18,410
what worked and what didn't work and we

1577
00:53:16,850 --> 00:53:19,788
sort of winning it down to a space

1578
00:53:18,410 --> 00:53:21,920
things that we could reasonably produce

1579
00:53:19,789 --> 00:53:23,539
and then for the clippable paper stuff

1580
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:27,200
it literally started with a paper clip

1581
00:53:23,539 --> 00:53:29,030
that we liked taped a board on and then

1582
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:30,410
like stuck some film behind and said oh

1583
00:53:29,030 --> 00:53:32,210
hey this might work right you know this

1584
00:53:30,410 --> 00:53:33,618
that's that's the EVT state that's where

1585
00:53:32,210 --> 00:53:36,410
it all starts we you just have to try

1586
00:53:33,619 --> 00:53:38,960
and see how it goes and then we matured

1587
00:53:36,410 --> 00:53:40,640
it to a DVT stage where we did a small

1588
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:43,400
crowdfunding campaign and some early

1589
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:46,578
stickers and some 3d printed models to

1590
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:48,020
sort of refine the clip and then after

1591
00:53:46,579 --> 00:53:51,500
about a year of effort we end up with

1592
00:53:48,020 --> 00:53:53,390
these sorry what you see now like on

1593
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:55,099
Amazon or whatever it is of the extra

1594
00:53:53,390 --> 00:53:56,960
product you know looks finished and

1595
00:53:55,099 --> 00:53:58,609
refined but it but it's not you know

1596
00:53:56,960 --> 00:54:00,680
it's not like it was just born that way

1597
00:53:58,609 --> 00:54:03,078
or another project that I'm working on

1598
00:54:00,680 --> 00:54:05,089
called any TV - I've mentioned the

1599
00:54:03,079 --> 00:54:06,859
earlier any TV which sits current kind

1600
00:54:05,089 --> 00:54:09,619
of the intersection of other computers

1601
00:54:06,859 --> 00:54:12,288
in society society says that it's bad

1602
00:54:09,619 --> 00:54:14,770
for you to break crypto that's a crime

1603
00:54:12,289 --> 00:54:17,420
today you're not allowed to go ahead and

1604
00:54:14,770 --> 00:54:21,890
circumvent crypto to access copyrighted

1605
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:24,890
materials NH TV - tries to challenge

1606
00:54:21,890 --> 00:54:26,569
that notion and so the basic idea of any

1607
00:54:24,890 --> 00:54:27,980
TV - is that if you have a Raspberry Pi

1608
00:54:26,569 --> 00:54:30,049
you have an application you wanna show

1609
00:54:27,980 --> 00:54:31,760
on your TV you can go ahead and just you

1610
00:54:30,049 --> 00:54:33,859
know plug it in line with your cable on

1611
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:35,480
the TV and then whatever it shows up you

1612
00:54:33,859 --> 00:54:37,220
know on your Raspberry Pi is now like a

1613
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:39,049
little window on the side on your TV you

1614
00:54:37,220 --> 00:54:42,259
can do sort of like a video overlay and

1615
00:54:39,049 --> 00:54:43,520
the reason why it sort of sits on the

1616
00:54:42,260 --> 00:54:44,660
intersection Society is that there's

1617
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:46,490
actually a law the Digital Millennium

1618
00:54:44,660 --> 00:54:51,589
Copyright Act which makes it illegal for

1619
00:54:46,490 --> 00:54:52,970
you to go ahead and play around with the

1620
00:54:51,589 --> 00:54:55,069
video feed so if you want to do

1621
00:54:52,970 --> 00:54:56,029
something even really simple like what

1622
00:54:55,069 --> 00:54:57,140
you can do with your phone where you

1623
00:54:56,029 --> 00:54:59,660
want to go ahead and do live video

1624
00:54:57,140 --> 00:55:01,250
translation of text on the screen or

1625
00:54:59,660 --> 00:55:04,250
something that that's actually not

1626
00:55:01,250 --> 00:55:06,380
lawful to do right now on a TV feed

1627
00:55:04,250 --> 00:55:07,760
because those things are encrypted so

1628
00:55:06,380 --> 00:55:09,770
when I first started the project this

1629
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:11,390
was the EBT one I thought maybe I would

1630
00:55:09,770 --> 00:55:14,538
build something in like a little PCI

1631
00:55:11,390 --> 00:55:17,000
mini PCI Express card form factor and I

1632
00:55:14,539 --> 00:55:18,680
floated around and they go you know did

1633
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,880
it catch fire and build some stuff for

1634
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:22,970
it turns out it was kind of I completely

1635
00:55:19,880 --> 00:55:25,490
missed the mark like went back to zero

1636
00:55:22,970 --> 00:55:27,589
again and EBT - looks a bit more like

1637
00:55:25,490 --> 00:55:28,939
this it's actual full size PCI card

1638
00:55:27,589 --> 00:55:31,490
because that's you know where people

1639
00:55:28,940 --> 00:55:33,940
actually had the power to do the video

1640
00:55:31,490 --> 00:55:37,399
where the interest was in the market

1641
00:55:33,940 --> 00:55:38,930
evolved it into a DBT prototype with the

1642
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:41,119
3d printed case and the Raspberry Pi

1643
00:55:38,930 --> 00:55:43,069
mounted on it to see you know and where

1644
00:55:41,119 --> 00:55:45,260
that's currently actually at the stages

1645
00:55:43,070 --> 00:55:46,610
right now what the PBT will look like

1646
00:55:45,260 --> 00:55:48,200
will actually be the outcome of it's

1647
00:55:46,610 --> 00:55:50,420
actually an active crowdfunding campaign

1648
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:53,569
shameless plug if you go to Krotz play

1649
00:55:50,420 --> 00:55:55,310
calm alpha max like any TV - you can

1650
00:55:53,570 --> 00:55:57,200
check out more details about this

1651
00:55:55,310 --> 00:55:59,509
project but the but the idea is that

1652
00:55:57,200 --> 00:56:01,009
like you know based upon the feedback of

1653
00:55:59,510 --> 00:56:03,110
people the users and what people want to

1654
00:56:01,010 --> 00:56:04,670
do with it the PvP will come into shape

1655
00:56:03,110 --> 00:56:06,800
so this is actually that process

1656
00:56:04,670 --> 00:56:08,300
happening live and you can participate

1657
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:11,210
in this process through the magic of

1658
00:56:08,300 --> 00:56:13,310
crowdfunding so you know the high level

1659
00:56:11,210 --> 00:56:14,780
sort of message I'm trying to get out

1660
00:56:13,310 --> 00:56:16,880
here is that you know hardware is

1661
00:56:14,780 --> 00:56:18,650
interesting and hardware isn't hard if

1662
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:20,420
you know the method right so just you

1663
00:56:18,650 --> 00:56:22,820
know hacking as a methodology you get a

1664
00:56:20,420 --> 00:56:25,340
couple pieces one to break when the hack

1665
00:56:22,820 --> 00:56:26,780
one to test it's not it's not scary if

1666
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:28,790
you wanted to do making this also

1667
00:56:26,780 --> 00:56:30,680
process right because I catch fire right

1668
00:56:28,790 --> 00:56:33,890
does it meet specs and can it yield and

1669
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:36,080
if you can hack hardware you can go

1670
00:56:33,890 --> 00:56:37,100
ahead and bring new capabilities to the

1671
00:56:36,080 --> 00:56:38,540
things you can do whether on the

1672
00:56:37,100 --> 00:56:40,130
security space if you want to go ahead

1673
00:56:38,540 --> 00:56:42,200
and pull out keys or if you want to

1674
00:56:40,130 --> 00:56:44,990
extend the interaction and capability of

1675
00:56:42,200 --> 00:56:46,910
a computer and this ultimately is sort

1676
00:56:44,990 --> 00:56:48,200
of like the core of the hacker ethos I

1677
00:56:46,910 --> 00:56:50,299
think when I was thinking of this talk

1678
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:52,069
it's about redefining your volume of

1679
00:56:50,300 --> 00:56:53,990
possibility it's not being caught in

1680
00:56:52,070 --> 00:56:55,490
that sort of infinite fractal surface

1681
00:56:53,990 --> 00:56:57,319
area and thinking wow like there's so

1682
00:56:55,490 --> 00:56:58,669
many things for us to look at let's just

1683
00:56:57,320 --> 00:57:00,950
change the rules that change the volume

1684
00:56:58,670 --> 00:57:02,990
of possibility so you have literally a

1685
00:57:00,950 --> 00:57:05,299
blue sky of ideas that you can go ahead

1686
00:57:02,990 --> 00:57:07,540
and explore and that's my talk it's

1687
00:57:05,300 --> 00:57:07,540
ready

1688
00:57:25,569 --> 00:57:30,470
what's it okay

1689
00:57:28,549 --> 00:57:31,819
thanks everybody oh I really look

1690
00:57:30,470 --> 00:57:33,319
forward to hanging out with you guys and

1691
00:57:31,819 --> 00:57:36,249
getting really trashed tomorrow

1692
00:57:33,319 --> 00:57:43,009
soldering should be a really good time

1693
00:57:36,249 --> 00:57:44,269
around that's right I think they wanted

1694
00:57:43,009 --> 00:57:46,099
to arrange like a book signing or

1695
00:57:44,269 --> 00:57:49,569
something like that I don't I've never

1696
00:57:46,099 --> 00:57:52,569
done with these so you're interested

1697
00:57:49,569 --> 00:57:52,569
sure
