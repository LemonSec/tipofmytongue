1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,549
so we need a couple volunteers I think

2
00:00:05,549 --> 00:00:09,360
six are for volunteers hands hands okay

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,940
so if you could find David and tell them

4
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:15,139
you want to sign up for hacker jeopardy

5
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:18,420
he was here a second ago

6
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:20,580
I think you can sign up online we have

7
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:21,300
oh there he is

8
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:23,490
so wait keep your hands up keep your

9
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:26,660
hands up where'd you go come on

10
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:29,580
okay there's still room for a couple

11
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:31,830
more teams at hacker jeopardy so please

12
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:34,250
see David please enjoy hacker jeopardy

13
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:36,660
because if there's not enough team it'll

14
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:42,469
probably get all left up what do it so

15
00:00:42,469 --> 00:00:46,410
up next we've got David Bryan aka video

16
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:48,600
man who is returning to torque on yet

17
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:51,420
again to speak with us I think the

18
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:52,920
reason he does come back to tour kana is

19
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,360
actually because it's a whole lot warmer

20
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:58,260
than Minnesota so he is a pen tester

21
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:00,180
with IBM's x-force read he had

22
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:02,190
established his tools and processes for

23
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:04,409
doing first clients to do pen testing

24
00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:05,909
and part of tools and processes

25
00:01:05,909 --> 00:01:08,369
sometimes means taking hard to use tools

26
00:01:08,369 --> 00:01:10,770
and making them easy to use tools so in

27
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:13,530
line with that we've got some stuff some

28
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:14,880
work here where instead of using a

29
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,860
proxmark and a bunch of other stuff he

30
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:18,630
simplified all that and show you will

31
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:20,700
show you that card cloning doesn't have

32
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:21,450
to be hard

33
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:30,659
thanks thank you so a couple of

34
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:32,790
shoutouts first to the torque on crew

35
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:34,520
thank you for putting this conference on

36
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:36,840
super-important also to my wife for

37
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:40,110
putting up with me as crazy as I am and

38
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:43,259
the that I do what we're going to

39
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:46,950
talk about a little intro about me talk

40
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:48,420
about some of the history of access

41
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:50,780
controls access cards that are out there

42
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:54,479
and talk about some of the current

43
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:59,369
systems as well as some of the issues

44
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:01,710
with some of those systems and then do a

45
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:04,229
little demo so hopefully the demo works

46
00:02:04,229 --> 00:02:08,508
and the demo gods won't fail me today I

47
00:02:08,508 --> 00:02:10,590
volunteer for a lot of things I probably

48
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:13,270
shouldn't but I do

49
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:15,520
a thot con is a conference I helped run

50
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,480
in Chicago it's a it's a good good

51
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:22,090
conference if if you're in or near

52
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:23,770
Chicago you should come by or maybe even

53
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:27,010
plan to come we have VIP tickets which

54
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:30,160
basically gets you free booze all day so

55
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,080
it's kind of like this but we also have

56
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,200
some sponsors but they don't get any say

57
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,430
in the conference they only get say in

58
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:40,480
the after-party which is great I've been

59
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:46,420
a goon for 21 years now it's been fun

60
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:48,610
it's been a lot of Def cons a lot of

61
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:52,690
craziness but basically if you sit in

62
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:54,280
your hotel room and watch any of the

63
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,320
talks that's because of my team we've

64
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,120
got a team of about seven of us that

65
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:00,700
that come out every year and set up the

66
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:05,110
video and yeah it's great also tour camp

67
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:10,150
is coming up right through camp 2018 was

68
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:14,050
a lot of fun so tour camp is coming up I

69
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:17,710
help support that also get involved your

70
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:20,230
local DEF CON groups DC communities Def

71
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:23,230
Con communities or 2600 to some degree

72
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:26,200
some of them are not so great some of

73
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,270
them are much better but the DEF CON

74
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:30,760
groups tend to be more computer security

75
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:34,670
focused rather than criminals I mean

76
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:39,740
I also really dislike large ISPs to the

77
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:42,500
point that I started my own picot ISP in

78
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:43,310
my neighborhood

79
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:46,370
I've got about I think 50 clients or so

80
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:50,240
that I service and then I'm a pen tester

81
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:54,850
with IBM so external customers I

82
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:58,310
recently was in Japan testing ATMs right

83
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:00,860
so all sorts of stuff like that all

84
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:01,180
right

85
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:03,980
so tour camp is awesome you should

86
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:06,020
register if you haven't registered why

87
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:09,290
haven't you bring it oh yeah bring a

88
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:09,770
modem

89
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:12,620
okay so I've just been informed bring a

90
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:15,920
modem somebody will have a BBS the the

91
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,200
shady tell people are awesome

92
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:21,680
they run twisted-pair everybody's camp

93
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,340
with a form in triplicate to request

94
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:27,560
your stuff it's beautiful

95
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:31,550
anyway access control why right

96
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:35,150
everybody has a building everybody has

97
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:36,800
something that they need to protect in

98
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,979
order to have protections you have

99
00:04:39,979 --> 00:04:41,990
access control systems access control

100
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:47,630
mechanisms physical keys are great from

101
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:49,010
the perspective that you know you have

102
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:50,900
to have a physical key supposedly right

103
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:52,669
blocks can be picked not everybody knows

104
00:04:52,669 --> 00:04:55,520
how to pick locks but you have to have a

105
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:59,030
key so in order to facilitate that you

106
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:00,919
might have a master key and you might

107
00:05:00,919 --> 00:05:04,460
have sub keys the master key systems

108
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:06,470
make your Luck's even more vulnerable to

109
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:09,290
attack and now you can't watch who's

110
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:10,790
actually entered your your building

111
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:13,550
unless you've got a lock that you know

112
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:15,770
essentially part of the key stays in the

113
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:17,330
lock and then you can go and interrogate

114
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:20,390
the lock those are extremely expensive

115
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:24,800
hard to maintain hard to manage all

116
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,600
sorts of stuff that it's just wrong with

117
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,450
them yeah and the biggest problem is

118
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:30,979
what happens when an employee loses

119
00:05:30,979 --> 00:05:33,229
their key do you recall your

120
00:05:33,229 --> 00:05:36,830
locks at you know $300 a pop probably

121
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:38,870
not right especially if you've got a

122
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:41,560
large number of locks on your building

123
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:45,289
so come in the next phase of electronic

124
00:05:45,289 --> 00:05:47,479
access control right because you want to

125
00:05:47,479 --> 00:05:48,440
be able to

126
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:50,690
remove their code or remove that the

127
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:54,230
user immediately if they lose their card

128
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:56,990
or maybe they're terminated right from

129
00:05:56,990 --> 00:06:01,190
an employee's perspective so really it's

130
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:04,010
it's a savior right it's the way to to

131
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:05,540
make it so it's easy for someone to come

132
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:08,540
in and revoke credentials change out

133
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:10,520
credentials maybe put restrictions on

134
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,900
when a user can actually enter the

135
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:13,670
building because you can't really do

136
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:15,770
that with a physical key a physical key

137
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:18,140
someone's gonna come in anytime right

138
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:21,980
24/7 so I say it's a savior and ablate

139
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:23,870
and it's a blight from the perspective

140
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:26,450
that a lot of the manufacturers have

141
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:28,100
basically used security through

142
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:28,670
obscurity

143
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:31,730
to protect your building right this the

144
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:34,460
obscurity is the card manufacturers or

145
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:36,320
the security is the obscurity is the

146
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,970
protocol right the protocol in the

147
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:45,950
backend so there's there's a basically a

148
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:48,800
ul so underwriter laboratories has a

149
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,430
scale that works I think it's the Aloha

150
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:56,030
locksmith Union there's a scale for how

151
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:58,300
long it takes to gain access to a safe

152
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:02,300
and it's like TTL 15 right which is

153
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:09,230
Tools torches and time of 15 right you

154
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:11,330
want to make sure that whatever you're

155
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:13,280
trying to get into has the appropriate

156
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,950
amount of controls right so a safe 15

157
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:17,930
minutes to get in if you don't have the

158
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:20,900
combination probably reasonable 15

159
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:22,780
minutes 30 minutes whatever it is right

160
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:25,640
an access door that's totally not

161
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:28,240
reasonable like you should be able to

162
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,010
probably drill the core to get into it

163
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:34,580
if you lose the key right at at the

164
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:36,169
least and you're you know you're gonna

165
00:07:36,169 --> 00:07:38,919
see that someone is up at your door

166
00:07:38,919 --> 00:07:41,750
drilling it destroying it whatever it

167
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:46,730
might be so access cards and access

168
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:49,580
control has to have appropriate controls

169
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:50,990
I guess is what I'm trying to say like

170
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:52,940
you you can't put Fort Knox in front of

171
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:54,890
your door that everybody comes in every

172
00:07:54,890 --> 00:08:00,250
five minutes all right

173
00:08:01,159 --> 00:08:04,050
this is what's called a Wiegand card

174
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:07,769
right so the reason well I'll get to the

175
00:08:07,769 --> 00:08:09,599
reason why I'm presenting this in just a

176
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:11,550
moment but this is one of the original

177
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:13,429
access cards and you can see down here

178
00:08:13,429 --> 00:08:16,259
we've actually got little bits of wire

179
00:08:16,259 --> 00:08:18,929
that are embedded in this card and what

180
00:08:18,929 --> 00:08:21,779
happens is this card passes over a reed

181
00:08:21,779 --> 00:08:25,499
head there's a magnet that drops a

182
00:08:25,499 --> 00:08:28,409
charge on the wire and then drops it on

183
00:08:28,409 --> 00:08:31,199
the reed head and there's two lines of

184
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:33,958
these little wires one is a zero line

185
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:39,059
and one is a one line as those drop on

186
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:40,979
the reader on the back end goes oh

187
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:43,649
that's a you know one that's a zero okay

188
00:08:43,649 --> 00:08:46,139
now we know what card number it is

189
00:08:46,139 --> 00:08:51,870
essentially right and that's a physical

190
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:55,040
card this is a proximity card which is

191
00:08:55,040 --> 00:09:00,029
magnetically coupled so the coil in this

192
00:09:00,029 --> 00:09:02,670
case in there card enters into the

193
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:06,350
readers field and the reader clamps down

194
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:09,120
or not the card sorry the card clamps

195
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,880
down on the field and then the reader

196
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:14,160
goes oh okay that's a one oh that's a

197
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:18,839
zero oh that's a one right does this at

198
00:09:18,839 --> 00:09:21,360
a frequency a resonant frequency of 125

199
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:28,850
kilohertz there's a manufacturer that

200
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:32,610
basically sold these cards with facility

201
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:35,220
codes right so if you knew that you

202
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:38,339
wanted a secure site you would buy one

203
00:09:38,339 --> 00:09:40,380
of the cards that had a very specific

204
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:43,199
facility code for your building or for

205
00:09:43,199 --> 00:09:46,040
your site right

206
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,980
it's a neat idea of security but again

207
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:51,720
it's security through obscurity right

208
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,949
especially when we start to talk about

209
00:09:52,949 --> 00:09:58,319
the proxmark stuff there's also a mode

210
00:09:58,319 --> 00:10:00,060
inside of the proxmark where you can

211
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:01,470
tell it a facility code and it'll just

212
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:02,730
go through and brute force all the

213
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:05,459
combinations right that's super super

214
00:10:05,459 --> 00:10:07,638
useful

215
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:12,120
so RFID is a little different

216
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,649
from the perspective that you are

217
00:10:13,649 --> 00:10:17,370
actually energizing the tag at thirteen

218
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:21,600
point five six megahertz and then the

219
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,819
device is sending data back to you at

220
00:10:23,819 --> 00:10:26,160
exactly half the frequency right so it's

221
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,470
it's an active device you can do a lot

222
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:30,889
more with RFID stuff than you can with

223
00:10:30,889 --> 00:10:38,009
125 kilohertz stuff for example

224
00:10:38,009 --> 00:10:40,170
passports right your passport is

225
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:42,180
encrypted with a bunch of the stuff at

226
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:43,860
the bottom of the text that's inside

227
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:48,209
your passport you can store like there's

228
00:10:48,209 --> 00:10:49,829
photo there's a photo and there's all

229
00:10:49,829 --> 00:10:51,360
the passport data that's on your

230
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,550
passport stored in the RFID chip inside

231
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:59,970
of your passport encrypted cards they

232
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:04,079
too exist however in a lot of

233
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:06,240
implementations that don't change the

234
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,249
key right so you have an encrypted card

235
00:11:08,249 --> 00:11:10,439
or card that has some sort of encryption

236
00:11:10,439 --> 00:11:13,290
on it encryption I say that with air

237
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:15,660
quotes to some degree because it really

238
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:21,629
depends on the implementation but the

239
00:11:21,629 --> 00:11:23,309
readers will all have the same key

240
00:11:23,309 --> 00:11:25,079
that's deployed out and it's probably a

241
00:11:25,079 --> 00:11:27,389
default key right which is a little

242
00:11:27,389 --> 00:11:29,129
crazy

243
00:11:29,129 --> 00:11:31,920
Mifare classic obviously is broken

244
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,009
Mifare DESFire for the moment we know

245
00:11:35,009 --> 00:11:38,910
works pretty well it uses a challenge

246
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:40,769
mechanism where it sends some data to

247
00:11:40,769 --> 00:11:43,259
the card the card then has to send data

248
00:11:43,259 --> 00:11:46,649
back right and that data back if the key

249
00:11:46,649 --> 00:11:49,230
is the same the data should be correct

250
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:53,459
right there's a chance that if you had

251
00:11:53,459 --> 00:11:55,170
access to the physical reader you could

252
00:11:55,170 --> 00:11:56,959
still do some chai side-channel attacks

253
00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:00,360
to recover that key so I just think

254
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,860
about that like if a reader goes missing

255
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:04,110
on your building maybe it's time to

256
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:06,929
change the keys hopefully if someone

257
00:12:06,929 --> 00:12:07,829
knows how to do that

258
00:12:07,829 --> 00:12:12,689
that's the hardest part all right so the

259
00:12:12,689 --> 00:12:15,449
reason I mentioned the the original

260
00:12:15,449 --> 00:12:17,910
Wiegand protocol with the wires is

261
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:19,860
because that's what all these readers

262
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:22,379
use on the back end just a one in a zero

263
00:12:22,379 --> 00:12:25,010
line to transmit the data

264
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:27,199
to the access control unit and then the

265
00:12:27,199 --> 00:12:28,940
access control unit is the thing that

266
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:30,860
has the relay that energizes the door

267
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:37,370
strike right it's not encrypted very

268
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:39,620
rarely will someone actually hook up the

269
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:41,420
tamper lines right because that's an

270
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:44,930
extra step it involves two pieces of

271
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:47,149
electronic components that need to go in

272
00:12:47,149 --> 00:12:50,170
at the door strike or at the reader

273
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:53,810
basically it's called a monitored input

274
00:12:53,810 --> 00:12:57,139
right they actually have that technology

275
00:12:57,139 --> 00:13:00,380
in a lot of the modern systems to

276
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:03,380
monitor that reader input that one zero

277
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:05,930
line if it gets clipped it then sends an

278
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:10,850
alarm most people don't use that so

279
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:13,070
there's a couple of people Zac Franken

280
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:15,769
and Mel major malfunction they put

281
00:13:15,769 --> 00:13:19,070
together in 2008 a pic controller called

282
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:21,529
gecko that you could basically insert in

283
00:13:21,529 --> 00:13:24,889
between the the Weig and line pick it up

284
00:13:24,889 --> 00:13:28,279
I think one of their versions had

285
00:13:28,279 --> 00:13:30,949
Bluetooth but by default it would just

286
00:13:30,949 --> 00:13:34,430
wait for one of their cards and when it

287
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:35,720
saw one of their cards it would then

288
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:38,360
replay the last card that was seen from

289
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:41,600
the device last known good read because

290
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,389
it also tracked the LED but or the LED

291
00:13:44,389 --> 00:13:47,000
so if the LED flashed green oh yeah

292
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,620
that's a valid card so let's store that

293
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:53,000
nerve our memory and now there is

294
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,480
actually this tool I found this out

295
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,660
recently ESP RFID tool I think you can

296
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:02,750
interrogate it with Bluetooth as well

297
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:07,940
it's just it you know ESP chip I thought

298
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:08,930
it was pretty ingenious that they've

299
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:13,339
made this little tiny board so when

300
00:14:13,339 --> 00:14:14,600
you're talking about okay we've got all

301
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:17,630
these fun security things up front that

302
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:21,110
you use these cards if the back end is

303
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:22,490
still weak hand and you're not

304
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:24,110
monitoring your inputs and you're not

305
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:25,970
monitoring your tamper right you're

306
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:27,440
you're still gonna have this problem

307
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,110
where your stuff is gonna be tampered

308
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:32,089
with or at least replay very easily

309
00:14:32,089 --> 00:14:34,630
replayed

310
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:38,460
I think one of the the last things is

311
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:40,650
putting the reader behind glass is

312
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:42,150
actually not a bad idea

313
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:44,880
right because now you know if that glass

314
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,130
is broken well someone's probably

315
00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:48,500
with the reader and we should probably

316
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:51,420
figure out what's going on maybe we've

317
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:53,130
got some camera footage of it we can go

318
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:54,780
back and try and figure out if they

319
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:56,250
actually stole the reader so they could

320
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:59,940
get the keys or if it implanted a device

321
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:04,290
for example all right

322
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:07,800
so now let's go onto card cloning so

323
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,630
this is the worst card cloner in the

324
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:13,980
world it goes through and actually will

325
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:16,890
write a pin a lot of these will write a

326
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:18,780
pin to the card so you can only

327
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:22,680
reprogram it using this card the

328
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:25,740
proxmark actually has a function built

329
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:27,540
into it that you can go through and try

330
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:30,110
and brute force the pin on these cards

331
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:35,790
on the reprogrammable cards are TI five

332
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:37,830
five seven seven cards that's the model

333
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:43,200
number so let's talk about a little bit

334
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,460
about the evolution because I think it's

335
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:46,350
it's important to see where some of this

336
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:49,400
stuff has come from I think this is a

337
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:54,270
knockoff of a proxmark I mean they're

338
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:56,460
all it's all open-source Hardware right

339
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:59,880
so but the first version sort of started

340
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:04,470
out fairly big fairly bulky not exactly

341
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:08,280
easy to use with all the connectors and

342
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:11,940
we had another version proxmark 3r TV

343
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:14,430
like we're now into like our TV for

344
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:16,740
already well now it's already before

345
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:24,930
right so this is the RTV 4 which is the

346
00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:27,900
size of a pack of cigarettes kind of you

347
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:30,330
know pretty small right so the idea is

348
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:33,630
that if I was an evil

349
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:37,620
I would come up and surreptitiously read

350
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:41,610
your badge from your bag right run the

351
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:43,230
wire up my my arm on my sleeve and

352
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:47,520
actually the guys who created this have

353
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,450
now come out with a module

354
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:51,370
that's bluetooth-enabled and has a

355
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:54,730
battery on it so yeah you don't even

356
00:16:54,730 --> 00:16:58,470
need the wire anymore now just bloop

357
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:03,310
pretty pretty cool stuff yeah I was

358
00:17:03,310 --> 00:17:05,349
actually very happy about this module I

359
00:17:05,349 --> 00:17:10,660
I the other modules are very bulky like

360
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:12,430
you would know that somebody is carrying

361
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:15,579
a giant PCB and wants to touch your read

362
00:17:15,579 --> 00:17:24,970
card so back about February or so I was

363
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:27,960
like hey I really want one of these

364
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:31,510
this card badge printer cuz like you

365
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:33,460
know I think I think would be fun to

366
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:35,290
play with I think it'd be fun to have it

367
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:37,330
could be definitely useful in a bunch of

368
00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:42,430
our pen test engagements right so I went

369
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:44,230
to marketing and said hey buy me one of

370
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:48,250
these printers and they said okay make

371
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:54,130
me a demo so for blackhat I put together

372
00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:56,530
a demo a couple of demos where we had

373
00:17:56,530 --> 00:18:00,850
some stations where people come up we

374
00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:03,850
take a picture of them they get a badge

375
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:07,060
printed out the default badge could

376
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:10,480
allow them to go and make coffee so at

377
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,740
the blackhat booth in order to make

378
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:13,750
coffee you had to have a badge it was

379
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:14,590
hilarious

380
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:16,270
because people didn't understand it

381
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:18,250
they're like what I have it I have to

382
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:23,230
have a badge yes but then there was also

383
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:26,230
a part where I had a badge on my person

384
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:29,380
they could walk up to me I walk over and

385
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:31,030
we would surreptitiously have them read

386
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:35,470
my badge right and then write it to

387
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:37,180
their badge and then they could go over

388
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:39,690
to this prize wall which was you know

389
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:42,490
3x3 cube of all sorts of little trinkets

390
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:45,130
and if they'd scanned or cloned my badge

391
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:47,320
they could scan it there and one of the

392
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:50,740
doors would open up sweet but I had to

393
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:53,560
make sure that this was idiot proof

394
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:56,230
right the last thing I want is someone

395
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:58,450
sitting at a command line what do I type

396
00:18:58,450 --> 00:19:03,280
yeah LF space re8 no no

397
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,140
no that's not going to work that is

398
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:07,300
totally not going to work so I came up

399
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:11,650
with a web interface and the idea is

400
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:13,600
that you can walk up someone can hit

401
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,600
read my card and then they can hit clone

402
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:20,280
that card done super simple super easy

403
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:26,170
and then a couple well last week I did a

404
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:31,480
talk in Tokyo that this talk I was like

405
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:32,620
I think I want to add some functionality

406
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:35,110
to this because this could be a really

407
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:39,160
nasty tool so I basically put in a

408
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:41,460
database and then added the ability to

409
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:43,810
clone any of the cards that are in the

410
00:19:43,810 --> 00:19:46,930
database back to a new blank card or

411
00:19:46,930 --> 00:19:51,880
simulate it alright so now we're gonna

412
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:55,860
do a demo and hope it doesn't fail

413
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:25,899
oh yeah so I'm also doing

414
00:20:25,899 --> 00:20:29,049
I brought my card printer with so I will

415
00:20:29,049 --> 00:20:33,519
be doing that demo tomorrow so if you I

416
00:20:33,519 --> 00:20:35,259
don't know where I'm gonna set it up but

417
00:20:35,259 --> 00:20:36,759
I have the card printer I have the badge

418
00:20:36,759 --> 00:20:39,070
cloner I have all the stations we'll

419
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:41,019
we'll set it up somewhere and people can

420
00:20:41,019 --> 00:20:43,330
come by take pictures and clone cards it

421
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:45,940
should be pretty fun all right

422
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:53,100
oh let's see here no I don't want that

423
00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:01,460
what are you doing

424
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:30,460
all right so this is the web interface

425
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:33,730
let's see I got a card here

426
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:40,690
I can hold it up to my thing and go read

427
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:45,160
card yeah awesome and hopefully it reads

428
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:47,980
it yes it did look at that we've got to

429
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:54,460
read facility code 42 1 3 37 and also I

430
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:59,110
can do this on my phone oh there we go

431
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:03,960
so I should be able to say read card I

432
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,770
don't know if we'll be able to see it

433
00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:08,940
here easily enough

434
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:29,300
come on oh I wonder so got a connect to

435
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:31,520
it first so I created a basically a

436
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:34,220
Bluetooth pan on this device in my

437
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:36,920
pocket which is a Raspberry Pi zero so

438
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:39,170
tiny little device with a bluetooth

439
00:22:39,170 --> 00:22:40,400
personal area network

440
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:46,310
connect to it over IP pop up into a web

441
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:48,800
browser and I can say alright let's read

442
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:51,440
that card alright so there we go

443
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:55,940
42 1 3 through 7 I can now go to all the

444
00:22:55,940 --> 00:23:00,020
cards that I've read read prior and go

445
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:01,870
through and say all right let's simulate

446
00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:05,390
right and so now the proxmark goes into

447
00:23:05,390 --> 00:23:09,350
simulate mode then just push the button

448
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:11,660
stop simulating pretty pretty simple

449
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:18,500
pretty easy oh I also I also translated

450
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:23,600
it into Japanese so because I figure if

451
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,970
I'm going to Japan I might as well make

452
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:28,690
the interface easy for people to read

453
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:30,560
but that also means that we could

454
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,270
translate into whatever language we want

455
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:38,210
so which was a it was a lot of work but

456
00:23:38,210 --> 00:23:48,770
it was a lot of fun yeah so come on over

457
00:23:48,770 --> 00:23:50,030
and play

458
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:54,290
I have probably 300 cards that I brought

459
00:23:54,290 --> 00:23:55,700
with so if anybody wants their picture

460
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:58,940
on some sort of fun card I think by

461
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:01,220
default I've got this template going but

462
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:03,890
if you've got another template we might

463
00:24:03,890 --> 00:24:07,580
be able to put it on there and the code

464
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:11,150
I pushed to github I don't know if it

465
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:14,510
works on anything else but but I mean at

466
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:16,730
least pull it down and try to try to

467
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:20,360
work with it it's only it only works

468
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:23,000
with the RDV 4 which is the latest

469
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,970
version and the way that the proxmark

470
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:29,840
s-- work is it's not just a serial

471
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,340
connection directly to the proxmark

472
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:33,870
there's actually a binary that

473
00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:36,720
runs that then talks to the proxmark to

474
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,880
get it to do the things so you kind of

475
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,340
you have to have the right code set for

476
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:44,700
the proxmark 3rt v4 if you don't and you

477
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:46,700
try and flash it you will brick it I

478
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:50,510
bricked mine and then had to pull out my

479
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:53,880
JTAG bus pirate basically the bus pirate

480
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:56,460
to talk to it over a JTAG to re-upload

481
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:59,010
firmware it was a pain in the ass so

482
00:24:59,010 --> 00:25:02,280
anyway I think that's about all I have

483
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:14,790
two minutes left and thank you okay

484
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:16,230
thanks very much if you have any

485
00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:17,670
questions we're gonna shuffle outside in

486
00:25:17,670 --> 00:25:19,440
just a few minutes we have a short break

487
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:23,330
between now and whatever's next

488
00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:27,179
lightning talks so yeah we have any

489
00:25:27,179 --> 00:25:29,340
