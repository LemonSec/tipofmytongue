this is Margaret she's a technical

2
00:00:02,909 --> 00:00:04,200
writer with a strong interest in

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:05,730
information security learning and

4
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:07,770
education and interdisciplinary

00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:09,120
connections she has spoken at

00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,660
abstractions - all right take it away

10
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:24,990
thank you hello friends and the front in

11
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:26,910
the middle good morning everyone and

12
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:28,500
thank you for showing up as it is still

13
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:29,220
morning

14
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:32,610
I appreciate it extra today I'm going to

15
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:33,989
talk a little bit about the mosaic

16
00:00:33,989 --> 00:00:35,910
theory of information security I am

17
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:37,710
going to start and spend a little more

18
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:39,210
than half the talk explaining what

19
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:42,420
mosaic theory is and how it is used in

20
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:44,340
the financial sector where the idea

21
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:46,170
originates and then in the second half

22
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:47,640
we are going to talk a little bit about

23
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,680
how this can be useful to you as an

24
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:54,719
information security practitioner first

25
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:56,430
we're gonna start with a giant slide

26
00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:01,620
full of disclaimers I'm gonna read them

27
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:03,210
out loud just to be completely explicit

28
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:05,339
I am NOT a lawyer I am NOT a financial

29
00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:07,920
advisor I am NOT the SEC I am not in any

30
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,540
way entitled to make expert judgments on

31
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:11,310
what is or is not legal or insider

32
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:15,840
trading this whole talk is provided

33
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,400
without warranty or guarantee this is

34
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,020
not legal advice this is not financial

35
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:21,420
advice I am especially not your lawyer

36
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:24,030
or financial advisor I am going to talk

37
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:25,530
about how legal and financial concepts

38
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:27,840
work in a general sense based on a lay

39
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,670
persons understanding so we can all have

40
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:31,350
a shared basis from which to discuss

41
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:33,299
their applicability to information

42
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:36,630
security do not make financial or legal

43
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:39,180
decisions based on any information in

44
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:44,430
this talk again not advice talk to

45
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:46,560
actual experts if you feel inspired to

46
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,210
make financial or legal decisions after

47
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:50,189
watching this talk do not rely on my

48
00:01:50,189 --> 00:01:52,049
information and do not make them because

49
00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:54,869
of anything I say today I am NOT an

50
00:01:54,869 --> 00:01:56,520
expert on insider trading regulations

51
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,140
but I have enough of a general idea to

52
00:01:58,140 --> 00:01:59,969
use them as an allegory for a problem

53
00:01:59,969 --> 00:02:03,600
but security faces we're all clear not

54
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,020
advice not gonna listen it's going to

55
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:10,489
come up a couple more times but

56
00:02:10,489 --> 00:02:13,349
so first I'm going to talk a little bit

57
00:02:13,349 --> 00:02:15,450
about what mosaic theory is we'll give a

58
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:17,219
few examples of what does or does not

59
00:02:17,219 --> 00:02:19,739
fall under the mosaic theory we'll talk

60
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:21,030
a little bit about how you can use this

61
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:23,269
and then we'll revisit and wrap it up

62
00:02:23,269 --> 00:02:26,310
first the SCC's definition of insider

63
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:30,209
trading this is illegal insider trading

64
00:02:30,209 --> 00:02:32,250
refers generally to buying or selling a

65
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:34,019
security in breach of a fiduciary duty

66
00:02:34,019 --> 00:02:35,639
or other relationship of trust and

67
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:37,290
confidence on the basis of material

68
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:38,760
nonpublic information about that

69
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,609
security insider trading violations may

70
00:02:41,609 --> 00:02:43,560
also include tipping such information

71
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,780
giving it to somebody else

72
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:47,639
securities trading by the person who

73
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:50,159
received that tip or securities trading

74
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:52,109
by people who misappropriate such

75
00:02:52,109 --> 00:02:55,469
information I really want to focus in

76
00:02:55,469 --> 00:02:56,969
this definition on the concept of

77
00:02:56,969 --> 00:02:59,669
material nonpublic information because

78
00:02:59,669 --> 00:03:01,590
whether something is or is not Material

79
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:05,609
or non-public is kind of the core focus

80
00:03:05,609 --> 00:03:09,389
of how this relates to info SEC first

81
00:03:09,389 --> 00:03:11,609
I'm a technical writer and I'm at a

82
00:03:11,609 --> 00:03:13,500
hacker conference why am I talking about

83
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:17,400
mosaic theory or Finance in general so I

84
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,930
decided at one point that I wanted to

85
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:21,030
learn a little bit more about finance

86
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:23,310
and mostly how that team worked at my

87
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:25,290
company but also just in general it

88
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:26,699
seems like a useful thing to know I

89
00:03:26,699 --> 00:03:28,470
started with kind of a basic

90
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:30,239
introductory finance newsletter and then

91
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:33,150
I graduated to money stuff by Matt

92
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:35,010
Levine it's a bloomberg newsletter I

93
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:37,079
love it it goes out every day he gives

94
00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:38,669
enough of an explanation that you can

95
00:03:38,669 --> 00:03:41,189
use it to learn about concepts but also

96
00:03:41,189 --> 00:03:42,959
goes over whatever the current news is

97
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:46,500
and one day he had a story about an

98
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,569
argument about whether something was

99
00:03:48,569 --> 00:03:50,340
insider trading or valid under the

100
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:52,470
mosaic theory and had a cool name so I

101
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:58,739
googled it a bunch a different columnist

102
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:02,069
describes the mosaic theory as being how

103
00:04:02,069 --> 00:04:03,870
professional investors and research

104
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:05,400
analysts work the phones to ferret out

105
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,900
information about companies that can't

106
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:08,669
be found by simply reading news releases

107
00:04:08,669 --> 00:04:11,609
that is they get information that the

108
00:04:11,609 --> 00:04:14,009
company is willing to disclose but that

109
00:04:14,009 --> 00:04:16,228
hasn't been prominently disclosed in a

110
00:04:16,228 --> 00:04:19,139
public place and they combine it this is

111
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:20,608
the core of what counts as skilled

112
00:04:20,608 --> 00:04:21,389
financial

113
00:04:21,389 --> 00:04:27,360
and not insider trading for something to

114
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,430
be insider trading which you do not want

115
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:32,189
to do it has to be material information

116
00:04:32,189 --> 00:04:34,650
direct from a reputable source the

117
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:36,210
information often comes packaged

118
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:37,680
together so you're not combining

119
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,270
information from different sources but

120
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:40,889
you can act on a single tip or piece of

121
00:04:40,889 --> 00:04:43,860
information and also the information is

122
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:49,680
useful alone on the good side skilled

123
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,659
financial analysis which you are allowed

124
00:04:51,659 --> 00:04:54,419
and encouraged to do involves immaterial

125
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:56,759
information from multiple sources you

126
00:04:56,759 --> 00:04:58,680
combine that information to create

127
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:01,289
useful packages and that combination is

128
00:05:01,289 --> 00:05:04,139
what counts as the skilled part here and

129
00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:05,610
the individual pieces of information

130
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:08,580
that on are not as useful as the whole

131
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:10,919
that is if you took any one of the

132
00:05:10,919 --> 00:05:12,509
things you're considering you would not

133
00:05:12,509 --> 00:05:14,310
be able to get as good a result as you

134
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:15,810
have gotten by combining that

135
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:18,569
information I bet this is starting to

136
00:05:18,569 --> 00:05:23,400
sound familiar to some of you here is an

137
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,919
example of a case that the SEC ruled was

138
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:29,699
insider trading in this particular case

139
00:05:29,699 --> 00:05:32,069
a member of the Board of Directors of a

140
00:05:32,069 --> 00:05:34,050
potato chip manufacturer called golden

141
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:36,750
Enterprises was informed for legitimate

142
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:38,669
business purposes as a director on the

143
00:05:38,669 --> 00:05:40,979
board that there was a pending merger

144
00:05:40,979 --> 00:05:43,080
with Utz quality foods which is

145
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,270
privately held so far so good

146
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:46,860
he got material nonpublic information

147
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:48,479
but it was for a legitimate business

148
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:50,219
purpose and he didn't trade on it that's

149
00:05:50,219 --> 00:05:53,789
all fine but instead of using that

150
00:05:53,789 --> 00:05:55,680
information exclusively for that

151
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,839
legitimate business purpose he tipped

152
00:05:57,839 --> 00:05:59,460
his friend and business partner Michael

153
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:01,289
Hale Smith who in turn tipped his dad

154
00:06:01,289 --> 00:06:04,860
and his brother and his boss who all

155
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:08,099
traded on it importantly they all knew

156
00:06:08,099 --> 00:06:09,839
he was a director and so he was a

157
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:15,389
reputable source that's also important

158
00:06:15,389 --> 00:06:17,580
because if I tell you that a potato chip

159
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:19,710
company will be acquired based on my

160
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:22,529
expertise as a technical writer I am NOT

161
00:06:22,529 --> 00:06:25,139
a reputable source and if you trade on

162
00:06:25,139 --> 00:06:27,599
that you got lucky that would not be

163
00:06:27,599 --> 00:06:30,229
insider trading

164
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:33,280
they profited off of information that

165
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,990
was surer than it's supposed to be you

166
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:37,120
are only supposed to be able to trade on

167
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,980
uncertain information so that there is

168
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:41,890
still that element of luck or skill and

169
00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:44,200
ascertaining how good the information is

170
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:48,580
involved in it there's this interesting

171
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:50,320
concept of fairness that underlies

172
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,310
insider trading

173
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:54,010
we're like the riskier it is the more

174
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:56,460
you're allowed to do it

175
00:06:56,460 --> 00:07:01,150
it's odd they did profit off of the

176
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:03,400
information to the tune of less than

177
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,440
half a million dollars which feels

178
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,500
extremely not worth it and they ended up

179
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:11,170
agreeing to repay it with interest and

180
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:13,690
additionally pay a fine equal to the

181
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:16,210
amount they had initially earned without

182
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:22,210
admitting or denying guilt by contrast

183
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:25,380
this was not insider trading a

184
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:27,520
businessman who owns a restaurant in

185
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,260
Massachusetts was found not guilty of

186
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:30,910
insider trading this year after

187
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:32,860
successfully reaping eight hundred fifty

188
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:35,520
thousand dollars a much better profit

189
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,690
from trading in the print company

190
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:38,580
vistaprint

191
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:41,620
he treated their futures between 2012

192
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:44,260
and 2014 in just two years he got eight

193
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:46,480
hundred fifty thousand dollars and while

194
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:49,390
he was extremely accurate he was found

195
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:51,040
to have combined bits of public

196
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,020
information to make his decisions on he

197
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:56,110
used their public disclosures which is

198
00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:57,790
totally fine and counts as skilled

199
00:07:57,790 --> 00:07:59,970
financial analysis not insider trading

200
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:02,380
the case was originally brought because

201
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:04,510
he had friends with ties to Vistaprint

202
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:06,910
and people had said that he was doing so

203
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:08,470
well that they must have been giving him

204
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:09,880
advance notice of the financial

205
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,350
disclosures before they were published

206
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:13,660
but a jury found that they had not

207
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:14,860
tipped him material nonpublic

208
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:21,610
information so in review insider trading

209
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:25,450
bad don't do this this involves trading

210
00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:27,130
on single pieces of significant

211
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:29,410
information that were not intended to be

212
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:30,340
released to the public

213
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:32,349
skilled financial analysis involves

214
00:08:32,349 --> 00:08:33,909
combining information that was meant to

215
00:08:33,909 --> 00:08:35,260
be released to the public and that's

216
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:36,220
totally fine

217
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:39,660
that's the thing you're allowed to do

218
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:43,299
why should you care about this

219
00:08:43,299 --> 00:08:47,519
well you also have a lot of information

220
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:50,140
there is the equivalent of material

221
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:51,640
nonpublic information things that

222
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,080
everybody knows you shouldn't disclose

223
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,610
and it's a huge problem if you are

224
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:56,740
disclosing you've got people's usernames

225
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:58,839
and passwords users personally

226
00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:00,579
identifiable information details of your

227
00:09:00,579 --> 00:09:02,980
unreleased features all that stuff the

228
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:05,769
stuff that we say yep definite breach if

229
00:09:05,769 --> 00:09:08,709
it gets leaked but you also have some

230
00:09:08,709 --> 00:09:11,320
immaterial or public information like

231
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:14,440
your press releases and your job ads and

232
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,209
group pictures from your on site that

233
00:09:16,209 --> 00:09:19,029
people can combine to constitute

234
00:09:19,029 --> 00:09:21,130
information that you may or may not have

235
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:26,680
realized you were making public your

236
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:28,510
material information might be something

237
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:31,120
like this something fun that I like to

238
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,220
do with this talk because all of these

239
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:35,050
information security issues are so

240
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:36,640
pervasive is replace all the examples

241
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,649
the night before I give any variation of

242
00:09:38,649 --> 00:09:42,310
it every time so this was a breach this

243
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:47,339
week two days ago the California DMV

244
00:09:47,339 --> 00:09:50,110
spilled data from thousands of drivers

245
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:52,630
driver's license applications to a

246
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:56,079
number of agencies including whether

247
00:09:56,079 --> 00:09:58,209
they had a social security number which

248
00:09:58,209 --> 00:10:00,899
is significant because California allows

249
00:10:00,899 --> 00:10:03,130
undocumented people to get a driver's

250
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:05,140
license and you can't get the Real ID

251
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:07,959
but now there's this whole database of

252
00:10:07,959 --> 00:10:10,630
who was in California and undocumented

253
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:12,940
and legally allowed to drive that was

254
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:20,110
given to among other agencies DHS but

255
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:21,130
then there's also this immaterial

256
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:22,990
information that you definitely want to

257
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:24,520
release so you can promote your company

258
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,350
right you've got your travel

259
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:28,240
opportunities and employees sabbaticals

260
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,510
employee travel on-site timing job

261
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:32,860
postings the information in your

262
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:34,810
applicant tracking system you want to

263
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:37,510
release internally a lot of the time so

264
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:39,220
that you can promote your opening so you

265
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:40,660
can promote your company so you can show

266
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:42,220
people what a great place this is to

267
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:51,459
work but how can you use this well move

268
00:10:51,459 --> 00:10:52,720
you may already have encountered a

269
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,610
situation where you released all those

270
00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:56,380
travel schedules and

271
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:58,660
someone noticed that maybe an executive

272
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:00,370
was out of office and took that as an

273
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:04,240
opportunity for spearfishing or similar

274
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,220
situations where there was something

275
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:07,570
that seemed harmless when the person

276
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:10,000
released it that was benign enough that

277
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,230
it didn't get covered in security

278
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:13,180
training or if it did it was maybe an

279
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:15,730
offhand mention and that then caused a

280
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:18,490
serious problem of that material public

281
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:20,650
material nonpublic kind of nature later

282
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:26,980
on because the concept of the mosaic

283
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:29,350
theory in the financial world is pretty

284
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:30,310
well-established

285
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:32,170
it began to be used as a defense in

286
00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:35,140
insider trading cases in the 80s and has

287
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:37,870
continued to be used since then this is

288
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:41,170
something that a lot of the MBAs or

289
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:43,210
executives or business stakeholders will

290
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:45,100
readily understand and so if you're

291
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:47,650
trying to establish why a couple of

292
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:48,700
things that we're about to talk about

293
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:51,010
are significant this can be a great

294
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:54,220
allegory for like look you know how

295
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:56,590
you're allowed to trade on stuff when

296
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:58,180
you combine the information and

297
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:00,070
sometimes you can do so well with that

298
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:01,660
that they're not sure if it was insider

299
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:04,810
trading or not well no one's gonna be

300
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:07,180
able to tell how this breach happened if

301
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:08,470
we keep putting out all of this

302
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:12,820
information you get blamed all the same

303
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:16,600
way one of the ways in which this turns

304
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,910
up is prioritizing dealing with chunks

305
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:21,370
of vulnerability chains if you have a

306
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:23,530
bunch of insignificant flaws in your

307
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:25,270
software that can be combined to

308
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:27,070
constitute a significant flaw in your

309
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:30,640
software instead of having legitimate

310
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:33,790
non insider trading we now have workable

311
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:41,650
no major breach required hacking this

312
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:43,780
can be especially useful when you need

313
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:46,030
to direct resources towards breaking a

314
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:48,040
vulnerability chain when another

315
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,540
stakeholder wants to advocate for

316
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:51,220
putting that same time onto something

317
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:53,950
flashy err maybe let's not work on a new

318
00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:55,480
feature until we've taken at least one

319
00:12:55,480 --> 00:13:00,670
of these chunks out it can also help

320
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:03,250
when you need to evaluate the available

321
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:06,010
OSINT on your organization but before we

322
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:08,530
get too far into that it's another

323
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:10,000
disclaimer slide

324
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,370
the tools that I'm about to mention are

325
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:14,620
risky because they are useful if they

326
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:16,000
were not useful people would not be

327
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,529
putting so much information into them

328
00:13:17,529 --> 00:13:18,819
they would just ignore them and then

329
00:13:18,819 --> 00:13:20,490
that's no risk to your business at all

330
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:23,470
beginning these tools is not a good

331
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:26,379
mitigation strategy for this risk it's

332
00:13:26,379 --> 00:13:27,910
good to build awareness around them it's

333
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:29,350
good to keep track of what's going on on

334
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:31,689
them don't try to convince people that

335
00:13:31,689 --> 00:13:34,509
they can't use Twitter or LinkedIn it's

336
00:13:34,509 --> 00:13:39,189
not gonna go well I really love an

337
00:13:39,189 --> 00:13:41,319
analogy from Sara Harvey who is a

338
00:13:41,319 --> 00:13:43,720
security and privacy engineer at square

339
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,910
and compares your data to Lego bricks

340
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:48,250
you can put them together to build cool

341
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:50,079
things with them and it's great when

342
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,089
you're using them correctly but if you

343
00:13:52,089 --> 00:13:54,100
don't clean them up they hurt a lot to

344
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:58,089
step on it's easier to avoid stepping on

345
00:13:58,089 --> 00:13:59,740
one if you have an idea of where they

346
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:01,779
all are and especially if they've all

347
00:14:01,779 --> 00:14:02,889
ended up where they're supposed to be

348
00:14:02,889 --> 00:14:05,709
and I'm hoping that everyone takes away

349
00:14:05,709 --> 00:14:07,959
an idea that there might be places in

350
00:14:07,959 --> 00:14:09,939
your organization with piles of stray

351
00:14:09,939 --> 00:14:16,300
Legos hidden in the corner there are a

352
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:18,490
couple of clusters of types of

353
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:20,230
information to watch out for this first

354
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:25,199
section are things related to the

355
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:27,759
locations of your employees at any given

356
00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:29,410
time and especially recent past

357
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:32,019
employees as people leave your company

358
00:14:32,019 --> 00:14:33,220
they're often going to update their

359
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:34,899
LinkedIn and then people know that they

360
00:14:34,899 --> 00:14:37,360
just left hopefully you were doing some

361
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,819
sort of exit interview or just having a

362
00:14:39,819 --> 00:14:41,319
nice company culture to begin with so

363
00:14:41,319 --> 00:14:42,790
that they're not really angry when

364
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:44,230
everyone in their network gets an update

365
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:46,540
that they just left your company but

366
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:49,420
that can be an area to watch for you

367
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:50,529
also want to look at things like

368
00:14:50,529 --> 00:14:52,569
conference or meetup attendance and

369
00:14:52,569 --> 00:14:55,000
course completion a lot of the skills

370
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,040
that your organization is targeting can

371
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,899
come through there especially if there's

372
00:14:58,899 --> 00:15:00,670
something that you are looking to get

373
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:02,350
into that you haven't yet your

374
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:03,910
organization might decide that it's

375
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:05,740
totally worth the risk to promote it for

376
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:08,199
example there is a you to me data

377
00:15:08,199 --> 00:15:10,059
science initiative and they have been

378
00:15:10,059 --> 00:15:12,269
able to make great strides in hiring

379
00:15:12,269 --> 00:15:14,259
competitively by announcing that they

380
00:15:14,259 --> 00:15:16,750
are trying to upskill or hire a ton of

381
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,339
data scientists and that they are going

382
00:15:18,339 --> 00:15:20,410
to throw resources at that and so that

383
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:21,730
might be a thing you want to do but you

384
00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:23,050
want to know that you're doing that

385
00:15:23,050 --> 00:15:23,500
rather

386
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:26,260
than link hey engineers go to three

387
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:28,090
conferences about this technology and

388
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:30,040
you can use your company name on your

389
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,420
badge but we don't want anyone to know

390
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:33,820
we're evaluating it that one's not gonna

391
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:36,130
work as well

392
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:38,080
additionally you have your career site

393
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:40,390
your blog your employees blogs if you

394
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:41,920
don't have a place they can promote them

395
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,530
internally everyone wins there you get

396
00:15:44,530 --> 00:15:46,210
to know who has a blog in what they're

397
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:47,710
saying on it they get to promote their

398
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:49,090
blog and maybe get some extra likes

399
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:51,730
everyone's happy

400
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:54,460
also watch out for what's happening in

401
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:56,260
terms of conversations on public transit

402
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:58,600
or near your office every security

403
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,790
training ever says that you should be

404
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:02,050
careful what you're talking about in

405
00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:03,940
public but it's often so vague and

406
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:05,830
abstract that by the time something

407
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:08,440
actually comes up an end user has said

408
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:10,300
the critical thing before they realize

409
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:13,360
that they've said it and so we've had

410
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,920
some traction at my organization with

411
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:17,050
providing concrete examples like hey I

412
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:19,450
was on the train this morning and I

413
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:21,190
heard three people wearing their company

414
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:23,080
badges complaining about how dumb this

415
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:25,750
new HR training is that got assigned by

416
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:28,060
the federal government after it turned

417
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:29,590
out that they were having major issues

418
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:32,680
in their stairwells three times in one

419
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:36,150
week different groups of employees I

420
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:41,110
loved part the main thing you want to

421
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:42,820
look for in terms of this information

422
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:45,370
though are the trends you want to look

423
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:47,410
for whether there is chatter about

424
00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:49,030
mergers and acquisitions this can also

425
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:52,030
be a little bit of a red team or

426
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:53,770
marketing competitive intelligence kind

427
00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:56,980
of area you can see where maybe if one

428
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:59,260
of your competitors is suddenly super

429
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:02,290
into attending events about and posting

430
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:04,359
on Twitter about all these cool merger

431
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:06,460
articles there might be something coming

432
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:08,260
down the line there that they have

433
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:11,380
willingly or unwillingly made public to

434
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:13,930
you you also want to watch for mentions

435
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:15,430
of tooling that's going to turn up most

436
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:18,190
frequently in terms of conferences

437
00:17:18,190 --> 00:17:21,940
courses taken meetups people often add

438
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:23,829
the skill assessments to their LinkedIn

439
00:17:23,829 --> 00:17:25,599
profiles now and that can be an

440
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:28,119
important source of one person learning

441
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:30,610
a new tool an entire team learning a new

442
00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:34,600
tool probably telling you something job

443
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,470
posts and resignations especially

444
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:38,720
you have someone who is significant

445
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,070
enough to your organization that there

446
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:41,840
is a blog post about their resignation

447
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:44,000
and replacement or their resignation and

448
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,240
the role being open as well as general

449
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:49,370
employee sentiment if your employees are

450
00:17:49,370 --> 00:17:51,500
super angry then you have a riskier

451
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,630
environment to operate in than if you

452
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:55,370
are a nice company and your employees

453
00:17:55,370 --> 00:18:01,640
love working there in conclusion one

454
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:04,400
final time this is still not financial

455
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,120
advice

456
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,250
nobody is trading on any of this ask

457
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:08,870
your lawyer ask your financial advisor

458
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:11,210
is some professional who is not me not

459
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:12,799
that kind of professional I am

460
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:14,419
especially not you're that kind of

461
00:18:14,419 --> 00:18:19,100
professional not advice insider trading

462
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:22,250
is bad you shouldn't do it that's that's

463
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:25,490
advice that I am willing to provide no

464
00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:28,909
insider trading additionally all of the

465
00:18:28,909 --> 00:18:32,870
small things can add up I'm because this

466
00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:34,850
is kind of an unusual topic I'm gonna do

467
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:37,669
a double tiered Q&A here there will be a

468
00:18:37,669 --> 00:18:40,100
brief Q&A period about five minutes in

469
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:43,370
here where people can ask questions that

470
00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:46,309
are for the benefit of everyone and then

471
00:18:46,309 --> 00:18:48,230
I will be out in the garden for the

472
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:49,760
normal Q&A where you can ask more

473
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,590
specific things or how this applies to a

474
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:55,940
certain domain or stuff like that we

475
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:58,159
will have a microphone available thank

476
00:18:58,159 --> 00:19:01,059
you does anyone have any questions

477
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:11,220
I was wondering how common is it for

478
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:14,340
companies to have to allow their

479
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:16,680
employees to just blog on their own

480
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:19,200
private blog about goings at the owner

481
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,910
at the company it seems like that would

482
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:25,140
be banned automatically so the question

483
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:27,780
is how common is it for companies to let

484
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:29,190
employees blog in their personal blog

485
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:31,530
about the company it depends on how

486
00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:33,660
directly about the company it is but

487
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:35,580
again you can combine insignificant

488
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:36,990
information from different sources and

489
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:39,450
so it's extremely common to let

490
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:41,730
employees have a personal blog and to

491
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:43,740
blog in a general sense about what they

492
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:46,320
are doing or learning and you can then

493
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,180
combine that with the same employees

494
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:49,650
LinkedIn profile which is often

495
00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:51,360
hopefully linked to from the blog page

496
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,910
itself to figure out pretty trivially

497
00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:55,530
which company they're talking about or

498
00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:57,150
what sorts of projects they might be

499
00:19:57,150 --> 00:20:03,210
working on do you have any sort of term

500
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:05,040
or anything that like a red flag that

501
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,840
when you see you know that there is

502
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,880
usually an expected outcome straight

503
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:14,310
from whatever was mentioned in terms of

504
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:17,630
gathering the information together or

505
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:20,520
and then Mike please I can't really hear

506
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:23,750
you sorry whenever I see people

507
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:26,580
disappearing for or getting fired or

508
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:28,470
anything like that I know that this

509
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:30,390
person the security sector if it's a C

510
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:32,580
so and I can guarantee there's almost

511
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:34,140
like a breach that has happened I'm

512
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:35,250
waiting for is there anything like that

513
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:37,830
and pertains to your talk that uh you

514
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:41,040
have the same reaction to so part of the

515
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,990
problem here is that this is all about

516
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:45,360
things you can combine and so there's

517
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:48,180
not any one silver bullet there are a

518
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:50,640
couple of things I'll be posting my

519
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,170
slides later and those things that were

520
00:20:52,170 --> 00:20:53,790
grouped together on the slide with the

521
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:56,520
sections of bullet points often can be

522
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:57,960
combined with each other to together

523
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,760
constitute one piece of information

524
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:05,070
that's useful in terms of a single thing

525
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:06,630
to watch out for with the exception of

526
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:08,370
stuff that's totally unhide all like

527
00:21:08,370 --> 00:21:10,520
your CCO took a new job somewhere else

528
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:13,110
people generally do a reasonably good

529
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:16,140
job of either not putting stuff out

530
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:17,730
there that shouldn't be out there or

531
00:21:17,730 --> 00:21:19,620
getting it down pretty quickly because

532
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:20,820
it's out there you've got a lot of eyes

533
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:22,440
on it and someone's going to report it

534
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:24,150
to a person who will tell you hey no

535
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:25,020
stop

536
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:27,240
whereas this you're probably not

537
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:29,730
monitoring your friends to the same

538
00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:34,110
degree that this would require Sani and

539
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:39,330
answer the questions in inline with the

540
00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:42,030
previous question do you think a portion

541
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:44,520
of this could be automated such as

542
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:46,500
scraping you know LinkedIn Facebook

543
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,930
whatever looking for new domains the

544
00:21:48,930 --> 00:21:50,550
company's registering and stuff like

545
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:53,820
that do you think that's possible chunks

546
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:55,910
of it are absolutely automatable

547
00:21:55,910 --> 00:21:59,600
you can scrape people's social media

548
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:02,640
something that I've seen that I kind of

549
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,770
hesitate to say on video is in the

550
00:22:04,770 --> 00:22:06,270
welcome emails people list all of their

551
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:08,010
social media links and so I've seen

552
00:22:08,010 --> 00:22:09,240
people just save all of those to a

553
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,710
document somewhere and then you have all

554
00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:13,910
of your colleagues social media links

555
00:22:13,910 --> 00:22:16,800
but you can absolutely automate parts of

556
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:19,530
the process there is still at this point

557
00:22:19,530 --> 00:22:21,179
I think some manual work required in

558
00:22:21,179 --> 00:22:23,730
terms of combining it but I would not be

559
00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:25,559
surprised if within a couple years the

560
00:22:25,559 --> 00:22:27,030
manual work could be drastically reduced

561
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:31,679
if not alleviated altogether to go off

562
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:33,330
of his question is there any established

563
00:22:33,330 --> 00:22:37,280
framework that you know or can suggest I

564
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,540
don't know an established framework for

565
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:41,370
this because it's a little bit a thing

566
00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:43,200
that I made up based on a couple of

567
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,910
learning interests I was digging into at

568
00:22:44,910 --> 00:22:48,300
the same time um it would be cool if

569
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:49,800
there was an established trained work

570
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,750
I guess maybe that means I should make

571
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:59,000
one alright one last question

572
00:23:00,659 --> 00:23:03,389
there's a partially established one I

573
00:23:03,389 --> 00:23:04,860
think parts of it have been deprecated

574
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:08,549
called recon ng but it's has a similar

575
00:23:08,549 --> 00:23:10,409
interface to Metasploit so it's like not

576
00:23:10,409 --> 00:23:15,240
the most user-friendly alright thank you

577
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,980
everyone I think you Margaret Connie

578
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:19,679
thank you and we will be continuing this

579
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:20,700
in the back in case you didn't want to

580
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:22,830
be recorded while you were asking your

581
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:25,040
question

582
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:27,370
