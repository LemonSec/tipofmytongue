so I am going to talk a little bit about

8
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:31,109
blue teaming for Human Rights my name is

9
00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:33,600
Megan de Blois I work for inter news

10
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,790
which is a non-profit my team in inter

11
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:37,649
news focuses on proving security for

12
00:00:37,649 --> 00:00:39,170
high-risk communities around the globe

13
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:41,190
journalists activists human rights

14
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:44,100
defenders I'm also doing a part-time

15
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:47,610
master's over at Oxford I am a San Diego

16
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:49,289
so if you all have any questions about

17
00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:50,760
San Diego please come and find me I

18
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:52,500
would love to talk to you if you need

19
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,020
advice on food tacos whatever it might

20
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:57,989
be and because I know it is early I

21
00:00:57,989 --> 00:01:00,030
wanted to conclude a puppy photo nice

22
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:01,949
and early in the talk just to catch

23
00:01:01,949 --> 00:01:05,069
people's eyes and yes this is my my

24
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:07,830
puppy dog so let's go let's jump into it

25
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:10,860
so the problem that we face in the human

26
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:15,330
rights community often people ask me

27
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:17,549
sort of where do you start what's why do

28
00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:19,680
human rights groups struggle so much

29
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,189
when it comes to information security um

30
00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:26,130
first off most human rights groups that

31
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:27,869
we're talking about in this talk are not

32
00:01:27,869 --> 00:01:29,400
once based here in the u.s. they're the

33
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:32,460
ones that are based in places like Syria

34
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:34,710
places like Turkey place like Venezuela

35
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:39,060
they are highly underfunded much more so

36
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:41,340
I would say than some of any of the

37
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:43,770
organizations that we've ever worked

38
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,770
with

39
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:49,560
what about IT stuff there are none most

40
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,270
human rights organizations we work with

41
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:54,540
have no IT staff if they're lucky maybe

42
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:56,700
they have a part-time person they know

43
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,710
that's a bit more technical that comes

44
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:00,270
and helps them out every once in a while

45
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:02,700
when they have you know a technical

46
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:05,159
problem with the website or maybe they

47
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:06,479
think they've actually downloaded

48
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:10,470
malware staff dedicated to security when

49
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:12,090
people ask me this I normally laugh

50
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:13,290
that's just a big

51
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:15,180
no one in the community has dedicated

52
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:19,049
staff to security so what's on the flip

53
00:02:19,049 --> 00:02:21,030
side what is our adversary look like

54
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:23,519
well a lot of our adversaries are state

55
00:02:23,519 --> 00:02:25,819
level actors so they are highly capable

56
00:02:25,819 --> 00:02:28,769
they've got a PT's advanced persistent

57
00:02:28,769 --> 00:02:30,239
threats that they have and they're also

58
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:32,220
Arsenal although often times they do not

59
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:35,010
have to use them but they also sometimes

60
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:37,980
have additional capabilities like legal

61
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:40,590
authority to subpoena to force companies

62
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:43,019
to show them their data that is actually

63
00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:46,620
on their servers legal legislation that

64
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:48,420
they've passed actually force companies

65
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:51,239
to keep data inside the jurisdiction of

66
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:53,879
the country all of these make it really

67
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:56,700
difficult and make very capable

68
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:59,519
adversaries obviously if you're a

69
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:01,889
nation-state actor you are well-funded

70
00:03:01,889 --> 00:03:03,959
although it's very easy to be better

71
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:05,549
funded if you have no money so

72
00:03:05,549 --> 00:03:07,470
relatively whether or not you are a

73
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:11,069
Russia or you are you know an organizer

74
00:03:11,069 --> 00:03:13,680
a country with less funding more money

75
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,859
means more capabilities and they have

76
00:03:16,859 --> 00:03:18,419
teams they actually have staff that are

77
00:03:18,419 --> 00:03:20,459
dedicated to strategizing on how to

78
00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:22,910
compromise different communities

79
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:26,549
including human rights groups and if you

80
00:03:26,549 --> 00:03:27,810
don't believe me we can just check out

81
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:30,690
the news so even recently a fancy bear

82
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:33,060
has made a reappearance Belling cat

83
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:34,889
recently reported I think in August this

84
00:03:34,889 --> 00:03:37,440
year that they had a massive campaign

85
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,030
against a lot of their protonmail

86
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:41,790
accounts against their particular

87
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:44,489
journalists that were later determined

88
00:03:44,489 --> 00:03:50,069
to be fancy bearer we've got Pakistan

89
00:03:50,069 --> 00:03:53,370
Pakistan last year Amnesty International

90
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:56,000
actually published a report about how

91
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,859
Pakistan was found to not just surveil

92
00:03:58,859 --> 00:04:01,500
and use technology to surveil different

93
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:02,849
communities and human rights defenders

94
00:04:02,849 --> 00:04:04,159
but they were actually using offline

95
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:07,650
sort of tactic second techniques as well

96
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:12,239
and then even more recently we have the

97
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:15,569
NSO group that was found to have

98
00:04:15,569 --> 00:04:18,149
actually perpetrated or actually gone

99
00:04:18,149 --> 00:04:19,589
after more than a hundred different

100
00:04:19,589 --> 00:04:22,260
human rights donors citizen lab released

101
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:25,080
this report very recently it was

102
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,030
specifically talking about the whatsapp

103
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:30,240
vulnerability back in May it was later

104
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,620
found that over a hundred different

105
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:34,140
cases of human rights targeted attacks

106
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:36,180
had actually occurred and the list goes

107
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:38,760
on right Human Rights Watch published

108
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,260
some interesting research about the way

109
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:41,640
your community in China and their

110
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:44,190
surveillance technologies that are being

111
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:47,100
implemented and deployed there we have

112
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:50,250
cases like Zambia and Uganda where

113
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:51,750
different surveillance technologies are

114
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:56,760
being used and the list goes on so this

115
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,770
is kind of what it feels like oftentimes

116
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:01,440
in the Human Rights space we're kind of

117
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,710
at the odds are all stacked against us

118
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:07,020
it's definitely not in not an even

119
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:08,490
playing field we have a lot of

120
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:13,590
challenges so what can we do to be

121
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:15,210
honest a lot of human rights

122
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:17,520
organizations and defenders right now or

123
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,210
just getting by they they do lack a lot

124
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:22,350
of the knowledge that you like a lot of

125
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:24,030
the skill and the know-how to do

126
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:26,430
anything at all but let's focus on what

127
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:28,890
some that are doing actively and

128
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:31,260
proactive mitigations what those what

129
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:34,710
those groups are doing oftentimes these

130
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:36,840
groups are really reliant on trust

131
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,820
relationships so again you're you're

132
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:39,930
looking to someone that's maybe more

133
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:42,690
technical he trusts you're looking for a

134
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:45,030
recommendation by a trusted person for

135
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:47,460
another trusted person to to give you

136
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:50,280
support and to give you some sort of

137
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:55,860
mitigation or help so you can kind of

138
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:57,090
easily see how this is quite

139
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:58,650
constraining because it's kind of who

140
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:00,479
you know and when you're in your human

141
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:02,100
rights organization and a far-off place

142
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:05,340
with very few contacts you're not a

143
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:07,200
technical organization you have even

144
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:10,020
less technical info set contacts it can

145
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:12,330
be very very difficult and we see sort

146
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:17,880
of getting trapped in this bubble so

147
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:18,960
we're gonna talk a little bit about

148
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,669
that's sort of the lay of the land in

149
00:06:20,669 --> 00:06:22,260
terms of human rights groups I'm gonna

150
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:24,600
talk a little bit about some specific

151
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:28,380
needs you guys are at this talk

152
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:30,120
hopefully you all are interested in how

153
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,250
you can support human rights groups and

154
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:33,720
we're gonna lay out a little bit of what

155
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,910
the needs are some approaches and then

156
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:37,530
what you can actually do today to help

157
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:39,090
support human rights organizations

158
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:40,710
journalists activists

159
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:44,840
all around the world so for this talk

160
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:48,060
and for this particular audience I put a

161
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:50,160
lot of thought in what this group might

162
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,430
be more able to do or able to contribute

163
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:55,230
to in terms of bodies of knowledge and

164
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:56,820
capacity building for these communities

165
00:06:56,820 --> 00:07:00,300
so when we talk about needs we really

166
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:03,240
like to focus on information where human

167
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,470
rights creeps around the world are

168
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:06,420
really sort of blinded they don't know

169
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:08,460
what capabilities the threat actors have

170
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:10,920
they don't know how those capabilities

171
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:13,680
are actually being used in in the wild

172
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:19,170
live in addition to that under resourced

173
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:21,390
groups means very little capacity so

174
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:23,130
there's not a lot of capacity internally

175
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:24,690
to actually detect things there's not a

176
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:29,270
lot of capacity to implement mitigations

177
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:31,680
so a little bit more on what types of

178
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,480
information that we really need in the

179
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,790
Human Rights space we need information

180
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:38,550
about the adversary there's only a few

181
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:41,790
groups that actually do active threat

182
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:44,220
research around targeted attacks for

183
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:48,360
human rights defenders it can often be

184
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,580
very difficult to get that information

185
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:52,230
which is one of the reasons but there's

186
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:53,400
not a whole lot of money right to be

187
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,200
made in the Human Rights space doing

188
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,300
threat research against those type of

189
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:01,860
actors surveillance technologies again

190
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:04,110
we only know what's reported so a lot of

191
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:05,700
human rights groups are dependent and

192
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:07,830
reliant on on journalists and people

193
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:09,480
that are doing investigative reporting

194
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,610
to get information about what types of

195
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:13,020
surveillance technology or B are

196
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:15,510
existing in the space and what's

197
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:17,220
actually being implemented by

198
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:20,970
governments more information around

199
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:23,100
protections and mitigations is also a

200
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:25,470
really crucial component things change

201
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:27,720
so quickly vulnerabilities change so

202
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:30,210
fast different techniques and

203
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:31,890
improvements that we make in industry

204
00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:33,960
sometimes take a really long time to get

205
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:36,600
to human rights groups and civil society

206
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,789
groups who are oftentimes facing those

207
00:08:38,789 --> 00:08:40,590
same threat actors if you're looking at

208
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:42,960
governments or you're looking at the

209
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:45,390
same vulnerabilities so sharing that

210
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:49,530
information is also super valuable in

211
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:52,640
terms of capacity

212
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:55,200
it's been widely recognized in the

213
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,420
industry that we are we need more

214
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:59,160
cybersecurity professionals in the space

215
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:02,279
right we have lots of universities that

216
00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:04,800
are starting cybersecurity programs we

217
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,600
have companies that are dedicating more

218
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,550
resources to building up their internal

219
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:09,990
staffs capacity to implement

220
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:12,500
cybersecurity solutions and improvements

221
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:15,029
where does this leave the human rights

222
00:09:15,029 --> 00:09:17,910
groups oftentimes they're left out in

223
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:22,550
the cold they don't have the type of

224
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:26,640
those type of resources or sort of

225
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,070
support networks to push them forward

226
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:30,959
and to learning the most advanced or the

227
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:33,839
most up-to-date techniques on how to

228
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:38,730
solve these really tough challenges most

229
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:41,040
organizations that I've worked with and

230
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,050
that introduce has worked with have very

231
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:45,660
little detection capabilities not being

232
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:46,980
able to detect when something malicious

233
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:49,470
has happened happening is a huge barrier

234
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:50,940
for most of those communities so

235
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:53,339
improving the ability and capacity of

236
00:09:53,339 --> 00:09:56,010
organizations both both on the human

237
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:57,360
resources side but also on the

238
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,430
technology side on on being able to

239
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:01,290
detect things so that you can actually

240
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:06,149
respond so those are again some of the

241
00:10:06,149 --> 00:10:07,680
specific needs I'm gonna take a quick

242
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:13,680
sip of water some of the specific needs

243
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,810
that I think this particular community

244
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:19,769
can really help address some general

245
00:10:19,769 --> 00:10:21,720
sort of guiding principles though before

246
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,430
you just jump into working with human

247
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:25,890
rights groups I thought would be pretty

248
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:27,870
important to talk about just so we have

249
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:30,060
sort of a shared understanding of our

250
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:32,970
approach I have a lot of folks that come

251
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:34,980
up to me and say hey I want to help out

252
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:35,930
what can I do

253
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:38,430
and then they before I can even tell

254
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:40,529
them sort of the needs they're going on

255
00:10:40,529 --> 00:10:43,199
and kind of going on about what these

256
00:10:43,199 --> 00:10:44,850
different communities should be doing

257
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:46,949
without understanding the context so

258
00:10:46,949 --> 00:10:48,180
it's really important to have a harm

259
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:50,459
reduction approach it's really important

260
00:10:50,459 --> 00:10:52,050
to understand the threat models of the

261
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:53,730
communities that were working with and

262
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:59,459
design solutions based on that too often

263
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:01,640
I also see a lot of beyonce's I mean I

264
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:04,380
we love to be diva three love to be

265
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:05,280
heroes

266
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,600
but at the same time that's not what

267
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:10,590
community needs we need more backup

268
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:12,810
dancers we don't need more Beyonce's we

269
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:14,790
need people to support human rights

270
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:16,470
organizations to build their capacity

271
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:18,660
and empower them to make the decisions

272
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:21,120
on their own if you're here today but

273
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,880
gone tomorrow that doesn't sustain

274
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,900
communities in different parts of the

275
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:25,980
world where they're already under

276
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:28,740
resource it makes them more self more

277
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:34,350
dependent less self-reliant and this is

278
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:36,600
a screenshot of Renee Renee Browns

279
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:39,510
empathy talk if you haven't I definitely

280
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:42,630
recommend it but designing security

281
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:45,990
solutions with empathy in mind being a

282
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:48,750
listener not assuming and asking why

283
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,730
those are all super important and

284
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:52,410
critical as we are working with human

285
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:54,270
rights groups again because their risk

286
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:57,060
tolerance their threat model is going to

287
00:11:57,060 --> 00:12:00,530
be dramatically different than yours

288
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:03,360
understanding what why they're doing

289
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,130
things the way they're doing them is a

290
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:08,640
critical component before engaging with

291
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:12,030
different groups so again we've got harm

292
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:15,960
reduction we've got B the support not

293
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:18,360
not the Beyonce be the backup dancer and

294
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:21,690
designing MPT driven security solutions

295
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:25,650
so how does this skill for me the vast

296
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:26,820
majority of people on the planet

297
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:29,700
security is still too hard if you look

298
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:31,050
at the human rights community it's not

299
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:33,150
just hard it's super consequential so

300
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:36,900
not having a licensed version of your

301
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:39,960
Windows operating system can actually be

302
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:42,000
super detrimental right that's like

303
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,120
having your front door open those are

304
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,089
very basic things but are oftentimes

305
00:12:47,089 --> 00:12:50,900
done because of the under-resourced

306
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:57,120
ecosystem that they're in so how might

307
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,530
we actually design systems tools and

308
00:12:58,530 --> 00:13:00,480
partnerships that support human rights

309
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,870
groups we're going to look at sort of

310
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:06,750
three proposed ways one is hardening the

311
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:08,280
systems that surround human rights

312
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:11,310
defenders maximizing adoption where we

313
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:13,920
can and making more partnerships with

314
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,770
private sector and industry folks so

315
00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:18,390
when I say hard in the systems that so

316
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:22,140
human rights defenders oftentimes I use

317
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:25,230
the analogy of you know threat

318
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:26,730
information sharing if you're able to

319
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:28,769
get something to Google or to the Gmail

320
00:13:28,769 --> 00:13:30,779
team that says hey this is a fancy bear

321
00:13:30,779 --> 00:13:33,269
piece of infrastructure dropping some

322
00:13:33,269 --> 00:13:35,519
indicators they actually can prevent

323
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:37,380
those emails from coming into the inbox

324
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:39,959
in the first place so hardening at

325
00:13:39,959 --> 00:13:41,459
things that human rights defenders are

326
00:13:41,459 --> 00:13:44,610
often using which are what a lot of us

327
00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:46,019
use to be they use Gmail they use

328
00:13:46,019 --> 00:13:48,839
Windows they use a what's up all of

329
00:13:48,839 --> 00:13:50,550
these things hardening them makes it

330
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:54,319
harder for the adversary to compromise

331
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:57,209
software licenses again that sounds so

332
00:13:57,209 --> 00:14:00,060
simple and so basic but I cannot tell

333
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:01,410
you the number of times I go into an

334
00:14:01,410 --> 00:14:03,180
organization and at least 1/3 of the

335
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:04,740
organization is using cracked windows

336
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:07,620
licenses that's still such a basic thing

337
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:09,660
that is out of reach because it costs

338
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:12,690
money free and open source software so

339
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:14,250
this is why it's free and open source

340
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:16,140
software has such an important impact on

341
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:19,529
the human rights community because they

342
00:14:19,529 --> 00:14:21,420
have very little money very little

343
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:23,790
resources they're oftentimes forced to

344
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:26,160
use free things free and open source

345
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,649
software that's been audited is better

346
00:14:28,649 --> 00:14:31,050
than running a cracked Windows operating

347
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:33,779
system so that ecosystem is something

348
00:14:33,779 --> 00:14:35,820
that we very much support as well

349
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:39,320
through some of our work that we do

350
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:44,760
maximize security adoption this again is

351
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,769
some kind of talking about some of our

352
00:14:46,769 --> 00:14:48,810
work that we've done on how we can lower

353
00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:50,370
the barrier to adoption of security

354
00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:52,199
practices this is one of my favorite

355
00:14:52,199 --> 00:14:55,160
personas that we worked with some of our

356
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:58,529
Ukrainian colleagues to create and the

357
00:14:58,529 --> 00:15:02,209
quote is gold I forgot my password again

358
00:15:02,209 --> 00:15:04,920
passwords we all know are really

359
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:07,350
difficult really consequential if you're

360
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:09,360
a human rights defender in Ukraine if

361
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,430
you can't use a password manager it's

362
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:13,470
really hard to have good account

363
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:16,620
security so keeping usability in mind as

364
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:20,130
you're creating tools keeping usable

365
00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:22,560
processes and procedures again as you're

366
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:25,290
engaging with human rights groups making

367
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:27,300
sure that you're designing things that

368
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:30,149
aren't just the most secure thing things

369
00:15:30,149 --> 00:15:32,040
that work within the workflows and

370
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:35,250
within the context that they are that

371
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:38,970
they're living in security but by

372
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:41,250
default is a game changer

373
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:44,279
what's up as an example of that and then

374
00:15:44,279 --> 00:15:46,949
designing for cases like human rights

375
00:15:46,949 --> 00:15:48,990
groups designing for those extremes can

376
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:50,730
actually better protect users everywhere

377
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:52,649
if you design something that is secure

378
00:15:52,649 --> 00:15:56,550
enough for someone like oleksander that

379
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:58,500
will be secure enough for a lot more

380
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:03,120
users as well why partnerships with

381
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,889
private sector are so important for

382
00:16:04,889 --> 00:16:06,750
human rights defenders I think we've

383
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:08,339
talked about that better-funded

384
00:16:08,339 --> 00:16:10,470
large entities with more access to

385
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:12,029
information you all have a lot of

386
00:16:12,029 --> 00:16:14,250
information that sometimes isn't

387
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:17,160
necessarily shared broadly but sharing

388
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,899
that with human rights groups might have

389
00:16:18,899 --> 00:16:22,350
significant impact understanding those

390
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:24,000
threats and tactics and techniques that

391
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,690
are being used are really critical more

392
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:30,899
access to expertise so again a lot of

393
00:16:30,899 --> 00:16:34,050
folks in private sector have formal

394
00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:36,600
education in security most folks that I

395
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,069
work with in the Human Rights space do

396
00:16:38,069 --> 00:16:40,199
not that doesn't mean that they're not

397
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:42,269
experts as well but it means that

398
00:16:42,269 --> 00:16:44,370
there's a lot of co-learning and

399
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:46,350
dialogue that can be happening to share

400
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:48,959
experience in his experiences and share

401
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:51,990
learning share learning methodologies

402
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:57,980
and approaches that might work so today

403
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:00,690
what can you all do and I really hope

404
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:03,329
that at least this sort of starts the

405
00:17:03,329 --> 00:17:04,559
conversation for those who are

406
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:05,970
interested in working with human rights

407
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:07,980
defenders I think the number one thing

408
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:10,829
if you want to start working with the

409
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:12,569
human rights or Civic civil society

410
00:17:12,569 --> 00:17:14,939
space is work with trusted

411
00:17:14,939 --> 00:17:18,869
intermediaries we all know the quote the

412
00:17:18,869 --> 00:17:20,429
road to hell is paved with good

413
00:17:20,429 --> 00:17:23,189
intentions I cannot tell you the number

414
00:17:23,189 --> 00:17:24,929
of horror stories I've heard of people

415
00:17:24,929 --> 00:17:26,760
reaching out to folks are communicating

416
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:29,240
in an insecure way and that ending up

417
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:31,530
that purse ending up in jail or that

418
00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:33,720
person ending up at the police station

419
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:37,350
getting interrogated so working with

420
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:39,900
people that are intermediaries tends to

421
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:41,909
be the but the safest and best way that

422
00:17:41,909 --> 00:17:45,179
you can support a lot of these high-risk

423
00:17:45,179 --> 00:17:46,970
group

424
00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:49,260
work with trusted organizations and

425
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:51,450
individuals like inter news like first

426
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:53,370
responders these people play critical

427
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:56,580
nodes within this ecosystem they have

428
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:59,250
trust networks but they also have the

429
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:01,140
ability to safely communicate with you

430
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:03,600
and build relationships I think that's

431
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,940
one that I'm we're trying to work a lot

432
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:07,860
with human rights groups as well go to

433
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:09,690
conferences build relationships with

434
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:12,420
these communities like Rapid Response

435
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:16,050
groups the civil society group civ

436
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:18,390
assert just started a computer emergency

437
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:22,020
response team SIV a cert and they need

438
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:23,730
more support so build those

439
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:29,040
relationships and continue teach our

440
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:31,110
community to fish I think that's one

441
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,600
that's also often overlooked it's really

442
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,730
easy to come in and just do it's a lot

443
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:38,130
harder to pause and give people the

444
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:40,980
tools to to learn and do it themselves

445
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:44,220
that night not necessarily be the case

446
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:47,640
always but look at look at it from a

447
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:50,400
perspective perspective of how am i

448
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,650
contributing to a sustainable community

449
00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:55,140
of security for human rights groups if

450
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:57,600
I'm here today but gone tomorrow will

451
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,880
they still be able to be resilient will

452
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,860
they still be able to implement the

453
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:03,800
things that I've set up for them

454
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:06,120
firewalls intrusion detection systems

455
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:09,480
things like that all of this gives

456
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:12,810
communities much more agency and better

457
00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:14,490
able to make informed decisions for

458
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:16,710
their own security needs not just today

459
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:21,480
but for the future as well and be the

460
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:25,250
backstop I cannot stress this enough

461
00:19:26,810 --> 00:19:28,710
collaboration is definitely a two-way

462
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:29,510
street

463
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:32,880
be the backstop and know that you are

464
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,920
supporting the human rights defender

465
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:37,250
first when they are asking you for help

466
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:39,960
that's when you come in not the other

467
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,780
way around

468
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:43,920
so continue sharing your knowledge with

469
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:46,710
others be a mentor and work with

470
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:49,410
existing ecosystems of support again if

471
00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:50,910
you don't know what those ecosystems are

472
00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:52,140
that's why you're working with

473
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:54,920
intermediaries

474
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:59,620
and again know your role so we spent

475
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:00,940
some time with some of my colleagues to

476
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:03,760
put together some ideas we had but for

477
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,840
private sector platforms and companies

478
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,920
providing licenses and services

479
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,840
CrowdStrike CloudFlare threat connect

480
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:11,680
virustotal

481
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:14,140
all provide licenses to civil society

482
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:17,370
for free and that's super beneficial

483
00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:21,130
share your knowledge host webinars if

484
00:20:21,130 --> 00:20:23,740
you're interested in sharing some cool

485
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:25,750
techniques and you would like to design

486
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:29,110
some webinars with us we would love to

487
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:33,160
host you create online resources there's

488
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:35,350
a few that I might go twos especially

489
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:38,500
for the reverse engineering space that

490
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:44,410
are really for the community and again

491
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:47,470
threat researchers we're building up in

492
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:49,510
region experts right now and if you're

493
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:51,970
interested be the backstop for them hope

494
00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:53,830
them as they work through help them as

495
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:55,570
they get stuck when they're analyzing

496
00:20:55,570 --> 00:20:57,640
malware and phishing that is being

497
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:00,550
targeted at high-risk communities share

498
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:02,110
your process and continue to host

499
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:06,970
learning sessions and let's connect

500
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:09,700
please please come talk to me afterward

501
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:11,980
