1
00:00:00,829 --> 00:00:04,439
sizzle of expel and founder of the shmoo

2
00:00:04,439 --> 00:00:06,029
group he's going to be speaking to us

3
00:00:06,029 --> 00:00:08,130
about pen testing by asking questions

4
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:15,419
the art of elicitation hey me super

5
00:00:15,419 --> 00:00:17,640
exciting but then doesn't know me

6
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:19,890
normally I run around and I make a fool

7
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:22,140
myself and I give talks but I have the

8
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:24,450
plague I even went to Urgent Care

9
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:25,980
yesterday just down the road I will tell

10
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:27,150
you that San Diego urgent care

11
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:30,240
specializes in revitalizing blonde women

12
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,850
there is little places that you can sit

13
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:35,010
willow do IV rehydration and the ad is

14
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:36,870
basically like had too much to drink in

15
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:38,969
the Sun on the beach come here and we'll

16
00:00:38,969 --> 00:00:41,039
plug you up if you roll in with like the

17
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:42,030
flu they're kind of like well that's

18
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:45,809
really boring so I don't have the flu I

19
00:00:45,809 --> 00:00:47,850
have some other thing going on so I've

20
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:49,170
watched every Harry Potter movie though

21
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:51,480
on E which has been great so it's been

22
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:52,469
super enjoyable

23
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:54,929
and I'm gonna go back to that as soon as

24
00:00:54,929 --> 00:00:59,609
I'm done so I started all my talks the

25
00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:00,600
same basic premise don't believe

26
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,219
anything I'm about to tell you what I'm

27
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:03,899
about to present is based on my

28
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:06,060
experience it's based on my view of the

29
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:08,700
world in general in this industry if

30
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:10,200
you're over the age of 33 years old you

31
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,000
do not have a degree in cybersecurity

32
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,190
you may have a graduate degree because

33
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:15,570
you went to Purdue and studied under

34
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:18,570
spaff or you went to Hopkins and studied

35
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:20,340
under IRA or something like that but the

36
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:21,630
reality is most of us came to this

37
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:23,070
because we liked it because we learned

38
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:24,720
on the job sometimes we learned the

39
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:25,950
right thing sometimes we learn the wrong

40
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:28,680
thing so if you disagree that's totally

41
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,210
cool you're welcome to raise your hand

42
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:31,950
throw stuff at me whatever and we can

43
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:33,660
have a conversation about it

44
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:38,520
so this is literally a pen test by the

45
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,560
way on the side this is one of my

46
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,300
favorite graphics ever this is someone

47
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:45,170
testing pens

48
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:49,759
pilot zebra crayola crayola it has a pen

49
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:53,000
apparently I was totally unaware why is

50
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,759
pen testing with words so important so I

51
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:57,140
ran a company for a number of years we

52
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:59,450
broke into things professionally and we

53
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:02,000
broke into things a lot of times by

54
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,100
writing really complicated code learning

55
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:05,509
really complicated system architectures

56
00:02:05,509 --> 00:02:07,159
and getting way down the weeds to figure

57
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:08,899
out how it worked and we broke into a

58
00:02:08,899 --> 00:02:10,489
lot of stuff just by asking the

59
00:02:10,489 --> 00:02:12,319
developers the right questions and we

60
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:14,930
figured out how to get in now we weren't

61
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:15,920
doing your kind of normal

62
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,690
run-of-the-mill you know fish you get

63
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:20,480
inside roll around and attack things

64
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,920
this is a lot more targeted work but I

65
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,170
think what you'll find in the in the

66
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:26,600
coming years as more organizations go to

67
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,550
the cloud as more cloud native

68
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:30,769
organizations get bigger when it comes

69
00:02:30,769 --> 00:02:32,900
to assessing our security controls it's

70
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:34,280
not going to be I'm gonna load up

71
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,650
Metasploit I'm gonna fire shoot roll

72
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:38,600
around like a pig and poo it's not going

73
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,459
to be as successful because at some

74
00:02:40,459 --> 00:02:42,470
point in the future my bold prediction

75
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:45,170
is ad is not going to be a thing like it

76
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:49,730
is now so my contention is ad is one of

77
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:50,930
the most dangerous things it's inside

78
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:53,299
that most organizations for those of you

79
00:02:53,299 --> 00:02:54,950
that do red teaming and pen testing for

80
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:56,180
a living you're pretty well aware that

81
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:57,530
once you get inside you're on an ad

82
00:02:57,530 --> 00:02:59,840
connected host you largely have won the

83
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:00,829
war

84
00:03:00,829 --> 00:03:02,930
I work in an organization we have no ad

85
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:05,060
and I work with a lot of other companies

86
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:07,790
that are new last three four years that

87
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:09,739
have no ad either and at the end of the

88
00:03:09,739 --> 00:03:11,540
day when you attack us

89
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:13,400
it's trench warfare right you have to go

90
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,959
host a host to host or you have to go

91
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:17,060
after the application you have to go

92
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:18,950
after the logic and that is a very

93
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:20,510
expensive operation compared to say a

94
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:24,019
standard pen testing so when you live in

95
00:03:24,019 --> 00:03:25,760
an environment that is cloud native that

96
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,260
uses other people's systems where you

97
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:29,209
may not even be able to penetration test

98
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:31,100
actively you have to get in the mode

99
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:32,180
where you have to be able to ask

100
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:33,530
questions you have to be able to listen

101
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:36,920
to information from people communication

102
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,989
is obviously a big part of our job no

103
00:03:38,989 --> 00:03:41,120
matter what we're just gonna blow past

104
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,470
this I got a half an hour so we're just

105
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:44,810
going to push so the big question is

106
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:46,730
what is elicitation has anyone ever used

107
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:49,760
that word in common discussion before in

108
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,010
their lifetime suite that's not too bad

109
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:53,180
how many of you are software developers

110
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:56,239
or engineers Yeah right well I meant at

111
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:59,150
the first ok it all right

112
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:01,290
it's gonna roll like this it is not

113
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:02,940
solicitation just in case you're

114
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:04,950
confused I'm not encouraging you to

115
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:06,599
prostitute yourself in order to do a

116
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:08,099
penetration test that's not what this is

117
00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:08,870
about

118
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:11,730
elicitation is also not about yelling at

119
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:13,319
people trying to get answers right it's

120
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:15,120
not taking them into a dark room shining

121
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,829
a bright light on them and trying to

122
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:19,048
pull information I think the FBI

123
00:04:19,048 --> 00:04:20,850
unfortunately has a very good definition

124
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:24,210
of elicitation that you can see here it

125
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:28,200
is you know I think one of the the core

126
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,700
parts of our job when you're breaking in

127
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:31,229
the system is to get people to assist

128
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:32,550
you without them realizing that you're

129
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:34,229
assisting you right being able to ask

130
00:04:34,229 --> 00:04:36,030
the right question at the right time to

131
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:38,400
help you do your job for me this all

132
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,580
started as an interest when I was going

133
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:43,860
through as a UAF drop out where's the

134
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:46,020
other UF drop out there's a couple three

135
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:48,210
uaf uaf University of Alaska Fairbanks

136
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:50,550
if your kids want to go somewhere where

137
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:51,900
they can drop out of school is the best

138
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:54,120
place to go anyone here go to UAF that

139
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,130
didn't drop out right that's the number

140
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:58,440
of hands you almost always see up in the

141
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:58,800
air

142
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,840
I took a soccer a requirements class and

143
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,430
there was a several chapters that Davis

144
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:04,139
wrote on software elicitation or

145
00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:06,450
requirements elicitation I thought it

146
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:08,130
was fascinating you know it was all

147
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:09,870
about how to ask questions how to

148
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:12,389
structure that process in a way that

149
00:05:12,389 --> 00:05:13,530
allowed you to get the most bang for

150
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:14,700
your buck by whoever you were

151
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:17,280
interacting with it's a I wouldn't say a

152
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,050
lost art but an art that I think isn't

153
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:20,729
well studied in our domain of the

154
00:05:20,729 --> 00:05:22,560
security domain so what I'm trying to do

155
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,289
here is take my knowledge I've been

156
00:05:25,289 --> 00:05:26,760
doing this for 20 odd years

157
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:32,280
I'm a terrible coder right I have been

158
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,020
forbidden from writing code in several

159
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:37,979
states I'm really terrible at it but

160
00:05:37,979 --> 00:05:39,630
I've broken into a lot of systems right

161
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:41,010
and the way that I've broken into

162
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:43,590
systems frankly is by starting by asking

163
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:44,729
a bunch of questions and eventually

164
00:05:44,729 --> 00:05:45,720
getting to the point where I'm like okay

165
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,280
now I can do the one little bit I need

166
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,780
to to get on the system and get the

167
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:52,590
access and go so that's how I've been

168
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:55,080
successful there's been other bodies and

169
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,130
knowledge that I pulled from from this

170
00:05:56,130 --> 00:05:59,370
presentation unsurprisingly intelligence

171
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:01,080
and law enforcement have a fair bit of

172
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:03,180
art on this but also the legal

173
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:05,010
profession trains people on this right I

174
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:06,090
don't know if you don't but there's a

175
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:07,380
lot of questions that are asked in law

176
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:09,930
and being able to understand how to ask

177
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:12,030
good questions helps lawyers do their

178
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:12,319
job

179
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:13,369
whether or not you think that's a good

180
00:06:13,369 --> 00:06:16,629
thing or not that was a joke by the way

181
00:06:16,629 --> 00:06:20,059
anyway Boop a lot of lawyer defenders

182
00:06:20,059 --> 00:06:23,149
here and then business analysts which is

183
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:25,339
actually a job description there are a

184
00:06:25,339 --> 00:06:26,469
lot of people that do business and

185
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:28,759
analytics and they're trained as well

186
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:31,759
and how to ask questions so why is this

187
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:33,259
important I've kind of gone over this

188
00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:35,479
but the reality of this is if you want

189
00:06:35,479 --> 00:06:37,129
to do an online assessment of a product

190
00:06:37,129 --> 00:06:38,149
whatever it is somebody hands you a

191
00:06:38,149 --> 00:06:39,740
thing and says I want you to break into

192
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:42,529
this thing ok sweet I'm going to spend

193
00:06:42,529 --> 00:06:46,069
eight hours 20 hours 40 hours standing

194
00:06:46,069 --> 00:06:47,449
up a lab getting everything in place

195
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:48,469
starting to figure out how the

196
00:06:48,469 --> 00:06:50,509
interfaces work do a bunch of crap even

197
00:06:50,509 --> 00:06:52,279
if it's a white box assessment like

198
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:53,959
here's the code here's whatever it's

199
00:06:53,959 --> 00:06:55,309
gonna take me hours and hours and hours

200
00:06:55,309 --> 00:06:57,439
to get up to speed instead I can

201
00:06:57,439 --> 00:06:59,209
probably tell to get a developer to tell

202
00:06:59,209 --> 00:07:00,680
me in 10 minutes where things are super

203
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:03,110
bad right if I can get a built a rapport

204
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:05,659
and do something productive from a

205
00:07:05,659 --> 00:07:07,369
communication perspective they'll say oh

206
00:07:07,369 --> 00:07:08,839
this authentication thing right here

207
00:07:08,839 --> 00:07:10,610
like the front door is great but here's

208
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:11,930
the side door administrative interface

209
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:13,879
that we have like thanks fella like

210
00:07:13,879 --> 00:07:15,830
that's the thing that gets you in the

211
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:21,649
door so I love what everyone hears that

212
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:25,009
right it's not just all the sudafed

213
00:07:25,009 --> 00:07:30,080
talking I do want to talk a little bit

214
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,110
about expectations a person can only

215
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:35,539
tell you what they know right this is

216
00:07:35,539 --> 00:07:37,729
the problem with torture if you will

217
00:07:37,729 --> 00:07:39,949
like if you torture someone this is this

218
00:07:39,949 --> 00:07:42,470
is the problem with torture right like

219
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:44,930
you are the ethical side of things but

220
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:47,750
the product that's created by torture is

221
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:50,180
that people will still make up just

222
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:51,620
to get out of an uncomfortable situation

223
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:53,030
and when you're being asked questions by

224
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:54,680
a security person it is like torture

225
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:57,380
right we we can I mean be socially

226
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:59,450
abrasive we can look funny like they

227
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:00,560
just want to get out of the room with us

228
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:07,520
so they will a few Wow I totally lost it

229
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,810
normally I could just roll but the

230
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:11,390
fever's just killing me today people

231
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:13,400
will ask the answer the question you ask

232
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,740
right but I've had people I have real

233
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:18,110
 friends that when you ask them

234
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:19,970
the question they will only answer the

235
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:21,650
specific question you ask even if your

236
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:24,440
intent was broader like you know are you

237
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:24,920
hungry

238
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:30,130
yes would you like something to eat yes

239
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:32,630
would you like a burger no okay we're

240
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:33,799
just going on a new raid all the food

241
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:35,690
the right question is what would you

242
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:37,490
like to eat right like it's not a

243
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:38,990
confusing question but I have friends

244
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:40,190
who were total it will just

245
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:42,830
answer the direct question I also have a

246
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:44,540
friend that if you throw something at

247
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:46,130
him and you don't say catch and he

248
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:47,360
acknowledges it first I'll let him hit

249
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,800
it hit you in the chest and fall there

250
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,750
ground right it could be a Faberge egg

251
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:52,460
and if you say catch and he doesn't say

252
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:54,110
yes it'll bounce off his chest and hit

253
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:56,060
the ground I have some real

254
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:59,990
friends so this is that's all the same

255
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:03,970
friends actually I have one friend

256
00:09:05,309 --> 00:09:08,649
people bring a lot to the table you need

257
00:09:08,649 --> 00:09:10,540
to be aware of the first is they bring

258
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:12,339
their personal experience I fail at this

259
00:09:12,339 --> 00:09:14,829
all the time right I people tend to

260
00:09:14,829 --> 00:09:16,329
believe that their experiences are

261
00:09:16,329 --> 00:09:18,369
everyone's experiences that what you've

262
00:09:18,369 --> 00:09:20,019
gone through in life is the same thing

263
00:09:20,019 --> 00:09:21,369
that everyone's gone through in life I

264
00:09:21,369 --> 00:09:23,799
had a really insane childhood growing up

265
00:09:23,799 --> 00:09:25,480
in upstate New York

266
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:28,720
a lot of weird things that we did that I

267
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,519
assumed every other high school went

268
00:09:30,519 --> 00:09:35,589
through like we would stories too long I

269
00:09:35,589 --> 00:09:37,269
can tell you but the reality is I made

270
00:09:37,269 --> 00:09:38,499
some horrible life decision that in

271
00:09:38,499 --> 00:09:39,669
hindsight I'm happy to have lived

272
00:09:39,669 --> 00:09:41,230
through and I assume every other high

273
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:43,089
schooler did the same thing that idea we

274
00:09:43,089 --> 00:09:44,829
ran from the cops we played with too

275
00:09:44,829 --> 00:09:47,079
many explosives we played with too many

276
00:09:47,079 --> 00:09:49,149
guns and all kinds of other things in

277
00:09:49,149 --> 00:09:51,399
whatever and and it none of us died

278
00:09:51,399 --> 00:09:52,899
right and we're like oh that's the way

279
00:09:52,899 --> 00:09:54,399
everyone's life goes well it turns out

280
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:55,989
it's not so you have to be aware of

281
00:09:55,989 --> 00:09:57,189
other people's biases what their

282
00:09:57,189 --> 00:09:59,169
backgrounds are the other thing is

283
00:09:59,169 --> 00:10:00,730
personal biases due to their

284
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:02,799
socio-economic position their gender

285
00:10:02,799 --> 00:10:05,619
their race you know geography things

286
00:10:05,619 --> 00:10:07,209
like that those personal biases come

287
00:10:07,209 --> 00:10:09,579
into play this industry is phenomenally

288
00:10:09,579 --> 00:10:11,799
white male dominated and we have to be

289
00:10:11,799 --> 00:10:13,059
aware of that when you're going down

290
00:10:13,059 --> 00:10:14,139
this road and you're asking questions

291
00:10:14,139 --> 00:10:15,519
that people are coming from different

292
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:17,589
positions with different sense of

293
00:10:17,589 --> 00:10:20,289
priorities different sense of you know

294
00:10:20,289 --> 00:10:21,730
the things that they feel are important

295
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:23,259
you have to be aware of that when you're

296
00:10:23,259 --> 00:10:24,819
asking the questions finally their own

297
00:10:24,819 --> 00:10:26,949
personal reality the way the world works

298
00:10:26,949 --> 00:10:29,199
is sometimes different than the way you

299
00:10:29,199 --> 00:10:32,109
think the world works there is no I will

300
00:10:32,109 --> 00:10:34,720
say this equivocally equivocally global

301
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,389
conspiracy to scatter chemicals from

302
00:10:37,389 --> 00:10:39,339
every commercial aircraft in the world

303
00:10:39,339 --> 00:10:40,869
all over the planet for mind-control

304
00:10:40,869 --> 00:10:42,850
purposes they're doing it for other

305
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:48,879
reasons so now we cross the chemtrail

306
00:10:48,879 --> 00:10:51,089
bridge things are about to get serious

307
00:10:51,089 --> 00:10:53,319
when I talk to someone when I go through

308
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:55,899
this process I think of I don't bend

309
00:10:55,899 --> 00:10:57,879
them like I don't like put a label on a

310
00:10:57,879 --> 00:10:59,470
person but I start to think about how

311
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:00,850
I'm gonna engage them based on their

312
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:02,470
their character traits are you an

313
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:04,509
introvert or extrovert are you guilty

314
00:11:04,509 --> 00:11:05,679
there are people who have like

315
00:11:05,679 --> 00:11:08,379
legitimately built insecure systems and

316
00:11:08,379 --> 00:11:10,389
they know it right they're like wow this

317
00:11:10,389 --> 00:11:11,769
thing sucks and the security guy is

318
00:11:11,769 --> 00:11:14,169
gonna rip me apart right there's also

319
00:11:14,169 --> 00:11:15,789
people who have tried really hard but

320
00:11:15,789 --> 00:11:17,140
still think they haven't done

321
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:19,720
the guilty feeling right I have made a

322
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:22,540
thing that I think is really bad reality

323
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:23,620
is it's actually probably pretty good

324
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:24,970
because they thought about the security

325
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:26,470
from the beginning and they haven't

326
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:28,180
actually gone through to have it tested

327
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:30,670
yet the know it all know it nothing you

328
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:31,839
know there's people who think that the

329
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:33,880
coolest people in the room there's

330
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,950
people that are too busy oftentimes the

331
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:37,120
people are too busy the people you need

332
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,529
to talk to because they're the ones that

333
00:11:38,529 --> 00:11:39,820
actually hold all the institutional

334
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:41,110
knowledge that you need to get your

335
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:43,300
hands on so each of those require their

336
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:45,370
own approach in reality all we're trying

337
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:48,339
to do here is exploit human nature its

338
00:11:48,339 --> 00:11:50,260
social engineering I'm not gonna bore

339
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:51,610
you here you all are familiar with

340
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:53,170
social engineering all you're trying to

341
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:54,490
do is social engineering your way to

342
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:56,829
find weaknesses in the system so the

343
00:11:56,829 --> 00:11:59,950
first thing you want to do this is a one

344
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:02,350
of the posters from The Sting I highly

345
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:03,459
encourage you if you haven't watched

346
00:12:03,459 --> 00:12:04,660
this thing recently because you don't

347
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:06,459
watch ABC on the weekends or whenever

348
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:07,720
the hell loose they show this thing

349
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:10,209
anymore please go watch it it's actually

350
00:12:10,209 --> 00:12:12,579
a fantastic movie but the setup of

351
00:12:12,579 --> 00:12:14,860
having a place to interview a person to

352
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:17,500
talk to them that is comfortable that is

353
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,480
familiar to them that puts them at ease

354
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:23,290
is very important also if possible have

355
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:25,029
a note taker in the room that's not you

356
00:12:25,029 --> 00:12:27,730
right have video and audio recordings

357
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:29,010
that people are comfortable with that

358
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:31,600
the note-taking thing is is interesting

359
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,730
I when I take my own notes I get lost

360
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:35,589
going back and forth between the process

361
00:12:35,589 --> 00:12:38,019
I run one of the things I do at work is

362
00:12:38,019 --> 00:12:39,339
we were on instant response role-playing

363
00:12:39,339 --> 00:12:41,440
games where we sit down and pretend the

364
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,360
bad thing has happened and I Drive the I

365
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:46,209
our tabletop exercise with a customer

366
00:12:46,209 --> 00:12:48,040
and if I have to take notes while that's

367
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,690
going on I can't pay attention to the

368
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:51,279
game and I have a very hard time driving

369
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:52,600
it it's the same with these kind of

370
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,800
sessions if you're the one having to

371
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:54,850
take the notes and then ask the question

372
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:56,620
and take the notes you will lose track

373
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:57,640
of what's going on

374
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,260
let somebody else keep track of the

375
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:01,209
facts while you work through the

376
00:13:01,209 --> 00:13:02,579
questions that work through the process

377
00:13:02,579 --> 00:13:04,930
you have to make a determination pretty

378
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:06,760
early on is this going to be a group or

379
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:09,040
individual interview I'll often start as

380
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,570
group interviews just to build a

381
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:12,880
collective trust with everyone and

382
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,529
allows the group to start to click

383
00:13:14,529 --> 00:13:16,480
around whatever project we have like hey

384
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,560
we're just going to sit down and talk

385
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:18,820
about your product we're gonna sit down

386
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:20,260
and talk about your service as a group

387
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:22,570
and then like Antelope you're just going

388
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:23,980
to start to peel them away from the herd

389
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:25,569
right and have individual conversations

390
00:13:25,569 --> 00:13:27,819
not that they're really pray but that

391
00:13:27,819 --> 00:13:30,040
you know they're prey

392
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:32,230
and so you'll be able to then have

393
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:33,610
individual conversations where you can

394
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:35,890
build the trust not eat them out on the

395
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:38,920
Savannah and dig into the knowledge one

396
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,390
person at a time

397
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:43,330
okay so again these group discussions I

398
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:45,130
think are great in the early days but as

399
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:48,880
you dig more into the the process you

400
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,460
need to be having individual

401
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:53,080
conversations before you even get

402
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,670
started asking questions there are

403
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:57,070
techniques around elicitation where you

404
00:13:57,070 --> 00:14:00,790
can gather data from written word from

405
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:02,530
surveys from questionnaires from use

406
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:04,420
cases things like that this is the

407
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:06,520
business analytics universe right if you

408
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,020
go read Business Analytics literature

409
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:11,140
around elicitation this is their toolkit

410
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:12,790
right all of these things because

411
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:14,200
apparently they're inhuman they don't

412
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,640
want to actually talk to people so most

413
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,710
of what they do is fill out this form

414
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:19,480
which feels very British to me so I

415
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,900
don't know if they're all British or not

416
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:24,250
sorry to any business analysts that are

417
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:30,460
in the room or any Brits so good

418
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:32,110
questions before we get into specifics

419
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:33,970
of other questions here's a good

420
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:36,130
question tell me about how you handle

421
00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:39,250
authentication why is it good when it's

422
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:41,500
open-ended it allows the person to talk

423
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,600
openly about it it doesn't it doesn't

424
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,640
infer anything it just answered the

425
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:47,800
answer the question it doesn't apply any

426
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,960
facts about their authentication doesn't

427
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,970
imply any prior knowledge it's not

428
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:54,190
biased everything's very open at this

429
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:58,300
the problem is when you when you ask a

430
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:00,130
question like this oftentimes you'll get

431
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:04,330
an answer of we use passwords okay like

432
00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:06,970
that's some great knowledge of how your

433
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:09,040
entire authentication process works

434
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,560
right like I got three word answer out

435
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:13,330
of this and what I really wanted was

436
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:15,130
like a deep understanding of your

437
00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:16,810
architecture so when I ask this

438
00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:19,270
open-ended question clearly I'm not

439
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:21,340
going to get what I want and we're gonna

440
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:23,020
have to find other ways to get what we

441
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:24,670
need so the first thing I like to do

442
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:28,180
find a personal common ground this is

443
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:30,370
where you before you even start talking

444
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:31,780
to the person hey where are you from

445
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:33,190
where'd you go to college what'd you

446
00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:35,320
study where you start to try to build

447
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:37,270
just a

448
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:38,950
rapport with a person so that they can

449
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:40,480
trust you right when you come in as an

450
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,920
outsider even if you're inside the

451
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,140
organization if you're doing red teaming

452
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:45,250
or whatever inside the organization

453
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:46,420
you're doing product assessment inside

454
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:48,790
the organization they're gonna view you

455
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:51,580
as an adversary right when you're

456
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:54,130
assessing a product or a service you're

457
00:15:54,130 --> 00:15:55,900
pointing out the bad things that people

458
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:58,390
have done wrong I'm not necessarily

459
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:00,130
actually saying that that's true but

460
00:16:00,130 --> 00:16:02,170
that's gonna be their feeling about it

461
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:02,740
right

462
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:04,180
even though you're there to try to help

463
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:06,010
make their product better the reality is

464
00:16:06,010 --> 00:16:07,630
they're there you're an affront to them

465
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:10,300
right you were a danger to their job so

466
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:11,440
the first thing you need to do is like

467
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,960
hey we're all in this together I have

468
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:16,930
the same background I did stupid to

469
00:16:16,930 --> 00:16:19,410
whatever whatever it was

470
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:21,910
so the next thing start with easy

471
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:24,190
questions that should be easy tell me

472
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:25,750
about your job what do you do what would

473
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:28,600
you say you do here right builds

474
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:31,240
confidence gets the person to open up

475
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,100
it's probably not a useful discussion

476
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:35,410
right because you don't really care I

477
00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:36,580
mean you'll care a little bit but you

478
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:38,260
don't care a lot but you have to go

479
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:39,490
through to continue to build this

480
00:16:39,490 --> 00:16:44,080
rapport next thing leading questions sir

481
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:48,430
I don't know if I'm triggering that or

482
00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:50,790
it's just happening but I love it

483
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:53,560
someone hacked it yeah let's play with a

484
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:57,010
guy who's all walked out on meds so

485
00:16:57,010 --> 00:16:59,080
what's a leading question a leading

486
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:01,870
question implies facts right when did

487
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:04,300
you stop beating your wife implies that

488
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:06,609
you beat your wife at one point and then

489
00:17:06,609 --> 00:17:08,800
you stopped right those are actually two

490
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:11,260
separate facts you may still be abusing

491
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:13,270
your spouse or you may never have abuse

492
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:14,530
your spouse in the first place but the

493
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:16,329
question does not leave room for that

494
00:17:16,329 --> 00:17:18,490
interpretation right this is like the

495
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:21,040
canonical example of a leading question

496
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,650
now the thing with leading questions if

497
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:25,990
used correctly they're actually useful

498
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:29,230
because if you have an idea of where a

499
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:31,570
question where the answer lies you can

500
00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:33,250
lead the witness there but you need to

501
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:35,530
be aware that you're consciously doing

502
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:37,870
it right you use lots of unsafe

503
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:40,600
functions in your code right okay that

504
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,670
assumes that that they're trying to do

505
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:45,820
something with with safety or input

506
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:47,560
sanitization or something and they're

507
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:48,610
doing it incorrectly

508
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:50,830
right tell me about how you handle input

509
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:53,380
sanitization much more open-ended

510
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:55,420
question doesn't leave your developer

511
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:56,770
training seems useful to all your

512
00:17:56,770 --> 00:18:00,940
developers tell me more okay instead can

513
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:02,140
you explain your secure development

514
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:03,100
training on how you measure his

515
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:04,809
effectiveness right you're in the first

516
00:18:04,809 --> 00:18:06,070
part of that question you're implying

517
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:08,200
that there it's a it's effective we're

518
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,790
gonna run with that right there going

519
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:11,770
yes it is effective let me tell you how

520
00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:13,780
effective it is no no don't assume it's

521
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:14,500
effective or not

522
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,360
tell me about the training process tell

523
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:17,679
me about how you measure the

524
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:19,720
effectiveness then we'll go from there

525
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,250
you have four different versions your

526
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:23,290
API which is no now confusing your

527
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:26,169
customers why do you do that right maybe

528
00:18:26,169 --> 00:18:28,510
it's not confusing you're implying the

529
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:29,890
fact there that they've screwed up

530
00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:31,390
because they have so many versions or

531
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:32,890
API now in space it's probably pretty

532
00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:35,500
pretty stupid but how do you handle

533
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,059
multiple concurrent versions your API

534
00:18:37,059 --> 00:18:39,220
these are just some examples but the

535
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:41,710
idea here is you can ask a question that

536
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:43,150
leads someone to answer in a very

537
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:46,770
specific way and if you if you do that

538
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:49,210
you need to do it with purpose you need

539
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:51,280
to do it in a way that if you can't get

540
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,990
information out of someone if you have

541
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:55,390
someone who says tell me about your on a

542
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:57,640
phen occasion they say we use passwords

543
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,650
you get to start to lead them right if

544
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:02,650
if you if you don't have to do this I

545
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:04,299
would avoid doing it I'm guilty of this

546
00:19:04,299 --> 00:19:05,890
all the time I ask leading questions at

547
00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:07,390
work all the time I try to be very

548
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:09,880
conscious of not doing it but it's

549
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,320
something that takes I mean for me is

550
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:13,150
taking a lot of effort to take it away

551
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:17,169
from Nextup comparisons another useful

552
00:19:17,169 --> 00:19:18,910
kind of question does your logging

553
00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:20,590
system aggregate all its logs are they

554
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:22,419
stored in each host okay of an either/or

555
00:19:22,419 --> 00:19:25,330
question here this can help provide

556
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:27,280
focus for people because it's leading

557
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,320
right I'm only giving them two answers

558
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:31,690
but I'm giving them a comparison where

559
00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:32,950
the truth can lie somewhere in the

560
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:34,720
middle and then we can get down to that

561
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:37,210
process right so by making a comparison

562
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:40,000
between two options sometimes I can get

563
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,950
a person that I'm interviewing out of

564
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:43,570
the woods right because they're a little

565
00:19:43,570 --> 00:19:46,360
lost about what we're talking about but

566
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:47,860
sometimes also have to be aware that I

567
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:49,780
know I've led them and I have to make

568
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:50,980
sure that they're gonna answer me

569
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:55,390
honestly and openly next prior knowledge

570
00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:57,880
so this is the idea where I already

571
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:00,160
understood something like in this case I

572
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,169
understand I had to upgrade to Python 3

573
00:20:02,169 --> 00:20:04,359
you know whatever this is something

574
00:20:04,359 --> 00:20:06,159
where we have a common experience I have

575
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:07,570
prior knowledge about the system

576
00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:09,850
I share it it builds rapport it also

577
00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:12,460
allows me to then go ahead and build on

578
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:14,529
that knowledge with that person right so

579
00:20:14,529 --> 00:20:17,100
the idea of prior knowledge of the the

580
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:20,710
the situation allows the the the person

581
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:22,389
I'm interviewing to say yeah okay this

582
00:20:22,389 --> 00:20:23,739
person understands what I'm going

583
00:20:23,739 --> 00:20:26,019
through I'm gonna I'm gonna work with

584
00:20:26,019 --> 00:20:27,609
them now because I believe that they

585
00:20:27,609 --> 00:20:30,279
know what they're talking about another

586
00:20:30,279 --> 00:20:32,019
thing it's not really a question but we

587
00:20:32,019 --> 00:20:34,590
use all the time is the whiteboard right

588
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:36,609
can you draw a high-level description

589
00:20:36,609 --> 00:20:41,230
your your system sure right now this is

590
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:42,669
great for visual learners I've got

591
00:20:42,669 --> 00:20:44,109
people that have gone up and just

592
00:20:44,109 --> 00:20:45,789
written out like the most amazing like

593
00:20:45,789 --> 00:20:48,129
you know chart of all this stuff up on

594
00:20:48,129 --> 00:20:50,799
the whiteboard I've also had people that

595
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:52,480
couldn't draw a straight line if their

596
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,919
life depended on it they could not draw

597
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:57,730
a legible word ever I had one client who

598
00:20:57,730 --> 00:21:00,039
would just on the board right like he

599
00:21:00,039 --> 00:21:01,210
was writing words but he was just

600
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:03,940
scribbling literally just scribbling and

601
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:05,499
I knew that's all I was and I was there

602
00:21:05,499 --> 00:21:07,179
the co-worker once and they're like what

603
00:21:07,179 --> 00:21:09,220
is he saying what I can't read that and

604
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:10,749
like he literally just scribbles while

605
00:21:10,749 --> 00:21:13,239
he thinks like it is not actually a word

606
00:21:13,239 --> 00:21:14,710
he's like you're kidding me I'm like no

607
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:16,779
watch him all day long not a single

608
00:21:16,779 --> 00:21:18,730
letter in the English alphabet will come

609
00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:21,759
okay to do a just scribble on the board

610
00:21:21,759 --> 00:21:23,919
so most people can't draw you have to

611
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:27,070
accept that but sometimes it'll help the

612
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:28,359
conversation along

613
00:21:28,359 --> 00:21:31,809
next up parroting back super important

614
00:21:31,809 --> 00:21:33,220
right some of the most important things

615
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:36,879
I've I've had done as a consultant was

616
00:21:36,879 --> 00:21:38,950
parroting back and adding clarity to

617
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:41,259
concepts that customers had right I

618
00:21:41,259 --> 00:21:43,899
started a assessment of a company once

619
00:21:43,899 --> 00:21:46,090
and at a pretty large portfolio of

620
00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:48,519
products hello

621
00:21:48,519 --> 00:21:49,929
this might keeps cutting out on me I

622
00:21:49,929 --> 00:21:51,609
apologize I'll just yell really loud if

623
00:21:51,609 --> 00:21:53,980
I have to they're like a dozen different

624
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:56,799
products and just in the process of

625
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:58,840
proposing to them I came up with a

626
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:01,330
composed view of here's how all 12 your

627
00:22:01,330 --> 00:22:03,369
products fit together in a portfolio and

628
00:22:03,369 --> 00:22:06,039
they're like holy we didn't realize

629
00:22:06,039 --> 00:22:07,869
that like this added clarity like I

630
00:22:07,869 --> 00:22:09,519
would have paid you for the proposal

631
00:22:09,519 --> 00:22:11,349
like a like oh my god you don't know

632
00:22:11,349 --> 00:22:13,480
what you're building right but part of

633
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:15,530
art we do these things is

634
00:22:15,530 --> 00:22:18,740
be able to add that clarity and the only

635
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:20,360
way you can do that is if you compare I

636
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:23,030
heard a thing I'm gonna tell it to you

637
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:24,440
how I think I heard it and you can

638
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:26,540
correct me it can be time-consuming

639
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:29,120
because it's likes in a kind of thing

640
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,350
right like you're going back and forth

641
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:32,960
back and forth but the reality is super

642
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,840
important for people to be able to

643
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,970
basically agree yes that's what I said

644
00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:40,790
yes I agree that's what you said another

645
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:44,660
one play dumb right just feign a veer

646
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:46,910
it's like I've never heard a saml tell

647
00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:50,240
me more and and there are people who

648
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,860
will tell you tell you more right

649
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:53,150
they'll think like this is the greatest

650
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:54,530
thing ever I have a person who I get to

651
00:22:54,530 --> 00:22:58,310
educate today it will if you know if you

652
00:22:58,310 --> 00:22:59,660
really know something like a topic like

653
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:01,340
Samuel it will ferret out people who

654
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:02,600
really don't know anything because

655
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:05,660
sometimes you run into those if the

656
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:07,700
problem can be when you play dumb they

657
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:10,340
might just assume you're dumb right so

658
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:12,050
you have to use this technique kind of

659
00:23:12,050 --> 00:23:14,060
judiciously and an environment where

660
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:15,560
you're prepared like I may lose all

661
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,150
credibility with this person but

662
00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:18,740
sometimes it's the only way to break

663
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:23,780
down the barrier kind of as a corollary

664
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:26,600
say something false right say something

665
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:29,060
that you know not to be true and that

666
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:31,670
will get a response right it'll be a

667
00:23:31,670 --> 00:23:33,500
remote emotional responsibility of this

668
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:36,080
little visceral response which can be

669
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,550
good and bad because sometimes again

670
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:39,350
you'll lose credibility but often times

671
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:41,510
who re-engage people right you're 45

672
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:43,520
minutes into a interview session and you

673
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,830
really get this person to wake up so

674
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:47,330
what are you gonna do I'm gonna say

675
00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:49,100
something that's wrong and get them to

676
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:51,230
come at me right this is actually

677
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:53,000
something I think beetle I used to do

678
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,980
every once the war on stage is just to

679
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:57,080
stay things we knew are untrue to wait

680
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:59,150
for someone to call us out because that

681
00:23:59,150 --> 00:24:00,380
was like the greatest thing when people

682
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:02,300
actually you're wrong like correct we

683
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:04,160
are wrong thank you we know you're

684
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,870
paying attention

685
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:08,810
say something provocative like I love

686
00:24:08,810 --> 00:24:15,980
systemd Yeah right it could totally

687
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:18,620
derail a conversation unsurprisingly but

688
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:20,540
it has the same kind of effect right it

689
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:22,730
may it may not even true or false but

690
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:25,060
it's provocative it gets someone engaged

691
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:26,990
another thing you can do is volunteer

692
00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:29,070
information this is the

693
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:31,590
idea that quid pro quo which seems to be

694
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:33,059
a common phrase in our lexicon these

695
00:24:33,059 --> 00:24:35,940
days you know it can build trust they

696
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:37,259
realize you have something to give me

697
00:24:37,259 --> 00:24:39,360
something to give you we give and take

698
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:42,539
we go back and forth to more things that

699
00:24:42,539 --> 00:24:44,850
I'm gonna wrap it up this is something

700
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:46,039
that took me a while to understand

701
00:24:46,039 --> 00:24:48,570
because when I was young doing this I

702
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:50,279
thought I knew everything and I would

703
00:24:50,279 --> 00:24:51,899
talk I would fill all available space

704
00:24:51,899 --> 00:24:53,759
with words and I talk and I talk and I

705
00:24:53,759 --> 00:24:56,429
talk it's what I do I had to learn to

706
00:24:56,429 --> 00:24:58,860
shut the hell up and let people talk and

707
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:00,570
ask the question let him answer and then

708
00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:03,629
stare at them right because then they'll

709
00:25:03,629 --> 00:25:05,820
fill the void which is what you want

710
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:07,830
right you want them to continue talking

711
00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:10,379
so you end up giving them the

712
00:25:10,379 --> 00:25:12,330
opportunity to say more and say more and

713
00:25:12,330 --> 00:25:13,830
say more and that's what you're really

714
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:17,429
gunning for finally maybe not it's the

715
00:25:17,429 --> 00:25:19,049
last thing but the next that last thing

716
00:25:19,049 --> 00:25:20,639
and I'm gonna open though what else

717
00:25:20,639 --> 00:25:23,100
should I know because there's almost

718
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:24,600
always a thing that they've been waiting

719
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,610
to tell you but they didn't want to say

720
00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:28,320
it because they were waiting for you to

721
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,909
ask the right question and somehow you

722
00:25:29,909 --> 00:25:32,279
never asked the right question so say

723
00:25:32,279 --> 00:25:33,840
what else should I know

724
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,460
and that's they're cued be like there's

725
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:37,139
this thing I've been wanting to tell you

726
00:25:37,139 --> 00:25:40,559
about the authentication system ok and

727
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:42,629
you jump into that right don't do it is

728
00:25:42,629 --> 00:25:43,980
the last thing because if you find

729
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:45,509
something really materially interesting

730
00:25:45,509 --> 00:25:47,039
you only have 5 or 10 minutes ago in the

731
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:48,990
interview like you could run out of time

732
00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:51,210
and and not be able to dig in but do it

733
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:54,210
for the end and you'll get good results

734
00:25:54,210 --> 00:25:56,429
with that here's a list of techniques

735
00:25:56,429 --> 00:26:00,720
that just went over a list there the

736
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,580
Babcock elicitation model is pretty

737
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:04,500
useful the FBI elicitation brochure is

738
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:06,090
actually pretty interesting just google

739
00:26:06,090 --> 00:26:08,429
FBI elicitation brochure and I just

740
00:26:08,429 --> 00:26:10,129
checked today this confluence page on

741
00:26:10,129 --> 00:26:13,679
Cornell is now behind a user password

742
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:15,899
wall for some reason unfortunately Booya

743
00:26:15,899 --> 00:26:18,240
right anyway here's my contact info you

744
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,649
have any questions I'm gonna go back to

745
00:26:19,649 --> 00:26:21,610
watching Harry Potter movies thanks
