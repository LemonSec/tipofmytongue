helping to protect the privacy and the

38
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,040
security

39
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,320
of those in underserved populations

40
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,479
those who simply

41
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:44,479
normally wouldn't realize they can be

42
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:46,640
afforded those protections

43
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:47,759
her work in this realm is more than

44
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,799
commendable and we

45
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:54,560

i am here to talk to you a little bit

56
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:27,840
about how to build a snowman

57
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:30,000
i mean a threat lab uh welcome everybody

58
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,879
to cactus con the play along at home

59
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,599
edition

60
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:34,319
uh as you can see we are currently at

61
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:38,238
the eff

62
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:41,280
office slash my apartment and

63
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:43,200
out of deference to to tradition i am

64
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,319
wearing a gown but because these are

65
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:47,679
quarantine times

66
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:49,839
i am also wearing fuzzy slippers so

67
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:52,160
uh enough about my sartorial choices

68
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:55,280
let's uh let's talk fat labs

69
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:58,640
so usually around this time i ask

70
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:59,360
everybody to raise their hand if they

71
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:02,480
know

72
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:04,640
what eff is and in this case

73
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:06,000
that will not be happening so i'm just

74
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,200
going to assume that some people raise

75
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,280
their hands that some people aren't

76
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,200
entirely sure what eff is

77
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:13,040
that some people assume that we are a

78
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,720
t-shirt and sticker company

79
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,319
especially if you have been to a

80
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:17,200
conference where eff has a heavy

81
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:20,000
presence and

82
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:22,000
everybody is wearing eff t-shirts and no

83
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,599
one will explain to you

84
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,920
what they mean if you go to defcon

85
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:28,720
in las vegas you will see that eff is

86
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:32,238
essentially

87
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:35,440
the closest thing that hackers have to

88
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:38,319
a to a religious organization um

89
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:39,760
but uh we we have actual goals we are

90
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:40,640
we're a real thing and we do things

91
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:43,518
other than

92
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:45,440
making uh clever t-shirts and stickers

93
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:46,640
uh we are a digital civil liberties

94
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,400
organization

95
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:51,279
and our goal is to make sure that when

96
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:54,400
you go online your rights come with you

97
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:57,439
eff has been around since 1990.

98
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:59,200
uh i have not i was not there in 1990

99
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:03,280
i've been working at eff since

100
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:07,518
2007 which was a long enough time ago

101
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:10,640
and from the very beginning

102
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:14,400
eff was an organization that was

103
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:17,839
envisioned as a way of speaking

104
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:19,680
tech to power uh even back in 1990 when

105
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:20,719
the internet existed but the web was

106
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,880
sort of in its

107
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:28,400
nascent state we had a couple

108
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:31,919
of incidents that that led our founders

109
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:34,080
to believe that the government was not

110
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:34,960
very good at understanding the internet

111
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,440
uh where

112
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:39,280
data was going and how data was going

113
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:41,840
there and as our lives

114
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:42,479
have become increasingly digital that

115
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:46,159
there

116
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:49,199
was a risk that we would lose

117
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:52,479
our our rights to to privacy

118
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:55,199
and to security our right to

119
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:56,159
own the things that we buy and tinker

120
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:59,040
with them

121
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,520
our right uh to speak freely and to

122
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,199
speak

123
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,880
anonymously and to be able to

124
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:06,000
communicate with one another

125
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:09,199
in uh in a way that is safe and

126
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:12,320
that is safe specifically

127
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:13,759
from government eavesdropping

128
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:15,440
furthermore we understood that this

129
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:18,000
wasn't just going to be the u.s

130
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,800
government that was a problem a lot of

131
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,639
the time

132
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,320
if you're talking about digital civil

133
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:24,720
liberties and you're

134
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,840
okay with the u.s government having

135
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,960
certain powers

136
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:32,159
in order to spy on bad guys or

137
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:34,159
pedophiles or terrorists or pedophile

138
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,320
terrorists which i understand are a very

139
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:39,440
serious problem

140
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:41,680
you might not be okay with uh

141
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,880
the chinese government using the same

142
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:46,479
powers on

143
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:49,759
uh the residents of xinjiang uh

144
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:52,320
or uh you might not be okay

145
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:53,440
with the ethiopian government using

146
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:56,400
those powers

147
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:59,039
and that technology to spy on dissidents

148
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:02,239
who are living in washington dc

149
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:02,719
or the russian government using it to

150
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,319
spy

151
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:09,520
on supporters of alexei navalny or

152
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:12,560
any of uh putin's other uh

153
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:13,599
sort of political opponents you might

154
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:16,720
not be okay

155
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,840
with the uae or saudi arabia having

156
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:20,960
these powers

157
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:22,080
with countries with extremely bad human

158
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:24,560
rights records

159
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:26,080
that use these powers in order to

160
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:29,120
identify people

161
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:31,440
prevent them from speaking and sometimes

162
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:34,560
as in the case of our

163
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:36,719
research in syria you will see that they

164
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,680
that they use these powers to find

165
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,919
dissidents

166
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,840
and bring them to torture centers and

167
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:44,000
kill them so there is a very

168
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:46,318
strong link between the things that we

169
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,880
do online and the things that happen to

170
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:50,400
us

171
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:53,599
in the real world i in fact there was a

172
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:55,520
a documentary that came out several

173
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:57,120
years ago about the pirate bay and i

174
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:59,840
think it was peter soon

175
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:01,759
who got up in front of a court and said

176
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,560
that he was really offended by the term

177
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:04,960
irl

178
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,639
by the the notion that there is a

179
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,120
separation between the things that

180
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:09,599
happen

181
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,560
online and the things that happen in

182
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:13,759
real life

183
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:16,960
and increasingly our digital life is

184
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:20,000
our real life and as a result uh

185
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,799
eff's issues have really moved from the

186
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,120
periphery

187
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,400
from being a bunch of what the british

188
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,319
call boffins

189
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:28,159
from being you know tech nerds who get

190
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:30,639
stuff stuffed into lockers

191
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:32,240
to being at the at the center of

192
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:36,080
everyone's lives

193
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:39,120
um most people uh have

194
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,840
some sort of access to technology and

195
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:43,039
some sort of

196
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:44,799
experience with technology every day

197
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:47,520
we have cell phones we are carrying

198
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:50,800
tracking devices around in our pockets

199
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:54,560
we post to social media

200
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:58,000
where a a company controls the platform

201
00:07:54,560 --> 00:08:00,240
and decides who can and cannot speak

202
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,840
largely according to its own terms of

203
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:05,759
service

204
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:09,039
we have you know

205
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:10,000
services and and consumer goods

206
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:13,520
advertised

207
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:17,039
to us at all times sometimes

208
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:20,240
in especially insidious ways

209
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:23,759
that that we are not aware of and uh

210
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:26,879
eff is there to make sure that

211
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:30,240
your right

212
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:31,039
to privacy to security to free speech to

213
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,760
anonymity

214
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:34,479
to tinker with the stuff that you bought

215
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:39,039
to

216
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:41,120
be creative still exists

217
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:42,718
and it's really under threat uh it is

218
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,360
increasingly under threat

219
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:47,519
with uh with every passing year so we

220
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,800
found that our issues have really moved

221
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:52,959
from the periphery

222
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:55,920
uh to the center of everyone's lives

223
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:56,239
so i am going to talk a little bit about

224
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:59,360
the

225
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:02,720
the three ways in which eff usually

226
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:04,720
uh approaches these issues so

227
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:06,080
when all you have is a hammer every

228
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:09,600
problem looks like a nail

229
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:11,920
so eff has a sort of diverse

230
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,920
toolbox for dealing with digital civil

231
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:15,360
liberties issues because

232
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,360
different problems require different

233
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:20,480
approaches so we

234
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:23,519
have people who work for us who are

235
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:24,399
lawyers and we do what is called impact

236
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:26,720
litigation

237
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:27,839
usually at this point i would also reach

238
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,760
out and

239
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:31,120
ask the audience who here knows what

240
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,800
impact litigation is

241
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,160
and some people would raise their hands

242
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,519
and some people would not raise their

243
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:38,399
hands and then i would try to

244
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:39,600
explain impact litigation relatively

245
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:41,600
quickly

246
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,440
most people are familiar with the

247
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,880
american civil liberties union or the

248
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,680
aclu

249
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:48,959
the aclu does impact litigation in the

250
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:51,040
sense that they take on

251
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:52,560
cases that they think are going to

252
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:54,719
create good precedent

253
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,760
or that are going to allow them to

254
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:59,040
strike down

255
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:59,680
bad precedent and one of the reasons for

256
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:03,680
that

257
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:06,000
is to create an environment in which

258
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:07,040
we have greater legal protections and to

259
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,560
sort of push

260
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:11,839
the the borders of civil liberties out

261
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:14,079
rather than having them

262
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:15,839
shrink and this means that we have

263
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:17,040
lawyers and that they have lawyers that

264
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:20,640
take on cases

265
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:23,360
but that we take on cases that uh

266
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:24,880
where we're not merely representing our

267
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:27,519
client

268
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:29,040
but we think that the outcome of this

269
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:32,560
case is going

270
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:34,240
to have an impact beyond that client

271
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,680
that is going to have an impact on a

272
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,360
large number of people

273
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:39,279
that it's going to impact the way that

274
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:41,760
judges decide future cases

275
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:42,560
the way that legislation is drafted in

276
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:45,600
the future

277
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:46,319
and the conversation around a particular

278
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,480
issue

279
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,839
so that those are often the reasons that

280
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:52,399
we get involved

281
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:53,279
um when i go to hacker conferences it's

282
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:57,760
really common

283
00:10:53,279 --> 00:11:00,560
for people to think of eff as sort of

284
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:02,160
hacker lawyers in in the sense that if

285
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,959
you have questions about your security

286
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,199
research

287
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:06,560
or if you get into trouble doing your

288
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:09,279
security research or

289
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:10,959
doing responsible disclosure often uh

290
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:12,640
efs lawyers are the people that you will

291
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:15,920
call

292
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:18,480
we don't often end up directly

293
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:19,360
representing security researchers but we

294
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:22,720
advise them

295
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:23,200
really often uh and to that effect we

296
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,240
have

297
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:30,240
a program called coders rights

298
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:31,839
and you can contact info at eff.org

299
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,440
and they will put you through to the

300
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:36,480
coders rights attorneys

301
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:38,000
and if you have questions about how to

302
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,760
go about your research in a way that

303
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,320
will keep you from getting sued

304
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:43,040
how to release your research in a way

305
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:46,000
that will

306
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:47,040
keep you from getting sued uh and also

307
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,480
what to do

308
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:52,480
when the target of your research uh or

309
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:54,160
a platform on which you are releasing

310
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:57,760
your research or something

311
00:11:54,160 --> 00:12:00,800
associated with your research uh

312
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:02,959
starts threatening you legally so

313
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:05,120
there are a lot of things that we do

314
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:06,560
along those lines so we have this uh

315
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:10,800
this sort of

316
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:13,920
floor of uh

317
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:16,719
very angry and talented

318
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:17,199
uh attack lawyers i'm very excited about

319
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:20,720
them

320
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:24,399
uh they have done things like uh sue the

321
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:27,040
u.s government a lot um specifically

322
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:27,440
eff is probably best known around the

323
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:30,319
time

324
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:31,040
that i came work to work for them for

325
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:34,800
having

326
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:37,680
sued the nsa

327
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:38,000
over its warrantless wiretapping program

328
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,399
first

329
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,519
we sued at t because we did not have the

330
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:44,959
standing to sue

331
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:48,320
the nsa and then apparently

332
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:50,160
one of the motivations for edward

333
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:53,519
snowden's

334
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:55,839
leaks uh was that he wanted to help

335
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:57,360
our uh our lawsuit and the very first

336
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:59,120
document that was

337
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:01,360
uh that was released in the snowden

338
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:02,160
leaks was actually a document that

339
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:05,120
supported

340
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:07,279
our lawsuit uh against the against at t

341
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,839
and that made it possible for us to go

342
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:11,920
on

343
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:15,200
and sue the nsa for spying on everybody

344
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:18,880
we argued that the

345
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:21,920
that mass surveillance is a violation

346
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:24,160
of americans fourth amendment rights and

347
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:25,760
outside of the lawsuit in sort of a

348
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:29,920
broader sense

349
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:33,439
eff argues that mass surveillance

350
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:36,800
is a violation of everyone's rights

351
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:37,600
it is a violation of fundamental human

352
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:40,479
rights

353
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:42,240
i and uh to that end we have an

354
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:45,680
international department

355
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:48,800
uh eff's international team is uh

356
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:51,040
one of our you know most most wonderful

357
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:52,800
sort of growing sectors and one of the

358
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:56,000
reasons for that is because eff

359
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:57,920
started out as a primarily us-based

360
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,639
organization and for a very long time we

361
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:01,120
were thought of

362
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:02,000
as you know sort of those crazy

363
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,000
americans on the west

364
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
coast uh or sometimes those crazy

365
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,240
americans in dc or boston

366
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,959
but always people who are concerned with

367
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:14,320
american law with american companies

368
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:17,439
and who believed that the way

369
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:19,120
to really change the internet uh was to

370
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,959
influence american law and american

371
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:24,320
companies because so much of the

372
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:25,119
the internet lives here that's not true

373
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,959
anymore

374
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,399
uh and in fact that has not been true in

375
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:30,560
many years and that was one of the

376
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:33,760
reasons why we created our

377
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:36,959
our international team so uh eff

378
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:40,079
has an international team that uh

379
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:42,839
travels all over the world not right now

380
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:44,319
obviously but under under better

381
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:46,399
circumstances

382
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:48,240
they travel all over the world they're

383
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:51,040
concerned with policy

384
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,680
in uh the world outside of the united

385
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:54,480
states

386
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:55,359
especially in latin america for a very

387
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:58,320
long time

388
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:59,279
i was a sort of eff specialist in

389
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:02,560
eastern europe

390
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:03,279
and the post-soviet states we're very

391
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:06,319
interested

392
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:08,639
in the surveillance state

393
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:10,399
that has been forming in china in the

394
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:11,680
surveillance state that has been forming

395
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:14,720
in russia

396
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:18,479
in surveillance states and

397
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:19,360
sort of creepy behavior among countries

398
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:22,160
that are normally

399
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:24,560
thought to be u.s allies and therefore

400
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:28,639
don't get as much attention

401
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:31,279
places like saudi arabia and ethiopia

402
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:32,480
uh and of course uh places that are

403
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:35,519
thought to be you know

404
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:36,320
the west and therefore somehow above

405
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:39,680
criticism

406
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:42,320
of their human rights records so we

407
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:43,120
also are are looking at places like

408
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:45,680
canada

409
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,320
and looking at policies in the eu and

410
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:49,839
especially

411
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:52,399
uh eu member states uh and

412
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:53,199
and now the uk since it's no longer part

413
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:56,560
of the eu

414
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:57,758
and has some of the most alarming first

415
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:00,479
amendment law the

416
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:00,800
first event free speech law that that i

417
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,680
have

418
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:05,920
ever seen so we have uh we have this

419
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:08,000
international team

420
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:09,360
in addition to an international team we

421
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,240
have a team

422
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:13,440
of rabid attack activists uh people

423
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:16,560
whose job it is

424
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:18,800
to get people on the ground uh to get

425
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:20,479
people excited about the work that we're

426
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:23,199
doing sometimes

427
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:24,160
the answer to a problem is not to file a

428
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:26,639
lawsuit

429
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:27,279
sometimes uh people have to get out and

430
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:30,399
march

431
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:32,880
sometimes people need to file a uh

432
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:33,600
you know to send an angry letter

433
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:36,240
sometimes

434
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,440
people need to sign a petition sometimes

435
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,759
it's necessary

436
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:41,199
for people to do something to their

437
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:44,720
devices or to

438
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:46,160
contact a company or a platform

439
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,920
they're using to explain to them that

440
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:51,279
their users will have

441
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:54,479
no more of this behavior sometimes

442
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:57,279
a revolt among the engineers is

443
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:58,880
the is the best way to go and this is

444
00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:00,399
the kind of outreach that i love doing

445
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:04,319
more than anything else

446
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:06,480
because companies are not monoliths

447
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:07,839
corporations are not monoliths they are

448
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:10,160
made up of people

449
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:11,039
and the people who go to cactus con are

450
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:14,959
those people

451
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:18,720
the information security uh sort of

452
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:21,760
community is made up of those people

453
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:23,760
and we decide what our companies do uh

454
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,240
if you take a look at recent behaviors

455
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:27,280
by

456
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:30,480
by google and amazon uh

457
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:33,200
and um and apple

458
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:34,000
you will see that the times when they

459
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:38,080
have really

460
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:39,919
made concessions to human rights

461
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:41,840
to sort of doing the right thing it has

462
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:45,440
largely been as the result of

463
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:47,120
a revolt among their engineers

464
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:49,360
one of the arguments that i hear really

465
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:51,120
often about not speaking up

466
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:53,600
in your job is that tech is not

467
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:55,439
political and that's simply not true

468
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,719
everything is political everything that

469
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,640
you do is political

470
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:00,000
and as an information security

471
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:03,360
practitioner your work

472
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,679
is especially political i mean i

473
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:07,439
i'm not a person who brings up the you

474
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:08,240
know world war ii or nazis or the

475
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:11,600
holocaust

476
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:13,679
flippantly but

477
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:15,678
not everybody who lived in germany

478
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:17,840
during world war ii was a nazi but

479
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:18,960
somebody still had to you know build the

480
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,959
machines

481
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,720
and if you refused to build the machines

482
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:24,799
and you refused to build the software

483
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:28,160
some of which was built

484
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:30,480
in the united states by ibm then

485
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:31,440
the work will not get done it is not as

486
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:34,080
if some other

487
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,480
engineer will rise up to take your place

488
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,240
uh

489
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:38,640
one of the things that i really want to

490
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:40,559
see engineers do

491
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:42,640
both now and in the future and some of

492
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:44,559
the best work that we're capable of

493
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:46,480
is changing the norms around what is

494
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:49,918
acceptable

495
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:52,559
and finally we have our tech team

496
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:53,520
and this is the the team that i am a

497
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:56,639
member of

498
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:58,559
uh sometimes the answer to

499
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:00,480
what what are you going to do about this

500
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:04,000
about this great ill

501
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:04,640
on the internet is actually to build an

502
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,679
app

503
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:11,200
uh or a web extension

504
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:12,799
or to explain how encryption works to

505
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:15,760
members of congress

506
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:16,639
or to give privacy and security advice

507
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:19,440
to people

508
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:21,120
all around the world uh or to sit down

509
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,760
with companies and talk to them about

510
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,840
how

511
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:25,200
they can provide greater privacy and

512
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:28,639
security

513
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:32,080
against authoritarian governments

514
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:32,880
or companies that are you know screen

515
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:35,520
scraping

516
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:37,280
or anything else that they they might be

517
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,160
concerned about and also to bring up new

518
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:41,360
concerns

519
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:43,679
uh like how they can serve

520
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:45,360
broader communities one of the big

521
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:48,400
problems that we have

522
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:48,959
in uh sort of in information security

523
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,919
and

524
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:52,799
you know in in tech in general is that

525
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:55,120
we

526
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:56,799
build platforms and we build tools for

527
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:58,959
people like ourselves

528
00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:00,480
uh and the majority of people who work

529
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:04,000
in information security

530
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:06,559
are sort of white and middle class and

531
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,559
living in what is euphemistically

532
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:10,559
referred to as the west

533
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:12,399
but i mostly think of as santa clara

534
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:15,840
california

535
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:18,480
and that leads to products

536
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:19,120
that work really well for you know kind

537
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:22,320
of

538
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:24,158
middle class straight cis men who live

539
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:26,799
in santa clara california

540
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:28,159
but the world is bigger than that and

541
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:31,440
other people have

542
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:34,559
other kinds of problems and if we think

543
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:38,080
of their problems as edge cases

544
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:40,799
as things that happen um you know as as

545
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:42,720
exceptions rather than the rule we build

546
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:44,559
products that simply do not work for

547
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:47,679
them and that let them down

548
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:48,240
in really frightening ways that often

549
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:51,280
have

550
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:53,840
a direct effect on

551
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:55,280
their everyday lives so that's one of

552
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:56,240
the reasons why the tech team is so

553
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:58,799
important

554
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:00,480
um a few of the the tech team projects

555
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:03,600
that you might be familiar with

556
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:06,159
uh include https everywhere

557
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:09,120
a very long time ago i think five maybe

558
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:11,360
even six years ago at the dawn of time

559
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:13,439
dinosaurs roamed the earth and most of

560
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:16,559
the web was unencrypted

561
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:19,600
i and so eff built a

562
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:20,720
web extension that made sure that if a

563
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:24,480
website

564
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:27,760
was capable of using https

565
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:29,039
that it would serve its contents over

566
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:32,080
https

567
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:33,039
by default um since then thanks to

568
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:36,399
another one of our

569
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:38,400
uh projects cert bot uh the web

570
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,679
is largely encrypted in transit

571
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:42,640
something like 80

572
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:44,080
of all internet traffic is now served

573
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:46,000
over https

574
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:47,840
and i'm really excited about that

575
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,720
because i remember a time when it was

576
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,959
trivial

577
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:53,039
for authoritarian governments and indeed

578
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:56,640
unauthoritarian governments

579
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:59,440
to see what we were doing online and

580
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:00,480
they spent a lot of time you know man in

581
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:04,480
the middling traffic

582
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:06,320
to email or to your various various

583
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:09,440
social media platforms

584
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:10,399
um one of the other things that our tech

585
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:13,440
team has really

586
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:14,880
uh championed is certificate

587
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:17,679
transparency

588
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:19,600
because obviously once the governments

589
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:20,480
were no longer able to just man in the

590
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:23,840
middle traffic

591
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:26,400
by by controlling the telcos

592
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:28,240
they started man in the middling

593
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,720
certificates they started issuing safe

594
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:32,320
uh

595
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:35,840
fake certificates uh in order to

596
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:38,879
decrypt the ssh traffic and thanks to

597
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:39,600
certificate uh transparency that would

598
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:42,240
be

599
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,879
visible almost immediately after it

600
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:46,080
happens

601
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:50,240
and people can simply stop trusting

602
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:53,678
uh the certificate probably the most um

603
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:54,080
noteworthy case of uh of that happening

604
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:56,880
was

605
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:58,320
uh with a european company called uh

606
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:01,440
diginotar

607
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:04,080
uh and i think it was belgium

608
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,720
so we have uh we have our tech team and

609
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:08,480
then

610
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:11,520
within the tech team we have a tiny

611
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:12,480
group of commandos uh there's there's

612
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:15,840
five of us

613
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:19,280
and uh and we are called the threat lab

614
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:22,320
uh in threat lab was founded

615
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:26,240
about three years ago

616
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:28,799
by me and my colleagues

617
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:29,280
i and the reason why we founded threat

618
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:32,320
lab

619
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:32,799
was that we had found ourselves doing a

620
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:35,918
lot

621
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:38,320
of security research which was not

622
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:41,440
unusual for eff

623
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:42,320
but the security research that we chose

624
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:46,640
to do

625
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:50,320
was uh mostly about internet censorship

626
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:54,320
and that led us to do work on

627
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:56,399
on apts so i spent several years

628
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:58,559
studying the behavior and writing

629
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:01,200
reports about the behavior

630
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:02,158
of various advanced persistent threat

631
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,919
actors

632
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:05,840
which is you know just our fancy way

633
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:09,200
usually of saying governments

634
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:13,199
um i wrote reports about

635
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:16,960
uh threat actors in vietnam

636
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:20,240
i in kazakhstan in lebanon

637
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:22,720
uh and and syria uh

638
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:23,760
as i mentioned before a lot of these a

639
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:27,120
lot of these things

640
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:28,799
resulted in you know real physical harm

641
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:30,719
to people which was one of the reasons

642
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:33,600
that i concentrated on it

643
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:35,600
and at the time the information security

644
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:38,158
world was not really interested

645
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:39,120
in malware that was targeting

646
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:42,559
journalists

647
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:44,399
or activists or lawyers

648
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:46,000
or you know other kinds of dissidents

649
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:49,600
they were not interested in

650
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:51,360
the um in the malware that was targeting

651
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:55,760
people who spoke truth to power

652
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:58,799
and the reason for that was because

653
00:24:55,760 --> 00:25:00,158
activists and journalists and and

654
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:03,760
dissidents of all kinds

655
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:04,640
have no money it is a really big deal to

656
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:07,039
write reports

657
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:08,559
about threats to enterprises especially

658
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:10,320
if you are doing it in order to prove

659
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:12,559
how useful you are

660
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:15,039
to enterprises so that you can sell

661
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:16,559
enterprise software

662
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:18,640
and this is one of the reasons why

663
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:19,918
nobody cared if if somebody was

664
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:23,200
targeting syrians

665
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:24,240
and sending them off to to camps to be

666
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:27,200
tortured

667
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:28,000
nobody cared if the ethiopian government

668
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:31,279
was spying

669
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:34,720
on ethiopian uh you know

670
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:37,600
exiles living in washington dc uh

671
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:39,120
no one spent a lot of time worrying

672
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:42,320
about what was happening

673
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:45,520
to uh you know

674
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:48,879
lebanese journalists or activists

675
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:51,520
because it there was no money in it

676
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:52,080
uh not only was there no money in it but

677
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:54,158
the

678
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:56,080
uh the malware that was targeting them

679
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:59,039
was not very sophisticated

680
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:59,600
uh when you see infosec companies at

681
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:02,799
least

682
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:03,600
at the time uh write reports about eight

683
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:05,760
pts

684
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:07,120
they started with apt-1 they started

685
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:10,158
with china

686
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:13,279
they started with china trying

687
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:15,919
or succeeding at uh compromising

688
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:16,720
the the new york times there was a lot

689
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:20,080
of interest

690
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:22,480
in chinese hacking against google there

691
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:24,320
was a lot of interest in you know sort

692
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:26,960
of uh

693
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:29,760
in russian apts all of the sudden uh

694
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:33,400
somewhere around 2016 for some reason

695
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:35,039
uh and now if you go out into a room of

696
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:37,840
non-infosec people

697
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:38,320
there are actually people who know what

698
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:41,520
you know

699
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:44,080
cozy bear and fancy bear are who

700
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:45,200
will not just look at you blankly when

701
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:48,080
you say apt

702
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:50,000
28 or apt-29 i mean they're not gonna

703
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:52,960
know what apt32 is but

704
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,320
you know this is this is the an example

705
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:57,279
of how much

706
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:57,760
uh this this language has entered the

707
00:26:57,279 --> 00:27:00,880
kind of

708
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:02,799
normal person lexicon um but

709
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:04,320
when we were first doing this work that

710
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:07,918
simply wasn't the case

711
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:11,760
uh people did work on you know

712
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:14,480
north korea uh and uh sort of other

713
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:15,360
non-big five actors occasionally uh

714
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:17,919
israel

715
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:20,080
but the reason that they did that work

716
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:23,120
was to show off their chops

717
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:23,760
uh because these were you know sort of

718
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:26,479
the

719
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:27,360
best most sophisticated most you know

720
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:30,880
kind of prolific

721
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:32,479
actors in the uh in the field a security

722
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:35,760
company could prove that they were good

723
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:40,159
simply by saying listen i i found

724
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:43,440
five eyes i have you know here is regin

725
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:45,279
the software which is being used uh to

726
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:46,640
you know the malware which is being used

727
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:50,080
by uh

728
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:54,720
gchq which is uh the british

729
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:57,760
uh sort of spy agency

730
00:27:54,720 --> 00:28:01,520
here is the malware which is being used

731
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:04,640
by the cia or the nsa

732
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:07,840
or again the fsb

733
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:11,120
or svu uh that is a

734
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:12,959
that is a flex as the kids say

735
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:15,120
uh whereas the sort of stuff that i was

736
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:18,159
looking at was actually very simple

737
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:21,439
and it was very rarely

738
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:24,399
using odays it was often using

739
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:24,880
you know straight up fishing the most

740
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:28,000
the most

741
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:28,640
basic and and boring stuff in the

742
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,360
universe

743
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:32,159
but it was effective and it was having a

744
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:35,678
real effect

745
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:38,960
on the uh on the lives of

746
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:39,600
uh of people in uh in authoritarian

747
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,360
countries

748
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:43,199
and often people who had fled

749
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:45,439
authoritarian countries who were still

750
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:48,559
trying to communicate with the people

751
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:49,360
in uh in those countries who are trying

752
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:54,720
to do work

753
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:54,719
or speak up to to power in some way

754
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:59,600
so we had we had this kind of work and

755
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:03,360
we we needed a place to put it

756
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:06,399
uh then we also got interested

757
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:09,520
in uh sort of other

758
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:12,239
types of uh of targets

759
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:14,000
uh for example and other types of

760
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:17,120
technologies for example my

761
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:20,320
uh colleague cooper quinton

762
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:21,840
along with another researcher from from

763
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:25,840
google

764
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:29,120
worked on a project in which he

765
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:32,158
described the ways in which

766
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:36,158
the police were using

767
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:38,240
cell site simulators or mz catchers

768
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:39,440
and at the time there had been a lot of

769
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:42,159
research done

770
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:43,120
on uh sort of the the older version of

771
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:46,080
mz catchers

772
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:47,678
but there wasn't a lot being done on the

773
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:49,199
kind of next generation and the kind of

774
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:51,200
technology that was being

775
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,559
that was being used at the time uh

776
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:55,679
stingrays uh

777
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:57,760
for example were out of fashion uh and

778
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:59,360
we uh believed that hail storms were

779
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:02,399
sort of the new hotness

780
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:06,080
so we spent a bunch of time uh studying

781
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:07,199
how they worked and uh our cell site

782
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:10,559
simulator

783
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:13,520
uh sort of project

784
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:13,918
for uh for finding them uh based on sort

785
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:17,840
of

786
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:20,399
aberrant behavior um you know in the

787
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:22,399
i is is available on github in fact all

788
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:25,360
of the software that we write

789
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:26,559
is open source we take contributions

790
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:29,360
from everybody

791
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:30,799
anybody can fork we're always very very

792
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:33,760
excited about it

793
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:35,039
so if you are looking for a way to get

794
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:37,360
involved

795
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:39,120
with eff or its projects i strongly

796
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:42,320
recommend taking a look at our github

797
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:44,719
and making some

798
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:46,320
contributions if you feel that you are

799
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:48,880
not yet ready for prime time

800
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:50,080
and you are afraid of the judging eyes

801
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:53,760
of

802
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:54,639
eff staff it's also good to look at the

803
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:56,720
code simply to

804
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:58,080
learn how to do this stuff in the first

805
00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:00,799
place uh

806
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:02,559
eff is really deeply opposed to the

807
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:06,240
notion of gatekeeping

808
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:07,840
if we don't inspire uh new software

809
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:10,799
engineers and we don't

810
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:11,760
inspire new security researchers then

811
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:15,600
then there will not

812
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:16,480
be a new generation of people to do this

813
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:19,678
stuff

814
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:21,120
if we climb up and we just pull up the

815
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:23,600
ladder behind us

816
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:24,559
uh then then no one will come and we

817
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:26,158
will be standing

818
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:28,000
at the top of whatever it is that ladder

819
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:29,519
was allowing us to climb to wondering

820
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,720
why it is so empty

821
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:36,640
uh so i really strongly encourage you

822
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:39,919
to to take a look at our github um

823
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:42,960
so where were we uh we were on

824
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:45,519
mzcatchers so we spent some time talking

825
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:46,080
talking about that we published a uh a

826
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:49,039
paper

827
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:50,399
on on how those mz catchers and cell

828
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:52,559
site simulators work

829
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:54,080
uh called gotta catch em all because we

830
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:56,320
love pokemon

831
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:58,000
and we also worked on some other

832
00:31:56,320 --> 00:32:00,879
projects

833
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:02,399
probably about last year people became

834
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:05,840
for some strange reason

835
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:08,399
uh very interested in the kind of

836
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:12,158
technologies that police had access to

837
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:13,279
in order to spy on activists inside of

838
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:15,039
the united states

839
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:17,279
and specifically the kind of

840
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:21,760
technologies that they were using to spy

841
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:24,559
on on protests and on protest movements

842
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:26,240
it turns out that you can file freedom

843
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:29,279
of information requests

844
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:30,799
and find out a lot of information about

845
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:32,720
the kind of stuff that

846
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:34,000
that various local police departments

847
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:38,559
are buying

848
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:42,159
and so uh my colleague dave moss

849
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:45,840
organized large groups of volunteers

850
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:46,159
mostly college students to go ahead and

851
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:49,918
look

852
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:52,480
into the to look into these purchases

853
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:53,919
and we mapped them out we mapped out the

854
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,880
different kinds of technologies and we

855
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:56,960
mapped them out

856
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:58,000
all over the state and this particular

857
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:00,720
project

858
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:03,600
is called the atlas of surveillance one

859
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:07,840
of the places that we really emphasized

860
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:09,439
because threat lab is so focused on

861
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:11,360
sort of centering the needs of

862
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:13,519
vulnerable populations

863
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:15,039
was the border the u.s border with

864
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:17,760
mexico and so we went

865
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:19,679
we went down to the border and we spent

866
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:21,440
a lot of time looking into the

867
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:23,799
technology which is being used

868
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:25,120
there because technology is being

869
00:33:23,799 --> 00:33:27,200
disproportionately

870
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:29,360
uh used there and it is

871
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:32,000
disproportionately being used

872
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:32,559
to uh to target people of color to

873
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,840
target

874
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:38,480
uh immigrants to target uh refugees

875
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:39,199
and uh we're especially concerned about

876
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,799
that so

877
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:42,320
knowing what kind of technology is there

878
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:45,600
is very important um

879
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:47,360
it's also the first step uh to allowing

880
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:48,639
people to protect themselves from this

881
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:50,840
sort of technology

882
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:52,320
to protesting the use of these

883
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:55,600
technologies

884
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:58,799
in your sort of immediate vicinity

885
00:33:55,600 --> 00:34:01,760
uh one of the the most interesting

886
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:03,039
bits of activism the eff has has done

887
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:06,480
recently

888
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:07,360
has been a campaign against the

889
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:10,560
government use

890
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:12,879
of a face surveillance technologies

891
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:13,679
and our suggestion is simply that face

892
00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:15,279
technology

893
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:16,879
face surveillance technologies and face

894
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:20,399
identification technologies

895
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:23,879
because they are so bad at what they do

896
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:27,679
and are are so biased towards

897
00:34:23,879 --> 00:34:29,918
misidentifying uh people of color

898
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:31,760
that governments should not be using

899
00:34:29,918 --> 00:34:33,359
them and specifically local governments

900
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:35,040
should not be using them and so

901
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:37,520
we worked with a lot of grassroots

902
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:40,879
organizations and have helped

903
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:43,520
to sort of create these bans

904
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:44,560
on uh on the use of facial recognition

905
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:48,159
technology

906
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:51,679
by uh by police and by governments in

907
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:55,200
in san francisco in oakland in

908
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:56,639
uh in cities in massachusetts and this

909
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:58,160
sort of thing is you know kind of

910
00:34:56,639 --> 00:35:01,040
kind of spreading throughout the country

911
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:03,680
which i'm very excited about

912
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:04,240
um and finally there's there's the work

913
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:06,799
that i'm

914
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:08,879
usually known best for uh which was so

915
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:12,240
while i was doing all of this apt work

916
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:13,680
uh i uh was working with another

917
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:17,279
security researcher

918
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:21,118
who turned out to be a serial rapist

919
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:24,240
and i uh was really

920
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:25,200
really mad and so one of the things that

921
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:28,959
i did

922
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:32,160
after i was i i read about it and i

923
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:35,359
read an interview with one of his

924
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:37,520
uh sort of survivors slash victims and

925
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:38,960
she was really scared one of the the

926
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:39,680
things that really touched me about this

927
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:42,720
interview

928
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:43,520
was that she was worried that he was

929
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:45,680
going to

930
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:47,440
hack her devices that he was going to

931
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:50,399
install you know stalker wear

932
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:52,480
on her phone or on her computer and

933
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:56,320
apparently he had threatened to do so

934
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:59,359
and so i tweeted that if there was a

935
00:35:56,320 --> 00:36:02,079
woman who had been sexually assaulted by

936
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:03,119
a hacker and was worried about the state

937
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:06,160
of her devices

938
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:07,920
that she could contact me and that i

939
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,480
would make sure that she got you know

940
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:11,520
sort of the

941
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:12,240
the forensics examination that she

942
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:16,000
needed

943
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:19,200
uh for her device and this tweet blew up

944
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:21,520
and in fact i still uh

945
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:22,319
this week i have been getting somewhere

946
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:25,680
between

947
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:27,920
six and a dozen requests a day

948
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:29,279
which is a little bit exhausting but one

949
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:31,760
of the things that i discovered was that

950
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:34,079
most of the time it's not stalkerware

951
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:35,440
most of the time people really just need

952
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:36,800
to lock down

953
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:38,240
lock down their accounts they need to be

954
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:39,200
able to change their passwords and

955
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:42,560
generally i found

956
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:46,960
that the problem was much bigger

957
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:50,960
than than just stalker ware that it was

958
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:54,000
that our real problem was a belief

959
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:58,720
in the information security field that

960
00:36:54,000 --> 00:37:02,000
somehow spying on devices that belong to

961
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:04,399
your spouse or that belong to an ex

962
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,920
or that belong to one of your partners

963
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:07,359
in order to discover whether or not

964
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:08,079
they're cheating or to maintain some

965
00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:09,920
sort of control

966
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:11,680
over them because you don't trust them

967
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:14,960
is somehow okay

968
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:17,040
and it's not so i've been

969
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:18,400
spending a lot of time working on

970
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:21,839
changing that norm

971
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:23,040
and also encouraging av companies to

972
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:26,000
treat

973
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:26,960
stalkerware as malware as potentially

974
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:30,000
unwanted

975
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:32,480
programs on people's devices i

976
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,359
also go around talking to companies

977
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:36,880
about

978
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:39,200
the domestic abuse use case

979
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:39,920
uh in the same way that we spent a lot

980
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:42,720
of time

981
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:44,079
trying to convince people that that

982
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:46,319
journalists matter

983
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:47,520
and that their safety is not an edge

984
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:49,520
case

985
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:51,200
and that activists matter and their

986
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:53,280
safety is not an edge case

987
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:54,879
women matter and their safety is not an

988
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:57,119
edge case uh

989
00:37:54,880 --> 00:38:00,240
survivors of domestic abuse also matter

990
00:37:57,119 --> 00:38:02,480
and their safety is not an edge case

991
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:03,359
so i have gone around trying to to talk

992
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:06,720
to companies

993
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:08,000
about how they can kind of domestic

994
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:10,078
abuse proof

995
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,280
uh their products and one of the big

996
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:14,560
problems that we have

997
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:17,760
in security is that we assume that

998
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:19,920
having uh the password combined with

999
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:22,800
physical access to the device

1000
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:23,200
equals legitimate access to the device

1001
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,720
and

1002
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:26,640
in the domestic abuse case that is

1003
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:27,040
frequently not the case so we need to

1004
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:31,279
look

1005
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:34,240
at other ways of establishing legitimate

1006
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:34,800
legitimate access and being able to lock

1007
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:37,279
uh

1008
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:38,560
lock a user out because one of the the

1009
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:40,160
most interesting things about the

1010
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:44,720
domestic abuse case

1011
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:45,359
is that it is not about simply not

1012
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:49,118
trusting

1013
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:50,799
someone often a a domestic abuser is not

1014
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:52,720
somebody who shows up on day one and

1015
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:54,000
says hi i'm going to control every move

1016
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:56,240
that you make and i'm going to have

1017
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:59,280
access to all of your devices

1018
00:38:56,240 --> 00:39:00,000
they show up looking nice they show up

1019
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:02,320
being polite

1020
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,920
they show up being you know the best

1021
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:06,320
thing that ever happened to you

1022
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:08,079
and the abuse very slowly creeps in and

1023
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:09,760
so you're moving from a person

1024
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:11,680
that you trust very much and that you

1025
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:12,320
love very much to a person that you need

1026
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:15,919
to lock

1027
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:17,359
out of your life asap i and so i've gone

1028
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:20,320
around to companies and

1029
00:39:17,359 --> 00:39:21,759
talked to them about uh the the things

1030
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:23,760
that they can do to do that

1031
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:24,880
one of the big mandates that i have for

1032
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:28,240
companies is

1033
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:31,680
i tell them that you need to make it

1034
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:33,839
very uh easy for people to see who has

1035
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:36,799
access to their data

1036
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:37,759
and you need to make it very easy for uh

1037
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:41,599
for a user

1038
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:45,119
to lock a person out to move them

1039
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:47,440
from trusted to uh to a state of

1040
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:49,280
untrusted so i think that that's

1041
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:50,800
especially important

1042
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:52,400
so let's talk a little bit about what

1043
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:54,640
you can do because

1044
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:56,400
uh a lot of a lot of this talk was

1045
00:39:54,640 --> 00:40:00,078
really supposed to be focused on

1046
00:39:56,400 --> 00:40:00,800
how you build a threat lab eff's threat

1047
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:03,280
lab is

1048
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:04,560
really not the only organization of its

1049
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:06,000
kind

1050
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:07,680
i don't know if you are familiar with

1051
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:10,880
the work of citizen lab

1052
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:12,078
in toronto but they predate us by many

1053
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:14,720
years and they're sort of the

1054
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:15,760
the og of doing this kind of this kind

1055
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:18,879
of research

1056
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:21,920
uh paired with advocacy there's uh

1057
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:25,520
lucy parsons labs which is

1058
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:28,800
is also quite fabulous consumer reports

1059
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:29,599
has opened up a lab and they put out a

1060
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:32,720
report

1061
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:35,520
just today in which they

1062
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:36,319
compared various uh kind of opt-out

1063
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:39,359
services

1064
00:40:36,319 --> 00:40:41,520
that that take advantage of california's

1065
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:44,400
new privacy laws that allow you to

1066
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:45,920
opt out of data collection uh and and

1067
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:48,640
their report is really great

1068
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:49,280
uh amnesty international uh puts out

1069
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:52,480
reports

1070
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:54,880
about the malware which targets the

1071
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:55,839
sort of activists and journalists that

1072
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:59,440
they work with

1073
00:40:55,839 --> 00:41:02,000
uh and again um citizen lab

1074
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:03,040
has done years and years of great work

1075
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:05,839
uh highlighting

1076
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:07,119
the way that uh the the sort of makers

1077
00:41:05,839 --> 00:41:10,319
of these technologies

1078
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:11,920
uh are often uh not people in

1079
00:41:10,319 --> 00:41:15,119
authoritarian regimes

1080
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:17,839
but uh you know information

1081
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:18,319
security workers like you and me who

1082
00:41:17,839 --> 00:41:20,960
work

1083
00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:23,520
in so-called western countries that

1084
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:26,800
frequently this technology is built

1085
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:30,079
in uh in places like

1086
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:32,400
italy and germany and

1087
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:34,640
israel which is the home of sort of the

1088
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:37,839
the notorious nso group

1089
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:39,598
um so this is one of the places where

1090
00:41:37,839 --> 00:41:41,279
uh people like you and me can make an

1091
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:44,480
enormous difference

1092
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:45,760
simply by uh changing the norm so that

1093
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:48,800
working for these companies

1094
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:50,079
is not okay so the you know building the

1095
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:53,200
panopticon

1096
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:54,880
is uh is not okay and we should not be

1097
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:56,640
doing it

1098
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:58,079
so hopefully at this point i've gotten

1099
00:41:56,640 --> 00:42:01,200
everybody all fired up

1100
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:02,160
and uh they are trying to figure out

1101
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:05,520
what kind of research

1102
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:07,920
they can do in order to help

1103
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:09,040
to help their their community and the

1104
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:11,520
good news is

1105
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:12,240
that everybody has a community that they

1106
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:16,160
know

1107
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:19,200
everybody is from somewhere for example

1108
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:22,240
you might look into the

1109
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:25,759
security and privacy concerns of

1110
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:27,919
uh of your family of uh your

1111
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:30,000
you know parents or grandparents and

1112
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:32,079
just generally the elderly population

1113
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:34,000
who are really being left out in the

1114
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:36,319
cold during this quarantine

1115
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,599
you might look at the security concerns

1116
00:42:36,319 --> 00:42:39,839
of students

1117
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:40,800
and student privacy right now especially

1118
00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:43,599
now that

1119
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:45,440
most learning takes place online and eff

1120
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:47,440
has done some really interesting work

1121
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:49,200
in student privacy especially on the

1122
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:51,040
kind of proctoring software which is

1123
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:53,680
very invasive

1124
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:55,119
that that children have been required to

1125
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:58,640
put on their devices

1126
00:42:55,119 --> 00:43:00,960
and we're very worried about that

1127
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:01,839
so you can do work on student software

1128
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:05,119
you can do work

1129
00:43:01,839 --> 00:43:08,560
on the concerns of your

1130
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:09,839
immediate community of your school of

1131
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:13,119
your church

1132
00:43:09,839 --> 00:43:18,480
temple or coven depending uh

1133
00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:20,079
and there is work for everyone to do

1134
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:21,520
one of the most important things that i

1135
00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:25,119
would really like people

1136
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:26,640
to to take away from this talk is that

1137
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:29,359
you don't need permission to become a

1138
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:31,598
security researcher there is no fairy

1139
00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:32,400
that comes around and sprinkles glitter

1140
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:34,640
on you

1141
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:36,160
and tells you you have now been blessed

1142
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:39,440
by cactus con

1143
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:42,078
or defcon or rsa

1144
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:44,400
or anything like that and now now my

1145
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:46,400
friend you are a security researcher

1146
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:47,680
the best way to do it is not to wait for

1147
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:50,400
permission uh

1148
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:52,240
though consulting with with an attorney

1149
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:54,960
in advance is a very good idea before

1150
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:57,359
publication or before doing your work

1151
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:59,200
including our coders rights project but

1152
00:43:57,359 --> 00:44:03,040
the most important thing is to

1153
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:06,319
find a community that you care about and

1154
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:08,319
ask them what their concerns are find

1155
00:44:06,319 --> 00:44:10,079
out the ways in which they are being

1156
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:12,079
underserved the ways in which they're

1157
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:12,640
being taken advantage of the ways in

1158
00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:16,160
which

1159
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:19,040
ordinary platforms and uh and

1160
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:20,240
internet connected devices and phones

1161
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:23,359
and computers

1162
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:26,078
are failing them i and start

1163
00:44:23,359 --> 00:44:26,880
looking into that and just go ahead and

1164
00:44:26,079 --> 00:44:29,440
publish

1165
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:31,599
go ahead and publish and i swear i will

1166
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:33,680
i will make sure that people read it i

1167
00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:35,920
am especially interested in this work

1168
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:37,040
one of the things that i'm really proud

1169
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:40,079
of uh

1170
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:40,800
with my with my soccerware work is that

1171
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:44,880
it has

1172
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:45,280
inspired a number of academics to go out

1173
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:48,560
and

1174
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:51,920
build their you know sort of phd theses

1175
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:55,040
around uh around doing research into

1176
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:55,599
the domestic abuse case uh and into ways

1177
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:58,079
that

1178
00:44:55,599 --> 00:44:59,359
uh iot devices are being used in

1179
00:44:58,079 --> 00:45:01,359
domestic abuse

1180
00:44:59,359 --> 00:45:02,480
and ways in which malware is being

1181
00:45:01,359 --> 00:45:05,520
categorized

1182
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:07,359
and ways in which uh you know this this

1183
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:08,960
tracking is taking place

1184
00:45:07,359 --> 00:45:11,200
and i think that that is really

1185
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:13,359
important work uh that just about

1186
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:16,078
everybody here can do

1187
00:45:13,359 --> 00:45:16,560
so i i hope that this has been helpful

1188
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:18,640
and

1189
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:20,160
i would like to see every last one of

1190
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:33,839
you go out

1191
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:33,839
and build a threat lab

1192
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:45,599
you
