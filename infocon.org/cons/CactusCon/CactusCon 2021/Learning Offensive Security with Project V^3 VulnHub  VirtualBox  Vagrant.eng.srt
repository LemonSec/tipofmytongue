the next talk

3
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:08,800
learning offensive security with project

4
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:11,200
v cubed vol hub

5
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:13,759
virtualbox and vagrant presented by

6
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:15,120

13
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:33,200
hey everybody anthony radzikavage here

14
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,960
aka red hat august and with me i have my

15
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,520
good friend

16
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,960
james green the fish seven all right and

17
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,040
what we're here today is

18
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,640
to do is to introduce a project that

19
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,320
we're working on so let me just share my

20
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,480
screen real fast

21
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,160
boom here it is what we're calling it is

22
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:51,279
we're calling it project v

23
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:54,959
cubed right the reason is is it's

24
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:57,120
vuln hub with virtualbox and vagrant

25
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,920
okay where what we're doing is we're

26
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,718
taking all of the machines that are on

27
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:02,719
vulnerhub.com we're making them

28
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:04,080
compatible with virtualbox if they're

29
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:07,680
not compatible

30
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:09,920
and we are creating vagrant boxes and

31
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,880
uploading it to the vagrant cloud the

32
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:14,080
idea here

33
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:16,720
is to help uh you know new entrants

34
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:18,158
into this field or you know help people

35
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:20,720
who want to learn

36
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:22,400
uh you know this industry of offensive

37
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:24,080
security

38
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,000
where they may not have a strong

39
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:28,158
background in virtualization system

40
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
administration uh doing some of the

41
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:31,200
things that i have to do to port it over

42
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,320
to virtualbox

43
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,600
and who would rather use virtualbox over

44
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:38,479
vmware

45
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,119
um so to explain a little bit about the

46
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:42,320
github

47
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:44,960
it's github.com redhat august vulnhub

48
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:46,639
underscore vagrant right i have an other

49
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,798
directory and this will hold

50
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,920
uh vms that are outside of vulnerhub

51
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:53,200
because i don't want to

52
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:55,840
limit this opportunity to just vulnerhub

53
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,560
so if you're a vulnerable machine

54
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,640
developer

55
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,719
and you did not upload your thing to

56
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,840
volthub and you want to get in on this

57
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:03,199
just reach out to us

58
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,799
and i will be more than happy to

59
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,600
incorporate you into this project as

60
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:08,399
well

61
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:10,560
i we have a setup scripts directory

62
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:12,400
right now we have a powershell script

63
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,520
you can run to help with

64
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:18,400
the special dhcp um

65
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,920
server you know network uh and then we

66
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,680
have the vulner hub directory which

67
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:24,799
holds all of the vuln hub

68
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,599
vms that we have converted and made into

69
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,239
virtual or

70
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:29,839
into vagrant boxes so far excuse me and

71
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:30,319
of course the readme right that goes

72
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,400
over

73
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:33,440
like how to get excuse me how to get

74
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,640
started so

75
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:38,079
um what you need is you need uh the

76
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,839
minimum of these three

77
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,440
applications installed you need

78
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,519
virtualbox you need

79
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:45,280
virtualbox extension pack which is found

80
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:47,440
on the same page as the download

81
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,400
where you got virtualbox and you need

82
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:50,480
vagrant

83
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,519
i would recommend that you also have git

84
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,920
installed and

85
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:56,239
for my demo here i do have get installed

86
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:59,599
i'm going to show you how to use that in

87
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:02,159
a powershell command line so

88
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:04,159
what we need to do before we get started

89
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:06,480
with the actual hacking is

90
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:08,799
yes we have to install all these

91
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:12,480
applications but then we have to set up

92
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:15,519
a dhcp server uh virtual one

93
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,159
with the network name hey marketers i'm

94
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:17,680
setting up

95
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:19,679
all of the vagrant machines that are

96
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:22,239
being pulled into this network

97
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,319
as an internal host and again i'm going

98
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:27,680
to show you how to do all of this

99
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:30,079
in real time so you'll see how uh

100
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:32,480
how it all functions right but you do

101
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:35,760
need to have it literally hey marketers

102
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,640
and again we do have a script here that

103
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:40,640
will help you

104
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:42,319
execute that so um

105
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:44,480
with that being said let me just go

106
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:45,440
ahead and show you how to get started

107
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:48,879
here

108
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:51,760
so i have a powershell right here

109
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:52,159
and um what i'm going to do is i'm just

110
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,079
uh

111
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:56,239
this is a secondary drive for me i'm

112
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:59,760
going to make the directory

113
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:00,000
uh you know i'll just call it v3 why not

114
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,560
so

115
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,599
i'm going to go into that directory yeah

116
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,480
oh my gosh

117
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:07,839
sorry i'm used to linux um and then i

118
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:10,640
want to pull in

119
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,840
the github repository right so i'm going

120
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:15,478
to go get

121
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:18,560
clone https forward slash forward slash

122
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:21,680
github.com red hat

123
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:25,919
august forward slash vuln hub

124
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:28,800
underscore vagrant dot get not

125
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:29,120
there we go and then it'll clone it all

126
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,240
in

127
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,960
right and so what you can see here is we

128
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,120
have vol

129
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,799
hub vagrant so we're gonna go into

130
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:39,840
volnhub vagrant

131
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:42,320
and uh you know we have exactly what i

132
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:45,440
showed you on the web page right so

133
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:48,479
if we go into setup scripts here

134
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:52,400
we have a readme that you can

135
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:54,000
look over on how to use it so

136
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:56,560
you know it's automatically going to do

137
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,280
everything for you for me and

138
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,240
you know uh james we were kind of

139
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,000
concerned with

140
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,520
if people have installations like me

141
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,600
where they don't install v

142
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:07,039
or virtual box on the primary drive but

143
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,440
maybe the secondary drive

144
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:11,360
this will automatically find it for you

145
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:13,039
and run that command

146
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,479
so all you need to do is you need to do

147
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:17,759
a powershell dash

148
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:20,800
e p bypass

149
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:23,199
v3 setup dot ps1

150
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,720
press enter it may take a few moments

151
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:27,039
for this to actually work

152
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,240
but the good news here is that you only

153
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:31,520
have to do it

154
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:35,039
one time right so unless you

155
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:35,840
you removed this network you will only

156
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:39,520
have to do this

157
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:41,359
one time to get set up to start working

158
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:44,159
with the project

159
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,800
so let's go ahead and uh well while this

160
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,240
is running

161
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,639
you know this will this will happen

162
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:51,759
fairly quickly and you know

163
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:54,000
full disclosure mine's already set up so

164
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:56,080
what i'm going to do now is i'm going to

165
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,960
show you virtualbox

166
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,758
another assumption that we have here is

167
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,719
that

168
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:04,479
let me just change that boom another

169
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,479
assumption that we have here

170
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:08,719
is that you already have an attacker

171
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:10,159
host right whether you're using kali or

172
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,199
parrot or you're trying to do this from

173
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,759
windows or

174
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:15,440
whatever flavor you're using you already

175
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:18,880
have a vm

176
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:22,000
that you're going to use to

177
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:23,280
try to learn this industry so uh the

178
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
first thing that we need to do

179
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,880
is we have that vm up we have it running

180
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,440
we're going to

181
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:31,440
right click and go into settings and let

182
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:33,360
me do a little bit of magic here really

183
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:35,840
fast so that you can actually see what

184
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,840
i'm doing

185
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:41,599
yep there you go that's what i want and

186
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,240
then i'm just going to drag that over

187
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,360
here

188
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:47,600
like this okay perfect and you're going

189
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:51,039
to want to click on network

190
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:56,960
go into internal network and then

191
00:06:51,039 --> 00:07:01,360
manually type h-a-y-m-a-r-k-e-t-e-r-s

192
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:03,599
for hey marketers click ok

193
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:05,360
and then you should be rocking and

194
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:07,680
rolling with that so let me uh

195
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,720
stop that here uh that's all you have to

196
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,599
do with

197
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,080
your machine on that side right now i'm

198
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:17,599
gonna go

199
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:20,960
back to uh the powershell screen

200
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:22,159
there we go as you see my dhcp server

201
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,680
already exists

202
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,759
and if you're worried about running our

203
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:28,319
script i mean of course you can

204
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:30,000
look at it and analyze it and see what

205
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:32,400
it does but otherwise you see

206
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,400
this right here just find out wherever

207
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:37,359
whatever path you put virtualbox

208
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:38,880
on run that command it will set it up

209
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,680
you can even change the

210
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:44,440
network ip to be something else we're

211
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:45,680
calling this elite network because it's

212
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:47,199
10.13.37

213
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,120
right so a little bit of tongue-in-cheek

214
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:50,479
there um but

215
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:53,120
you know you can change any other

216
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:55,280
parameter except hey marketers

217
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,960
must be hey marketers because that's

218
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,599
what i have all the vagrant boxes set up

219
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:00,960
to do

220
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:02,878
okay so let me go here

221
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:04,400
now that we have the network created we

222
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:07,039
have our attacker host

223
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:08,080
on that what i want to do is i want to

224
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:11,680
go into the

225
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:13,680
vuln hub directory and as you can see

226
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:17,120
i have quite a few of them finished

227
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:19,759
right i have 198 of the vuln hub

228
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:21,440
machines completed uploaded to vagrant

229
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:24,560
cloud and ready to go

230
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:26,560
now 198 machines is a lot to go through

231
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,080
so usually when people do this they have

232
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,720
a certain box in mind

233
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,680
right so the trick here is you're going

234
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,279
to run a dir

235
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,919
if you're using windows ls if you're

236
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:38,880
using linux but a dir

237
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:39,439
find string and the one that i want to

238
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,519
look up

239
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,479
is first blood that's the one i'm going

240
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:45,040
to showcase here

241
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:46,720
done by another another friend of mine

242
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:50,079
uh so

243
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:53,279
we have uh first blood one in

244
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:54,560
the directory 2020 09 19

245
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:57,200
right because it was released on

246
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:59,839
september 19th uh so i'm going to go

247
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,720
cd 2020. i'm not going to do it that way

248
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:04,240
that's going to take forever

249
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,800
all right here we go 10 9 19 first blood

250
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,519
right

251
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:08,000
so i change into this directory and if

252
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:10,160
you look

253
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,399
in this directory as well you will see

254
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,920
there is a readme file for every single

255
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:16,720
one so let me go ahead

256
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:18,160
and i will read that for you here uh so

257
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:21,040
you can get an idea of the

258
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:22,000
uh how i'm setting this up i tell you

259
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:24,240
exactly where i take

260
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,480
it from right uh and then this

261
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:28,080
information came directly from vuln hub

262
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,640
and then if i have any notes i'm going

263
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,959
to put it

264
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:32,480
underneath the vagrant box made by and

265
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:35,279
it's either going to be the fish 7

266
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,000
or redhead august who has done this

267
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:38,000
right

268
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,120
uh so again this is a machine that my

269
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,519
buddy vincent made

270
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,720
and i'm gonna do all i need to do at

271
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:44,240
this point

272
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,920
because check it out check it out we

273
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,360
have these two files we have this thing

274
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:49,839
called vagrant file

275
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,800
all you need to do as an end user is run

276
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:53,120
vagrant up

277
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,120
ready

278
00:09:54,399 --> 00:10:01,360
and that's it right so if you look

279
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:03,360
at virtualbox while this is happening

280
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:05,040
see here it goes bringing it up cannot

281
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,480
find provider that's perfectly fine

282
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:10,319
reaches out to the cloud

283
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:12,720
uh but we only see one vm here right now

284
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:14,079
okay when this is finished what it's

285
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,440
going to do is it's going to grab that

286
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:18,239
vagrant box from

287
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:19,600
vagrant cloud pull it in set it up with

288
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,200
virtualbox it's going to make it

289
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,360
headless so it's not going to pull out

290
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:25,760
the vm it's very easy to pull it out

291
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:27,120
and it will be on the haymarketer's

292
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:30,079
network and you will

293
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:31,680
be ready to go so with this i'm going to

294
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:33,760
do some movie magic

295
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,719
and you know speed up a little bit of

296
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:37,920
the time

297
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:40,959
and boom we are back so

298
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:44,160
uh as you see it downloaded the

299
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:47,439
vagrant box and what you'll be seeing

300
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:49,839
next is it's gonna add it to virtualbox

301
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:52,320
get it uh get it set up per its

302
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:54,480
configurations and then power it on

303
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,760
while that's powering on let me go ahead

304
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:58,959
and power on

305
00:10:55,760 --> 00:11:01,839
my attacker host so i just double click

306
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:01,839
on my vm

307
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:07,359
so now it's uh it's going to import that

308
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,680
box like i said it's going to get it in

309
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,760
there

310
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:11,279
it's going to set it up it's going to

311
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,640
power it on and then we should be

312
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:16,399
rocking and rolling

313
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:19,279
so in my attacker host let's let this uh

314
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:19,279
finish booting up

315
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:29,839
great so i'm gonna type in my

316
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:29,839
username and my password

317
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:35,599
and here we go so one of the first

318
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,200
things that we'll want to verify is

319
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,519
we're going to open up a terminal we can

320
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,399
uh

321
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:41,920
just open it here um let me make this

322
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:42,480
larger so you can actually see what i'm

323
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:45,920
doing

324
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:47,760
is uh see what our ip address is

325
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:49,839
right we should be on the elite network

326
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:53,600
so as you can see i'm on 10

327
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:56,240
1 3 3 7 and 5. so that is

328
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,360
my machine that i'm running in this uh

329
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:00,720
network

330
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:03,760
and i'll go back to virtualbox here

331
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:05,760
as you can see first blood is

332
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:07,839
up and running but it starts in a mode

333
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:09,439
that's called headless right so what

334
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:11,040
what it means is when i double clicked

335
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:13,040
on bulky roth it actually pulled out

336
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:14,719
that vm and i'm able to manipulate it

337
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:16,399
this one it doesn't pull out that vm in

338
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,000
another window if you want to do it it's

339
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:19,839
very easy you can double click on here

340
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,000
and it will go ahead and do that for you

341
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:23,040
otherwise you can see a preview that it

342
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,040
is running here

343
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:27,360
now since this is a gui it doesn't have

344
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:28,240
the ip displayed but on most of the

345
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:31,600
machines

346
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:33,600
i did try to display the ip since

347
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,360
they're all command line interface based

348
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:38,320
right they're not gui based

349
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:39,760
so with that being said this is on the

350
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:42,240
hey marketers network

351
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,959
um and then don't worry about this

352
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,560
second one

353
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:47,040
this is just because of the way that

354
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:48,479
vagrant works another thing to note that

355
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:51,760
i kind of want to uh

356
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:54,399
set aside is vagrant by default will try

357
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:56,319
to ssh into the machine this will not

358
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:58,240
work right because if you could just

359
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:00,160
you could ssh vagrant vagrant and all

360
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,560
the machines kind of defeat the purpose

361
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,959
of

362
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:04,880
um hacking into the machines let that

363
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:06,319
cancel out let that error out it is

364
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,519
perfectly fine not going to hurt

365
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,959
anything not going to hurt your

366
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:11,760
operations etc

367
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:13,680
um but i just wanted to make you aware

368
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:15,600
yes if it ssh is and it just keeps

369
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:17,599
trying and trying to train

370
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:19,519
i know that's how it works just ignore

371
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:22,639
it just ignore it don't worry about it

372
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:26,240
so um let's go ahead and do an nmap

373
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:29,200
ping sweep real quick 10 13 37.04

374
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,839
24. this is a class c network oh what

375
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:34,000
happened here

376
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:37,279
hold up hold up now 136. what am

377
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,279
i doing there you go

378
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:45,440
and as we can see we have a

379
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:49,120
117 in the network

380
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:51,360
as well so let's go ahead

381
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:54,079
and i'm not sure why it's taking so long

382
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:56,079
but we can do the sudo and map

383
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:57,199
let's just do a basic one right and this

384
00:13:56,079 --> 00:14:01,120
is generally how i

385
00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:01,120
test 117

386
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:04,719
while that is happening a lot of these

387
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:06,639
machines are

388
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:09,199
web servers so let's go ahead and open

389
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:16,959
up one of those

390
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:19,040
or open up a browser i mean 10 13 37 117

391
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:20,719
sure as i'll get out it says welcome to

392
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,920
first blood let me zoom that in make a

393
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:24,639
little bigger for you

394
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:25,760
uh so this is a great beginner box put

395
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:29,120
on by my friend

396
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:31,199
i am vincent i highly recommend it i

397
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,800
think it's super cool he essentially is

398
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:34,719
walking you through

399
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:36,319
uh how to tackle the machine you may

400
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,240
have to look a couple things up

401
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:40,240
but you know you're not gonna get into

402
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,800
these crazy exploits that you don't know

403
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,040
about

404
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:44,160
perfect place to start okay let's go

405
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:47,120
back here

406
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:49,120
and as you can see for the first top

407
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:52,720
1000 ports port 80

408
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:54,160
is open so with that um i'm going to go

409
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,360
ahead and just get out right because

410
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:58,399
it's it's for you

411
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:59,120
to break into uh let me go ahead i will

412
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:02,959
power this

413
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:06,720
off just for the sake of

414
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:07,279
and i am back and i see a virtual box

415
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:11,120
here

416
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:14,160
and again uh this

417
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:17,199
the uh power shell okay so

418
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:19,279
um i did a control c a bunch of times to

419
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:20,240
get that ssh to stop because you know

420
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:21,279
i'm not going to hack through the

421
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,079
machine if you were going to hack

422
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:24,160
through the machine

423
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:25,439
this would definitely time out before

424
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:29,279
you were finished

425
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:32,560
uh but i did a control c now to avoid

426
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:34,000
having all of these machines pile up

427
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,920
hold on a second there we go all these

428
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,680
machines just pile up in a big list and

429
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:38,800
just take over your hard drive in a

430
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:41,120
massive way

431
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:42,719
uh vagrant's really really nice in this

432
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,240
respect

433
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:46,880
if you want to stop it and you want to

434
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:49,839
go back to it just type vagrant halt

435
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:50,880
and what that'll do is it will stop the

436
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:52,800
machine for you

437
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:54,000
and then you can go back and you know

438
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:57,439
shut down your computer come back

439
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:59,759
to it another day uh however when you do

440
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:02,000
do that make sure you go to the same

441
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:03,759
directory that you were in before

442
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,440
so that you can modify the same exact

443
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:08,880
machine the same exact box

444
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:12,240
that you were um you were

445
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:14,639
going through in the first place so here

446
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:18,240
we go as you see it powered off

447
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:19,279
and we have it um you know it stopped

448
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:22,320
here right

449
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:24,320
so the other thing is say i am done with

450
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:25,040
this machine and i don't want to save it

451
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:28,000
at all

452
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,959
if you do a vagrant destroy it will

453
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,519
remove

454
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:33,439
the box it will remove it from your hard

455
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:34,560
drive it will no longer take up any

456
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:37,519
space

457
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:39,279
anything that came with it will be gone

458
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:40,160
okay and it will ask hey are you sure

459
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:42,560
you want to do this

460
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:43,759
yes you do and if you want to do it

461
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:45,599
again

462
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:47,680
you just run another vagrant up within

463
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,199
the same exact directory it's not

464
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:51,439
you know it's not like you can't start

465
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:53,120
over but vagrant destroy you see it's

466
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,639
gone from the list it will no longer

467
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:56,480
take up hard drive space

468
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:59,040
so you can go into the directory choose

469
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:01,839
which one you want go to that directory

470
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:03,599
and then type vagrant up it will

471
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:05,039
automatically download everything for

472
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:07,199
you set everything up

473
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:09,280
you get in there you go through the

474
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:10,240
exercise hack into the box get your

475
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:12,959
trophy

476
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:14,559
uh get out do a vagrant destroy and it's

477
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:15,600
as though it was never there but you

478
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:18,000
gained the knowledge

479
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:19,119
in a very easy way with just a few

480
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,400
commands

481
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:23,359
uh with that you know really that's what

482
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,280
we wanted to show

483
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:26,879
and showcase again we're calling this

484
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:30,160
project fee cube

485
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:32,960
we will be available for feedback

486
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:34,400
conversation just hit me up on twitter

487
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:38,240
at red hat august

488
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:40,640
or at the 57

489
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:42,480
on twitter as well yeah that's fish as

490
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:45,760
in f-e-e-s-h

491
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:46,559
all right so thank you so much for uh

492

attending

493
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:49,760
you know our talk here listening to us

494
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:52,720
prattle on

495
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:55,120
seeing what we're doing and i hope this

496
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:57,360
gains as much interest as we have and it

497
00:17:55,120 --> 00:18:01,039
can bring a lot more new entrants

498
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:15,840
into our uh field into our interest

499
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:15,840
as a community so thank you very much

500
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,080
you
