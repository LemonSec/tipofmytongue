looked into it

129
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,080
and we found a great cause because we

130
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:34,639
don't want to make money off of our swag

131

right

132
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:42,160

154
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,479
lot of time we have like maybe

155
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:27,919
30 seconds each which is nothing but i

156
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:29,440
want to ask just in general how you got

157
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:31,120
into purple teaming it's it's

158
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,560
such an important thing you know as a

159
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,080
blue teamer we see

160
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:36,000
i'll shut up forget me how did you get

161
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:38,880
into it yeah so uh

162
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,440
i i ran the offensive team at citigroup

163
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,800
so

164
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,840
uh rather large organization we had 145

165
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,880
ethical hackers

166
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:49,198
globally uh we were doing red team for

167
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:51,039
a couple years and realized that uh you

168
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:52,960
know doing all these zero knowledge

169
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:54,639
engagements wasn't

170
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:56,638
really it was bringing value but it

171
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:58,319
wasn't bringing as much value

172
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:00,560
especially when you had 12 people

173
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:02,479
dedicated to just doing red teaming so

174
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,160
uh we started working and collaborating

175
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:05,199
with the blue team we weren't even

176
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,720
calling it purple team

177
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:08,880
back then we were just you know kind of

178
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:11,280
collaborating and showing that

179
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:13,199
we weren't just like going yolo full

180
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,239
cyber and gaining access and being like

181
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:16,800
haha blue team

182
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,880
sucks um so actually establish

183
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,000
relationships and realize that it was

184
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,560
very efficient

185
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,440
to actually fix uh a lot of the issues

186
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,600
that we were seeing

187
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,719
in people process and technology how

188
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,880
about you bryson

189
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,840
so i'll be real quick on mine one um

190
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:32,159
similar thing

191
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:33,758
um i didn't know what purple was but i

192
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,960
did know i was tired of the red team

193
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:37,600
with an ego

194
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:38,638
and so i can started speaking actually

195
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,720
like giving talks

196
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:41,680
several years ago on how to red team

197
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,479
without an ego

198
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,520
and it just naturally like fell into

199
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:47,039
this process

200
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,240
which i didn't even know existed and

201
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:50,159
then that's how george and i actually

202
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,599
came to work together is we both were

203
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,360
really like-minded

204
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:54,960
um collaborating a couple of years ago

205
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,720
when we first ran across each other

206
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,719
and talking about these problems we saw

207
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:02,080
