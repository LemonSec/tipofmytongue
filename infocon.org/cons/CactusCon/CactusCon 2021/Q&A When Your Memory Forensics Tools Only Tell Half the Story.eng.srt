gave a great talk

6
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:17,520
on using some tools that apparently

7
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,198
based on the

8
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,960
chatter and discord some folks just

9
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:22,080
weren't aware of and or at least the

10
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,160
features of them

11
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,240
to do some really cool stuff finding

12
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:29,279
things that your general forensic tools

13
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:30,640
maybe just don't show you so hey

14
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:32,479

yeah off air we were just talking about

47
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:46,880
a bunch of malware analysis stuff and so

48
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,079
quick little plug i saw him over his

49
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,280

00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,920
proof is in the pudding folks who know

54
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:57,439
what they're doing you know they have

55
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,920
their books on the shelf

56
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:01,758
so that was super ad like but that's all

57
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:06,399
right

58
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:08,399
guys have their books on their shelf

59
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:09,919
yeah that's good stuff all right or on

60
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:13,040
their nightstand yeah

61
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:16,238
yeah right every night i read a chapter

62
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:19,120
so we had someone net z is the name

63
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:19,520
say i love how he runs strings as the

64
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,840
first

65
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,040
thing and i copied that right away to

66
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,800
bring it up um

67
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,560
is that one of your go-to's for for

68
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:29,599
starting things off

69
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:31,680
oh absolutely i mean um and like all

70
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:33,839
things it just depends but if i can

71
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,760
if i can iso like if i can isolate

72
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,080
something pivot on it really quick and

73
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,160
then

74
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,160
build some some sort of strings based

75
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:43,359
text file that you can rapidly

76
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:46,000
search through um that is definitely one

77
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:48,560
of my go-to's for sure

78
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,640
awesome yeah i'm i'm famous myself for

79
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:53,360
running strings and piping uh

80
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,238
content into xxd like instead of running

81
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,560
a file i just

82
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:58,800
all the time yep yeah it's like i forget

83
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,400
file just xd it real quick

84
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,560
what is this what's in here it runs

85
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:05,120
strings on that's awesome

86
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,560
seeing that right away you're like okay

87
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,000
i see yeah

88
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,680
and then someone else made the comment

89
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,720
wow volatility has a shell

90
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,760
i did not know that super useful i know

91
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,519
it's super useful

92
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,120
yeah i don't want to say a better

93
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:18,959
comment but another comment that even

94
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,480
took it a little bit further is our

95
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:23,040
buddy jj styles

96
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:24,640
who's just having a quite quite the

97
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,959
conference

98
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:28,879
today says this talk could also be

99
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:31,040
called half the story or rather

100
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:33,040
how the vaul shell and mal find your way

101
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,159
to the motherland of hidden executable

102
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,920
code

103
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:38,159
i was like okay just copy paste that

104
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,920
title and there it is yeah

105
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:41,280
no i mean and that's there's a lot to be

106
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,679
said with that though i mean being able

107
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,840
to just

108
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,360
real quickly and you know pivot and

109
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:48,319
granularly dive in

110
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,440
you know you save a ton of time and um

111
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:51,518
being able to just

112
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:53,760
manually manipulate that is super super

113
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:56,959
quick and useful

114
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:58,959
yeah man so time wise your

115
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:00,799
your talk went toward the hour so we'd

116
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:03,040
only have like three minutes or so going

117
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:04,000
on here so i just want to i wanted to

118
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,359
bring up something and we kind of

119
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,480
touched on it offline

120
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,519
but uh rader or radar or just called r2

121
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:12,798
framework r2

122
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:14,000
yep yeah r2 um you know personally i

123
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:16,400
never jumped into the

124
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,759
into the deep end with r2 so i've been

125
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:19,120
sticking to the tools like we were

126
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:20,880
talking about offline

127
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,400
um but you mentioned you like to stay in

128
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,600
the command line and use it do you have

129
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,359
any just general

130
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,199
you know whether it be tips tricks or

131
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,960
any just comments on it or you know

132
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:29,919
why you chose to include that out of all

133
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,799
the frameworks that i know you're

134
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:34,240
familiar with

135
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:36,000
you know i mean i chose to include that

136
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,440
one because you could pivot really quick

137
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,639
and stay in the command line

138
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:42,160
and then um sort of double check

139
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:44,080
you know are we looking at potentially

140
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,600
shell code right so you know

141
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,120
when we look at that second memory

142
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,720
sample with the no op sled

143
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,240
i was able to dump that section and then

144
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,080
we were able to look and see are we

145
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,759
seeing like legitimate op code that's

146
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,758
being converted into assembly

147
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:56,960
and you can do that super fast without

148
00:04:55,759 --> 00:05:00,000
having to like then

149
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:02,719
launch something say like gidra create a

150
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
you know create a case analyze the file

151
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,440
and then go through it you can just do

152
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,440
it right there from the command line

153
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,719
super super quick because all you're

154
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:11,120
doing is a real quick just

155
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:13,759
shell code emulation check basically and

156
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,759
you're good to go

157
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:18,320
yeah i like it i like it but so you

158
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,919
brought that up actually shellcode

159
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:23,280
emulation do you have any any

160
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:26,479
favorites scdbg or any other yeah so

161
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:28,559
uh i mean yeah i mean scdbg for sure

162
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:30,080
um even though it is limited with you

163
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:33,120
know being 32-bit

164
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:34,880
but um the folks the folks from uh the

165
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,080
fireeye team released this thing called

166
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,600
speakeasy

167
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:39,199
so i've been playing around with

168
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,800
speakeasy a little bit and then the

169
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:41,680
queueing framework as well i don't know

170
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,840
if you

171
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,720
are familiar with that one as well so

172
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,239
both of those

173
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,840
will allow you to do shell code

174
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,360
emulation um

175
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,479
but the one i've been playing with over

176
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,840
the last couple of weeks or probably

177
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:53,120
like month and a half now has definitely

178
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,960
been the speakeasy

179
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,720
framework because you can you can

180
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,919
emulate binaries as well as shell code

181
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:01,199

182
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:03,599
