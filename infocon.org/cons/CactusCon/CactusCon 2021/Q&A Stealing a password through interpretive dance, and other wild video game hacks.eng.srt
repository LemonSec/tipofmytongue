in the chat during your talk my

61
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,758
favorites

62
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:10,720
were uh discussions of the cat cameos

63
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:14,160
yeah

64
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:16,400
so jamie winterton who has been a staple

65
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:18,400
uh helping us out for many years now was

66
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,920
on our call for papers board this year

67
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,440
again so thank you by the way she

68
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,440
brought up you know like holy holy heck

69
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:26,000
there's a cat cameo and then

70
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,480
talking about cats back and forth and

71
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,560
notes

72
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:30,480
and comments on your costume changes

73
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,239
yeah those were great

74
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,920
yeah i wanted to play around a little

75
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:36,560
bit with the format of this talk

76
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:38,079
uh so i really wanted to lean into the

77
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,200
idea of this being like a pre-prepared

78
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:42,239
video and not

79
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:43,839
necessarily like just doing a like slide

80
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:45,360
and talking head format

81
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,720
and i think part of that meant like i

82
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,760
was gonna record it over the course of a

83
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:50,319
few days

84
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:51,840
so uh like the wardrobe changes weren't

85
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:53,119
even like on purpose as like an

86
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,760
intentional thing it was just the fact

87
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,280
that i

88
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,120
like did this over the course of a few

89
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:59,760
days and the cat's like well

90
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,879
you know what am i gonna do kick the cat

91
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,159
out just because i'm trying to record no

92
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:04,480
way they're adorable i'm not gonna

93
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:05,920
kick them out so uh yeah like they're

94
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:08,238
they're here they own the place i just

95
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,238
rent it

96
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,920
i also note your shirt you're wearing

97
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:14,238
right now i like how you tied it

98
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,760
yeah this is the yeah this is the the

99
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:17,680
smash the logo

100
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:19,200
uh that like kind of is the the theme

101
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,840
across all the smash games so you know

102
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,238
gotta

103
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,599
represent that yeah i love it we had a

104
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:25,519
comment during the talk

105
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:26,640
i'm totally fascinated by this story on

106
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:28,640
the edge of my seat

107
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,920
about where it's going and i was like

108
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,238
this person being a smart ass because i

109
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,760
think it's

110
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:33,840
and they were like oh really i'm like

111
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:37,440
it's just really awesome

112
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:39,040
yeah that i almost actually just

113
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:41,120
got rid of all the other bugs and just

114
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,640
did a 45-minute talk on that first one

115
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,400
i feel like there's there's still a lot

116
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:47,920
more that i could have said there

117
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:50,319
like more like details to talk about

118
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:51,040
but uh i did want to eventually move on

119
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:53,359
but uh yeah

120
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:55,040
that first thing like about you know the

121
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,640
interpretive dance winds up being

122
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,239
more literal than you probably thought

123
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,238
it was going to be like maybe reading

124
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:02,159
the talk description thought oh well

125
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:04,239
that's just some weird exaggeration

126
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:06,239
that people say like no it's like

127
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:07,040
actually a pretty good description of

128
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:09,920
how that

129
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:11,679
like exploitation and like exfiltration

130
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:14,559
mechanism works

131
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:16,160
i i the visual element to it it reminds

132
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,759
me of something from the fighting game

133
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,000
community that you and i are both a part

134
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:20,400
of

135
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,358
um that may be a little kind of left

136
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:23,520
field but it's just

137
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:24,960
in my brain it kept clicking there are

138
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:27,120
visual hacks when you're playing

139
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,000
fighting games um there's audio and

140
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,680
visual hacks when

141
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,520
you're in person playing fighting games

142
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,600
maybe not right now on the code

143
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:35,520
uh area of curving but when you're at a

144
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,880
tournament or even just you know casuals

145
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,479
as we call them right and you're playing

146
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,240
um i'm a street fighter guy myself and i

147
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:41,120
gotta paint it on the wall i love street

148
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,520
fighter

149
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,479
um yeah you can hear the joystick and

150
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,240
you can hear like if so

151
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:47,919
yeah street fighter at least you know

152
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,080
zombie you know he's got

153
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:51,758
a pile driver where you do circles and

154
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:53,120
people often will buffer the circle so

155
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:54,479
you can literally hear them

156
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,320
we call it churn and butter and they're

157
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:57,840
kind of they're grinding and you're like

158
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,320
okay he's gonna pile drive me right now

159
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,599
right

160
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,960
but you can also there are some people

161
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,160
who literally like they play like this

162
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:05,039
you watch them at tournaments and

163
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:06,400
they're like this watching the tv like

164
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:07,680
watching their opponent's hands trying

165
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,400
to see what they're oh you're in a jab

166
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,919
okay

167
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:14,320
so yeah one of the local players uh

168
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:15,520

169
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,680
wonderful player

170
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:19,919
and was one of the original uh like

171
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:22,240
inspirations for smashbot

172
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:23,198
would do that he would uh play you two

173
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,440
and if you uh

174
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:26,639
like got into a position where uh he

175
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,240
could do the combo

176
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:29,680
by muscle memory but needed to know

177
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,560
where you're dying basically he needed

178
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,400
to know like

179
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,080
what you're pressing you just look over

180
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:36,320
at your like controller

181
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:37,120
to see like what you're pressing and

182
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,880
everyone's like

183
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,240
no don't do like you know like start

184
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,479
playing like this you know

185
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,680
like holding the controller behind your

186
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:45,520
head or something like that

187
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,039
yeah it's a good time yeah a lot of the

188
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,400
tournaments the japanese style at least

189
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:48,960
for the you know those types of fighting

190
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,719
games

191
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,159
they've been head to head for years but

192
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,240
the american style has

193
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,680
for the whole you know forever has been

194
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,160
side by side and so it's just you're

195
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,759
just like

196
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,199
i see what you're doing right there you

197
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:00,800
know it becomes obvious

198
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:02,319
it started putting up dividers you know

199
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,440
so that people can't and then you see

200
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:04,720
every once in a while tournament people

201
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,319
looking over the device

202
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,919
like partly it's an esports thing too

203
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:10,400
you know you want to have like

204
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:11,440
the the look and feel of like this per

205
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,919
like a versus b

206
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,639
and it looks good on stage it does it

207
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:16,318
does

208
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:17,919
there was a comment during the talk this

209
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:19,120
talk is making me not want to write my

210
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:21,120
chess server engine

211
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,560
and then follow up with haven't done the

212
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,080
risk modeling for it

213
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,080
yet but this talk will make sure i

214
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:28,800
simulate some attacks yeah

215
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:30,318
yeah at least uh like the old school

216
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:33,199
board games like chess

217
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:35,120
like are pretty well understood and like

218
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:37,199
they don't have any like

219
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,199
hard real-time requirements in the sense

220
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:41,759
that like like fighting games do

221
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:42,639
where like they're i can't tell you how

222
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:46,080
many man hours

223
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:49,199
have gone into lowering the latency

224
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:51,280
in melee to like to shave off like

225
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:53,039
a half a millisecond here and like a

226
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:55,280
quarter of a millisecond there

227
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:56,318
right to like bring like the latency as

228
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,559
like absolutely

229
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:00,000
down as possible where like that's not

230
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,680
really particularly critical

231
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,759
in like chess like you could just use a

232
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:05,440
tcp connection uh like i

233
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:07,199
even if you go to chess.com like i'm

234
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:09,759
pretty sure it's all just web requests

235
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:11,759
like i don't think that they use any

236
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:12,880
like weird like websocket thing like

237
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:14,160
maybe i'm wrong about that i haven't

238
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:17,599
looked into it but

239
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:19,440
uh i don't i don't believe they do

240
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:20,880
so i'm looking through the chat here

241
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,960
there's a lot of conversation

242
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,560
uh a number of folks basically saying

243
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:27,758
like wow that was in depth

244
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,800
you know that was super in-depth um have

245
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:31,919
you

246
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:33,280
have you seen or do you believe anyone's

247
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:35,280
actually

248
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,719
tried to implement what you came up with

249
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,239
or would when you originally came up

250
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,319
with it was it already patched out

251
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,919
before or were you able to basically

252
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:43,360
what i'm getting at is you know your

253
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:45,039
your display of you can actually have

254
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,240
recorded video

255
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:47,680
as opposed to having the playback for

256
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,639
the playback file that's complete you

257
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,240
know obvious

258
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:51,840
you have the hex values sure whatever

259
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,879
have you been able to successfully

260
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,080
implement that and have

261
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:55,599
other people do it i'm wondering if

262
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:57,520
other people were able to successfully

263
00:07:55,599 --> 00:08:01,599
do it and not just you

264
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:02,080
uh so this has just so it hasn't been

265
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:04,800
public

266
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:06,560
so like the the um the read overflow bug

267
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:10,000
that first bug

268
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:12,160
the it was patched only like for real

269
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,879
only recently uh because we tried to do

270
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,120
that patch

271
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:16,639
first back in like october or whatever

272
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,919
it was and that's the one

273
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:23,599
where i said it broke everything yeah um

274
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:26,159
so yeah i uh so yeah there's that

275
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:26,719
the uh the scrubbing tool still doesn't

276
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,120
exist

277
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,319
yet uh there's some there's a reason why

278
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,599
that's hard too that i

279
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:32,719
get into this this is one of those

280
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:34,880
reasons i could have talked about this

281
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:38,080
one bug for like 45 minutes

282
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:40,799
so um there doesn't yet exist a good

283
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:42,320
way of modifying those slp files like

284
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:43,679
there's not a library for it basically

285
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,880
so in order to do that i'm going to like

286
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:47,199
write a library

287
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:48,880
that's capable of modifying those files

288
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:51,760
which also kind of opens up

289
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:53,600
a door of like potential cheating since

290
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:55,839
those slp files are like

291
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,279
used as kind of like proof of things so

292
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:58,399
if you could like modify them to say

293
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:59,920
arbitrary stuff you're like

294
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:01,600
hey look at this match that i played and

295
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:03,680
it shows you winning

296
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,200
like then you presented to the

297
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,560
tournament organizer and say hey look

298
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,800
like i played this game here's the

299
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:11,119
replay i won and then

300
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:13,040
like that gets really complicated so

301
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,920
like how to implement that in a way that

302
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,439
probably doesn't like

303
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,760
open this pandora's box of people

304
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:20,800
cheating is gonna be tricky

305
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:22,319
uh so i wanna be able to both like stomp

306
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:25,279
out though like zero out those

307
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,320
um that that that heap data like i

308
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:27,680
mentioned without

309
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,360
kind of ruining it for everyone along

310
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:32,399
the way

311
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:35,600
i think uh billy of uh king kong fame

312
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:37,360
right now so through my head where

313
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,880
he's going like oh just modify the yeah

314
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,080
they can't use emulators for their proof

315
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,519
they have to use real machines and

316
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,279
record them and um

317
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:45,040
sure you've seen that that whole oh yeah

318
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:46,399
yeah at this point but i'm just thinking

319
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,120
that like i'll just change a couple bits

320
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:50,640
here

321
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:52,800
look at my score okay cool so

322
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,920
we're uh we're basically here on time i

323
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:57,040
just want to thank you

324
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:59,920
very very much i was so excited

325
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:01,360
so excited to see the call for paper you

326
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:03,519
know submission and then when i

327
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,959
saw the video you know being a hardcore

328
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:06,480
fgc guy for for

329
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:07,920
you know most of my life i live and

330
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,640
breathe street fighter i got it all you

331
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,160
know you can't see it

332
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:12,240
it's off camera now but i have my crap

333
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:13,360
all over so when i was like oh this

334
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,440
guy's a smasher

335
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,880
oh oh oh he wrote the damn bot i've seen

336
