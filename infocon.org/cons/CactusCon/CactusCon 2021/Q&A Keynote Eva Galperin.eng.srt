want to throw out there or

24
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:51,120
i figured i would just start with

25
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,640
thanking everyone uh

26
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,718
you guys have done such a wonderful job

27
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:57,520
of organizing this con and

28
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:58,000
it's been oh so long since i've been to

29
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,680
a physical

30
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,680
hacker convention that it's really nice

31
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:03,760
to be in

32
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,040
in this discord room that feels very

33
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:08,479
much uh

34
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,479
like the hacker cons of old

35
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,960
that's that makes us feel really good to

36
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,360
hear that so awesome

37
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,880
thank you so i'm going to go ahead and

38
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,159
just jump into some questions here we've

39
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:21,280
got around 11 minutes

40
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:23,439
our next talk starts so let's get to it

41
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,960
uh one of the questions and i think i'm

42
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:27,439
making the decision here and

43
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,559
read off all these discord names so

44
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:30,320
rather i think i'm just going to bust

45
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,560
out with a question

46
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,839
first question if relevant thoughts on

47
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,799
clearview ai

48
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:39,119
current issues in canada regard the mass

49
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:41,759
collection of people's biometric data

50
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:44,720
through facial recognition does the eff

51
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:47,439
help deal with those kinds of situations

52
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:49,119
well uh to begin with there there is

53
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:52,320
currently a lawsuit against

54
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:54,000
against clearview ai and i in the united

55
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,758
states that i'm fairly certain that

56
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,880
we're doing an amicus on

57
00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:01,280
uh the the defense is

58
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,158
uh that they're mounting is essentially

59
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,680
that uh

60
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:07,360
scraping all of facebook in order to uh

61
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,200
in order to pull everyone's pictures and

62
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,000
then putting them in a giant biometric

63
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:13,519
database

64
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,560
is in fact free speech and um

65
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:18,560
as much as eff loves free speech and boy

66
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,760
are we some like crazy free speech

67
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,959
maximalists

68
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:25,840
uh no uh if you want to see uh

69
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:27,200
efforts get really mad show them an

70
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,520
issue where free speech

71
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:32,799
goes up against privacy and you will see

72
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,800
them bear their fangs

73
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:39,599
i am keeping up less with the situation

74
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:43,119
in canada but eff does have an

75
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:46,079
international team that that looks at

76
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:51,840
canadian issues specifically and is more

77
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:51,840
familiar with canadian law than i am

78
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,360
awesome thank you very much appreciate

79
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:59,360
that

80
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:03,519
next question for you is the eff going

81
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:06,000
to open back up the internships program

82
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:06,800
well uh we actually do have interns uh

83
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,959
the eff

84
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:13,280
has uh interns for uh for the summer

85
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:14,560
uh from law schools so if you're

86
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,239
thinking about

87
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,760
about going to law school we take you

88
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:18,640
know everything from one else to three

89
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,040
else

90
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,000
i and those internships are currently

91
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,640
remote because

92
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,560
our office is also remote uh the eff

93
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,359
office is closed so that we don't give

94
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,400
everyone

95
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,680
uh and each other the plague i and i

96
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,319
expect that it will

97
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:36,560
remain closed for a while uh we also

98
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:39,920
have some volunteer opportunities

99
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:43,280
uh eff uh specifically my team

100
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:43,679
uh threat lab works uh it has worked

101
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,680
with

102
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,760
it with teams of students at the

103
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:51,360
university of nevada at reno

104

at the sort of student level uh fairly

111
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:09,519
often as long as we have specific

112
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,519
projects

113
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:12,879
that that they're interested in working

114
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:16,239
on

115
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:18,079
and also we have a technical mailing

116
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:19,358
list we have a mailing list that you can

117
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:23,600

and that is where eff sends messages

121
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:33,599
when we need somebody with a specific

122
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:36,560
technical skill

123
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:39,759
to to work on a specific project and

124
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,759

tidbit we'll drop that in the chat

127
00:04:44,919 --> 00:04:52,159
eff.org cooperating technologists

128
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:53,040
cool next question for you where do you

129
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,919
draw the line

130
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,720
between parental control software i know

131
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:58,639
where this is going i have a

132
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:01,759
nine-year-old daughter

133
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:02,800
spying on your kids versus using similar

134
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:05,280
tools to watch

135
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:07,039
spouse and or family i'm especially

136
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,799
curious to where you draw that line with

137
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:12,400
family members with dementia

138
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:14,960
or destructive addictive behavior

139
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:16,000
well i as it happens i have given this

140
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,000
some thought

141
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,520
um as far as i'm concerned it doesn't

142
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,639
matter who you're spying on

143
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:24,000
i it does not matter whether you are

144
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:26,240
tracking the behavior

145
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,919
of uh of a child or you're attracting

146
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,960
the behavior of

147
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:31,758
of your spouse or even a parent with

148
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,919
dementia

149
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:35,520
what matters is whether or not you are

150
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:38,320
tricking them into thinking that they're

151
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:41,520
not being spied on

152
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:42,960
that is really the the defining element

153
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:45,120
of stalker wear

154
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:47,039
if you have to fool your kids into

155
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,600
thinking that they're not being

156
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:50,960
that you're not watching them in order

157
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,720
to catch them doing

158
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:54,560
something you might want to consider

159
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,400
doing some parenting

160
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,400
likewise if you feel like you have to do

161
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:00,318
this with your spouse

162
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,440
you might want to consider you know a

163
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:03,759
divorce

164
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:05,120
because at this point you already know

165
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:06,479
what you're going to find

166
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,000
and if you don't know what you're going

167
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,560
to find and you're doing this in order

168
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,199
to

169
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,720
uh in order to control your partner

170
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:14,479
you're being an abuser

171
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,800
and that sort of stuff is really not

172
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:16,800
okay

173
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,880
so i think that that is extremely

174
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,680
relevant to many of us

175
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:27,440
who are here right now i'm a blue teamer

176
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:30,639
through and through hardcore

177
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:32,400
and the home lab right the the quote

178
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:33,680
unquote home lab whether it's an actual

179
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:36,080
server rack or just a

180
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:38,319
you know a box for a pf sense whatever

181
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,840
is a very common thing that we discuss

182
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:41,840
and that we have in our environments

183
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,919
many of us have them for that matter

184
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:46,080
during the interview process at

185
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:47,440
last job my last job and current job now

186
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,359
one of the things we do is we

187
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,719
do you have a home lab now there's a

188
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,199
connotation to that

189
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,800
are you spying on your whole family are

190
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:55,199
you doing ssl decryption too are you

191
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,759
seeing

192
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:58,479
all the stuff they do um so you know

193
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:00,639
where i to

194
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:02,800
to have mine enabled i actually don't

195
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:05,039
have one enabled first

196
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,080
kind of reasons because of that that's

197
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:07,199
something you definitely need

198
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,960
to think about you know we have a

199
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:10,240
nine-year-old daughter but i also have a

200
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,198
not nine-year-old wife

201
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,440
well that'd be weird if i had a

202
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:16,400
nine-year-old sorry

203
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:17,440
so my wife if i'm looking at you know

204
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,280
our daughter's stuff

205
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,639
would i see her stuff and and you know

206
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,440
like how does that how does that

207
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:23,599
translate

208
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:25,360
so that's that's a really good really

209
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:25,680
good topic to kind of mull over i like

210
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:31,280
that

211
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:33,120
thank you for that feedback the problem

212
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,638
uh i must have missed the first part of

213
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,199
this question so i'm going to go back to

214
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:40,000
it here

215
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:40,000
just give me one moment right here

216
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:48,240
scrolling up

217
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,239
and

218
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,479
i'm gonna move on and come back to that

219
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:58,240
one uh so the question there

220
00:07:54,479 --> 00:08:00,159
then is

221
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,759
could you provide some example about the

222
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:05,120
latin america region

223
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:08,160
specifically venezuela

224
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:11,280
well uh i will start with the general

225
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:12,400
latin american region uh generally we

226
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:15,919
have a

227
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:17,919
uh we have a director uh for

228
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:19,280
our our latin american work her name is

229
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:23,520
katissa rodriguez

230
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:26,400
uh she's originally from peru um

231
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,799
katitsa kicks my ass in the sense that

232
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,960
uh

233
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:31,280
i have personally taken part in the

234
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:34,958
overthrow of zero governments

235
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:36,958
uh and uh and she was there for the

236
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:38,640
for the overthrow of the authoritarian

237
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:41,518
government in uh in peru

238
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:42,718
so that's pretty cool uh we have we have

239
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:46,240
other people who are

240
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:48,399
who have lived in brazil mostly

241
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:50,080
uh doing doing work for us in the latin

242
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:53,120
american region

243
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:55,600
and threat lab is taking part in

244
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,640
a project in which we are sending foia

245
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:59,279
requests

246
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:01,279
to a bunch of latin american governments

247
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:02,000
i mean not actual foia requests because

248
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:04,720
foia is

249
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,120
an american law but essentially we are

250
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,880
testing out their versions of foia

251
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:11,360
to see whether or not they even work

252
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,560
because if they do oh man we've got some

253
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:16,399
uh

254
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:18,000
we have questions that we will be asking

255
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:19,760
and we definitely have some stuff that

256
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
we want to map out in the

257
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:23,040
in the area of you know privacy and

258
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,640
surveillance

259
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:31,680
throughout latin america venezuela is

260
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:33,920
sort of a different issue um

261
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:36,560
often the latin american countries that

262
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:37,199
eff does the most work in uh are divided

263
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:40,319
up into

264
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:43,519
two categories one is uh

265
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:47,040
countries where the where the government

266
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:48,160
is uh very actively spying on dissidents

267
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,160
and journalists and

268
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:51,839
sort of people who speak truth to power

269
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:54,480
and this can be anything from

270
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:55,440
venezuela to say the government of

271
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,760
mexico

272
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:59,519
uh the mexican the mexican government is

273
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,720
actually a wide and sprawling thing and

274
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:02,640
then there's the whole question of what

275
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,279
part of the mexican government is spying

276
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:06,480
on you

277
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:08,800
uh and it matters but uh

278
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,880
there have definitely been uh people in

279
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:13,839
the mexican government who have used

280
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:15,120
spyware um not commercially available

281
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:16,800
spyware but spyware that they have

282
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:19,279
mostly purchased from the manifold group

283
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:21,599
uh to spy on their political opponents

284
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:24,000
we have not seen that in venezuela

285
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:25,920
um i would be super interested in seeing

286
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,839
some venezuelan government malware

287
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:30,240
and if anybody has any just send it

288
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:32,079
directly to me

289
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,920
like not be a virus total just fire it

290
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:37,359

very much due to time we need to wrap up

293
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,880

294
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:45,360
