wade who just gave an awesome talk on

12
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:40,000
linux analysis and we're gonna jump into

13
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,599
some questions and just kind of

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,559
pick his brain a little bit but first

15
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:47,680
we're gonna go ahead and select a winner

16
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:49,919
select the winner live for chapin

17
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:53,760
bryce's digital forensics book

18
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,760
and boop there we go

19
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:59,840

of titles you know your actual titles

27
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,320
within the talk the cli method kind of

28
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,720
even just like the sleep

29
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:23,839
60 yeah it was that was creative i

30
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,759
enjoyed that

31
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:28,799
um thank you for your talk you know as

32
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:31,600
an instant response consultant myself

33
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:32,640
we really don't see as many as i would

34
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:36,000
like to see

35
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:37,439
um you know linux engagements so any and

36
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,880
all training in this realm

37
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:43,279
is just extremely welcome and oh my lord

38
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,158
thank you for freaking mentioning hey

39
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,720
hey

40
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:47,840
don't jump on the box and and start

41
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:51,039
running lslf

42
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,439
let alone other stuff uh log rotations

43
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,439
are

44
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:54,880
common you know when analyzing linux

45
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:57,119
environments especially to us

46
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,479
by the time we get it the linux dev cert

47
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:59,920
you know devs have you know run

48
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:02,240
everything under the sun

49
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,680
uh default short buffers in history for

50
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:05,280
example are like you know basically

51
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,719
swapped out and we're like cool story

52
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,199
bro

53
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:10,560
so yeah uh again thank you for your talk

54
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:12,319
very very cool

55
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,640
uh anything you want to lead us off here

56
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:16,958
with to discuss up front

57
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,079
um i mean the the big thing is i mean

58
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:19,440
this talk kind of

59
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:22,160
was really meant to show how easy it is

60
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:23,599
to set something up at home like this um

61
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,280
if you don't have link skills and i want

62
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:27,839
people to work in linux environments

63
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,120
um you can get the skills set it up uh

64
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:32,239
but a big part of this

65
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:34,400
is i so long you suggest people

66
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:35,440
set up the lab don't follow the script

67
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,840
that sets it up for you

68
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,720
there's a place for that but uh half of

69
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,400
this is just

70
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,840
learning to shoot yourself in the foot

71
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,760
and rebuild it and

72
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,360
continue to remake it and redo it again

73
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,679
because a lot of those same skill sets

74
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,560
are

75
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,000
what's going to help you figure out

76
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,200
what's normal in the linux environment

77
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,319
what's not normal where you should look

78
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,119
for things where you shouldn't look for

79
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:52,879
things

80
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,000
um and a lot of ir is like you know

81
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:55,280
baseline what's normal what's the

82
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,800
context for this

83
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,959
um so having some of the hands-on

84
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,159
experiences is super helpful

85
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:02,840
you don't have to know everything but

86
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:04,560
it's good to have a lot of those basics

87
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,840
down

88
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,840
do you find that you or your

89
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:09,280
organization or even just folks who run

90
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:12,400
in your circle if you will

91
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:15,599
end up working a decent number of linux

92
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:18,480
like just next base engagements

93
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:19,280
um it's kind of a mix of i i go to amy

94
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,560
obviously we

95
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,760
have a ton of servers every show hosting

96
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,879
fleet we have you know whole corporate

97
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,399
side of the house so i mean it's a good

98
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:25,440
mix of windows and linux

99
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,120
because a lot of what we do is web

100
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:29,200
servers of course linux is huge there

101
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,720
for us so really kind of pinned

102
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,399
what environment you're talking about we

103
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,400
have a decent mix of both but

104
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,319
we're probably a little unique in that

105
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,360
um you know there's not a lot of shops

106
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:39,518
that probably have

107
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,720
you know 100 000 plus servers where 60

108
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:42,560
70 percent of linux

109
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,920
you know it's uh so that's definitely a

110
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,120
challenge it's a challenge for us hiring

111
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,079
you know usually you get like the winner

112
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,440
side of the house you know people got

113
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,400
that down super easy but like it's a

114
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:51,120
challenge but

115
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,400
um incident wise it can be kind of

116
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,599
either one it also

117
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,120
kind of mentioned in a talk it depends

118
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:56,720
on what you're talking about if it's a

119
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,400
workstation or a laptop

120
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:00,480
um you're more likely to see windows

121
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,840
incidents um kind of depends on the

122
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:05,518
server one environment but

123
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:06,319
uh i would say it's surprising like a 50

124
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:08,640
50 split

125
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:08,640
for us

126
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:13,120
well you get to work more than i do then

127
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:15,120
so

128
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,239
it's very very cool you have a preferred

129
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,079
linux distro

130
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:19,440
what's your uh what's your flavor would

131
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:21,040
you like

132
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,560
uh i mean i just kind of go with the

133
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,479
easy classic centos

134
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,240
um we'll see coming up how that works

135
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:27,680
out uh with centos eight

136
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,520
into life now being shorter than since

137
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:32,479
seven but since i've been still using

138
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:33,599
2.7 uh python 2.7 which is end of life

139
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:35,680
so

140
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,199
that'll be a challenge for a lot of orgs

141
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,800
uh but i think you know ultimately

142
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:41,199
it's synthesis is going to be my

143
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:44,320
favorite red hat

144
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:44,320
related is always good for me

145
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,759
yep um

146
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:53,359
i i rpm systems i just

147
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:54,800
i never personally loved them i went to

148
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,479
the debian side myself

149
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,720
and it's just always funny how it ends

150
00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:02,800
up being like you know vim versus nano

151
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:06,800
or it's like no that's stupid

152
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:08,720
attitudes and all this silly stuff

153
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,000
i mean really it's just just a package

154
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,800
manager that's the only difference you

155
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,400
just gotta learn

156
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,600
you know learn linux and then figure out

157
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,320
the package manager that's the only

158
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,440
difference

159
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:20,639
yeah right uh

160
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:23,039
so we got a question here in the chat

161
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:24,479
two of them actually one of them is so

162
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:25,759
you mentioned not getting on a host to

163
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:28,800
run commands

164
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:32,800
want to go more in depth on that ooh

165
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:34,639
uh yeah i would definitely say

166
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,080
as an org you know like particularly

167
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:37,199
doing security there's different levels

168
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:39,520
of maturity

169
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:40,800
um so being able to alert and hop in the

170
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,919
hospital what happened stuff like that

171
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,520
is is one level

172
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:45,359
um obviously you always want to strive

173
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:47,440
to be more mature more more secure and i

174
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,199
think part of that is being able to

175
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,880
uh triage or investigate my host without

176
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:52,240
actually logging in without potentially

177
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,000
exposing your credentials

178
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,840
uh without kind of ruining that

179
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,680
forensically sound you know disk image

180
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,799
whether or not you can take a disk image

181
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,759
and quarantine that machine i mean

182
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,360
that's another part of the material

183
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:03,039
level too um

184
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,560
but instilling at the very beginning

185
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:06,318
that if you hop on the box

186
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,840
and you're running commands you're

187
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:08,400
potentially destroying data you can use

188
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,239
right

189
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,440
do you need a memory dump cool you're

190
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,520
running stuff

191
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:15,120
you're blasting some of that memory out

192
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:17,039
uh if it's not used so

193
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,400
that that's one thing i would suggest um

194
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:20,479
you know like velociraptor or something

195
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,840
for edr that you can use uh to not have

196
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:22,960
to be in the box or square you can do

197
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,719
certain things

198
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:26,479
um but like i kind of mentioned like you

199
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,319
know salt ansible anything that could

200
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:30,159
run remotely do commands for you you can

201
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:32,840
write a shell script you can do it

202
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:35,039
um you know a huge portion of like the

203
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:36,960
enterprise you know triage tools

204
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:38,400
it's just powershell scripts and shell

205
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,599
scripts so there's no reason you can't

206
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,960
recreate that yourself it's just a

207
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,880
little bit more work up front but

208
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,318
that's why i strongly stick don't don't

209
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:46,080
get on the box do everything you can to

210
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:47,280
avoid that

211
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,840
and if you are getting on the box you

212
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:51,198
know if that creator you're using is

213
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,719
tied to 80 or whatever okay cool you're

214
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:53,599
burning that and you get off that box

215
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,599
but ideally you

216
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:56,960
you either have a a specific local

217
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:58,080
account or something you can kill

218
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:01,039
you're not going to reuse those credits

219
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:04,159
but just assume that they're gone

220
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:07,360
i absolutely love the fact that

221
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,840
you discuss using essentially an agent

222
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,599
that

223
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:11,280
is already there or in the sense that it

224
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:14,400
should already be there

225
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:15,599
salt ansible chef puppet whatever um

226
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,919
something going into a high state

227
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:18,719
whatever term they uh you saw last right

228
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:21,198
so

229
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:23,120
the ability to use what already is there

230
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:23,759
it just it does such a great job of

231
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,759
avoiding

232
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:27,680
additional stomping that you'd be doing

233
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:28,639
by bringing your toolbox into the

234
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,520
environment and

235
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:32,960
consulting we see it all the damn time

236
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,719
you know in a windows environment they

237
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,758
bring in a bunch of ps tools and they're

238
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,520
running like you know

239
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:39,280
process hacker and then we're like okay

240
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:41,840
well the threat actor dropped process

241
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:44,159
hacker but then we see you dropped

242
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:46,000
what are you doing yeah like yeah who

243
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:48,400
installed ps exec and why

244
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,520
you know how many times did they stop on

245
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,520
that same service

246
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:53,198
you know i think a lot of folks just

247
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,960
don't realize that when they do those

248
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:55,360
kinds of things like when they run ps

249
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,198
exec

250
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,240
it's installing a service remotely and

251
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:58,800
you're like you know what i'm saying

252
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,160
it's just

253
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,000
this huge thing that people think

254
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,599
they're just taking a quick look

255
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,520
and then oh we'll pull the consulting

256
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:06,479
group or or bother with our cyber

257
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:08,159
insurance later

258
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:10,080
and then but by doing that you're

259
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:12,479
already you're already causing problems

260
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,919
stop it so i really i really like that

261
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:14,560
folks you know a lot more companies

262
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:16,639
these days

263
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,919
are you know deploying things like salt

264
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:20,479
and ansible and shut

265
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:22,000
you know so i i love that that's cool

266
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:25,039
thank you for mentioning that

267
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,360
there's another question in here uh view

268
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:28,639
on

269
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:29,280
red hat support or oracle is that other

270
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:31,840
oracle

271
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,559
says or oracle uh probably or is gonna

272
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:35,679
be my guess

273
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:36,880
um honestly it

274
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:40,239
that's gonna really kind of depend on

275
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:41,360
your org

276
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,560
you know obviously if you go to red hat

277
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,839
you have a lot more if you actually pay

278
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,319
for red hat support you get a lot more

279
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:45,519
likes

280
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,640
was it like satellite or whatever the

281
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:48,640
package management thing there's a lot

282
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:50,080
more bells and whistles there i think

283
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:52,080
i haven't looked too much into oracle's

284
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:54,080
thing but it's oracle so

285
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,279
assume that there's going to be a sale

286
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:58,080
at some point there

287
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:59,439
um that's probably a fair assessment um

288
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,080
but i mean go with whatever works best

289
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,640
for your org

290
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,920
um was the cloud linux is also doing

291
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,760
their own fork so if you're

292
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:07,040
uh you know cloud link shop and they do

293
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,319
a lot of custom kernel stuff

294
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,760
they're doing they're already a four

295
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,040
percent they're gonna actually do and

296
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:13,600
maintain their own fork

297
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,719
uh another option for a lot of people uh

298
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,160
because cloud links

299
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,080
if you don't know it's another group

300
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:19,760
that they offer um

301
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:21,519
kind of like extended supports you can

302
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:23,279
buy like into life centos

303
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:24,640
six packages from them can buy support

304
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:26,320
package so even if

305
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,760
centos isn't releasing security packages

306
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,519
they're back ported uh

307
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:31,040
that's just a paid thing but that's you

308
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:32,240
know if you're stuck in scent six

309
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,439
into life and trying to get onto

310
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,480
something more secure that can give you

311
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,959
a little more time

312
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,720
um but yeah it'll it's going to be a

313
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:39,359
challenge for a lot of orcs yeah centos

314
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,800
is

315
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,000
was assumed to be kind of the free

316
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,800
version of red hat that you know when

317
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,800
you want to pay for it

318
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:52,000
another question we have here in the

319
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:54,640
chat is there a room or a path for ir

320
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,519
specializing in linux with very little

321
00:09:54,640 --> 00:10:01,040
experience in the internals of windows

322
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:05,040
i think so um the challenge there is i

323
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:07,199
mean obviously the um

324
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:08,959
number of jobs that require linux only

325
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,120
it's kind of few and far between

326
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:12,399
so like any time that you severely

327
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,120
specialize right you're kind of

328
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:15,519
narrowing your

329
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:16,399
your scope of potential places you can

330
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:18,160
work

331
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:19,120
um but i think there's i mean there's

332
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,399
absolutely a place where it's just like

333
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,720
there's a place for

334
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:23,600
mac os x right or mac os or whatever you

335
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,399
wanna call it now it is

336
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:28,160
um there you can specialize there too

337
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:28,880
but when you do so you you kind of limit

338
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,800
yourself

339
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:32,560
um but you don't need to know windows

340
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,920
internals at all for for linux

341
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,518
it actually probably almost helps you if

342
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:37,360
you don't because you don't have any you

343
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:39,680
know preconceived notions

344
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:41,440
uh you can learn from the ground up um

345
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,279
but like i kind of mentioned like ir

346
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,480
workflow itself doesn't change

347
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:46,240
depending on what operating system

348
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,640
you're on it's still kind of follow the

349
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:49,200
same

350
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:50,640
workflow the same steps um just you know

351
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,760
where you go to look for persistence is

352
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,600
different you know

353
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,800
what the normal looks like is different

354
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,839
the data you can get in and out is

355
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:58,000
different but

356
00:10:55,839 --> 00:11:00,320
um you know link sets its own challenges

357
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,120
a lot of it's just tooling it's catching

358
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:04,320
up but

359
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,880
tooling is a big one i love that you

360
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,160
said that

361
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:09,279
about potentially not

362
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:11,360
it's kind of like when someone moved

363
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:13,279
from one martial art to another

364
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:15,440
if you've trained you know classically

365
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:16,240
in karate uh like a shotokan based

366
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,079
karate for like

367
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,360
you know even five ten years and then

368
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:21,279
you move to something else

369
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:23,360
like you're just gonna have those roots

370
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:24,160
no matter what it's really hard to break

371
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,480
that

372
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:27,519
windows not only is windows an absolute

373
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:30,560
snitch

374
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:32,399
but it's file system the ntfs is

375
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:34,560
such a snitch you know what i mean it's

376
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:35,920
like oh here's my mft and here's my usn

377
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:39,599
journal and oh yay

378
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:39,599
all right and then the ext is like

379
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:43,120
it's it's very very different and hope

380
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
for the best uh

381
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,880
yeah exactly so i i really like you know

382
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,399
you look at

383
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:51,040
someone who's gone through you know like

384
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:52,560
the sans 500 windows forensic poster if

385
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,800
you're familiar shout out to sans one of

386
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,518
our

387
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:56,719
in-kind sponsors um you know you see

388
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:58,720
that you're looking at all these

389
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,079
registry locations like damn

390
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:03,200
and then you go to linux and you're like

391
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:04,160
bar log i want all that

392
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:07,279
i mean like you know what i'm saying to

393
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:08,240
start off it's so so different so it can

394
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:10,720
be

395
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,519
really useful um maybe even to start

396
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,760
with linux

397
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:14,560
just to get that that response feel of

398
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:16,000
where to go and

399
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:18,239
understanding that and then opening it

400
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,560
up to windows i don't know

401
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,000
yeah i mean linux sometimes feels like

402
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:24,239
there's less places to hide until you

403
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,440
get into rootkit territory um

404
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,959
versus windows like you mentioned it's

405
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,600
like okay cool i've got these folders

406
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:28,880
that all around

407
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,320
these registry keys that are run and

408
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,600
there's like a million of them and then

409
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:34,000
like every user has its own

410
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,600
multiplied of that and links it's like

411
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
okay well i mean i can throw it in etsy

412
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,399
and d

413
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,120
rc.d i can do a cron job okay i'm kind

414
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:41,200
of out

415
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,160
you know yeah it's a little bit more

416
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,200
limited so

417
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:45,199
there's a little bit less targets to

418
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,480
linux but

419
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:50,079
yeah they each have their own unique

420
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:53,200
challenge they're both fun

421
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:56,000
yeah another one for you zero trust

422
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:57,360
networks are they a myth and how does it

423
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:03,519
affect ir

424
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:03,519
and linux doesn't affect r links because

425
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,880
the best way i can put that is you you

426
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:09,040
should never assume you're safe because

427
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:11,120
of your network topology right so like

428
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:12,560
uh i wouldn't say that zero trust

429
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:14,480
networks are a myth

430
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:16,319
i would say that it's extremely

431
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:19,440
extremely difficult

432
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:20,639
to actually do it correctly um

433
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,560
that's going to be a huge challenge i

434
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:26,560
don't think anybody really is i

435
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:26,560
still have to do my dog's going crazy

436
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:38,399
um um so therefore it's super hard to do

437
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:40,320
so you just have to assume you're still

438
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:41,279
going to have to do ir it's not going to

439
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:44,560
change ir

440
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:47,120
it might change your kind of

441
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:48,560
what risk you have um you know as far as

442
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,279
like what's actually out there what's

443
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,880
visible

444
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:54,000
uh but ultimately it's still gonna be

445
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:54,000
risky ir

446
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:05,519
very important question what kind of dog

447
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:05,518
is barking

448
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:09,439
uh one's a chihuahua if you haven't

449
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:12,479
guessed but i'm still going um

450
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:14,959
there's a bichon and it'll be shampoo

451
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:15,600
nice we're in the era of remote workers

452
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:17,760
man

453
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,839
it wouldn't be a conference let alone

454
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:21,199
any conference call throughout the day

455
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:23,680
without multiple dogs

456
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:25,120
going nuts so oh yeah absolutely

457
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,638
perfectly fine

458
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,880
uh another one for you how do you

459
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:31,839
interface with teams like devops

460
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,839
during ir work

461
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,279
that's that's actually always a

462
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:37,519
challenge

463
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:38,959
um because the better your teams get at

464
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:40,160
devops the more hands-on they want to be

465
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:41,599
and they want more they want to mess up

466
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,319
your ir it's the best way to put that

467
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,440
right because they

468
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,360
they want to get in there they want to

469
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,800
fix the solution they might have the

470
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,320
the knowledge and skill set to do it or

471
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,120
to find what's wrong but they're going

472
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,720
to be on the box they're going to be

473
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,199
touching your data so the best thing you

474
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,199
can do

475
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:54,800
is just like the secure development

476
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:55,760
lifecycle get in there early with those

477
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:58,880
teams

478
00:14:55,760 --> 00:15:00,399
make those uh relationships um

479
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:02,000
you know if there's a big team like to

480
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:03,519
designate like hey you're the one sme

481
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,639
security guy for your team if you guys

482
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:07,279
see something weird

483
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:08,480
train that guy on instant response what

484
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:09,760
what's the process how does he

485
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:11,600
communicate with ir

486
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:13,439
what should should he not do what data

487
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:15,360
does he need to bring to the ir team

488
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:17,920
to get things started so that you kind

489
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:21,120
of have you know a sleeper agent

490
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:22,560
in each devops team to help you do ir um

491
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,240
because that that person is also going

492
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:26,079
to help you you know depend on your

493
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,760
documentation but you know where do you

494
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:29,519
where how does this application work

495
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,880
does it have application specific logs

496
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:31,600
that are not going to the stem is going

497
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,040
somewhere else

498
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,959
you know that's somebody who's going to

499
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:36,480
be announcing me on that application

500
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:38,160
and that product that architecture that

501
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:40,160
can help the ir team out

502
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:41,839
and then simultaneously ir train that
