the worst stories we can find

29
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:13,679

00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,720
started right after

42
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:38,640
defcon ended and then like ended right

way to kill time between deaf clients

46
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,798
but it's

47
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,799

their work safe to keep their sources

54
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:03,360

actually dropped out in order to start

71
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:37,280
your friendly local neighborhood

72
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,280
hackerspace heatsink laps

73
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:44,079
all right so welcome back to our

74
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:46,399
online zoom roast as it were so we're

75
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:50,080
having a zoom barbecue this year

76
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:52,319
um but we still have lots to serve

77
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,760
uh yeah what kind of journalism do we

78
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:55,359
have on the grill

79
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,200
uh so today we're talking about writing

80
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,200
we're gonna ignore all the the worst of

81
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:03,040
cyber security television radio

82
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:08,000
podcast youtube tick tock journalism

83
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:08,799
cool uh and and just a few reminders

84
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,159
because it's easy

85
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,680
i think it's kind of easy for some

86
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:13,280
people in the hacker community to sort

87
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,879
of hate on journalism

88
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,640
um just because you read a bad article

89
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:18,000
doesn't mean the author is a terrible

90
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,040
writer and everything they write is

91
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,440
horrible

92
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,879
um and some there are bad writers but

93
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,560
that doesn't mean that the site they

94
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:26,239
write for is always bad

95
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,560
and just because there's some bad sites

96
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:29,920
doesn't mean that um the entire industry

97
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,400
is bad every time

98
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:34,000
um so kind of what we want to do is uh

99
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,599
help people get better all we can do is

100
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,360
our best but we can always get better

101
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:39,839
um like we think it's important that

102
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:43,120
there isn't misinformation spread by

103
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:45,040
bad headlines and bad reporting um and

104
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,720
uh just a reminder to follow the work of

105
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,319
individual journalists who do great work

106
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,840
people bounce around a lot there's

107
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:52,560
always layoffs and

108
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,760
and people just switching jobs uh so

109
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,760
instead of saying like oh this

110
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:57,439
publication is good or bad you can

111
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:00,560
follow the work of individuals who you

112
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:04,480
think are are good

113
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:06,640
very cool um so this this first

114
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,840
story that we're gonna start with is is

115
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:10,958
not so much

116
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,599
a cyber security story um we actually

117
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,640
had to

118
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:17,039
dig through a lot to find um

119
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,478
the sort of bad cyber security stories

120
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,680
that we were able to

121
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:23,280
um share with you today uh

122
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,880
this one though happens to be a good

123
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:28,159
example of um

124
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:31,360
you know some very kind of obvious

125
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:33,040
uh mistakes and bad things uh that you

126
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,680
should definitely not do

127
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,720
as a journalist covering tech uh so this

128
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:41,120
is a story from

129
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:44,240
the national review uh it is um

130
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:45,440
basically uh false so this headline is

131
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:49,919
actually wrong

132
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:52,800
uh it turns out uh kamala harris is not

133
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:54,719
the kind of kama harris's former press

134
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,680
secretary is not the face of twitter

135
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,880
censorship

136
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:01,600
and actually has uh nothing really to do

137
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:02,080
with the authorization of you know who

138
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,240
to

139
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,840
suspend or remove from the twitter

140
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,479
platform

141
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,039
uh in this case the headline was not

142
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,639
corrected

143
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:13,280
this was shared over 9000 times on

144
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:14,960
twitter uh and then only after that was

145
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,479
a you know small correction kind of

146
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,159
added at the end

147
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:20,159
uh we're going to be touching on

148
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:22,240
corrections in kind of some of the other

149
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:24,560
stories that we're going to talk about

150
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:26,400
and uh in this case we have one we have

151
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,080
a correction here but we don't have a

152
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:30,000
corrected headline

153
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:32,159
uh which if anybody is familiar with the

154
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
way people consume these on twitter

155
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,199
people usually don't get beyond just the

156
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,639
headline

157
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:42,160
whoops so

158
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:44,560
there's a little bit about um

159
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:46,080
sort of how editorial processes and how

160
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,560
you know the different processes that go

161
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,560
into

162
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,680
fixing things after they're published uh

163
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,280
go into play

164
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,720
uh that are not necessarily as fast

165
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,080
moving or as iterative as

166
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,319
you know something we might be used to

167
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:58,880
dealing with in tech and security

168
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:59,680
whereas if as a software engineer i were

169
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:02,319
to

170
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,800
fix an issue that was causing bugs i

171
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:05,759
would

172
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,160
you know create a fork of the repository

173
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:08,400
um

174
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,199
create a pull request argue with the

175
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:12,080
maintainer

176
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:12,880
maybe get it merged uh journalism is a

177
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:16,159
little bit different

178
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:17,840
where you know there are uh sort of

179
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,840
changes that get made in post if

180
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:21,280
something is discovered to be uh

181
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:23,919
unfactual

182
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:25,198
and uh in some cases a note saying like

183
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:26,719
hey we this is a

184
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:28,080
big thing that we changed so here's a

185
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,160
note on what we changed this is

186
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:32,560
different from the original

187
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:34,000
so if the fact in the story is wrong

188
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,639
that fact should be corrected if

189
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,319
the entire premise of the story this

190
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:39,120
story should be retracted which is to

191
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:42,319
say just like

192
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,960
thrown in the dumpster which is on fire

193
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:46,319
because

194
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:48,000
2020. uh and in this case

195
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:51,360
you know the premise of the story is

196
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,199
false should have been a retraction

197
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,400
so let's talk about what went wrong like

198
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:58,639
how do these things happen

199
00:06:54,400 --> 00:07:00,479
so back in idaho when i was a young lad

200
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:01,360
i worked at a grocery store as my first

201
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:03,440
job

202
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,800
and the owner of the grocery store rick

203
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,319
used to have the same

204
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,639
as i was like learning the ropes of

205
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:10,960
having a job for the first time

206
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:12,639
and he was like david never assume it

207
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:16,080
makes an ass out of

208
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:18,960
you and me and i think

209
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,919
that's a valuable lesson to learn in

210
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,318
journalism

211
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:23,039
but also just kind of everything in life

212
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:26,400
in

213
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:28,800
just in general uh and it would help if

214
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,758
writers would not assume uh things that

215
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,400
turn out to

216
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:34,639
be very false without actually fact

217
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:36,400
checking them first

218
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:37,759
uh and then there's also the issue of

219
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,599
just like not everybody that writes

220
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:42,479
things on the internet is gonna be

221
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:43,039
super well versed in journalistic ethics

222
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:44,878
or

223
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:46,400
you know just general practices and

224
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:48,960
norms

225
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:50,719
also though twitter's not exactly making

226
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:53,599
this easy

227
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:55,360
there is a lot of opacity into like how

228
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:58,719
the bird side works

229
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:00,479
um how decisions get made who makes them

230
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,319
um there's not a lot of transparency

231
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:03,599
there um speaking from personal

232
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:06,080
experience i've had a

233
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:07,759
twitter account suspended uh with an

234
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,159
email saying that i have via one of my

235
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:10,960
tweets

236
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:12,080
violated in terms of service this was an

237
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:14,799
account with

238
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:15,599
zero tweets in it uh i logged in from

239
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,759
linux

240
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:18,878
apparently uh twitter doesn't like that

241
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:20,800
so there's you know

242
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:22,000
a lot that is unknown about how things

243
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:26,879
work there

244
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:29,599
it would be cool if we knew more

245
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:30,879
all right and yell you have a story for

246
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:32,958
us here

247
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:34,640
yes next step is we have this um art

248
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:37,359
story which is talking about um

249
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:41,838
signal and how celebrite can break into

250
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:41,839
it even though it's encrypted

251
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:47,600
and um this was actually celebrate

252
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,880
already had access to people's unlocked

253
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,600
phones and it was talking about how to

254
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,640
like

255
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:54,000
pull that data and organize it basically

256
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,439
and so obviously there's a difference

257
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,200
between if you have somebody's unlocked

258
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,680
phone and can read their messages or if

259
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,160
you can

260
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:01,120
you know remotely decrypt all signal

261
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:03,600
messages

262
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,320
uh and the article didn't really explain

263
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,080
that

264
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,839
um so that was really annoying for

265
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,720
people freaking out about signal being

266
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,480
broken

267
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,399
um and then after haaretz wrote this

268
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:15,760
story bbc broke the same story

269
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:18,880
um pretty similar um but made it worse

270
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:20,720
they just uh yeah celebrate claim to

271
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:22,000
have crack chat apps encryption

272
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:24,080
and it's like what does cracking

273
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
encryption actually mean and if you read

274
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,920
the article they have this quote

275
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,920
according to one cyber security expert

276
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:33,040
the claim sounded believable

277
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:34,640
um that's not that's not reporting

278
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:36,240
like you have to actually look at data

279
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,839
not just like this person said this

280
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,680
sounded plausible

281
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:41,120
um and then obviously make a distinction

282
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:43,199
between like are you decrypting

283
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:45,680
intercepted messages or are you like do

284
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:47,920
you have somebody's unlocked phone

285
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:49,680
um and it wasn't just bbc that bandwagon

286
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:53,360
on her it's a story there was a

287
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:54,800
other people who did too and you can see

288
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:58,320
a lot of edits saying like oh

289
00:09:54,800 --> 00:10:00,240
psych but it's just really good to kind

290
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,839
of look into these things ahead of time

291
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:04,240
instead of jumping into it when a lot of

292
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:06,160
people are talking about it um

293
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,279
because sometimes you have

294
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,880
misinformation

295
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:11,360
and how art's kind of later wrote a

296
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:14,240
story saying looks like

297
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:15,680
um but i don't know like like it's kind

298
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,360
of an important thing that you want to

299
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,800
get right the first time and obviously

300
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,399
that's easier said than done i've had

301
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,279
errors and stories i think most

302
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:24,560
journalists have

303
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:26,240
but for something as important as that

304
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,439
that could really like affect signal

305
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,360
users who are using

306
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,399
it for sensitive information i think

307
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,360
it's really important to kind of

308
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:32,640
understand

309
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,959
what you're talking about a little bit

310
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,959
better

311
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,640
um so what went wrong so yeah there was

312
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:40,880
claims from self-right they weren't put

313
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:43,199
into the appropriate context

314
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:44,959
um and you know it's hard being a tech

315
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,560
reporter because even if you know a lot

316
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:47,920
about one type of tech you might not

317
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:50,959
know about another

318
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:52,560
area of it but in this case it's very

319
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:54,000
important to kind of explain the

320
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,680
difference between encryption and rest

321
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,839
or in transit

322
00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:00,959
we also saw that like i saw that signal

323
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:02,800
had written a blog post but it was after

324
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:04,079
both of these sites had written stories

325
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,920
and i wonder if they could have done it

326
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:08,399
more preemptively

327
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:10,399
and uh and then again like people with

328
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:12,240
huge followings can avoid bandwagoning

329
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:15,839
a little a little bit maybe wait to get

330
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,839
more clear information

331
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:20,399
um but what if you are concerned about

332
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:23,200
someone taking your phone so i

333
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:23,920
will turn it back to david thanks yell

334
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,480
um

335
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:28,000
so yeah i think this is you know a

336
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,640
subject that i talk about a lot with

337
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,519
journalists

338
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:33,519
because signal is like um very much a

339
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:36,079
staple in the kind of digital security

340
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:39,360
toolkit that we tend to recommend

341
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:42,719
uh in this case just to kind of

342
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:44,720
kind of clear how this all works um

343
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:47,360
tools like those made by companies like

344
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:49,519
celebrate like greatkey

345
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:52,079
try to get into your phone by unlocking

346
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:53,440
it and they do so by trying to

347
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:55,359
unlock your phone through whatever

348
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:59,760
passcode you sent to it

349
00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:01,920
and they know that most people choose um

350
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:03,120
very common and predictable passcodes to

351
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:05,040
the point that they

352
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:07,279
will use you know what most of you may

353
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:10,560
be familiar with a dictionary attack

354
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:12,240
um using uh known

355
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:14,160
passcodes that have been used in

356
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,600
previous finds on other phones

357
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:17,120
essentially so you have basically this

358
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,120
giant list of

359
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,399
known used passcodes that they run

360
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:22,959
through to see if there's a match and

361
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:26,399
then unlock the phone if there is one

362
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:28,319
and that is why we generally recommend

363
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:30,160
opting for something that is randomly

364
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:32,880
generated

365
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:35,120
long uh or even better yet instead of

366
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:37,360
going with a numeric passcode going with

367
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,880
an alphanumeric passcode

368
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,480
there's also some you know there may be

369
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:42,720
some use cases for things like

370
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,839
the uh biometrics but at the same time

371
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,600
there's also

372
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:47,200
some fifth amendment protections to

373
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,720
think about as you're like balancing

374
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,880
those two options

375
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,800
uh we have a little bit about that on

376
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:55,839
our website at freedom.press

377
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:57,680
uh with a sort of guidebook on mobile

378
00:12:55,839 --> 00:13:00,399
security uh written by my colleague

379
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,399
martin shelton

380
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,920
and signal has another feature that i

381
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:06,959
think isn't really

382
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:09,839
super well known but i think is really

383
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:12,638
great and that is disappearing messages

384
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:13,680
this can help sort of automate being

385
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:16,160
able to like call

386
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:17,519
old signal messages in a conversation so

387
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:19,439
that

388
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:21,760
if somebody does seize your phone and

389
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:23,600
use one of these forensics tools on it

390
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:25,439
they would only be able to access you

391
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:28,560
know a certain recent amount of

392
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:30,639
of co of chats in a conversation this

393
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:32,079
has to be set per conversation

394
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:33,519
that's something that like both parties

395
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:33,839
on the line so to speak have to agree

396
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:35,839
with

397
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:37,760
in terms of like whether to keep

398
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:39,120
messages around for like a day or a week

399
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:41,199
for example

400
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,720
um and signal in this case has some

401
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:43,880
support documentation help you get

402
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,600
started you can go to

403
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:47,360
support.sigmund.org

404
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:49,839
we have a link here and you can kind of

405
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:52,480
look for how to turn on that feature

406
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:52,480
in your device

407
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:58,160
cool so we have a article here

408
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:00,000
that i want to talk about this case from

409
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:03,600
the new york times

410
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:06,639
uh so at the very beginning of

411
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:09,680
a lot of the uh tick tock discourse um

412
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:10,240
that we kind of ran into i was expecting

413
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,638
to see

414
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:14,399
a lot more fud a lot more fear

415
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:16,240
uncertainty and doubt and a lot of bad

416
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:18,320
reporting to come out of this

417
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:19,839
um fortunately for the world and

418
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,959
unfortunately for this presentation most

419
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:22,800
of the writing around that actually

420
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:25,359
turned out to be pretty good

421
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:26,880
um maybe they they saw or heard about

422
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,320
our talk from 2019

423
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,760
and decided they really don't want to

424
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,000
end up on this presentation in which

425
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,279
case

426
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,760
then we'll just give ourselves a high

427
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:35,439
five um

428
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,560
that is to say though that you know

429
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,519
there are some things that could be

430
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:39,199
improved in this

431
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:40,959
um we'll talk a little bit about this

432
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:42,240
paragraph which is not actually the

433
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:45,680
original

434
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:46,160
uh there's a mention of wechat in this

435
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,680
case

436
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:49,439
uh in addition to kind of the main

437
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:51,760
discourse about tick tock

438
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,360
uh most of which is actually pretty good

439
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:55,040
in terms of

440
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:57,040
making sure to get your facts straight

441
00:14:55,040 --> 00:15:00,000
making sure that

442
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:01,599
people have talked to experts uh there's

443
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,880
a few are there's a few issues with this

444
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,720
original kind of

445
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:06,320
paragraph and wechat and and that is

446
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:09,199
kind of the

447
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:11,279
um mischaracterization of who actually

448
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:13,439
uses wechat so in this case

449
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:15,120
uh we had a american official kind of

450
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,560
cited as you know

451
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:19,519
being the source for this kind of

452
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:22,239
description uh and in this case

453
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:23,839
your source might not always be the best

454
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,519
at understanding the usage of apps that

455
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:28,320
they don't use themselves

456
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:30,320
and it's a good thing to you know get a

457
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,600
second opinion from people that actually

458
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,880
do use those apps

459
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,079
for example or they do use the

460
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:35,439
technology that you're writing about in

461
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:37,040
general doesn't have to be specific to

462
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:40,240
any one app

463
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:43,279
and it's not a unique

464
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:44,000
issue in journalism we see this all the

465
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:47,120
time in

466
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:49,600
cyber security infosec where

467
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,320
uh we don't necessarily understand the

468
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:53,040
way

469
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:54,000
non-techie people use computers and that

470
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:56,319
can lead to

471
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,920
a number of different problems in terms

472
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:00,399
of security recommendations

473
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:01,759
um in terms of the design of these

474
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:03,440
systems as they're being built for

475
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:05,199
example

476
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,880
uh so this is a teachable moment

477
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:10,000
basically for all of us

478
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:12,880
uh and in this case the new york times

479
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,720
uh doesn't isn't like short of those

480
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:18,000
resources they have an entire

481
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:18,880
like skyscraper in new york city uh full

482
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,519
of people

483
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:22,880
who are like experts in all variety of

484
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:24,240
fields they're not actually in the

485
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,600
building right now of course because of

486
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:27,600
kobe but i'm sure they have a slack

487
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:30,720
channel where they can talk to somebody

488
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:33,759
that would know about you know

489
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:35,519
people using apps in china and how

490
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:38,800
people are using

491
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:40,240
uh wechat in this case the reality of

492
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,120
that being that it's not so much

493
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,120
something that is

494
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,800
being used by only software engineers in

495
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,519
silicon valley talking to friends back

496
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,439
home

497
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:50,480
but also by like literally anybody that

498
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:52,800
wants to talk to somebody in china

499
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,839
uh there's also you know this issue just

500
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:56,719
like

501
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:57,680
where where where's the correction

502
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:00,320
statement

503
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:01,758
uh on this article um yeah you have some

504
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,680
some thoughts on this i think

505
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:06,000
yeah i actually led a discussion to talk

506
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:07,599
about the ethics of corrections so i

507
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,199
uh the new york times is one of the

508
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:11,678
publications that will sometimes kind of

509
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:13,120
quietly make changes without necessarily

510
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:15,280
publishing a correction and different

511
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:16,000
sites have different kind of rules

512
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:19,039
around it

513
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,959
but uh some of them will say like if

514
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:22,640
it's a minor error you can just change

515
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:24,160
it without putting a correction notice

516
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:26,079
uh the reason to put a correction notice

517
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:27,839
is because um if you don't it's sort of

518
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:28,480
like gaslighting sometimes where people

519
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:30,159
are like

520
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,760
i could have sworn that this article

521
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,360
described this user group in this way

522
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,799
and now it's not there

523
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:37,120
and having to kind of comb back through

524
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:39,760
twitter screenshots or whatever

525
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:41,120
but i think a lot of times publications

526
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:43,280
and even reporters have trouble

527
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:45,199
admitting when they made an error

528
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:47,039
and are less likely to want to have an

529
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,480
error notice because it just highlights

530
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:49,760
like all the things they got wrong and

531
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,760
in a time where people are kind of

532
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:54,240
doubting the credibility of media

533
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:56,000
and attacking journalists for for making

534
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:58,000
mistakes it's not as

535
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,000
easy to just be like oh yeah look i had

536
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:03,600
these five mistakes in my story

537
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:06,400
um and uh and so i think the bar for

538
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:08,000
putting a correction notice is is higher

539
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:09,520
than it could be

540
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,200
and then sometimes like a writer will

541
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:13,360
say like oh i had an error can we fix

542
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,880
this or maybe it was an editor error

543
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,479
and some editors won't even you know

544
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:19,039
make those changes

545
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:20,160
uh so yeah it's kind of dependent on and

546
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:21,919
a lot of times people will think

547
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:23,520
something needs to be corrected when

548
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:25,120
you know maybe it doesn't maybe it's

549
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,400
they're wrong or maybe it's a matter of

550
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:28,159
opinion or maybe

551
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,919
there's debate on it there's not like

552
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:31,840
hard um

553
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:33,679
data that it's incorrect um so

554
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:35,678
personally i think like my biggest thing

555
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:37,039
is that changes should get corrected and

556
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:39,120
if that means

557
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:40,559
like if if it lowers the bar for those

558
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:42,320
changes to be made if they don't put a

559
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:44,160
correction notice i don't personally

560
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:45,600
have a huge problem with it

561
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:47,600
um but yeah it depends on the

562
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:49,120
publication like most of them will put a

563
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:51,520
correction notice if you

564
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:52,959
misspell a proper noun or make a major

565
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:54,240
factual error

566
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:56,080
and then we talked earlier about how

567
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:58,000
like if the entire premise is wrong just

568
00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:00,080
take the piece down

569
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,240
is my opinion for the ethical way to

570
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:06,000
handle that

571
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:06,880
cool um so you know just going back to

572
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,720
what went wrong

573
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:10,720
uh there is you know sometimes a

574
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:14,000
disconnect between

575
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:16,559
uh journalists and

576
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,400
the people they write about um you know

577
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:19,440
in some cases maybe not understanding

578
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:21,440
the way

579
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:23,039
uh people use tech outside of you know

580
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:24,960
their own circles

581
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:26,240
uh again you know we have the same issue

582
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:30,080
in infosec we

583
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:32,160
you know could use some time talking to

584
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:33,360
uh people who are not like us who are

585
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:35,919
not like knee deep

586
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:36,879
in the weeds of security all the time

587
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:40,240
that may end up

588
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:41,520
you know uh just

589
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:44,320
may end up you know kind of

590
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:46,080
demonstrating that maybe we don't

591
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:47,760
understand the way other people

592
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:50,799
understand technology

593
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:52,400
um and then might give us you know some

594
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:54,400
insight into

595
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,760
you know other issues and problems that

596
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:57,120
we might not have thought about to

597
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:59,039
address

598
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:01,280
uh one example that i listed here is you

599
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:02,879
know is the recommendation for signal

600
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:04,480
for example something that we

601
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:06,080
do regularly in a lot of digital

602
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,520
security trainings and would make

603
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:09,120
sense for most of the journals of

604
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:11,200
journalists to be trained

605
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:12,959
uh here where i am now in kind of new

606
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:15,039
york city and in that area

607
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:16,400
wouldn't necessarily map out too well in

608
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:18,559
a place like china where

609
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:22,400
you cannot download signal easily

610
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:22,399
because it's not listed in the app store

611
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:28,960
okay so the next day the next roast is

612
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:32,879
uh this fast company story

613
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:34,480
um about uh voting via smartphone which

614
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:36,240
everybody's really obsessed with with

615
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:37,919
the pandemic like they

616
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:40,559
really want to do stories about how like

617
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:43,600
we could phone over the internet

618
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:45,520
or or phone and this story was about

619
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:47,840
a company called votes and it was about

620
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:49,679
how 2020 was the first ever presidential

621
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:52,158
election where people cast their vote

622
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:54,240
by smartphone and i've reported on votes

623
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:55,919
a lot so i know a lot of information on

624
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:58,960
it and i was kind of

625
00:20:55,919 --> 00:21:00,320
stunned by by this article actually

626
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:02,640
there was a similar article in the

627
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:04,000
information which had a panel

628
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,280
it wasn't a fast company article it was

629
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,960
an information article but they had a

630
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:08,000
panel on online voting with the author

631
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:10,000
of that article

632
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,360
and it included a panelist from the

633
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,880
company

634
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:14,719
and didn't have any questions about

635
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:16,559
votes sending personal information to

636
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:17,360
third parties without user notice or

637
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:18,960
consent

638
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:20,879
which is something that they could have

639
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:23,200
found out by doing research

640
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:26,640
on the company before inviting them on a

641
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:29,039
panel or writing a story about them

642
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:30,480
votes was notoriously kicked off of a

643
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:32,158
bug bounty because they turned the

644
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:34,559
student researcher over to the state

645
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:36,400
officials who contacted the fbi

646
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:38,320
um and they tried to say like we didn't

647
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,440
contact the fbi and kind of hedge about

648
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:41,520
that but uh

649
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:43,360
it became pretty clear what they were

650
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:44,720
doing they also went to the supreme

651
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:46,320
court

652
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,919
i think they filed like a brief with the

653
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:49,360
supreme court because they decided that

654
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:51,679
they don't actually like

655
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:52,639
um they actually do like the cfaa so

656
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:54,880
they don't actually want to work with

657
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:56,960
researchers even though they claim to

658
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:59,600
they also retroactively change their bug

659
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:02,880
bounty terms uh to make it look like

660
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:05,199
this researcher had broken the terms

661
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:06,000
but luckily hacker one has like you can

662
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:08,640
actually see

663
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,919
like these retroactive changes and when

664
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,280
they were made

665
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:13,039
and they were eventually like kicked off

666
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,600
that bug bounty so this is all stuff

667
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:15,600
that the

668
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,639
writers of the story and it's not just

669
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,480
fast company

670
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:20,640
could like kind of research and dig into

671
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:23,120
a little bit

672
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:24,960
um there's also an uh a nasa report

673
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:26,000
representing the consensus of experts in

674
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:28,880
elections they're like

675
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,640
it is not secure to have marked ballots

676
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:32,480
over the internet right now there's

677
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:33,919
so much research on it and that's one of

678
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:35,840
the reports that

679
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:39,120
is kind of good background reading if

680
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:40,879
you're going to write a story about this

681
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:42,559
uh and then of course there's an mit

682
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:44,320
report on the security vulnerabilities

683
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:45,360
in in votes's app and you can read that

684
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:48,799
entire report

685
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:51,039
publicly available um

686
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:52,559
but let's try to say that the report

687
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:54,000
wasn't well we'll talk about this a

688
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:56,399
little bit more but votes basically

689
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,679
tried to say like oh these researchers

690
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,320
don't know what they're talking about

691
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:00,799
and then

692
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:02,399
their findings were corroborated by

693
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:05,520
trail of bits which both

694
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:07,039
and and um another group uh i think was

695
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:09,520
tusk like hired

696
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:11,280
so it's just stuff that was kind of

697
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:14,720
missing or glossed over like all these

698
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:16,399
researchers said this but never mind

699
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:18,080
uh and yeah there was the headline was

700
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:19,280
wrong and there's a correction

701
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:21,840
but it doesn't actually address the

702
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:22,720
headline it just says like oh by the way

703
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:24,559
um

704
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:26,000
votes's use in brazil elections was just

705
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:29,440
an experiment it wasn't actually

706
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,440
tabulated sorry about that

707
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:34,720
um but yeah there's more and there

708
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:36,320
they've had a quote saying election

709
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:37,919
officials who use this say they're no

710
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:40,240
riskier than the current methods we use

711
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:42,400
for some special cases of voting

712
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:44,000
that's not like obviously if election

713
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:46,480
officials are using something they would

714
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:49,520
say like oh yeah this is perfectly safe

715
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:51,760
um and then they um you know those

716
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:53,520
several experts had voice concerns

717
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:55,039
administrators say this is more time and

718
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:56,158
cost effective and no riskier than

719
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:57,919
voting in person

720
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:59,600
so when somebody makes a claim like that

721
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:01,679
that's when you have to see if they're

722
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:03,039
telling the truth or what the data shows

723
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:06,320
which just wasn't done

724
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:08,320
it's not like a he said she said or

725
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:10,480
he said he said if it's if there's

726
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:14,559
actual data that you can turn to instead

727
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:14,559
of making it a both sides type story

728
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:18,479
uh oh yeah and they quoted amelia powers

729
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:19,919
gardner who um

730
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:21,919
it's one of the election officials and

731
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:23,840
she actually got campaign funds from the

732
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:26,080
ceo of overstock who

733
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:27,760
dumped 10 million dollars into votes so

734
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:29,199
it's kind of worth looking into like is

735
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:30,720
there a conflict of interest does this

736
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:32,320
person have a vested interest in

737
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,039
supporting this company and is that why

738
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:35,039
they're

739
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:37,120
basically slandering researchers and

740
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:39,760
overlooking like hard data that's

741
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,760
consistent

742
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:44,000
oh yeah they wrote votes published a

743
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,640
report addressing each of these supposed

744
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,679
flaws

745
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:49,360
supposed flaws which said it was in the

746
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:51,120
interest of public transparency so yeah

747
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:53,120
they published a report that addressed

748
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:54,559
the flaws that were found

749
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:56,559
this quote makes it sound like they're

750
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:58,480
not real but again

751
00:24:56,559 --> 00:25:00,240
mit found these flaws in a company that

752
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:01,120
votes helped paid for found the same

753
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:03,600
flaws so

754
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:04,719
these flaws these supposed flaws were

755
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:07,360
found by two different

756
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:08,880
research teams and you have to actually

757
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:10,158
read through the report before saying

758
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,360
like oh it's great for public

759
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:13,039
transparency

760
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:14,799
because if you read the actual report

761
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:16,720
you'll see that boltz's response to many

762
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:17,840
of the flaws i found was we accept the

763
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:20,400
risk

764
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:22,240
essentially on behalf of the voters

765
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:23,600
which is pretty unacceptable and you

766
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,400
have to kind of i don't know i feel like

767
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,240
you can't not

768
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:27,760
read these reports like it's boring and

769
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:29,440
it's time consuming and you have to make

770
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:30,400
a lot of phone calls to kind of verify

771
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,919
them

772
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,440
but if you just kind of skip over them

773
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:35,760
and be like oh

774
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:37,440
um these flaws are supposed and these

775
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:38,559
researchers are wrong without digging

776
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:43,520
into it you end up writing

777
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:45,760
like a fluff piece that's inaccurate

778
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:46,879
so what went wrong much much more

779
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:48,720
research should have been done to

780
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:50,320
surface issues or even just a little bit

781
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:53,039
would have surfaced some of them

782
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:55,279
with votes with electronic voting

783
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:57,039
current voting standards etc

784
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:59,200
if you're going to quote somebody you

785
00:25:57,039 --> 00:26:00,640
know maybe do a little bit of research

786
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:02,400
on who those people are and what their

787
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:04,960
interest is in the

788
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:06,400
um in the topic at hand and and then

789
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:08,559
just don't assume that experimental

790
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:11,760
votes are for real bones

791
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:14,799
uh is is a kind of it seems obvious

792
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:17,279
to me but apparently not isn't always

793
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:17,279
obvious

794
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:21,840
so in general what can we do better as

795
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:23,279
journalists and security researchers in

796
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:25,279
2021 because it's

797
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:26,720
i feel like it's a constant practice and

798
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:29,200
you're constantly trying to improve and

799
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:29,200
get better

800
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:33,120
um for journalists like you want to fact

801
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:34,240
check your assumptions and that can be

802
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,279
kind of difficult because sometimes you

803
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,640
don't realize you're making an

804
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:38,320
assumption and then afterwards you're

805
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:40,080
like oh i didn't even i didn't even

806
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:42,480
think to double check that

807
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:43,520
because uh i you know i just assumed it

808
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:45,679
was true

809
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:46,639
um and then you wanna make make

810
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:48,159
corrections

811
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:49,840
whether there's a correction notice or

812
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:52,400
not like figure out how to get your

813
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:54,080
editors to make changes

814
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:56,080
assuming that you have you know you

815
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:57,199
couldn't like avoid making those errors

816
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:59,678
in the first place because

817
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:00,320
errors happen and so that's really

818
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:02,720
important

819
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:05,360
is to make sure to to fess up when you

820
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:07,200
make a mistake and try to get it fixed

821
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:08,479
and if you're writing about an app and

822
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,840
you kind of have a statement that you

823
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,799
heard about like the type of people who

824
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:12,959
use it maybe

825
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:15,120
maybe check if that's true with the

826
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:16,640
actual users

827
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:18,399
and if you're if you're quoting somebody

828
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:20,240
kind of check dig into who they are make

829
00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:22,000
sure they're credible

830
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:24,480
and see whether they have conflicts of

831
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,120
interest so the do not kind of goes back

832
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:28,640
to

833
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:31,840
to what david said about assuming um

834
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:32,399
so don't do that um and don't don't kind

835
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:34,799
of

836
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:36,399
gloss over security certain concerns and

837
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:37,520
product i guess this is kind of a twofer

838
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:39,678
because it's like

839
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:40,960
if there are actual security concerns

840
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:42,559
you don't want to kind of gloss them

841
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,120
over and be like oh this isn't a big

842
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:45,520
deal

843
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:47,199
it's whatever it's an assumption these

844
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:49,120
supposed concerns

845
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:50,960
but then at the same time if everybody's

846
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:52,959
screaming about how the sky is falling

847
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:54,799
and like encryption is broken

848
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:56,880
you also want to make sure you

849
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:58,399
understand the context before sharing

850
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:00,320
that information so kind of trying to

851
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:01,918
avoid those two extremes and doing the

852
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:05,120
necessary

853
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:06,960
research and conversations and and and

854
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:08,479
kind of grunt work ahead of time to

855
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:10,080
avoid making these errors that i'll get

856
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:12,640
you in this presentation is a really

857
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,639
good idea

858
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:18,240
and of course we also have some do's and

859
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:22,159
don'ts for security researchers

860
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:23,919
um we do we do recommend

861
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:26,480
telling journalists about security

862
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:29,679
issues and products they're reporting on

863
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:31,039
um and this can be in the context of

864
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:32,880
being a source that's kind of on

865
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:33,600
background with the journalists to

866
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:36,159
discover

867
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:38,320
you know what is going on in a

868
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:41,200
particular product or industry

869
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:41,840
um or in the context of just letting

870
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:44,080
people know

871
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:46,000
in their like mentions being by the way

872
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:48,480
this was found in this issue

873
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,480
uh because not everybody is gonna know

874
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:51,600
all the things you know

875
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:53,760
there's also you know helping

876
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:55,760
journalists understand

877
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:57,120
which situations of vulnerability

878
00:28:55,760 --> 00:29:00,480
actually matters in

879
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:02,158
because not all situations are the same

880
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:03,760
we talked a little bit about this last

881
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:06,880
year uh for example with the

882
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:07,760
juice jacking story that got a lot of

883
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:11,200
press

884
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:11,679
but in reality was maybe not the thing

885
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,679
people

886
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:15,360
should be worried about compared to the

887
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:17,360
thing that

888
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:19,279
is you know what people are concerned

889
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:21,520
about and the way that hacking actually

890
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:24,799
happens in the real world

891
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:28,000
uh the do nots in this case

892
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:29,840
maybe we want to avoid bug bounties for

893
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:33,440
companies that

894
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:36,399
uh turn researchers over to the cops uh

895
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:37,840
there are many wonderful projects with

896
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:39,199
bug bounties

897
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:41,760
uh that will not lead to an

898
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:43,919
interrogation with the fbi

899
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:45,600
there's also you know something to avoid

900
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:47,520
is also bandwagoning

901
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,639
uh in claims that are really

902
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:51,520
sensationalists

903
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:52,320
um such as but not limited to you know

904
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:55,679
signal

905
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:56,799
encryption is broken and it's a good

906
00:29:55,679 --> 00:30:00,080
idea to understand

907
00:29:56,799 --> 00:30:03,279
in what context this claim is being made

908
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:04,720
and in the case of um celebrate for

909
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:06,240
example they did have a blog post

910
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:08,000
explaining

911
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:10,320
what they actually did at the technical

912
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,480
level and people that

913
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:15,120
were in security research could have

914
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:17,200
just saw that post and realized hey

915
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:18,959
this actually does not break signals

916
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:21,200
encryption which is generally meant to

917
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:22,799
save the signal protocol

918
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:24,559
but actually just has to do with the way

919
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:28,600
they keep you know the local

920
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:29,840
sql database and messages inside the app

921
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:32,240
[Music]

922
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:34,399
cool so just some kind of just to get to

923
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:39,200
the point of a lot of these things

924
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:41,678
um it's best to get correct information

925
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:43,440
as soon as possible uh journalists

926
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:45,200
putting out accurate stories

927
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:47,200
and hackers responding misinformation

928
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:49,279
before it gets amplified

929
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:50,799
uh you know corrections still have to be

930
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:53,600
made sometimes

931
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:54,720
and it should be corrected up to and

932
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:57,760
including retracting

933
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:59,840
an entire story if necessary uh

934
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:01,679
again don't assume because it makes an

935
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:04,240
ass of you and me

936
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:05,039
uh that your experience with an app or

937
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:08,240
tool

938
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:10,879
or a user base that uses these

939
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:13,519
tools or devices is reflective of the

940
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:13,519
whole story

941
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:18,960
definitely you know avoid in this case

942
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:20,640
half-heartedly getting both sides isn't

943
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:22,480
good enough uh we

944
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:24,559
you know do quote people to get

945
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:26,240
different perspectives on a story

946
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:28,080
but we also want to make sure that

947
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:30,880
they're not lying to you

948
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:32,639
and looking at actual actual data helps

949
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:34,080
you figure that out

950
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:36,240
also doing research on the people you're

951
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:39,199
speaking with uh checking for

952
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:40,159
conflict of interests other issues that

953
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:42,240
may uh

954
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:44,240
chant their legit their legitimacy or

955
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:45,519
their i guess authenticity i should say

956
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:48,320
or whether or not they're lying that's

957
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:50,000
kind of the point of a lot of steps

958
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:51,360
but sometimes people lie to you and the

959
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,880
point of journalism is to get to the

960
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:55,279
truth

961
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:56,480
uh it's important to put cyber security

962
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:58,240
issues in context

963
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:00,640
uh for journalists this requires

964
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:02,320
reaching out to multiple experts

965
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:04,000
yes it means asking them dumb questions

966
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:06,000
over and over and over again

967
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,600
um or at least maybe questions that

968
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,440
they've heard a lot

969
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:11,840
for hackers this means being clear and

970
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:13,840
specific and nuanced about these threats

971
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:15,600
um you know and being clear about when

972
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:18,158
they matter when they don't

973
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:20,399
uh and being just as good as you can be

974
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:23,279
at explaining a situation

975
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:24,158
uh knowing that they're not gonna know

976
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:26,000
all the different

977
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:30,480
caveats that you're thinking about as

978
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:30,480
your um understanding situation

979
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:34,639
all right if you have any questions uh

980
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:38,640
feel free to leave them

981
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:40,559
in i guess a chat or whatever

982
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:43,120
thing that we're going to use for that

983
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:46,799
when this video goes live

984
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:50,399
otherwise uh feel free to

985
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:54,080
drop us a line um we can be reached at

986
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:54,080
these email addresses

987
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:58,559
thank you for coming on a saturday

988
00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:11,840
morning

989
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:11,840
yeah thanks y'all

990
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,678
you
