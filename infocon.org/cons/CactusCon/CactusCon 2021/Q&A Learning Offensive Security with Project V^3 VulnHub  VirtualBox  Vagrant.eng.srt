just you know we'll be in contact

38
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,759
all right so before we get going here

39
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:37,119
with the questions uh

40
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:39,119
red hat august i believe you have

41
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:41,040
something you wanted to add

42
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:42,799
yes so i just wanted to let everybody

43
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,320
know i kind of made a little bit of a

44
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:47,840
nooblet mistake in the video

45
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:49,439
uh i put vagrant remove and that's it

46
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,520
it's the command would actually be

47
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:52,798
vagrant box remove and then you have to

48
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,640
specify the box

49
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:56,560
so i don't want people who are using

50
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,840
this uh to end up like

51
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,200
you know filling up their hard drive

52
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,640
when they're trying to remove it or

53
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,200
freaking out when that command doesn't

54
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,040
work

55
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,360
uh we'll put it in the readme just for

56
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:07,200
clarification but again i made a mistake

57
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:09,679
wanted to come forward with that and

58
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,520
clarify what it's supposed to be

59
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:13,680
so just stay tuned for the readme on

60
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,680
that

61
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,319
awesome thank you for that uh little

62
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,080
note here

63
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:22,399
i i thought it was you know just

64
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,560
absolutely fantastic project

65
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,640
and talk concerning the project i

66
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,680
personally am not a red teamer at all i

67
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,040
mean i've already mentioned this in a

68
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,920
couple qas before all right we get it

69
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:33,359
dude you're a blue team

70
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:35,839
shut up but the thing is is that i

71
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,360
love trying to pretend like i'm a red

72
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,640
teamer and every once in a while you

73
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,800
know i still go back to like

74
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:44,000
metasploitable too you know

75
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,280
from like 2000 and no i don't know what

76
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,720
year that came out

77
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:50,560
you know um i keep popping pro ft ftpd

78
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:54,000
and thinking i'm awesome

79
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:57,040
so having this easy method to just

80
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,040
spin up boxes is awesome i love the use

81
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,480
of vagrant to bring stuff up and bring

82
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,239
it down when needed

83
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,518
there's a group westmech hopefully

84
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:04,959
there's some westmeckers out there

85
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:08,080
watching right now the western

86
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:09,280
maricopa education group um they do some

87
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,879
great training for folks

88
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,400
on the uh well the west side of the

89
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:14,799
valley hence the name

90
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,920
some extension training some adult

91
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,680
training and a lot of concurrent

92
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:19,839
enrollment for high schoolers

93
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:22,480
they were teaching vagrant to their uh

94
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:24,959
you know 16 to 18 range i believe kiddos

95
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:26,640
back like even four or five years ago i

96
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:28,640
remember going over there the first time

97
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,760
and the the kids were like you know they

98
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,599
got up and and

99
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:34,000
bringing boxes up and down and i'm like

100
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:36,399
i work with people who don't

101
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,440
who don't know how to do that so yeah i

102
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,840
just i i love

103
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,879
i love that inclusion great great job

104
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,879
overall

105
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:44,560
so we have a couple questions for you

106
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:45,920
one and it's been answered but we're

107
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,879
going to go ahead and ask it and make

108
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:49,119
sure everyone

109
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:51,599
is aware is essentially is the project

110
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,000
is it available is it open is it public

111
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:54,640
and

112
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,840
essentially where can i find it yeah

113
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:58,238
absolutely uh

114
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,519
so as the video had it you would just go

115
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:02,080
to my github

116
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:03,280
and uh phone hub underscore vagrant you

117
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:06,080
would want to clone that in

118
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,640
as i put in the video um you'd have to

119
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,200
install

120
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,839
virtualbox virtualbox extension pack and

121
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,439
fragrant

122
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,000
i do encourage you install git too

123
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:16,320
because i'm just a command line junkie

124
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,478
uh so you clone it in and you go into

125
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:21,759
the directory and you do vagrant up

126
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:24,639
it is free as in um you know free beer

127
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:26,479
which is great such as vonhub has always

128
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:28,320
been since 2004.

129
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:29,520
everybody has access to these machines

130
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,599
always has

131
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:33,680
ever since its creation you know hence

132
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,479
got milk's point of putting it out in

133
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:37,440
the world

134
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:38,320
uh however through my experience of

135
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,840
starting out

136
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,599
remembering what that was like i just

137
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:44,320
wanted to make it a little bit more

138
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,600
accessible as in setting up the machines

139
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,840
because some of them you can kind of

140
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,680
have issues with getting them to work

141
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,440
so i'm trying to get all that done up

142
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,800
front so again you just have to run the

143
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,400
command and everything

144
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,000
is good and you also don't have to worry

145
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,719
about oh i need to go get vmware

146
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,759
versus virtualbox or you know hyper-v or

147
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:03,360
what what have you

148
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:05,360
right so yep it's free just hit the

149
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:09,039
github

150
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:11,360
i like it i like it and

151
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:13,120
another question for you here and this

152
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,479
question

153
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,240
we talked about it offline we'll see

154
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:17,199
where we go with this is there any way

155
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,600
to set up

156
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:21,039
and then essentially to remote in such

157
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,800
as in a classroom

158
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:24,080
setting so a shared infrastructure if

159
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:27,039
you will

160
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:28,479
right so um to address this question the

161
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:32,000
way that i designed the project

162
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:34,800
is really to be on the host itself right

163
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,639
i the intent was somebody's gonna be

164
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:39,680
going in their own computer

165
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:41,680
and i made that internal network a

166
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,440
requirement for virtualbox that means

167
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,479
there's no internet access from both

168
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:47,280
your attacker host

169
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:48,960
and uh the virtual machine you know just

170
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,638
in case somebody's a little bit nervous

171
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,159
about pulling in an exploitable

172
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:53,520
machine there might be something on it

173
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,320
they're worried about that it's

174
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,000
literally going to

175
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:57,360
lock it down so it doesn't even have

176
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,160
access to the host

177
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:02,080
however with that being said if you

178
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,560
wanted to change the network of the

179
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:05,440
vulnerable machine to maybe bridged and

180
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,280
you had it as an

181
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:09,039
internal setup for your classroom you

182
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:12,080
pull them all into a central server

183
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:13,919
that's how i do it in my class right

184
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:16,880
however that does mean that you would

185
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:18,880
need a some type of access maybe a vpn

186
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:20,960
to get into the classroom to be able to

187
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:23,759
hit those machines on that server

188
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:26,239
so it is definitely possible but it will

189
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:30,319
take a little bit more manipulation

190
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:32,560
and um you know finesse on your part

191
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:34,160
depending on how your network is set up

192
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,080
how you wanted to deliver it

193
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:38,160
uh whoever asked that question feel free

194
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,440
to hit me up on twitter

195
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,840
you know and we can we can kind of

196
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:43,840
clarify that out uh of course doing the

197
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:45,359
whole vpn thing i'm going to leave that

198
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,880
out of scope for me that would be for

199
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,479
you to figure out but if everybody's in

200
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,280
the same classroom and you have like a

201
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:51,120
bunch of

202
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,559
uh student computers who are accessing

203
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,479
it that's how i do it um

204
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,960
so i i could make that shift really

205
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:56,960
really quick

206
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,000
awesome thank you thank you i don't see

207
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:03,840
any

208
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,080
questions immediately in the chat right

209
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,799
now anything that either you fellows

210
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,800
would like to

211
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,080
share with the group any you know

212
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,680
commentary what you

213
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:13,280
what you got you're on the spot all

214
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,960
right yeah sure one

215
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,960
one thing that i want to do is i want to

216
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:20,479
give a shout out to dion zeller

217
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:22,000
i you know something in the github that

218
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:22,880
i want to make clear is i have a folder

219
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,479
called other

220
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,319
right he's the only machine that i have

221
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:30,318
in there so far uh

222
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:32,160
but his uh server yoblog was one of the

223
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:33,759
very first servers that i ever hacked

224
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,759
into and what i learned from

225
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:37,280
so i highly recommend that go check it

226
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:38,720
out you're going to learn about lfi

227
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:41,119
you're going to learn

228
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,080
you know how to get into servers you're

229
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,199
going to learn a little bit about

230
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,520
database

231
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:47,039
exfiltration and whatnot a really cool

232
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,639
machine go into other

233
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:50,960
check out yo blog it's outside of

234
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:52,319
vulnerhub uh and then another thing is

235
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:54,400
if there are any

236
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:56,080
exploit machine developers out there

237
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:58,159
that want to give me

238
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:59,758
uh you know the machine to throw into

239
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,360
the project reach out

240
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:02,879
you know i'll throw you in the other if

241
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,800
you're not on vuln hub

242
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:06,960
uh so we can grow this thing and really

243
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:09,919
make it again accessible for

244
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:12,560
our newbies who you know we're gonna try

245
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:15,520
to level up right

246
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,800
absolutely fantastic uh a note about

247
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:19,039
that box

248
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,560
the yo blog i see here in the

249
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:23,840
description on github

250
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:27,919
this machine was used in the cactus con

251
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:32,799
uh root box competition in 2016.

252
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:36,399
that's right put on by early warning

253
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:36,799
yeah early warning by the way who's one

254
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:38,799
of our

255
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:41,199
partner sponsors and has a chat room

256
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:43,838
that you should go check out

257
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,640
very cool thank you thank you all right

258
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:46,080
well

259
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,439
if there's anything else you want to

260
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,200
throw in now's the time to do it

261
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:52,560
otherwise we'll go ahead and wrap it up

262
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:55,040
and um yeah thank you both

263
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:56,160
very very much again awesome awesome

264
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,680
project

265
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:00,800
uh i was going to ask about how you're

266
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:03,279
going to maintain uh to avoid

267
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:05,599
stale boxes and then realize that you

268
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:08,000
don't need to i mean you can essentially

269
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:10,640
you know i'm still with metasploitable 2

270
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,640
like i said so

271
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,399
and it's it's huge there's a last time i

272
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,920
checked

273
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:18,720
um because the last time they were

274
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:21,680
updated was december 15th of 2020

275
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,000
uh there were 624 in all i have on vol

276
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,239
hub

277
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
209 of them finished uploaded ready to

278
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,519
go i'm working from the newest one and

279
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,640
going to the oldest ones

280
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:32,480
uh i gotta you know i'm hoping to talk

281
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:34,000
with got milk later on to see kind of

282
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,920
what the future of on hub is if it's

283
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,440
going to keep going if my project has a

284
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,959
definitive close date

285
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,880
but like i said if there's people who

286
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:42,959
are making uh exploitable

287
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,560
machines that are outside of vuln hub

288
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:45,599
and you want to keep adding to the flow

289
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,959
just hit me up and

290
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,959
and we'll get it up there you know

291
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,800
awesome and i have to ask you before we

292
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:53,360
leave here i see that you have a whole

293
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,319
bunch of

294
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:58,640
rubik's cubes behind you do you have do

295
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:01,920
you have one of the connected cubes

296
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,920
one of the no no no

297
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:06,880
i got the uh the go cube um and then i

298
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,680
connected when rubik's actually you know

299
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,680
got into it

300
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:11,519
and they're pretty nifty especially for

301
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:13,839
someone who is horrible at them so i

302
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:15,760
assume you're probably better given

303
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:18,160
i don't know man i don't know i like

304
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:20,180
puzzles they're fun to fiddle with but

305
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,680
you know there's always someone better

306
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:24,800
[Laughter]

307
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:26,719
all right well redhead august and the 7.

308

thank you very very much for your talk

309
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,440
and for that project it's

310
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,959
really a great project everyone go check

311
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,000
it out on github

312
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:34,079

317
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:45,120
leverage the power of python and

318
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:47,600
forensic investigations

319
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:49,920
this is a digital book by chapin bryce

320
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:52,399
he's a co-worker of mine he works also

321
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:53,360
on our team blackberry security services

322
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:55,200
ir

323
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,959
blackberry of course is a partner of

324
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,519
ours they have a chat room go check them

325
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:59,599
out

326
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:02,160
