1
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:13,519
we're live

2
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:17,359
we're live all right all right

3
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:19,359
welcome everyone to cactus con 9 2021.

4
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:21,439
we're extremely excited to be able to

5
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:22,800
present cactus con to you virtually for

6
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:24,640
the first time ever

7
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,240
the overall crew has been out this for

8
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:29,199
over 10 years now we took

9
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:30,880
somewhat of a hiatus in 2020 simply

10
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:33,680
because our last event was in

11
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:34,719
december by 2019 we wanted to move to

12
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,079
earlier in the year

13
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:39,040
and it just wouldn't have made a ton of

14
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:40,960
sense to do december and then february

15
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:43,519
so i know many of us wish we could have

16
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:45,039
just outright skipped 2020 ourselves but

17
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,399
our conference at least was able to do

18
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:48,320
so and we're back

19
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:50,239
and better than ever we have some great

20
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:53,120
talks lined up we have a whole bunch of

21
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:55,280
giveaways we have some fantastic

22
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,800
prizes that have been provided by many

23
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,960
of our sponsors

24
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,399

made for

71
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,840

we've been doing conference calls the

81
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,560
entire year 2020 and i'm still talking

82
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,159
on mute

83
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,920

we're extremely happy to have you here

87
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,359
andrew because

88
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:14,000
uh unbeknownst to you but now known to

89
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:16,239
you we were about to talk about the

90
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,440
lady of caccus con do you want to do you

91
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:19,760
want to be on the spot you want to go

92
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:22,319
for it

93
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:23,840
the legacy of cactus con is that the

94
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:24,958
history of cactus con where did we come

95
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:28,159
from

96
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:30,720
oh yeah so uh absolutely um

97
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:32,159
cagus con is interesting we started uh

98
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:35,599
cactus khan

99
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:37,679
literally after an oauth meeting in town

100
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:39,518
i think we were actually in scottsdale

101
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,200
and a bunch of us went out sort of bar

102
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:42,959
crawling afterwards and had a long

103
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,958
conversation about like

104
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:46,959
the phoenix community is huge and we

105
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:49,040
have a ton of people out here

106
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:50,560
like why do we have to wait for defcon

107
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,319
or why do we have to wait for all these

108
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,080
other conferences to happen like

109
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:55,679
do we have enough momentum to

110
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,680
potentially do something

111
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:00,000
ourselves and so i think there was about

112
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,680
eight of us originally who got together

113
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,840
and said look you know what would it

114
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,560
take to do a very bootstrap thing and so

115
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,879
we

116
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,480
looked at a bunch of venues and actually

117
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:10,640
ended up settling on

118
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:13,119
dave and buster's here in town which

119
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:16,000
turns out to have like an amazing

120
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:17,199
conference room deal that was relatively

121
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,839
affordable in fact we

122
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:21,040
floated the entire conference year one

123
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:23,280
between the eight of us

124
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,880
right we just said look let's let's do

125
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,638
it let's see what we can get out there

126
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,479
let's see if we can get sponsors

127
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:30,320
um we did we had a couple of sponsors

128
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:32,240
step up and jump in i think that year

129
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,520
godaddy helped out and a couple of other

130
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,160
local firms

131
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:37,680
uh stack and lou now bishop fox has

132
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,639
actually been involved really from the

133
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,960
beginning

134
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:42,560
uh securiosus was one of our original

135
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,719
sponsors and they

136
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,880
they helped us out for a season and so

137
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:49,520
we sort of grew it out from there

138
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:50,400
the idea behind it has always been we

139
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,639
just want

140
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,000
to create something with high quality

141
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:55,840
talks that are

142
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,080
freely available to anybody in the

143
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:00,000
community who wants to attend

144
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,919
we want it to be vendor neutral so you

145
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,600
don't show up and go oh my gosh like

146
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:05,039
this is vendor con i mean i've been

147
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,560
places where you walk in

148
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:08,080
and you have to pass through the hall of

149
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,400
vendors before you're even allowed to

150
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:12,560
like get to the conference you know

151
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,679
uh and then we wanted we wanted

152
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,560
something

153
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,960
that could kind of grow as a community

154
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,120
and

155
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,320
and and have some of the best talks out

156
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,400

157
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:25,120

158
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:28,479

uh and so i'm again super that's that's

170
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:50,560
really the history in a nutshell we've

171
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,758
started i think the first year we had

172
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,639
120

173
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:55,759
people show up and uh 20 of them were us

174
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:58,319
you know

175
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:59,759
and then and then now we're we're really

176
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:01,280
sort of grown and expanded

177
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:07,840
year-over-year it's just been really

178
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:07,840
impressive to be a part of so

179
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,240

181
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,600

182
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,759
person who ran the con

183
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,880

187
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,639
in general you know

188
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:28,400
starting as a b-sides event we had their

189
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:31,600
support to transition

190
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:33,840
to our own cactus con and uh what was it

191
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,120
was it last year or the year before was

192
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,880
last year

193
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,800
where we had them come in and do our

194
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:41,840
keynote um

195
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:43,039
it was last year yeah last year yeah the

196
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,080
years were already starting to blend for

197
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:44,479
me i don't know about everyone else out

198
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,719
there

199
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:49,599
but i mean it was last cactus con it

200
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:51,039
wasn't necessarily last year

201
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:52,880
there we go that's probably it right

202
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:54,240
there

203
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,919
all right so check it out we're going to

204
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,840
take a look here and

205
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:59,520
peek behind the curtain a little bit

206
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,080
somewhat i mean we still have folks who

207
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:03,520
like to use

208
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:05,520
avatars skyler rather than

209
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:07,520
their actual likeness but i want to

210
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:09,440
introduce people to the team

211
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:11,440
behind the conference because this

212
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:12,080
conference could not happen without an

213
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,560
entire

214
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:17,198
team or organization committee of people

215
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:20,479
so we have a board for cactus khan

216
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:23,919

217

00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,120
activities

337
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:08,640
when we have a physical conference

338
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,680
obviously it's a lot different we have

339
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,279
all kinds of

340
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,880
you know hullabaloo day of and

341
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:14,640
everyone's running around and there's

342
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:16,399
directing needs to occur

343
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:18,560
it was a lot different it was a big

344
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:20,320
transition for both of them

345
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:21,760
for all of us really of course but

346
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,440
especially for them

347
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:25,279
uh you know they're not currying around

348
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,240
projectors and making sure that cables

349
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:27,920
aren't you know

350
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,959
causing tripping hazards and stuff it's

351
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,319
just a you know it's a virtual

352
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:31,760
environment now

353
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,680
so uh helping out with all the

354
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:35,519

and this year um got roped into

374
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:15,119
doing a lot of discord stuff because

375

i've discord bot building experience so

376
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,839

377
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:19,680
yeah if the bot breaks uh you can

378
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:21,839

381
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:30,160
stream here but

382
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:31,040
nick has been helping us for many years

383
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:33,680
now

384
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:34,079
zoom in on his on his mug there with our

385
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,079
art

386
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:38,319
whether it's partially doing the design

387
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:40,160
or whether it's just running the full

388
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:42,800
actual exhibit if you will it's almost

389
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:44,560
like you walk into a physical cactus con

390
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:46,479
and it's like an art display it's like

391
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:48,800
an exhibit you know we had like vinyl on

392
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:50,480
the windows we had large stands here i

393
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:52,560
mean it's just been

394
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:53,600
awesome now this year obviously

395
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,439
different again because we don't

396
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,639
necessarily have artwork to you know put

397
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,160
around a venue

398
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:00,720
but a lot of the artwork that you see

399
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:02,639
throughout the con a lot of the digital

400
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,760
graphic items that you're gonna see and

401
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:05,519
be provided

402
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,880
uh is handiwork of nick in fact what

403
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:08,000
we're looking at right now is

404
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,680
technically

405
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,279
let me go back to the front here is our

406
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:12,800
digital event brochure

407
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:14,720
it's not yet been released but very

408
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,120
shortly will and this is handiwork of

409
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,279
nick

410
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,839
so nick thank you for all that you do

411
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:20,480
and what you have done throughout the

412
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:22,560
years

413
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:24,639
and that takes us to our partners and

414
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:26,638
sponsors we obviously couldn't throw

415
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:28,959
a conference we couldn't hold this thing

416
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:30,959
without our partners and sponsors

417
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:32,959
this year again it's very different in

418
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:34,638
former years years past we've had you

419
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:36,560
know table set up and we've tried to

420
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:37,120
funnel people to our our sponsors be

421
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,920
like hey

422
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,560
yeah all this what we're doing now is a

423
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,240
little different

424
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:44,160
in the digital venue but i want to go

425
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:47,199
ahead and transition over

426
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:50,719
and take a look at our website

427
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:52,560
on the cactuscon.com website we've got a

428
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:54,160
sponsor section so i'm literally just

429
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:56,239
going to click on the sponsor section

430
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:57,519
and just show you here we have a couple

431
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:00,079
different tiers this year

432
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:02,240
so one of our tiers is our partner tier

433
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:04,000
and in the partner tier returning for

434
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,839
i don't know half of six seven the whole

435
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:09,440
time andrew were they day one

436
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:11,760
partner bishop fox yeah technically

437
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,399
vision fox has been a day one partner

438
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,639
when they were

439
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:15,600
stacking lou they've sort of grown year

440
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:17,519
over year

441
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,760
and i'll i'll say something else kind of

442
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:21,199
specific about partners is that we were

443
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:23,920
very careful

444
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:24,399
in that word because you see in that

445
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,399
group

446
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:27,440
are not just people who contribute

447
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:30,079
financially to

448
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:32,240
the conference historically the people

449
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:33,920
who are in that partner tier

450
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:35,360
and folks who've stepped up to help run

451
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:37,360
it so like paypal

452
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,959
a lot of people volunteer and help

453
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:41,199
actually run the conference

454
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:43,279
early warning for a season some of their

455
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:45,199
main people and directors actually

456
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:47,120
sat in the registration booth with us

457
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:48,639
and helped run registration

458
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:50,800
and so what you see is kind of an

459
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:51,279
investment in the in the conference that

460
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,279
is

461
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:54,639
you know beyond this idea of hey here's

462
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:56,880
some money go go

463
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:58,639
like do stuff with it they've actually

464
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,360
joined in and helped us do things early

465
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:02,160
warning ran

466
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:04,000
a ctf actually at one point and paypal

467
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:06,480
has a lot of people who've supported

468
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:09,279
different ctfs and such so like this

469
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:11,360
partner tier is like a big deal for us

470
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:12,639
not just in sort of that idea of a title

471
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,519
but it really represents our

472
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:15,839
relationship

473
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:18,320
to them and that it's not it's not just

474
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:19,839
this transactional thing but it's

475
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,440
an investment that they bring to the

476
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:23,600
conference so

477
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:25,040
it's awesome it's really great to see

478
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,279
all these these folks i mean

479
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:29,519
uh bishop vox has been from the

480
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:31,040
beginning early warning in paypal

481
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:32,800
kind of in lockstep early warning i

482
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,360
think just a little bit ahead of paypal

483
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,519
and then

484
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:36,800
this is the first year uh blackberry has

485
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:39,199
joined us as a partner

486
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:40,160
you know but obviously they they

487
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:43,120
produced you

488
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:44,480
for us so i don't know if that counts uh

489
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:47,680
you know but

490
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:49,519
yeah it's anyways this is more than just

491
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:52,079
than than something like hey here's some

492
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:52,079

493
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:56,079

that earnest thanks to the partners

496
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:05,040
um you know early warning uh i

497
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:07,759

00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:09,439
army like literally like an army

499
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:10,959
i had some people come up and just ask

500
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,240

00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:35,600
so they are not going to be given out to

672
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:38,559
a first

673
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:40,240
second or third place finisher by design

674
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:40,720
we've decided that we're going to base

675
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:43,200
it on

676
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:45,120
participation so folks who are able to

677
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,640
jump into the mix folks who are doing

678
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,120
the work folks who are helping other

679
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:50,000
folks

680
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:51,439
perhaps you know um whatever we're

681
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,480
whenever we see someone who's going

682
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:54,720
above and beyond

683
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,600
that is how pon is going to make his

684
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:58,480
decisions as to

685
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,959
where those go we also have no starch

686
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:01,120

hesitant to open any of the files

778
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:00,000
contained within we included a hashes

779
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:03,279
file

780
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,880
md5 sha-1 shot 256 of all the various

781
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:06,000
files i can guarantee you that they are

782
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:07,760
all clean

783
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,520
most of these are pdfs and you're

784
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:12,640
wondering was there javascript in there

785
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:13,520
no no we're good to go so in the virtual

786
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:15,520
swag bag

787
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:17,760
we allowed the partner level and the

788
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:19,918
sponsor level to participate

789
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:22,559
and yes if anyone's wondering we had

790
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:23,840
four sponsor roles the three financial

791
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:27,279
being labeled

792
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:29,360
partner sponsor and supporter

793
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:30,480
it was my wonderful idea to name the

794
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:33,678
middle tier

795
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:36,159

digital badges this year

848
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:27,760
how this came to be alex and the rest of

849
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:30,880
the crew were sitting in the ask

850
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:32,640
cactus con channel in our cactus con

851
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:34,720
community discord server

852
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:36,559
and someone randomly asked hey are we

853
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:37,679
going to have digital badges that we can

854
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:40,399
print out

855
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:42,320
and some of us were like we had that

856
00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:45,760
idea and and just didn't do it and

857
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:48,559
was it even 10 minutes later perhaps

858
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:50,480
probably yeah five or six minutes yeah

859
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:52,639
yeah it was just like oh here you go

860
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:53,679
like this like yeah yeah just like that

861
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:56,000
yeah

862
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:57,679
so not only do we have for example

863
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,679
attendee

864
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:00,840
badges but we have staff we have

865
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:04,080
volunteer we have

866
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:05,279
speaker a couple others right i think so

867
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,720
so everyone should have your

868
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:08,320
your little digital badge it would be

869
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,679
really cool if we could see some folks

870
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:11,360
actually print these out

871
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:12,480
and maybe even like you know throw your

872
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,600
little hole punch in there and throw

873
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:15,440
them around your neck and i don't know

874
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:17,199
take a picture go on the video for

875
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:19,679
our after party something i think that'd

876
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:22,799
be pretty rad to see

877
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:25,679
so that's available in the swag bag also

878
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:26,399
and then we have an agenda so a quick

879
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:28,720
shout out to

880
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:31,039
grace from pulse dive reached out and

881
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:32,000
said hey do you have a dynamic agenda

882
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:34,240

883
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,039

884

930
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:01,360
mention to everyone now this is

931
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:05,120
something

932
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:07,360
that skyler really really pushed

933
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:08,158
and made happen when i came into the

934
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:10,080
group i

935
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:11,200
i have an affinity for the hitchhiker's

936
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:13,439
guide to the galaxy

937
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:14,960
and i was trying not to push my agenda

938
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:16,720
while trying to push my agenda

939
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:18,159
i was like come on i want to use it for

940
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:21,200
a theme come on

941
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:22,240
and skyler the uh is always been the

942
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:24,320
head of the art and

943
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:27,200
you know his the view the the way that

944
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:29,200
we're displayed to the public is is big

945
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:30,320
for him and he was okay with it and he

946
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:32,559
put together

947
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:33,439
with our artists nick and travis and

948
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:35,279
some others just

949
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:37,200
you know some amazing art and we were

950
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:39,520
able to open up a store

951
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:41,520
this year on threadless.com which

952
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:43,520
apparently i didn't make as an actual

953
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:47,679
link that would have been too easy

954
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:47,679
so uh let's just go take a look now

955
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,200
i think skyler is in here in the in the

956
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,960
stream too

957
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:55,840
oh good skyler if you want to say hi or

958
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:57,279
if you want to talk about the store

959
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:59,519
if you want to be on the spot you're

960
00:30:57,279 --> 00:31:03,039
doing a great job just go for it

961
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:04,880
all right so in the threadless store

962
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:06,720
that skyler and our artists so

963
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:09,360
tirelessly put together we have

964
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:11,519
a lot more than we would normally be

965
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:13,600
able to provide as a conference

966
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:15,039
simply because in years past we've had

967
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:16,879
the merchandise up front

968
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:18,399
we purchase it we have it printed we

969
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:20,240
have it shipped you come to the

970
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:22,399
conference we have posters

971
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:23,760
we have t-shirts some other things but

972
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:26,239
we have to you know

973
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:28,158
front that cost in this case we were

974
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:28,720
able to upload all the art and we were

975
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:30,240
able to

976
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:32,240
provide things that otherwise we

977
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:34,559
wouldn't have been a stockpile

978
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:35,600
so we have a bunch of different really

979
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:38,960
cool art

980
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:40,639
so we took our hacktar which is our

981
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:43,519
ongoing uh

982
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:44,799
from kind of cactuar if you will um and

983
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:46,960
melded with the hacking

984
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:48,480
theme which has been our mascot for the

985
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:50,000
entire time right since year one

986
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:52,720
officially or is that started year two

987
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,720
or three andrew

988
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:58,960
the hacked r was year two and beyond

989
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:00,640
you're telling started the first year

990
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:03,919
our um theme was

991
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:06,080
f snow so if you go to uat

992
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:07,360
there was a guy named frank snow or fred

993
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:10,158
snow and he had a lice

994
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:12,399
like a custom vanity plate that said um

995
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:14,480
f snow on it for his parking spot

996
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:15,918
and that became our logo for the b-sides

997
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:17,840
phoenix and when we

998
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:19,200
transitioned to cactus con right off the

999
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:21,039
bat we created

1000
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:23,120
uh the hectare and everything kind of

1001
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:25,519
moved from there so

1002
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:26,959
awesome i love it so we've basically

1003
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:29,120
done the design we've taken the

1004
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:31,679
hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy

1005
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:32,799

hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy

1016
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:54,000
this particular art may seem a bit

1017
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:56,080
confusing

1018
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,919
but for others oh there he is there's

1019

1022
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:07,440

1023
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:09,678

can get tank tops

1026
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:14,880
pull over hoodies zip up hoodies so we

1027
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:16,240
didn't have to choose between them we

1028
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:18,159
could offer both

1029
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:20,960
they have like a terry of fleece and by

1030
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:23,519
the way the fleece is super soft

1031
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:25,919
and for women's stuff we have uh the

1032
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:28,240
same things we also have v-necks

1033
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:30,320

1034
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:31,039
upper body where upper torso wear if you

1035
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:33,120

1036

00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:41,519
and then here's where it really starts

1041
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:44,240
just opening wide up under home

1042
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:46,159

1043
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:47,440
prints and acrylic prints we were able

1044
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:49,279

cactuscon itself or a sponsor a notice

1115

00:35:57,359 --> 00:36:00,640
sponsors kicking it off it'll direct you

1119
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:02,240

and thumbs up react to the post all you

1121

1124
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:12,640
if you enter a giveaway that is

1125
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,200
uh kicked off by one of our sponsors uh

1126
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:15,279
that is

1127
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:16,480
similar to how you would have your badge

1128
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:18,320
scanned in a real live

1129
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:19,920

personal information it's your first

1131
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:24,000
name last name and email address

1132
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:25,280
to that sponsor so if that's a concern

1133
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,880
that is only applicable for the

1134
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:28,960
sponsored giveaways the ones that are

1135
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:30,240
have the cactus con logo on them uh that

1136
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:32,000
is not the case

1137
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:33,520
um so yeah giveaways are easy just

1138
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,040

1139

this is the place for it um if you want

1178
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:45,119
to ask a question to the presenter

1179
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:47,359
because

1180
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:48,320

1181
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:51,359

1186
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:59,359
talks

1187
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:00,960
uh after a talk is completed if you

1188
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:01,520
still wish to continue conversation on

1189
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,880
the talk

1190
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:04,560
step out of the hallway just like we

1191
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:05,760
would ask you to in a real life con so

1192
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,400
the hallway is there for you to talk

1193
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:08,400
about

1194
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:10,720
previous talks or or whatever just

1195
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:14,079
continue the conversation

1196
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:17,279
uh moving on down what else we got

1197
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:18,720
uh workshops are uh and i apologize

1198
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,200
again anybody who didn't get a ticket

1199
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:21,839
but

1200
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:23,359
they filled up super quickly um

1201
00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:24,640
information about the workshops before

1202
00:38:23,359 --> 00:38:25,759
they kick off will be in the workshops

1203
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:27,680
general discussion

1204
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:29,040
uh and the channel should allow you if

1205
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:31,200
you had a workshop ticket

1206
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:32,960
to access those channels if not open up

1207
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:36,240
a help ticket with the registration team

1208
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:38,720
and they'll get you hooked up for that

1209
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:40,720
ctf channels look for announcements on

1210
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:42,720
the ctf and then general discussion

1211
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:44,160
and there's a channel called ctf players

1212
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:45,839
only that if you

1213
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:47,279
sign in with a ctf ticket with the bot

1214
00:38:45,839 --> 00:38:49,279
you should have access to it

1215
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:51,040
uh just a reminder going back one step

1216
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:54,160
if you have multiple tickets

1217
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:55,759
um for ctf or workshops send them all to

1218
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:56,720
hectare one at a time and i'll make sure

1219
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:58,640
you have the right roles if you haven't

1220
00:38:56,720 --> 00:39:02,160

1223
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:07,520
villages but we wanted to have a place

1224
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:09,599

1225

1284
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:03,119
to them

1285
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:04,640
again this conference couldn't be

1286
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:07,040
without our

1287
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:07,759
various sponsors so the partner level

1288
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:09,759
and the

1289
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:10,880
sponsor the mid-tier level that i so

1290
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:12,560
wonderfully named

1291
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:14,400
they have their own chats we'd love

1292
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:16,319
people to funnel in there they have

1293
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:17,440
upwards of uh four official

1294
00:41:16,319 --> 00:41:19,920
representatives each

1295
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:20,720
some of them have a couple some have far

1296
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:22,480
more than that

1297
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:24,000
uh but you'll see them actually labeled

1298
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,920
four or five of them

1299
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:28,079
so you know go in and say hello when

1300
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:30,400
they're doing you go into the channel

1301
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:31,599
and i just want to reiterate alex has

1302
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:33,440
already stated it but it's very

1303
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:36,640
important that i make this

1304
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:40,400
adamantly clear when a giveaway is

1305
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:43,598
facilitated by us by cactus con

1306
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:45,599
you can submit and your information is

1307
00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:49,040
not necessarily going anywhere

1308
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:50,480
when a giveaway is facilitated by one of

1309
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:52,000
the sponsors you will know

1310
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:53,839
because their logo will be at the top

1311
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:56,079
right hand side and it will say so and

1312
00:41:53,839 --> 00:41:58,000
so is sponsoring this giveaway right

1313
00:41:56,079 --> 00:41:59,760
if you see that when you put that thumbs

1314
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,440
up you are agreeing to have

1315
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:03,280
your first name last name and email

1316
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:05,520
address as registered with

1317
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:07,440
eventbrite provided to them it's the

1318
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:09,759
exact same as having your badge scanned

1319
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:10,800
when you go up to say a vendor booth at

1320
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:12,880
you know one of those types of

1321
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:14,960
conferences so i just want to make

1322
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:16,400
very very clear that everyone's aware of

1323
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:19,920
that and that that's

1324
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:22,640
how that works all right back to you

1325
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:23,760
i think that's about it for discord um

1326
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:25,359
as far as uh

1327
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:27,040
the overview if we want to talk turn it

1328
00:42:25,359 --> 00:42:27,520
over and talk about some moderation

1329
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:32,480
stuff and

1330
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:34,720
and rules turn it back over you

1331

00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:40,160
we have a rules channel up in the

1334
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:42,880
general cactus con 2021

1335
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:44,480
section and our rules we have a code of

1336
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:46,880
conduct it is

1337
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:49,680
basically it boils down to hey don't be

1338
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:52,000
a fart okay please don't be a fart

1339
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:52,799
if you are being a fart you will be put

1340
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,599
in time out

1341
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:57,359
well literally we have a room a channel

1342
00:42:55,599 --> 00:42:59,520
that most people will not see

1343
00:42:57,359 --> 00:43:01,279
in fact you should never see it or even

1344
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:02,720
know that it exists outside of me

1345
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:04,640
talking about it right now

1346
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:06,879
if you're put in time out you will only

1347
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:08,879
be able to communicate in that channel

1348
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:11,040
and our staff members will ask you

1349
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:14,319
politely to stop being a dick

1350
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:16,079
so if we have an issue with

1351
00:43:14,319 --> 00:43:17,520
any community members then we have

1352
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:20,480
plenty of volunteers

1353
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:21,599
and moderators to take care of it our

1354
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:24,560
code of conduct

1355
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:26,400
is essentially anti-harassment we have

1356
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:29,119
exhibitors and sponsors

1357
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:30,960
and we don't want them to be barraged by

1358
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:32,160
negativity they're a big part of this

1359
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:34,640
conference so

1360
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:35,520
for example let's just say a given

1361
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:36,960
sponsor

1362
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:38,319
you're like oh i don't like that product

1363
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:40,319
can you just keep spamming this

1364
00:43:38,319 --> 00:43:41,440
product's crap and trash i'm very very

1365
00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:42,400
like that's just it's just not

1366
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:44,480
appropriate

1367
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:47,040
so um and plus we love all of our

1368
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:49,599
sponsors and all of their products

1369
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:50,240
so people people hey hey there's other

1370
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:52,880
people in this

1371
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:53,598
this discord server okay people don't

1372
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:56,560
want to

1373
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:58,079
come to a conference like this and have

1374
00:43:56,560 --> 00:44:01,119
a negative experience

1375
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:04,079
so pretty much any general negativity

1376
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:05,440
where you want you don't feel safe or

1377
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:07,520
you feel as though your

1378
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:09,760
experience is being marred if that

1379
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:11,440
happens please do report that either in

1380
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:12,240
the help and support or directly to

1381
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:14,079
hacktar

1382
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:16,160
if you go to hachtar it's completely

1383
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:17,920
anonymous and you will not

1384
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:20,640
you know have to worry about anyone

1385
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:23,680
knowing or whatever you get the idea

1386
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:25,680
also privacy and operations security

1387
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:27,759
this is an online conference

1388
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:30,640
we had a press member reach out to us

1389
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:31,040
and say hey are you doing a a badge or a

1390
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:33,598
role

1391
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:34,240
a ticket type specifically for press we

1392
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:37,200
decided

1393
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:37,759
we did not want to go that route and as

1394
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:39,040
such

1395
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:40,800
we figured that one of the things we

1396
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:44,560
would do is just simply add

1397
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:46,560
the privacy and opsec note to our rules

1398
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:48,000
so take a look at these bad boys posted

1399
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:50,640
by matt these

1400
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:52,240
are it's just a heads up letting you

1401
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:53,839
know look whatever you type in here

1402
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:56,240

1403
00:44:53,839 --> 00:44:59,279
in a public chat room

1404
00:44:56,240 --> 00:45:01,359

chapin bryce hi chapin hopefully you're

1441
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:23,359
watching right now

1442
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:24,560
he is an author and he has written two

1443
00:46:23,359 --> 00:46:26,799
different textbooks

1444
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:28,240
on uh basically dealing with python in

1445
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:30,880
the forensics realm

1446
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:32,160
they are awesome if you are a developer

1447
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:33,520
and you're in the

1448
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:35,200
in this realm at all if you're here and

1449
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:36,480
you're a developer definitely be

1450
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:37,279
interested in that and if you're not a

1451
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:38,880
developer

1452
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:40,720
you'll definitely be interested to get a

1453
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:43,680
feel for what goes on behind the scenes

1454
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:46,959
of the automation of many of the tools

1455
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:48,799
upon which you rely we also have

1456
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:50,319
some other fun books from no starch

1457
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:52,880
press they've provided for example

1458
00:46:50,319 --> 00:46:55,279
beyond the basic stuff with python

1459
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:56,880
they've also provided real world python

1460
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:58,560
and two copies of practical

1461
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:59,839
vulnerability management

1462
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:02,640
those will be given away throughout the

1463
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:04,720
conference i also have i've had this

1464
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:06,078
sitting around and i was you know i was

1465
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:06,399
like you know what someone's gonna enjoy

1466
00:47:06,079 --> 00:47:08,079
this

1467
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:09,680
and it probably won't focus very well

1468
00:47:08,079 --> 00:47:12,960
here but it is a

1469
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:14,160
jack the defcon jack soldering kit uh

1470
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:16,000
we were like we don't want to give away

1471
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:18,000
another conference of stuff that's weird

1472
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:19,280
but it's a really fun soldering kit and

1473
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:21,520
i couldn't help myself

1474
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:23,599
and we're gonna couple that with a ble

1475
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:25,200
key and it's not really much to see here

1476
00:47:23,599 --> 00:47:27,920
but if you look this up

1477
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:29,919
it's a uh fun little device to mess

1478
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:32,480
around with bluetooth

1479
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:34,160
i will initiate the first yes stream

1480
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:39,839

1481

1663
00:54:05,359 --> 00:54:08,799

realized we never officially set a time

00:54:16,559 --> 00:54:20,800
i guess what 8 pm sounds about right

1670
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:22,880
so the quote unquote after party we

1671
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:24,400
thought about doing a full vr thing all

1672
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:25,920
kinds of great ideas

1673
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:27,760
and it just came down to you know what

1674
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:28,640
we're going to do we're going to have a
