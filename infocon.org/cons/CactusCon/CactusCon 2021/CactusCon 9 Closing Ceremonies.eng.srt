of these closing ceremonies i have no

53
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:13,200
idea how long they're going to take

54
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,200
we'll find out

55
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:18,000
so we had a couple mishaps along the way

56
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,360
and i just wanted to kind of point them

57
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,280
out for anyone thinking of running a

58
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,720
virtual conference or just to show that

59
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,160
hey it may have looked like

60
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,599
everything worked out absolutely

61
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,040
flawlessly but of course you're going to

62
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:28,000
have little you know flubs here and

63
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:31,120
there

64
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,319
uh our stream went mostly well and i was

65
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,640
very excited to see that

66
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:36,238
we had a dip and i believe it was either

67
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:38,958
our first or our second

68
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:40,879
q a session our live session the stream

69
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:41,200
just kind of went away for like a minute

70
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:43,120
or

71
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:45,040
maybe two it wasn't that long and it

72
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:48,400
just came right back we're like okay

73
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:49,040
cool we had uh some random giveaway bot

74
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,080
issues

75
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:54,879
uh our red wedge put in so

76
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,720
much time and effort to our discord bots

77
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:58,159
uh that was the one bot that was

78
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,000
actually functioning and just

79
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:02,000
behaving the entire time and then it

80
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,400
just decided on day two like

81
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,920
i'm bored i don't want to give us you

82
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,239
know a little bit of a

83
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:09,280
little bit of a headache if you will but

84
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:11,920
got it back working

85
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,720
everything's working fine now our cloud

86
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:16,319
vendors stole

87
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:18,720
our gpu oh yeah our streaming box was

88
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:20,480
working just fine and then all of a

89
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,400
sudden the gpu decided to die

90
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:25,040
and when we tried to migrate over to a

91
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,640
different box a gpu was not available so

92
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,319
it just kind of we've been rendering on

93
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,440
software the entire time but it's been

94
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:32,879
working just fine

95
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:34,159
so no biggie there and um alex i'm going

96
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,599
to put you on the spot

97
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:37,280
red wedge if you want to talk about the

98
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:38,798
reg bot issues i don't want to steal

99
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:42,080
your thunder i think it's such a

100
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:44,080
fun thing to discuss yeah we had when we

101
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:46,560
opened the con server the night before

102
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:48,720
kind of like a soft opening um the

103
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,760
registration bot just completely crashed

104
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,080
uh didn't work at

105
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:53,599
all and people were just streaming in it

106
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,200
had no way to check into the con

107
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:57,200
so for a good hour and a half i was

108
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:59,200
running the entire con for my laptop on

109
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:02,319
wi-fi on my desk

110
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:03,839
and shockingly it completely held up but

111
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:06,079
it was a little nerve-wracking watching

112
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,680
everyone come in with absolutely no way

113
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:10,879
i've literally had sleepless nights

114
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,879
about this registration bot

115
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,920
at one point he held up his laptop and

116
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:18,320
you can hear the fans just you know

117
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:19,279
going crazy it was a it was a good time

118
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:22,800
but it worked out

119
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:25,599
and uh we're all the better for it

120
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,960
so i'd like to do a quick meet the staff

121
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,680

closings for cactus con

229
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:53,440

230
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,520
event loops in my head

231
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:57,680
all the time and it's mike sitting on

232
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:59,120
stage while andrew was talking

233
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,639
and just kind of kicking his feet around

234
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,440
looking at the audience and i don't know

235
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:03,919
why i always

236
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:05,680
flash back to that uh but mike has been

237
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:08,000
extremely extremely helpful

238
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:09,120

set up as they're supposed to be all of

247
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:26,638
that the transition to

248
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:27,440
a digital to a virtual space was very

249
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:29,680
different

250
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,560
for us our home this year our venue was

251
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,799
discord

252
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:34,880
so the two of them helped a whole lot

253
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:36,478
with discord setting up all the rooms

254
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,279
making sure all the permissions were

255
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:39,680

old roles really and just did a great

259
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:45,519
job of making sure speakers knew where

260
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:47,518

people who submitted a form to be a

274

volunteer but

275
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:18,079
obviously we didn't need quite that many

276
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:20,959
for the virtual then

277
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:23,279

308
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:19,439
slack group or i don't know somewhere i

309
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,200

00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:23,519
one of the previous cactus con slacks

311
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:25,279

398
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:08,399

402
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:16,079
find our account

403
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:18,000
speakers thank you speakers you wouldn't

404
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:19,120
have much of a con without speakers

405
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,839
right

406
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:24,160
so we had a whole bunch of submissions

407
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:25,360
to our cfp that jess helped run as she's

408
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:28,719
done for years

409
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:31,920
i think we had over 45 right i think and

410
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,320
uh we decided we made the decision to go

411
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,240
with

412
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:36,079
one track we wanted to just have one

413
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,760
track and we didn't want to release all

414
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:40,000
the videos at once and have people just

415
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:42,160
kind of randomly go to the talks we

416
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,680
rather chose to go with the hey we're

417
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,880
going to do a premiere mode right they

418
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,399
were all pre-recorded

419
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:48,079
but we want it to feel like it's

420
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:50,240
actually on schedule and do live

421
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:52,079
q and a's after so out of all those

422
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:55,199
talks we whittled it down

423
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:57,199
to just 14 and personally i think

424
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:59,439
it worked out really well i i loved all

425
00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:00,560
of our extremely happy that all the

426
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:03,519
speakers

427
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:03,920
were able to be here with us also for q

428
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:06,160
a

429
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:08,160
thank you speakers there's no con

430
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:10,000
without speakers it's the entire purpose

431
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:11,760
that you know without speakers

432
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,680
also the folks who ran our workshops we

433
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:15,920
had four different workshops

434
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:17,680
we understand by the way we know we are

435
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:20,079
fully cognizant of the fact

436
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:21,680
that not enough people felt they got

437
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:24,719
into the workshops

438
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:25,439
um on one hand at uh cactus cons in

439
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,040
person or

440
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:29,040
any conference really workshops are

441
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:31,920
often the most limited

442
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:32,959
thing for me i i totally feel all of the

443
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,240
people who are like

444
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:36,560
i didn't get in the workshop like that

445
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:38,240
sucks i'm the same damn way when i go to

446
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,880
a conference i typically spend the whole

447
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,639
damn time

448
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,920
either talking to people in the hallways

449
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:43,040
or in workshops

450
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:46,000
so one of the things we're going to try

451
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:48,319
to to work on for next year if we have

452
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,920
however much of an element of a virtual

453
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,519
conference is dealing with that

454
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:53,040
and trying to make them as big as

455
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:55,360
possible while keeping the

456
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:56,480
folks running them comfortable but the

457
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:58,399
workshops went

458
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,760
really really well so thank you so much

459
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:03,600
to the folks who ran

460
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:05,839
your workshops for us that was awesome

461
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:07,680
and all of the talks are in the digital

462
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:09,040
brochure by the way so let me just pop

463
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:12,000
back over that little sucker

464
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:14,079
so if we go over to the digital brochure

465
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:17,839
i'm just going to skip past those

466
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:19,839
we've got here our keynotes

467
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:21,600
and then we've got our workshops so

468
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:24,079
thank you to sam bone and

469
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:25,519

uh thank you to christy for the analysis

479
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:46,399
101 and 102 for the incident responder

480
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:47,680
i think it's critical that we have these

481
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:50,079
types of workshops

482
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:51,839
more and more of them at conferences or

483
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:52,880
at other venues just like this we're

484
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:56,160
even throwing around

485
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:57,360
ideas of doing potentially

486
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:59,360
we're not committing anything but

487
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:01,519
potentially looking at you know

488
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:03,040
between or at some point a conference

489
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:05,120
that's sole focus

490
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:06,240
is essentially workshops because of how

491
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,320
important they are

492
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,680
and this type of introductory like look

493
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,959
you're just gonna jump into it you're

494
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,638
gonna get your feet wet you're gonna do

495
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:15,599
it hands-on that is exactly

496
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:17,040
what we all want uh gavin thank you very

499
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:22,000

500
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,759
in the general ai

501
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,600

510
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:42,000
the heavens you know the clouds parted

511
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:43,279
and the heavens sang down i was like

512
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,800
this is this is the way

513
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:46,800

514
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:48,399

519
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:58,560
say that we do have all the talks

520
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:59,599
did see i'll just keep paging down

521
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:02,800
randomly through

522
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:03,199
here they are in the digital brochure so

523
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,039
please

524
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:06,879
check those out and reach out to any

525
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:08,480
speakers ask them questions bug them

526
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:11,199
constantly you know

527
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:12,400
let them know that they are loved our

528
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:14,799
partners

529
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:16,079
all of our sponsors all of our sponsors

530
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:18,720
a conference

531
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:21,198
would be purposeless without speakers it

532
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:23,280
would not be possible without sponsors

533
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:24,319
um not having any type of money to do

534
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,678
anything

535
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:27,480
that's not going to work very well you

536
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:29,600
know cactus con is we are officially a

537
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:31,440
501c3 organization

538
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,639
so we're not in this for profit we're in

539
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,400
this for the community

540
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:36,559
and that's why for example we have a

541
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,360
discord community server it's called

542
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:39,918
cactus con

543
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:40,879
community facilitating all that does

544
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:42,559
require

545
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:44,400
money essentially right so we're not

546
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:47,280
trying to line our pockets but we need

547
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,760
money coming in this year our partners

548
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:51,440
bishop

549
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:53,440
fox blackberry early warning and paypal

550
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:55,200
thank you so much for being a partner at

551
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,000
that tier and at that level it's a

552
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,760
pretty decent

553
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,440
it's a decent amount of money to provide

554
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:01,520
to a group like ours

555
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:04,240
for getting into a conference that

556
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:05,679
really there haven't been that many

557
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:07,440
for you to judge what you're going to

558
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:08,799
get for your money right what you're

559
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:12,720
going to get for that

560
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:15,039
as andrew has said in the past in fact

561
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:16,240
he said it so well in our opening i

562
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:17,679
don't know if he was unmuted say it

563
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:21,039
himself but our partners

564
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:22,720
are not just sponsors they are literally

565
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:24,160
partners they're they go above and

566
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:26,640
beyond they do

567
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:29,120
things and they apply themselves oh

568
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:31,919
andrew you're unmuted go

569
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:32,639
yeah uh no our partner here actually

570
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:34,960
came about

571
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:36,000
because he had so many different

572
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:38,720
sponsors or

573
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,120
step up and actually contribute so much

574
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:42,320
more

575
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:44,320
beyond this idea of uh just giving us

576
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:46,000
money right so early warning

577
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:47,520
spent a lot of time in the early days

578
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,520
helping us with

579
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:51,039
um registration as an example they

580
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,918
helped run the registration booths with

581
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:53,919
jessica

582
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:54,960
and then we've had bishop fox involved

583
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:56,960
from the beginning when

584
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,320
even when it was stack and lieu and you

585
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:00,960
know they've helped us with

586
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:02,480
they helped us with the ctfs and several

587
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,360
art pieces and some of the marketing

588
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:06,240
such so

589
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:07,678
we've done a really we created this

590
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,480
because of their involvement in the

591
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:10,240
conference

592
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,919
and our ability to continue to up level

593
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:14,160
and and make this what

594
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:15,679
what ultimately we want is something

595
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,480
that benefits the whole community

596
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:19,200
including

597
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:21,039
the the companies and the people who are

598
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,640
looking for work here in town so

599
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:24,799
it's been it's been phenomenal to see

600
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:27,280
this many people step up paypal

601
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:28,639
more recently and then uh blackberry

602
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:30,480
this is the first year

603
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:32,559
uh they've they've joined at this level

604
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:35,120

00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:37,280

and the offer to be an in-kind sponsor

690

696

throughout the conference to bring you

750
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,840
really didn't know

751
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:15,520
what was in store in terms of numbers in

752
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:17,600
terms of actual attendance which is

753
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:21,520
technically the very next slide

754
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:23,678
um what we ended up with is far more

755
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:24,960
far more than i personally could have

756
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:27,840
ever expected

757
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:29,440
so we have registration counts we used

758
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:30,840

873
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:24,720
all the things uh now don't mike and

874
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:27,360
matt

875
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:29,440
both helped out with discord too but

876
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:32,918
alex put together all of our bots

877
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:34,080
all kinds of work went into that love

878
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:36,960
1461

879
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:39,360
attendees now that was different from

880
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:43,279
the 1814

881
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:45,279
who entered the server so 1814

882
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:46,559
showed up if you will but there was a

883
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:48,640
registration bot

884
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:50,480
that required your eventbrite

885
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,200
information in order to get into the

886
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:54,880
server

887
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:55,520
so somehow uh 350 or so just never got

888
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,960
past that

889
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:59,279
i don't know if they just showed up and

890
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:00,880
gave up and whatever we had a great help

891
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:02,480
ticket system so it's not like they

892
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:03,919
they just couldn't do it i guess they

893
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:06,640
just gave up but

894
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:07,520
almost 1500 people and andrew if i'm

895
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:10,960
correct here

896
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:13,039
our check-in for people in person

897
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:14,559
people in person people real people

898
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:17,919
showing up to cactus con

899
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:20,240
9 in december 2019 was right around that

900
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:21,919
same number was it not just shy of 1500

901
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:25,200
people

902
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:26,159
yeah i think we have basically met the

903
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,159
exact amount

904
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:29,600
that we hit last year so we're right on

905
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:31,120
par with what we did the last time we

906
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:34,320
hosted this event which is

907
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:36,158
is really exciting and the 1800 folks as

908
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:37,918
sort of entering and registering to get

909
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:39,919
into the conference

910
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:41,919
larger than any event we've held so far

911
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:44,480
so

912
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:48,000
right really really cool to see that we

913
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:51,679
had 1355

914
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:53,840

915
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:55,200
000. excuse me i'll learn to read

00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:57,039
thirteen thousand

917
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:59,200
five hundred and fifty five that is a

918
00:29:57,039 --> 00:30:00,720
lot of communicating and communication

919
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:03,120
going on in our server

920
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:04,559
we had 79 help tickets one of the things

921
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:06,479
that we had was a bot that

922
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:08,480
facilitated help tickets so the

923
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:11,520
registration team the technical team

924
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:14,640

926
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:18,480
able to open tickets

927
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:19,279
and i watched as the tickets popped open

928
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,960
because i was

929
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:23,039

930
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:25,039

941
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:47,439
and give us a heads up about something

942

1004
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:53,918
you enter you receive a note

1005
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:56,080
saying i need your eventbrite

1006
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:57,279
information here's exactly where it is

1007
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:59,600
and what it looks like

1008
00:32:57,279 --> 00:33:00,720
well were someone to actually take that

1009
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:02,639
exact example

1010
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:04,559
and try to feed that to the bot in other

1011
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:07,120
words trying to use the example

1012
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:08,879
as the entry data we logged that and we

1013
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:10,399
had seven of those that occurred we just

1014
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:11,440
thought that was a cute little number to

1015
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:13,360
provide

1016
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:15,120
along with the fact that we had six

1017
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:17,039
different links that were sent to the

1018
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:18,000
bot so people trying to get the bot to

1019
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:20,158
access links

1020
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,600
and just be silly apparently hopefully

1021
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:25,840
not too malicious

1022
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:29,039
four of them have any

1023
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:30,480
four of them or rick rolls nice

1024
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:32,080
four of six were rick rolls that's

1025
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:34,960
fantastic

1026
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:35,678
uh as far as development went on the uh

1027
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:38,399
the bot

1028
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:39,519
stuff we had eight different vms in use

1029
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:42,320
throughout the conference

1030
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:42,960
four distinctive bot applications one

1031
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:45,279
web app

1032
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:47,679
and one lambda function which gives you

1033
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:52,000
a heads up on what platform we use

1034
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:54,960
and over or i guess specifically 2 656

1035
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,519
lines of python which were written by

1036
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:58,159
alex

1037
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:59,440
in order to facilitate the whole damn

1038
00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:01,679
conference on discord

1039
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:03,519
so um i think this worked really really

1040
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:04,880
well we've also decided

1041
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:07,360
well i don't know if we either or i just

1042
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:10,240
did we would like to use

1043
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:11,040
and have an online presence at the next

1044
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:12,479
cactus con

1045
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:14,320
even if we're not quote unquote a

1046
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:16,399
digital or virtual conference

1047
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:18,320
and please don't forget we have a

1048
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:20,000

1049
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:23,280

uh who is an absolute badass used to

1073

run b-sides las vegas and uh she

1074
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:25,680
surprised me during my talk in fact it

1075
00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:27,520
was so abrupt i thought my talk was

1076
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:29,200
getting shut down because the woman who

1077
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:31,520
runs the entire show

1078
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:32,399
was like excuse me ryan ryan and i was

1079
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:35,359
like oh

1080
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:37,040
 like what did i do and she

1081
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:39,359
presented me with something and

1082
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:40,560
it has been a it has been a huge

1083
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:43,598
motivating factor

1084
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:45,119
essentially in a lot of what i do as far

1085
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:47,280
as networking

1086
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:49,440
the minor details that people pay and

1087
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:50,880
the the appreciation and thanks

1088
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:52,400

1089
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:54,000
thing for me so i invited her to come

together

1094
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:02,480
my wife by the way had this idea she

1095
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:04,320
said isn't that that thing i don't want

okay so some folks may not be aware of

1242
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:09,520
the fact

1243
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:10,560
that cactus con for many or a couple

1244
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:11,920
years now in fact

1245
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:13,759
andrew can you throw out a number of

1246
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:17,839
years i don't cactus con kids

1247
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:21,040
that it's been a thing oops

1248
00:41:17,839 --> 00:41:22,960
uh two years i think we we did it for

1249
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:24,880
two years and this is the third year we

1250
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:28,480
have kids stuff

1251
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:31,359
okay cool so for two years cactus khan

1252
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:33,760
had a a sub event if you will a holy

1253
00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:34,960
separate event entitled cactus con kids

1254
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:36,160
that had a i believe

1255
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:39,599
and you can correct me andrew if you

1256
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:42,560
need to over 250 something odd kids

1257
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:44,160
showed up last year or 2019.

1258
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:46,560
um i think that sounds about right we've

1259
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:48,399
restricted we restricted it to a hundred

1260
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:50,078
people i think the first year

1261
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:52,079
and we got that and then we ran it the

1262
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:54,960
second year at like two to fifty and i

1263
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:54,960
think that sounds about right

1264
00:41:55,119 --> 00:42:00,319
cool cactus con kids obviously caters to

1265
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:02,319
the kiddos right and the idea was to

1266
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:05,119
provide like for example here's the oh

1267
00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:06,640
i was gonna say here's the old agenda

1268
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:08,480
and the doors closed

1269
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:11,118
uh but it caters to the kiddos and the

1270
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:11,839
idea is just to give them a place to

1271
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:13,280
learn grow

1272
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:15,279
and hack and you can see here they're

1273
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:18,640
being shown some lock picking

1274
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:21,359
cactus con kids itself is amazing

1275
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:22,400
i was floored last year they had i don't

1276
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:25,119
remember how many five

1277
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:25,599
six different stations uh lock picking

1278
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:27,680
and

1279
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:28,800
all kinds of soldering station all kinds

1280
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:30,560
of fun stuff

1281
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:32,400
and then the culmination of going

1282
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:33,440
through those stations was going into an

1283
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:35,040
escape room

1284
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:36,880
where you had to then implement the

1285
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:38,160
newly learned skills in order to get the

1286
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:40,480
hell out of the room

1287
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:42,240
i thought it was phenomenal um kevin

1288
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:43,440

1289
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:44,879

1301
00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:05,119
their

1302
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:07,440
end-user license agreement so there's

1303
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:10,880
certain things like that we're like well

00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:11,520
so we are however happy to announce and

1305
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:14,720
it is in

1306
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:17,680
our digital brochure that ctf

1307
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:18,879

whether it's friends and families or

1318
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:40,720
your neighbors just go

1319

1321
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:45,359

on the link here you'll see that it

1331
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:06,078
actually throws in some extra values um

1332
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:09,200
so that's kind of challenge number one

1333
00:44:06,079 --> 00:44:10,960
is to get to the link but

1334
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:12,319
visually the link is is actually correct

1335
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:13,280
totally on purpose go ahead and check

1336
00:44:12,319 --> 00:44:16,079
out

1337
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:17,440
what's that so that was totally on

1338
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:20,880
purpose

1339
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:23,440
yeah oh 100 yeah so go

1340
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:24,640
check that out um hopefully folks can

1341
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:26,560
find that very useful

1342
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:28,960
and and get some kiddos involved i think

1343
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:32,078
that would be really really cool

1344
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:34,640
so we're just about done here we've got

1345

1370

anything along

1371
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:29,359
the lines of the profit i don't actually

1372
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:31,040
mean profit because

1373
00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:32,960
everything goes right back into the

1374
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:34,720
product right so

1375
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:37,359
we have some numbers for you we like to

1376
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:38,720
we believe in and because we're a 501c3

1377
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:39,759
we don't just believe in but we have to

1378
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:42,799
adhere to

1379
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:45,280
you know full transparency so this year

1380
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:46,800
from general sponsorship corporate

1381
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:51,000
sponsorship if you will

1382
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:54,319
we brought in 26 000 we also brought in

1383
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:56,160
5.7 technically 5727

1384
00:45:54,319 --> 00:45:57,599
from community sponsors and remember

1385
00:45:56,160 --> 00:46:00,560
that that's just people just

1386
00:45:57,599 --> 00:46:02,480
giving us 100 250 you know bucks

1387
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:05,680
themselves 67 of those people

1388
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:09,680
provided that our store the cactus con

1389
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:12,000
9 store brought in 1 190

1390
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:12,879
which is pretty darn cool there's not a

1391
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,880
there's not a steep

1392
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:16,880
profit on that it's not a huge profit

1393
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:17,520
per item so that just goes to show how

1394
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:19,599
many

1395
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:21,040
things were primo purchased and uh

1396
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:24,160
that's awesome okay door's still

1397
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:26,720
oh that's really cool yes

1398
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:28,560
yes the store is still up and i actually

1399
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:30,319
have a thing to go over um that's i

1400
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:34,160
forgot to talk about the store that's

1401
00:46:30,319 --> 00:46:35,599
that's next i lied store

1402
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:36,879
all right normally we do our closings we

1403
00:46:35,599 --> 00:46:38,640
just walk up to the podium and start

1404
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:40,079
talking so i tried to do a powerpoint

1405
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:43,279
and i almost had it finished

1406
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:46,319
almost so money-wise um

1407
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:48,079
we had expenses of course operating

1408
00:46:46,319 --> 00:46:51,119
expenses one of our expenses

1409
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:53,280
was 1 100 for

1410
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:54,640
taxes and accounting so we have to pay

1411
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:58,480
for our taxes to be done

1412
00:46:54,640 --> 00:47:01,200
essentially in accounting and we had 4k

1413
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:02,800
that was already paid toward the venue

1414
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:03,520
now you might be wondering like what

1415
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:05,359
venue

1416
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:06,640
we ran on discord and it was technically

1417
00:47:05,359 --> 00:47:08,319
free discord itself

1418
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:10,799
was free so what are you talking about

1419
00:47:08,319 --> 00:47:13,119
well we have a physical venue that we

1420
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:15,760
were in a three-year contract with

1421
00:47:13,119 --> 00:47:17,440
and they were actually really cool and

1422
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:18,800
i'll even say it's the mesa community

1423
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:19,599
center it's where we had our last

1424
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:21,359
conference

1425
00:47:19,599 --> 00:47:23,599
it was a three-year contract and we were

1426
00:47:21,359 --> 00:47:25,440
unable to meet this year because

1427
00:47:23,599 --> 00:47:27,599
we would not all want to hang out right

1428
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:30,480
now and exchange covet together

1429
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:32,720
um and in meet space if you will so we

1430
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:34,160
had money down and they were cool enough

1431
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:37,040
to not make it weird

1432
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:38,160
and uh basically just allowed us to just

1433
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:40,960
push that money

1434
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:41,279
to next year so that that was already in

1435
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:43,440
there

1436
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:45,520
the 4k was already in there and there's

1437
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:49,599
a couple other bills that are due coming

1438
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:49,599
up for our our next venue

1439
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:55,760
payment if you will so on top of that we

1440
00:47:53,119 --> 00:47:59,680
also had

1441
00:47:55,760 --> 00:48:00,079
okay cool discord was not very expensive

1442
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:03,919
at all

1443
00:48:00,079 --> 00:48:04,800
uh just basically free um however the

1444
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:07,920
bots that ran

1445
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:09,680
on discord are in a cloud-based provider

1446
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:11,680
i'll just call it cloud for right now

1447
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:13,440
and that cloud-based provider actually

1448
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:15,440
and i'm going to give a huge hint as to

1449
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:17,200
who it is right now they provide an

1450
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:19,680
initial upfront 300

1451
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:21,118
credit when you sign up so we signed up

1452
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:22,799
and out of that 300

1453
00:48:21,119 --> 00:48:25,440
credit uh alex i believe you said we

1454
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:28,720
were at 220 230ish

1455
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:29,839
dollars so this morning yeah um yeah so

1456
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:32,000
probably by the end of the conference

1457
00:48:29,839 --> 00:48:35,839
we're just going to hit that 300

1458
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:37,359
so essentially that was also free

1459
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:38,480
right we did pay some money towards

1460
00:48:37,359 --> 00:48:40,160
discord though i don't know if you

1461
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:42,960
forgot about that

1462
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:44,799
i did forget about that we paid 125

1463
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:45,760
dollars to discord because i am a filthy

1464
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:48,079
liar

1465
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:48,800
sorry about that so in discord land we

1466
00:48:48,079 --> 00:48:51,359
actually

1467
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:53,200
too hold on what's it called uh nitro

1468
00:48:51,359 --> 00:48:55,920
boost the server up to what's known as

1469
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:57,520
level two it took 15 boosts and and

1470
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:59,440
normally that would be

1471
00:48:57,520 --> 00:49:00,640
uh well if it was normally we had a

1472
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:02,319
slight discount because of

1473
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:04,160
a previous membership and it was around

1474
00:49:02,319 --> 00:49:05,599
125 bucks to do that

1475
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:09,279
thank you for reminding me about that

1476
00:49:05,599 --> 00:49:12,079
that is not in my notes i'm a bad person

1477
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:13,599
um we had a lot of things that we didn't

1478
00:49:12,079 --> 00:49:16,960
necessarily

1479
00:49:13,599 --> 00:49:19,119
have to pay for this year and

1480
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:20,160

jump in there and

1493
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:42,800
correct me but it's one of the first

1494
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:46,240
years where we did not

1495
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:46,240
have to actually

1496
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:52,078
spend money ourselves so other

1497
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:54,079
expenses that we had for example was

1498
00:49:52,079 --> 00:49:57,280
there a

1499
00:49:54,079 --> 00:49:58,880
venue that was from 2019

1500
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:00,720
so good example of what i'm talking

1501
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:02,319
about it up here it's like oh

1502
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:04,160
you got a whole bunch of profit for a

1503
00:50:02,319 --> 00:50:06,160
virtual conference where'd it all go

1504
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:09,359
well we owed a bunch of myself

1505
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:11,598
right so there's that um the venue fees

1506
00:50:09,359 --> 00:50:13,520
for the upcoming years were actually not

1507
00:50:11,599 --> 00:50:15,200
100 sure on especially this

1508
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:16,720
contract next year so i couldn't put a

1509
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:19,359
dollar amount on here

1510
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:20,240
but it looks like based on what we

1511
00:50:19,359 --> 00:50:22,240
brought in

1512
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:23,439
right and if you ballpark right this

1513
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:27,680
value it looks like

1514
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:28,960
33 34 000. we're probably not going to

1515
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:32,040
have to pay

1516
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:33,520
anything for at least for the venue for

1517
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:35,920
2019

1518
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:37,200
now the trick comes into when you then

1519
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:39,440
discuss

1520
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:40,399
other fees and things that we normally

1521
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:43,200
have to pay for

1522
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:45,200
for an in-person conference so since i'm

1523
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:46,720
just sharing my screen i will go ahead

1524
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:49,279
and literally just

1525
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:50,640
just cut that and start going again we

1526
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:53,520
saved on the following

1527
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:54,400
art we did not have to line walls with

1528
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:57,040
art because

1529
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:58,400
we're all at home so we didn't have to

1530
00:50:57,040 --> 00:51:00,720
pay for a ton

1531
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:02,319
of art to be created now one of the

1532
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:05,200
things i did forget by the way

1533
00:51:02,319 --> 00:51:06,319
put on here was that our expenses for

1534
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:07,919
our artists

1535
00:51:06,319 --> 00:51:10,160
was one thousand two hundred dollars so

1536
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:12,480
that's another expense to throw on there

1537
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:13,920
but we didn't have to pay for all of the

1538
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:16,400
art to be printed out

1539
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:18,800
so we avoided that expense this year now

1540
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:20,079
we have that coming up next year still

1541
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:21,839
another thing that we didn't necessarily

1542
00:51:20,079 --> 00:51:23,760
have to pay for this year i guess that's

1543
00:51:21,839 --> 00:51:24,319
wrong we did pay for the video we just

1544
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:26,319
pushed

1545
00:51:24,319 --> 00:51:27,920
some of that to last year and then we

1546
00:51:26,319 --> 00:51:29,759
paid for the previous year that we still

1547
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:30,400
had it you know we owed a decent amount

1548
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:31,599
on

1549
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:33,359
but at the very least we didn't

1550
00:51:31,599 --> 00:51:34,880
necessarily have to you know put the

1551
00:51:33,359 --> 00:51:37,040
money towards that at least we have some

1552
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:39,119
of that funneled into next year

1553
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:40,160
another thing is uh just food and

1554
00:51:39,119 --> 00:51:41,359
concessions

1555
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:42,640
we didn't have to pay for food or

1556
00:51:41,359 --> 00:51:43,759
concessions because everyone just went

1557
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:46,480
to their own refrigerator

1558
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:48,880
essentially um we didn't have to pay for

1559
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:50,559
badges we did not do hardware badges

1560
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:51,839
this year it was just going to be too

1561
00:51:50,559 --> 00:51:55,119
much of a pain

1562
00:51:51,839 --> 00:51:57,279
in the butt basically so we didn't have

1563
00:51:55,119 --> 00:51:58,960
to worry about all the sourcing

1564
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:01,119
skyler by the way typically from the

1565
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:02,160
board typically deals with all that and

1566
00:52:01,119 --> 00:52:05,040
we were able to

1567
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:06,399
essentially avoid that this year we do

1568
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:09,279
have something special

1569
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:10,000
planned there is something uh in the

1570
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:13,440
works that

1571
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:15,520
certain folks may or may not receive but

1572
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:17,359
as far as we're all concerned right now

1573
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:19,759
there was zero cost to any of that and

1574
00:52:17,359 --> 00:52:22,480
whatever i'm talking about doesn't exist

1575
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:23,920
so we were also we didn't have to

1576
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:27,040
pre-purchase

1577
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:28,000
merchandise rather we had our threadless

1578
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:30,400
store which i'm gonna

1579
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:32,000
talk to talk about right after this and

1580
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:35,200
because of that store

1581
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:38,000
we were able to allow on-demand

1582
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:39,040
purchasing and dust printing for stuff

1583
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:42,319
and because of that

1584
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:43,119
we didn't have to bulk purchase x number

1585
00:52:42,319 --> 00:52:44,480
of shirts

1586
00:52:43,119 --> 00:52:46,319
and keep in mind even just when you're

1587
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:49,440
selling shirts at a conference

1588
00:52:46,319 --> 00:52:52,079
you don't buy 500 shirts you buy x

1589
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:53,920
number of a hundred in every size and in

1590
00:52:52,079 --> 00:52:55,280
every model if you will right men's and

1591
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:59,200
women's and children

1592
00:52:55,280 --> 00:53:02,319
that adds up the badges

1593
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:05,279
the pre-purchasing merchandise and oops

1594
00:53:02,319 --> 00:53:06,160
excuse me and the art those are massive

1595
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:08,480
expenditures

1596
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:10,078
for us and we were able to avoid that

1597
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:11,920
this year now we're not going to be able

1598
00:53:10,079 --> 00:53:13,359
to avoid it completely next year

1599
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:15,040
but it's something that allowed us this

1600
00:53:13,359 --> 00:53:17,040
was essentially a recovery year

1601
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:18,240
for us so while certain organizations

1602
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:20,558
were losing money

1603
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:22,160
cactus con going virtual allowed us to

1604
00:53:20,559 --> 00:53:24,720
get out of the red

1605
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:26,399
and be into a good place now what are

1606
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:28,879
these things going to cost for us

1607
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:30,319
next year we really have no idea we're

1608
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:32,079
not sure what to expect

1609
00:53:30,319 --> 00:53:33,920
um badges aren't even designed yet of

1610
00:53:32,079 --> 00:53:34,400
course but i mean just parts wise like

1611
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:38,000
what's

1612
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:41,280
i don't know um but we also were able to

1613
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:43,040
avoid um spending money on gas to drive

1614
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:44,160
places because we just we all just hung

1615
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:47,279
out here together

1616
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:50,078
so easy enough overall we

1617
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:50,800
are finally out of the red we are

1618
00:53:50,079 --> 00:53:54,400
extremely

1619
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:58,000
appreciative of all of the folks

1620
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:58,400
who uh donated to cactus con and we will

1621
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,480
have

1622
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:02,400
very specific information once we know

1623
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:03,440
exactly what all of our venue fees are

1624
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:05,920
going to be

1625
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:07,680
for next year but it looks like we're

1626
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:10,559
not necessarily going to be in

1627
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:11,040
a place where we have to spend our own

1628
00:54:10,559 --> 00:54:12,800
money

1629
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:14,400
then to even just reserve that we're

1630
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:17,280
we're good we're fine

1631
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:18,960
and that's an awesome feeling so let me

1632
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:19,760
just zero for a second sorry i want to

1633
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:21,839
clarify we

1634
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:23,359
we're not really ever been in the red

1635
00:54:21,839 --> 00:54:25,200
right cash flow

1636
00:54:23,359 --> 00:54:27,359
works a little different right in the

1637
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:28,558
sense that you have earnings from one

1638
00:54:27,359 --> 00:54:30,160
that go into the other

1639
00:54:28,559 --> 00:54:31,920
and one of the things that's happened to

1640
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:33,520
your point before and i'll i'll sort of

1641
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:35,760
simplify it is that

1642
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:36,720
when we make reservations for a physical

1643
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:38,400
venue

1644
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:40,319
especially because we wanted to move it

1645
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:41,839
to the beginning of each year we have to

1646
00:54:40,319 --> 00:54:43,520
get reservations

1647
00:54:41,839 --> 00:54:44,880
over multiple years and we have to put

1648
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:46,799
deposits into it

1649
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:47,920
which in the past we didn't necessarily

1650
00:54:46,799 --> 00:54:50,160
pay for right

1651
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:52,160
we collected money exclusively and

1652
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:53,118
solely for the purpose of investing into

1653
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:55,200
each year

1654
00:54:53,119 --> 00:54:56,960
and the moment that we started planning

1655
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:58,480
multiple years out in advance of course

1656
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:59,119
it meant we needed more money so there's

1657
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:01,359
always

1658
00:54:59,119 --> 00:55:03,119
this sort of lag where there might have

1659
00:55:01,359 --> 00:55:04,880
been some deposits that were due from

1660
00:55:03,119 --> 00:55:06,880
one season to the next but

1661
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:08,720
never been in the red let's be clear

1662
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:10,799
about that we've been able to pay all of

1663
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:13,359
our bills and we've been actually

1664
00:55:10,799 --> 00:55:14,000
you know ahead of that game because we

1665
00:55:13,359 --> 00:55:16,078
are

1666
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:18,000
doing everything virtual this year we're

1667
00:55:16,079 --> 00:55:20,559
actually in a much better position

1668
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:21,440
to sort of prepay for some of the things

1669
00:55:20,559 --> 00:55:23,599
in the past

1670
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:24,799
to your point which is like if we want

1671
00:55:23,599 --> 00:55:26,640
to have t-shirts

1672
00:55:24,799 --> 00:55:28,720
at the venue we have to buy them all

1673
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:30,160
before and then we can sell them there

1674
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:32,160
and so there's sort of that lag that

1675
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:33,759
happens with it because this is all

1676
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:35,200
virtual and because you could just order

1677
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:36,480
it online et cetera

1678
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:37,839
there's no reason for us to have

1679
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:38,720
pre-purchased some of those things

1680
00:55:37,839 --> 00:55:40,319
because

1681
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:42,640
it wouldn't have changed the experience

1682
00:55:40,319 --> 00:55:43,119
so um the long and short of it is we've

1683
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:44,799
done

1684
00:55:43,119 --> 00:55:45,920
you know i think very well with stuff

1685
00:55:44,799 --> 00:55:46,880
and we're actually really well

1686
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:49,440
positioned

1687
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:50,319
to come into 2022 to do what we wanted

1688
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:52,559
to do

1689
00:55:50,319 --> 00:55:53,839
uh you know in person hopefully right as

1690
00:55:52,559 --> 00:55:55,599
we get closer to that

1691
00:55:53,839 --> 00:55:58,400
it just means we get to do more right

1692
00:55:55,599 --> 00:56:00,640
think um you know better badges or more

1693
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:02,799
investment in other activities

1694
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:03,680
we also look at ways to give this money

1695
00:56:02,799 --> 00:56:05,759
back out too

1696
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:07,279
and so there's continued discussion of

1697
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:08,079
how that money can be leveraged for

1698
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:09,920
things like

1699
00:56:08,079 --> 00:56:11,520
supporting cactus con kids or other

1700
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:13,359
activities and such so

1701
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:15,520
um anyways we're very excited about

1702
00:56:13,359 --> 00:56:16,960
where that's going and excited that uh

1703
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:18,799
you know this thing worked out as well

1704
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:20,480
as we were able to collect this year

1705
00:56:18,799 --> 00:56:22,160
as it puts us in a better position for

1706
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:24,799
the next year and the year prior next

1707
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:24,799
after that so

1708
00:56:27,839 --> 00:56:32,190

it

1752
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:58,000

aluminum or acrylic this one happens to

1757
00:58:04,799 --> 00:58:07,680
be the aluminum one

1758
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:09,440
and you can see it's extremely

1759
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:11,919
reflective but it is

1760
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:12,960
badass and it's really made really

1761
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:15,680
