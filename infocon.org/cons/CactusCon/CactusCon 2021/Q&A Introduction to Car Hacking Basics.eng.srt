day job uh when i say together

11
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,360
work like not different teams like the

12
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:35,440
actual exact team

13
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,399
blackberry security services incident

14
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:38,480
response

15
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:40,079
another shout out hi to blackberry one

16
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,839
of our partners this year

17
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:44,079
so kay and i communicate every day just

18
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:46,640
about

19
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:48,399
um we're going to kick off some actually

20
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,640
i'm going to try first let me

21
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:53,280
let me try something here real quick

22
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,399
survey says

23
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:58,559
never mind we'll get to those prizes

24
00:00:54,399 --> 00:01:01,920
later on all right so um

25
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:03,839
okay i used to fart around with

26
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,280
uh what we call data logging there was a

27
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,920
company called han data

28
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,000
do you ever heard of them yeah they uh

29
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,119
they do the flashing for ecu still i

30
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,600
think actually

31
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:15,119
oh snap okay i didn't know that back in

32
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,880
the day they had a little box they had a

33
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:18,640
couple devices but the most popular was

34
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:21,119
a little box called the hondata

35
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,799
honda logger it was s200 and you would

36
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:24,080
just plug it into your ecu and you

37
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:25,040
usually leave it in your glove box or

38
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,119
whatever

39
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,320
and it would do all kinds of recording

40
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:31,439
um and you could even

41
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:33,039
output like the video to avi and

42
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:34,639
you can have you know the video would be

43
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:37,280
like a attack speedo

44
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:39,040
uh fuel mappings all kinds of fun stuff

45
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,119
and then you could overlay that

46
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,479
with a camera in the car i don't know if

47
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:45,600
we actually had gopros

48
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:48,079
back then in like 99 2000

49
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,720
but uh they had an extended license that

50
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:50,320
you could

51
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,920
get by paying for it and we were trying

52
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,798
to crack the software it was my first

53
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,240
time using

54
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:57,759
soft ice uh like seriously like hours a

55
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,719
day i was trying to crack it i never did

56
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:01,920
by the way

57
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:03,600
that sucks but uh yeah so i'm really

58
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,640
interested in the general car hacking

59
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,158
stuff

60
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,080
thank you so much for showing us all

61
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:09,200
that um how did you originally get into

62
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,480
this

63
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:12,958
um oh i've always been kind of into cars

64
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,480
and so

65
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:16,400
it was kind of a national math

66
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,440
progression as i got into cyber security

67
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,599
stuff

68
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:21,359
um i got bored one day and i was like

69
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:24,319
okay let's just hook up

70
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,360
my laptop to the car and see what

71
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:28,079
happens

72
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,480
um it was part of i just did a workshop

73
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,160
at

74
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:32,879
campus as part of like some of the

75
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:34,239
things i do on campus but um

76
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:35,840
yeah i basically just got bored i was

77
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:36,879
like all right this is a thing i know

78
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:40,560
it's a thing because i've

79
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:44,399
seen it before let's do it

80
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:47,280
let's dive in i like it my favorite part

81
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,640
of of all of it um is the virtual

82
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,040
instrument cluster

83
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,920
i love that just like let's just emulate

84
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,760
the damn thing

85
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:55,119
i think that was really really cool do

86
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,959
you perhaps have any

87
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:59,440
like recordings with a whole bunch of

88
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:00,879
instruments in a

89
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:03,040
video somewhere recording that someone

90
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:05,840
could check out i

91
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:07,120
don't unfortunately well no pressure you

92
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,959
know what i'm saying

93
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,879
i want to see it i'm sure others want to

94
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:13,200
see it too that'd be really cool

95
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:14,319
uh we were just talking off stream about

96
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,000
uh can bus

97
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:17,518
and whether it's required or not

98
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,720
essentially because so many people

99
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:23,040
you know abide by the protocol and uh

100
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:24,560
obd2 obviously being mandatory and i

101
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,519
remember the first time we went for a

102
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:29,200
smog check

103
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:30,640
as a family and rather than a sensor on

104
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,920
your exhaust they were just like all

105
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,440
right get out of the car and they just

106
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,119
you know open your kick panel and just

107
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,680
boop just plug it you know plug it in

108
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,080
and

109
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:39,440
pick up all your stuff and i remember

110
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,640
thinking to myself well that's really

111
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:43,359
that seems really easy

112
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:45,679
like i wonder and yeah it is easy yeah

113
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:47,599
you can get all kinds of fun stuff

114
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:50,640
what uh what's your favorite see you

115
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:52,159
listed like the elm 327 and the cantack

116
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,679
what's your favorite device to play

117
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:57,439
around what's your go-to

118
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:58,959
uh the cantact that's so i i carry elm

119
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:00,879
for like basic engine codes and stuff

120
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:02,239
but the contact is like

121
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:03,599
if you're like me you're lazy and you

122
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:05,040
just want something that works you get

123
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:07,359
the contact

124
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:09,519
if you have an arduino laying around get

125
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:12,080
the seat shield and it'll work

126
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:14,080
um there's less sort of upfront cost if

127
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:16,319
you already have the arduino in there at

128
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,319
home

129
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,079
yeah i was actually going to ask if

130
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:21,440
there are any custom build projects

131
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:23,280
um you know stuff where maybe you could

132
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,160
buy the parts from digikey or something

133
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,919
like that

134
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,199
but i guess technically the arduino that

135
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:28,479
would be the way to go right to throw a

136
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:30,000
shield on it like

137
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:31,840
you can do that the contact and the

138
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,199
usual contact that area is actually open

139
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,960
source so like all the

140
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:36,960
diagrams in the pcb and what you need to

141
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,758
buy is all out there on a github um if

142
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,239
you look it up

143
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:41,440
i will pop a link into the talks q a

144
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,280
channel in a bit

145
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:46,400
but that's all open source hardware

146
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:48,559
which is great it's all open source

147
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:51,520
that's cool i like that i'm going to

148
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:54,840
check the q a chat

149
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:56,400
have you heard of or played with a car

150
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:59,599
loop no

151
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:01,359
i have not i'm just doing a quick google

152
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:04,000
real fast i haven't i don't recall

153
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,000
hearing of it

154
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,919
that question comes from one of the the

155
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:10,560
community's

156
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:12,320
general uh car hacking enthusiast that i

157
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:15,360
used to work with for a couple years

158
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:17,599
oh man now i'm wondering i'm pretty sure

159
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:20,560
he's gonna be

160
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,520
let's talk it's i feel like there's a

161
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,440
couple other

162
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:25,520
kits that are similar to this car lead

163
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:28,400
thing i can't think of any names off the

164
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,400
top of my head though

165
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:42,479
can't say i have unfortunately

166
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:44,400
okay so any any lasting thoughts any

167
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:47,280
anything you want to leave us with in in

168
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:48,719
terms of general car hacking or you know

169
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,320
how people can really get involved

170
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,639
community kind of stuff

171
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,919
um if you look up open garages i think

172
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:56,080
it's kind of a hard thing with code

173
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:58,560
right now but um open garages there's

174
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,599
some areas where they have meetups for

175
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,400
car hackers

176
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:04,840
uh there's not locally for me but if you

177
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:07,520
look up i believe it's just

178
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:10,159
opengarages.org

179
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:12,000
no maybe it's not um it is

180
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,199
opengrudges.org it's just being weird

181
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,440
for me about loading

182
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:19,680
um you can find a place where people

183
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:21,600
do this for fun you know sometimes they

184
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,280
rent out like a space in a shop like a

185
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,319
bay or they do it at someone's house or

186
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:27,758
whatever but

187
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:27,759
there are like meetups for this

188
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:32,080
um i see there's one listed here for

189
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:35,840
hacker dojo in santa clara california

190
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,840
that's uh

191
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,520
i don't see anything listed there in

192
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,800
arizona but this i'm not sure if this is

193
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:46,080
the official directory or not

194
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:49,280
start one up right

195
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:51,599
um i don't know how long how

196
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,960
off may 2020 so that is a fairly recent

197
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:56,000
page if you're on the

198
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:59,039
the wiki type but um

199
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:03,360
yeah definitely

200
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:05,039
if you want to start one go for it um

201
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,560
make sure you have spare money for a car

202
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:08,719
if you break yours

203
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,759
that's stopped me from doing it i'm a

204
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,039
college student

205
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:14,840

206
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:17,759
like maybe i'll not do it on my real

207
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:19,840
