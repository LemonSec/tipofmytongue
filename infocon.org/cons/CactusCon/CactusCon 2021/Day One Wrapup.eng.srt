00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,800
okay we get it dude

hanging out with us today

9
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,119
this was the culmination of a lot of

10
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,880
work

11
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:28,240
to transition a conference that's been

12
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,759
running for

13
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:32,320
essentially 10 years right this is our

14
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:35,520
ninth cactus con over 10 years

15
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:38,239
to a virtual platform um i personally

16
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,280
i think that it went really really well

17
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:42,399
compared to what

18
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:44,160
could have happened so thank you thank

19
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:46,000
you thank you so much uh

20
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,120
to my cohorts on the screen right now

21
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,440
with me is there anything you want to

22
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:52,239
just throw out in terms of

23
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,239
what you saw today

24
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:57,440
no not even a little bit

25
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,719
that's why we have brought you on so you

26
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:01,440
can just i tried i tried it didn't work

27
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:03,840
okay i tried

28
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,119
all right so the talks all of our talks

29
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,880
went really really well

30
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:09,520
um you know there was some feedback that

31
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,798
we got uh like zoom size on on one of

32
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,640
the the terminals

33
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:13,920
for the the font you know and someone's

34
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,119
saying that they were able to use like

35
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,119
accessibility

36
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:18,880
mode to actually zoom in a little bit it

37
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:21,360
turns out that editing a talk

38
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,000
post production if you will in youtube

39
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,159
um

40
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,400
it's you can use the youtube editor

41
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:28,240
without modifying you know views or the

42
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,280
actual url and so on and so forth but

43
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,399
that's not

44
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,240
what we would need to actually like

45
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,079
overlay something on top we'd have to

46
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,839
like kill the video out

47
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:36,960
and we don't really want to do that so

48
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,960
just make sure you're watching full

49
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:41,039
screen it's definitely legible

50
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,559
um i really really enjoyed the talks

51
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,360
today you know we had a

52
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:47,520
number of submissions you know over i

53
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:50,720
think it was over 50 i believe of

54
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:52,720
talk submissions and we selected 14. our

55
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:54,320
goal was to have a single track

56
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,960
conference aside from the workshops of

57
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,719
course

58
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,640
that was by design and i think the first

59
00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:00,798
day showed that we made some pretty

60
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,719
pretty damn good selections as a team

61
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:05,280
i'm really excited and

62
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:06,000
happy to have those and to have the

63
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,759
first set

64
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,400
of official cactus con videos archived

65
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:14,958
and available yeah yeah i got really

66
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,560
excited there for a second

67
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:17,920
i keep telling people ah i work with

68
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,599
cactus con and they go to youtube and

69
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,640
like there's like two things on there

70
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:22,799
i'm like well we don't

71
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,958

84
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,280
course

85
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:49,518
our sponsors would appreciate it we

86
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,560
didn't necessarily run into any major

87
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:53,280
whoopsies

88
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,640
the one thing that we kind of did occur

89
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,840
that did occur is i believe it was

90
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:58,079
either the first or second

91
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,879
talk during the q a session our stream

92
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,280
died

93
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:03,359
and we're not 100 sure why it died and

94
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:05,200
it actually returned shortly it was down

95
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,000
for what was it felt like two minutes

96
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,319
maybe

97
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,599
if that even yeah not even yeah not even

98
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:11,359
that so that was just

99
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:13,040
one of those uh it's all on the internet

100
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,400
kind of blips i don't know luckily it

101
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,879
wasn't you know something crazy we were

102
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,080
like well

103
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:19,840
it's down time oops so that's awesome

104
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:22,319
we did have an issue on the back end

105
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,760
with our streaming server so we set up a

106
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:26,399
server in the cloud

107
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:27,120
for redundancy and so things like um the

108
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,159
following

109
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:32,480
didn't occur and uh one of

110
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:34,399
our streaming box a big beefy bad boy

111
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,440
with gpu enabled you know the gpu is

112
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,599
just like

113
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:39,040
i'm bored i'm out of here and just took

114
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:40,879
off just took off on us

115
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,640
and it was basically software rendering

116
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:44,079
from there uh luckily

117
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:46,079
it still worked just fine and it's still

118
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:49,599
working right now just fine

119
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:51,519
so um that's cool this is a

120
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:52,959
yeah i'm trying to get another box in

121
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:55,200
the environment it was like oh there's

122
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:57,760
no gpus available now it's like oh

123
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:59,119
uh okay well we were just using one and

124
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,319
and now we need one

125
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,560
like that'd be cool if we could have

126
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:04,000
another one so i won't bust out the

127
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:07,519

00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:28,639
beneficial situation

173
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:30,240

178
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:38,639
email and i wasn't paying attention to

179
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:40,000
email and it was like hey we want to

180
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,680
give this away and it took like three

181

emails for me to finally see it

182
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,039

in-kind sponsors

193
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,960
i'm gonna start actually with offensive

194
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:09,520
security because there were giveaways

195
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,479

196
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:14,000
the ctf for offensive security so we

197
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:16,960
will be discussing those

198
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,039
