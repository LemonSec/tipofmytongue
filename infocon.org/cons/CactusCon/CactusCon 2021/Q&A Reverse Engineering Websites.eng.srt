andrew thank you very much for your talk

6
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:23,840
how's it going

7
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:25,198
uh it's going really well i'm super

8
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,080
excited with the way the last couple

9
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:28,240
days have gone

10
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:30,479
uh for me this is literally the most

11
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:33,440
relaxed cactus con i've ever been to

12
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,880
is because uh you took over for me so

13
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,079
that was awesome

14
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,079
this is actually i think the first time

15
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:40,480
i've even been able to give a talk

16
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:41,440
at the conference except for like one

17
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,839
time we did a

18
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:45,760
sort of keynote panel type of deal where

19
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:47,120
we took the original organizers up but

20
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,640
apart from that i don't think i've ever

21
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,480
actually given a talk

22
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,079
at the conference so it's pretty awesome

23
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,680
to be able to continue to do that and

24
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:56,879
share it back so

25
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:58,640
i'm excited so it's great for folks who

26
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:00,480

yeah so they are at my house uh i as i

79
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,238
mentioned

80
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:45,839
sort of during the opening yesterday i'm

81
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:48,720
super excited about it so

82
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,680
xlogic was a gentleman who lived here in

83
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,519
phoenix

84
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,360
at the time i think he worked at a sock

85
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:55,599
and he may still work at a sock

86
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,200
uh he's been sort of integrated in the

87
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:57,760
conference back when we were b-sides in

88
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,679
fact i

89
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:01,440
i sort of begged him last minute because

90
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,680
he had just given a talk

91
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:05,359
at one of the local community groups the

92
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,000
night before a couple nights before i

93
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,599
said look

94
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,040
our speaker backed out or he'd have a

95
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:10,238
spot i don't know what to do and he was

96
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:13,040
like i got you

97
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:14,720
and uh jumped in he's been given a talk

98
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,359
pretty much ever since then along with

99
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:17,599
uh

100
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,480
with joe uh grown i always have to say

101
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:20,319
that because

102
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,679
i guess mad if i don't remember you know

103
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:24,399
call him out too but

104
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,840
um xlogix has done such an awesome job

105
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,920
like he gives these great talks on like

106
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,599
steganography and like very deep

107
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:31,679
technical things i think one time he did

108
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:34,879
the whole presentation in a

109
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:37,040
in a console right so like

110
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:38,480
who does that it's awesome and uh this

111
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,480
is a book he wrote about

112
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:42,720
um i wanna say it's a game he created is

113
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,798
that right uh but it's a book he created

114
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,239
uh in a bootloader and it's uh pretty

115
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:48,239
interesting to check it out

116
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:49,760
so i got him i reached out to him and

117
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:50,480
said hey you know could you autograph

118
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,000
these

119
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,760
i saw you put out the book and he was

120
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,400
like absolutely so we've got a bunch

121
00:03:53,760 --> 00:04:00,159
here to

122
00:03:54,400 --> 00:04:03,439
to give away for folks so cool

123
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:04,959
awesome cool man well i i really enjoyed

124
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:07,599
your talk and obviously i would say that

125
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:11,040
no matter what if it sucks because

126
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:11,760
because mr cactus gone from no i really

127
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,120
like

128
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,879
i mean honestly it's like a thinking

129
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,798
outside the box style of approach

130
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:17,918
you know a lot of people don't approach

131
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:20,638
systems analysis

132
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:21,198
in in that manner quite honestly i think

133
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:23,440
it was

134
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:24,720
speaking to you at uh it was after one

135
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:28,320
of the cactus cons

136
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:29,840
and we were no it's a lie it was 2017.

137
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:32,719
you were just asking me to be part of

138
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:34,880
the cp cfp board for the first time

139
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,639
and you went on one of your andrew rants

140
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:38,000
right after so i was all elated because

141
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:39,520
i was like oh i'm going to be involved

142
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
with the actual conference you know i

143
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,359
didn't

144
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,199
didn't know this was going to be a thing

145
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,800
obviously right at that time but

146
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:46,800
i was really excited and then you went

147
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:49,520
on an andro rant and it was like a solid

148
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:51,120
30 minutes and i it's been a while you

149
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:53,198
and i have interacted on just you know a

150
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,919
topological more cactus connie kind of

151
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:55,360
stuff

152
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:57,359
and i was mentioning to some folks it's

153
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:59,120
like when you have a deep conversation

154
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,479
with someone and you realize holy crap

155
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,120
the way that they approach things the

156
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:02,960
way that they

157
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,800
view things there's a lot of

158
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,080
intelligence behind it you know and then

159
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,600
you really respect them and then you

160
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:09,199
forget all that crap and you just hang

161
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,800
out and drink or whatever right

162
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:13,120
and then they do some other thing you're

163
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:16,080
like oh yeah i forgot about

164
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:17,120
that we're you know where do you when

165
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,800
did you first start

166
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,160
you know positing that way when it just

167
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,400
became

168
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:24,000
you know your method of review your

169
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,320
method of your approach

170
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,840
how long has that taken to hone if you

171
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:31,440
will

172
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:34,479
oh man uh so i started pen testing

173
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:38,000
probably in 2010

174
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:40,240
11 roughly right and i had this

175
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,080
this interesting job where i got a lot

176
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,880
of engagements in a row i think i

177
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:45,280
probably

178
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,479
would do over 50 tests in a year right

179
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,719
so every quarter we were

180
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:49,919
we were basically cracking through maybe

181
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,400
10 12 13

182
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:54,080
engagements um and so with that you kind

183
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:56,239
of have a lot of opportunity to

184
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:57,280
to try to figure out speed and

185
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,720
expeditious

186
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:00,318
right how do you go through that sort of

187
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,000
volume what do you do

188
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:03,680
and i kind of went through this this

189
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,080
very normal phase that i think is

190
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,520
predictable for pen testers where you

191
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,960
know you first want to learn everything

192
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,840
about the vulnerabilities you want to

193
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,680
have this like

194
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:13,679
sort of broad base of knowledge and then

195
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,720
you try to like automate as much of it

196
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,199
as you can

197
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:19,120
you sort of uh come up with a repeatable

198
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:21,680
pattern and a process for you

199
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:23,360
and what's interesting about it is uh

200
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,680
not only is that really good and

201
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:27,120
great for like a beginning pen test uh

202
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,400
it gets boring really fast i think

203
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,600
anybody who's done it

204
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,280
after a while it sort of feels like

205
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,960
you're just sort of repeating over and

206
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,559
over again the same thing

207
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,080
and so then i started going like now

208
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,039
that i have this time because i've

209
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,719
gotten

210
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:40,639
faster and i have more time to think

211
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:42,160
about the problem of the app and and

212
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:44,319
what they've probably done

213
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,840
you know how do i explore some of the

214
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:47,120
areas you can't automate how do i get

215
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,799
into the things that you can't

216
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:51,039
necessarily get into and i say

217
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,240
i'd say once i transitioned out of that

218
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:54,240
company into

219
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,520
stack and load now bishop fox which is

220
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:58,240
the same company right

221
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:58,799
um we went from like 50 engagements a

222
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,639
year

223
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,479
to really only being on one engagement

224
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:04,319
at a time right and so you get that the

225
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:06,639
pace you get to really dig in

226
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:07,360
i'd say probably within the first year

227
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:09,759
or so

228
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,120
i kind of dialed this process down into

229
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:13,680
something that i could do

230
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:15,280
um it's taken me a while before i've

231
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,000
been able to speak about like it and

232
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,599
teach it to other

233
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,840
people and show them you know it's

234
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:21,199
because like i'm i've been a developer

235
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,400
for so long i don't know what people

236
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:24,639
know or don't know i can't

237
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:26,000
say like what do you see and not see and

238
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:27,759
it came from a lot of like

239
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,440
discussion and conversation with

240
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:32,800
everybody so um

241
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:34,479
it's good yeah cool man well

242
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:37,039

243
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:39,039
sit here and just wax idiotic for
