48
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:08,160
hello cactus con welcome to

49
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,759
personal branding safely i'm going to

50
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:12,239
teach you how to protect yourself from a

51
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:14,640
world of creeps and criminals

52
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:16,480
as you go through your personal branding

53
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,319
journey

54
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:20,238
so i've been doing this for a long time

55
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:23,200
and i study

56
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:26,879
intelligence gathering and operational

57
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:29,760
security and privacy and surveillance

58
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:30,480
i've been building my personal brand for

59
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,760
about

60
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:36,480
five years ish between writing

61
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:37,200
speaking teaching contributing to

62
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,440
articles

63
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,799
things like that so i've experienced

64
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,959
this process myself

65
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,840
and i practice what i teach and you can

66
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:47,840
find my full bio at

67
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:49,760
architectssecurity.org

68
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,840
personal brands are really important for

69
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:54,399
a sense of self

70
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,360
figuring out who you are and what your

71
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:59,040
place is

72
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:02,080
in the community in the world

73
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:03,920
in your career it's also

74
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,120
a good way to make friends but not just

75
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:08,159
friends but

76
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:12,239
people who become your network

77
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:14,959
people who will help you get jobs and

78
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:17,040
find new opportunities and people that

79
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:18,159
will go to you when they want to work on

80
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,799
a project or they need

81
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:22,319
input or they need advice personal

82
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,959
brands help you stand out from the crowd

83
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:26,720
of course

84
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:28,319
um if somebody

85
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:31,200
has no personal brand and they just

86
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:36,798
exist in the world that's perfectly fine

87
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:40,399
but having a personal brand is going to

88
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:42,239
make it so that people will come to you

89
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,879
rather than you going to them in many

90
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:45,599
cases

91
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:46,399
and the best part in my opinion because

92
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:47,840
i was always

93
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,680
uncomfortable with this is that you'll

94
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,200
know exactly what to say when people say

95
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:54,080
like who are you and what do you do

96
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,480
and or introduce yourself to the group

97
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:58,400
so

98
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:58,399
you'll have that down pat

99
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:05,920
uh contributing to the community and

100
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:08,079
the world in general are good things

101
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,280
um it'll definitely get you further in

102
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,599
your career

103
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:14,080
spreading knowledge uh helps protect

104
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:15,760
things that we all rely on every day so

105
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,199
if i share something with somebody and

106
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:20,880
they share something with somebody

107
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:24,320
and it ultimately impacts and helps

108
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:26,479
a service that i use that's

109
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:28,400
that's a good thing that's going to be

110
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:30,159
helping lots of people

111
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:32,400
instead of just the company that i work

112
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,400
for

113
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:39,680
it's also good to elevate and encourage

114
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:41,440
others i love talking to people about

115
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:44,639
their careers and what they're looking

116
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:46,639
to do in their projects and other things

117
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:48,000
once you have a personal brand and you

118
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:50,000
start to

119
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,600
to let's say have a lot of followers on

120
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,720
twitter you can help

121
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:57,759
elevate other people and

122
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:59,919
help them be known by uh

123
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:01,520
retweeting them and sharing things about

124
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:03,120
what they're working on and stuff like

125
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,000
that so you can definitely help other

126
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,400
people

127
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,759
it's also challenging um to do these

128
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:10,960
things it takes time

129
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:14,080
it takes patience um

130
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:15,440
it's it's not always easy but um you do

131
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:18,639
have a lot of fun

132
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:21,759
i mean i certainly do and i i've seen

133
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:26,560
um every continent except for two

134
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:26,560
so um hopefully i'll get those soon

135
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:31,758
but before you get going let's get real

136
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:35,039
about

137
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:37,039
some of the things that can happen

138
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:39,840
when you do start to have a personal

139
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:39,840
brand

140
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:45,840
first of all you might have a false

141
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:48,320
sense of security

142
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,679
i hear these quotes a lot from different

143
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:51,199
people like

144
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,039
i don't care about privacy i've got

145
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:56,400
nothing to hide

146
00:05:53,039 --> 00:06:00,159
that's not really true

147
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:03,758
i hate to break it to you but

148
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:06,479
people can still do things

149
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:07,120
that are very negative or hurtful or

150
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:10,960
causing

151
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:14,560
cause problems for you even if you

152
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:18,880
think that everything that you have

153
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:22,000
is meaningless to someone of no value

154
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:24,960
but uh think of the lifelock guy

155
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,520
um he put his uh social security number

156
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,000
on

157
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,560
trucks and billboards and everywhere

158
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,039
he's had

159
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,479
his identity stolen like multiple times

160
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:34,639
and that's like their whole business

161
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:38,960
model so um

162
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:41,440
everybody has uh valuable information

163
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,560
there's uh the opposite um of that is

164
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:45,440
this notion

165
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:46,560
for like i'm a hard target i've done all

166
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:49,680
these things and

167
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:52,000
i'm i operate under an alias

168
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,440
and i have no you know like nobody's

169
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,080
gonna find anything about me

170
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,560
but that becomes a trap because if

171
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:59,758
you're

172
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:01,680
on high alert all the time and um

173
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:05,039
you know it starts to all become noise

174
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:07,440
and you get burned out quickly

175
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:09,120
so giving back to the community is very

176
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,639
important

177
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:14,560
but giving back to the community while

178
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:14,560
protecting yourself is also very

179
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:18,719
important

180
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,599
i don't want to dissuade you with any of

181
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:23,440
these things

182
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:25,520
um i i want you to

183
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:27,120
understand why you need to protect

184
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,960
yourself so

185
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,840
we're going to go through some scenarios

186
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:33,919
and stories and history

187
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:35,520
it's never too late to take steps to

188
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:37,039
protect yourselves from

189
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,560
these things that we're going to talk

190
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:41,120
about

191
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,800
always consider that personal safety is

192
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,240
number one and that includes not only

193
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:47,599
yourself but the people

194
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:51,039
that you care about um and

195
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:53,440
you know people around you

196
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:54,960
so we're going to go through some things

197
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,000
that

198
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,318
are going to be a little bit

199
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,879
uncomfortable i don't want to scare you

200
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,520
off

201
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:03,360
because after we talk about these i'm

202
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:05,280
going to teach you how to take specific

203
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:08,879
actions to protect yourself

204
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:10,318
so that you can go forth and be awesome

205
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:12,240
so like i said first i'm going to scare

206
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:14,240
you a little i'm sorry

207
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:17,199
but we have to understand what we're

208
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,199
protecting against

209
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:22,639
so what is doxing the word doxing first

210
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,960
emerged in the 90s hacker community

211
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:26,160
where

212
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,878
anonymity was sacred so posting

213
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,800
documents

214
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:30,720
or dropping documents that reveal the

215
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,399
legal name of a person who had only been

216
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:35,440
known by an alias was

217
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:38,240
a pretty cruel act docs became

218
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:39,440
dox which in turn lost the drop and

219
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,360
became a verb

220
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:43,360
in and of itself occasionally being

221
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,760
written with an extra x

222
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:47,600
as doxing which i personally like to use

223
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:50,319
because there's so few words with double

224
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,320
x's in them

225
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:57,600
celebrity boxing is a pastime

226
00:08:54,480 --> 00:09:01,680
of some people and uh something that

227
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:05,040
uh the public often likes to

228
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:07,599
see uh in some cases so

229
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:09,360
by weapon professional information let's

230
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:12,000
talk about the march 2013

231
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,600
mass celebrity doxing um it included all

232
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,440
kinds of personal and financial

233
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:19,360
information

234
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:21,600
of many celebrities dozens of victims

235
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,720
for instance lady gaga her social

236
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:26,240
security number

237
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:28,720
and credit report were leaked however

238
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:29,440
this is rather interesting in 2011

239
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,399
information

240
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:33,519
on thousands of her fans were leaked so

241
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:36,560
it wasn't just her

242
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:38,399
but it was also people who i mean in

243
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:40,479
theory she cares about her fans she

244
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:42,800
doesn't want her fans to

245
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,160
get her i assume i mean you know you

246
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:48,800
want to have fans

247
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:51,360
so um so protecting your information

248
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:54,079
is in some cases protecting other

249
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:56,880
people's information

250
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,279
scarlett johansson uh was unlucky enough

251
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,600
to

252
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:00,480
have nude photos leaked in addition to

253
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:04,079
this um

254
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:07,279
she described it as devastating

255
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:10,079
and said that i quote

256
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:13,839
i felt like it's such a degrading and

257
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:13,839
awful thing to have to go through that

258
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,640
the gamergate movement led to the

259
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:20,560
harassment of many women gamers and

260
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:23,360
developers with multiple prominent

261
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:25,760
female gamers being boxed and harassed

262
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:28,560
felicia day

263
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:29,120
amazing in mystery science theater 3000

264
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:32,640
reboot

265
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:35,200
and loved the guild anyway

266
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:36,959
she said i have tried to retweet a few

267
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,560
of the articles i've seen dissecting the

268
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:40,560
issue in support but personally i'm

269
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:42,000
terrified to be doxed for even typing

270
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,839
the words gamergate

271
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,519
i've had stalkers and restraining orders

272
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:46,560
issued in the past i've had people show

273
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:48,560
up on my doorstep

274
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:51,199
even when my personal information was

275
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,199
hard to get

276
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:56,800
so some other high profile targets you'd

277
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:59,359
think that these people would

278
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:00,160
you know have people to help lock down

279
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,240
their lives

280
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:04,640
but we realize no one is really safe

281
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,320
from doxing

282
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:08,000
so we have to take steps to defend

283
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:10,079
ourselves as much as possible

284
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,880
and then be ready in case it happens and

285
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:12,880
know what to do

286
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:18,079
so who does this who would possibly do

287
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:21,120
this to another human

288
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:23,279
well activists and activists um

289
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:25,360
so the term docs entered mainstream

290
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:28,640
public awareness through media attention

291
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:32,000
attracted by anonymous in december 2011

292
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:35,120
they exposed information of 7 000

293
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,800
law enforcement officers and in 2014

294
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:40,160
they began releasing identities

295
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:44,640
of members of the kkk

296
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:47,760
in recent news uh early january 21

297
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:49,839
21 uh hacktivists released information

298
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:52,560
about users of far-right discussion

299
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:56,079
forum parlor including locations photos

300
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:58,800
places and videos

301
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:59,279
um they also had usernames and real

302
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,120
names

303
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:03,120
and links to the posts and videos and

304
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,839
they mapped them out as you can see in

305
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:11,120
the background

306
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:13,920
of this slide

307
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:15,920
following the april 2013 boston marathon

308
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:17,519
bombing vigilantes on reddit wrongly

309
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:20,639
identified a number of people

310
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:22,320
as suspects including sunil tripathi

311
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:24,000
a student reported missing before the

312
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:28,399
bombings took place he was not

313
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,399
guilty but was the subject of a manhunt

314
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:34,399
journalists also do this in 2016 fox

315
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:36,399
business news anchor lou dobbs revealed

316
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:38,399
the address and phone number of jessica

317
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:41,279
leeds one of the women who accused trump

318
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:44,480
of inappropriate sexual advances

319
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:46,320
and in 2016 also political editor

320
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:48,079
michael hirsch resigned after publishing

321
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,639
the home address of white nationalist

322
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:52,239
richard b

323
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:56,639
spencer on facebook

324
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:59,440
sometimes you made docs yourself

325
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:00,959
i i had the original paper version of

326
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:03,760
this in 2017

327
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:04,160
uh from the aaa road association and i

328
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,680
cut

329
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:07,439
i actually cut it out of the paper

330
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:10,239
because i i thought it was

331
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:12,079
really funny um so he gave away a ton of

332
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:14,000
personal information in this

333
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:15,359
interview what was your first car is

334
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,000
that not one of those

335
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:20,800
like uh you know security personal

336
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:24,079
security questions that they ask

337
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:27,120
when you set up an account like also

338
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:30,079
your first job mcdonald's we got it

339
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:31,040
okay so if he's using those real answers

340
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:34,719
to

341
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:35,839
the security questions we could possibly

342
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,680
get into

343
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:39,279
his accounts or some of his accounts or

344
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:42,880
something so

345
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:46,240
you know sometimes uh we inadvertently

346
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:50,079
uh expose ourselves and other people can

347
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:50,079
inadvertently exposed things about us

348
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:54,320
ripped from today's headlines helena

349
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,000
duke was

350
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,680
told by her mother last year that she

351
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,120
was no longer welcome in her home

352
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,839
because she participated in a black

353
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:03,839
lives matter

354
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:03,839
rally

355
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:09,120
her mother a trump supporter warned her

356
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:11,040
she was exposing herself to violence at

357
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,560
the blm event

358
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:15,519
after the attempted insurrection at the

359
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:18,800
u.s capitol helena identified her mother

360
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:21,920
aunt and uncle and outed them on twitter

361
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:25,040
so angry children can certainly be

362
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:28,399
a threat angry parents as well uh

363
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:30,560
january 25th 2021 it's been a busy year

364
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:32,720
ex-counselor trump posted a topless

365
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:35,040
picture of her daughter claudia 16

366
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:36,000
on twitter of course since claudia's a

367
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,760
minor this is

368
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,480
considered child pornography and

369
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:41,199
kellyanne could and should face criminal

370
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:44,240
charges

371
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:46,160
just for having such a photo but anyway

372
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:47,600
conway's account shared an image of her

373
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:49,600
topless teenage daughter

374
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:51,440
the post was removed but not before

375
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:53,680
twitter users documented it

376
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:56,160
once it's out there it's out there

377
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:58,880
forever

378
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:59,439
some other threats people with grudges

379
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:02,480
um

380
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:03,199
maybe uh somebody didn't like you in

381
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:05,360
high school

382
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:07,199
or um people who just don't like you in

383
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,639
general um

384
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:10,639
people who are jealous of you of your

385
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:11,839
success of your station in life of your

386
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:15,199
good looks

387
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:17,600
of your repertoire of uh of

388
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:19,040
articles that you've written um people

389
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:21,040
who don't like you for

390
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:22,560
stupid reasons like race or religion or

391
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:25,279
gender identity

392
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:26,719
there's also people just want attention

393
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:30,079
and whether it's negative

394
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:32,800
or positive and in this case negative um

395
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:34,000
you know they just will do it for the

396
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,519
laws

397
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,839
um and then there's people of course

398
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:39,839
that do it because

399
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:41,120
um they don't know any better and they

400
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:42,639
don't know why it's dangerous

401
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,800
and so they share things that they

402
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:47,120
shouldn't

403
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:48,000
basically anyone who has data online is

404
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,959
theoretically

405
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,839
at risk of doxxing some people are docs

406
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:54,000
without warning or without doing

407
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:57,199
anything

408
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:59,920
but people who are in the public eye

409
00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:01,199
for example people with personal brands

410
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:06,560
may be at higher risk

411
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:06,560
for for doxing and related activities

412
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:13,279
so docs and sources are generally legal

413
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:15,279
uh info is obtained using open source

414
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:17,600
intelligence or osint

415
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:18,480
and that includes internet records like

416
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,279
uh the

417
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:22,320
information in a who is look up or a

418
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:25,360
wayback machine

419
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:28,000
looking at the history of pages

420
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:30,399
social media is probably the number one

421
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,839
place that people find things

422
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:33,600
there's also these people search

423
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:36,639
directories and

424
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:38,800
you can it's like find anyone and um you

425
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:41,040
pay a little bit of money and you can

426
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,920
get a full credit report on on

427
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:45,040
background check

428
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:46,719
and whatever on on a person um

429
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:48,800
and if they're willing to pay you know

430
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,720
it's not that expensive to get access to

431
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:53,279
these things

432
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:54,880
website logs cookies phishing you know

433
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:57,680
certain types of

434
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:58,079
fairly passive engineering but there's

435
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:00,959
also

436
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:03,279
less legal information gathering tactics

437
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:06,079
which are usually

438
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:08,559
active attacks and these are uh

439
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:08,559
generally

440
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,760
not legal because they're active and not

441
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:13,678
passive

442
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,879
so you know spying on someone

443
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:19,199
eavesdropping on them

444
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:22,720
setting up surveillance these are not

445
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:23,679
legal um and if they are it's a it's a

446
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:26,799
very gray line

447
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:30,400
so um people will

448
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:32,960
sell they'll collect breach data

449
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:34,320
and put it together as an identity and

450
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,919
sell it on the dark web

451
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:38,159
and the more information you have about

452
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:41,280
a person the more money you can

453
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:45,280
get for an identity um that's

454
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:48,399
certainly a way that a an attacker could

455
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:48,879
find information about you identity

456
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,200
theft

457
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:53,360
is an interesting one because it can not

458
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:56,400
only be

459
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:57,120
the result of doxing but it can also be

460
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:01,120
used

461
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:03,678
after getting the identity

462
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:06,719
and to get more information so once you

463
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:09,760
have that established uh fake identity

464
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:12,720
um or stolen identity then you can

465
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:13,760
uh get more info from uh by calling

466
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:16,480
places and

467
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:18,960
and asking for account numbers and

468
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:21,840
things like that

469
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:24,320
so it's so easy because our personal

470
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:26,559
identifiable information or pii

471
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:28,240
can't really be changed i can't change

472
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:28,799
my mother's maiden name i can't change

473
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,720
the first

474
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:33,039
the street i grew up on i can't change

475
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:36,080
my first car

476
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:38,160
but the ability to contact people is

477
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:40,480
easier and easier and especially doing

478
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:44,160
it anonymously

479
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:45,840
makes um impersonation and pretexting

480
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:48,240
and other types of social engineering so

481
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:50,480
much easier because um

482
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:52,000
you can uh you know i can certainly

483
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:55,120
spoof a phone number right now

484
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,320
on my phone and call you as anybody from

485
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:59,600
any number

486
00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:02,320
um spycraftgear is

487
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,879
readily available um location tracking

488
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,879
like

489
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:06,400
like those gps devices you see in movies

490
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:08,080
they put under cars

491
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,679
they're like magnetic and you can track

492
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:12,320
where people go

493
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:13,360
but more than that we over share on

494
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:16,000
social media

495
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:18,159
and we over share on blogs and message

496
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,160
boards and things like that

497
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:22,000
we live stream our lives some people

498
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:25,200
live stream their lives

499
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:27,440
so it's it's sometimes uh easier to get

500
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:31,039
information from the person than from

501
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:31,919
other sources um there's also you know

502
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:33,760
human error

503
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:35,600
and phishing and things like that that

504
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:38,879
we know are a problem

505
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:42,000
um an interesting one is uh digitizing

506
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:45,520
old media so um

507
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:49,520
as like libraries and other uh

508
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:51,840
outlets start to scan their microfilm

509
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:52,720
basically and put it on the internet you

510
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:56,080
can find

511
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:58,320
uh you can find information that might

512
00:19:56,080 --> 00:20:00,480
not have been online previously

513
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:01,678
um things like school newsletters and

514
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:04,400
stuff like that so

515
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:06,080
um it it definitely makes it uh easier

516
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:08,880
to get now

517
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:10,639
so what can happen um well dachshunds

518
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:12,000
can either start with harassment and

519
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:14,559
bullying

520
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,360
so the harassment bullying and then they

521
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:18,480
dox you

522
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:19,439
or someone can dox you and then you can

523
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:22,559
be harassed

524
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:25,760
and bullied um

525
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:29,200
what can an attacker do with data photos

526
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:31,360
um they can either post them and

527
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:33,360
just to embarrass you but they can also

528
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:36,320
extort you

529
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:37,840
to so to pay them or whatever to not

530
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:39,678
leak them

531
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:40,879
um if they have your home address uh

532
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:43,919
they can find you

533
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:48,559
send you malicious things um pii

534
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:51,280
you know identity theft and other um

535
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:52,879
really terrible things financial

536
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:56,080
information fraud

537
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:59,120
tax fraud especially and if they have

538
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:59,120
evidence of a crime

539
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,559
or even if it's just faked evidence of a

540
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:04,799
crime you could be arrested

541
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:05,678
i mean you might get out you know if

542
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:09,120
it's fake i

543
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:10,080
won't face charges but um so stalking is

544
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:13,280
a criminal act

545
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:15,918
but doxing is not always illegal

546
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:17,840
stalking is a crime basically everywhere

547
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:21,200
in the united states

548
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:22,080
um it can be very difficult to find the

549
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:25,280
perpetrator

550
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:27,439
of any of these types of attacks um

551
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:28,559
which is kind of ironic but doxxing is

552
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:32,720
not generally a crime

553
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:36,320
unless the uh obtaining the information

554
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:39,360
involved a crime or if

555
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:43,120
uh it's taxing is done against

556
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:45,840
like jurors and federal employees and

557
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,840
things like that

558
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:50,960
so dachshund can hurt your personal and

559
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:54,080
professional reputation

560
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:54,480
it can humiliate or embarrass depending

561
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:57,600
on

562
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:59,840
what their goal is

563
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,959
it can cause social backlash either on

564
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:04,720
them or

565
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:07,520
on you financial credit trouble

566
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:09,360
once you your identity is stolen i've

567
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,840
just heard so many horror stories about

568
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:12,879
that

569
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:15,199
um i i i

570
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:16,080
it lasts for a long time and it's hard

571
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,000
to deal with

572
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:19,840
um there's also swatting which is false

573
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,200
reporting of incidents such as hostage

574
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:23,039
situations and

575
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,640
the swat team comes in and takes you

576
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:28,640
down it happens a lot with um

577
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:30,880
gamers for some reason like during games

578
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:32,400
but basically the internet is not like

579
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:35,280
court and

580
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:38,400
you are guilty until proven innocent

581
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:38,399
with anything that's posted

582
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:42,159
so what are the ttps of stalking and

583
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:44,960
harassment

584
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:45,600
threats any kind of threats um spreading

585
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:48,159
rumors

586
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:49,199
posting embarrassing pictures and videos

587
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:52,559
um

588
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:55,200
whether it's a a real photo

589
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:56,720
or video a doctored photo or video or

590
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:59,760
even one that might be considered

591
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:02,640
parody like with your face pasted over

592
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:03,280
um something else that is happening and

593
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:05,760
it's

594
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:06,720
you know obviously fake and it's meant

595
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:11,120
to

596
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:13,280
um to denigrate um

597
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:14,879
watching and following spying cameras

598
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:18,879
gps those kinds of things

599
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:22,240
um unwanted calls messages hang ups

600
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:24,880
texts cards letters flowers presents

601
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:25,760
sending pizza to the house to that isn't

602
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:27,440
paid for

603
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:29,679
um you know some of these are some of

604
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:31,360
the less

605
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:33,280
less scary things that can happen i

606
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:35,760
suppose approaching

607
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:36,879
and showing up at somebody's workplace

608
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:39,919
or school

609
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:42,960
or like your favorite coffee shop and

610
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:43,760
um you know just like being somewhere

611
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:46,640
where you

612
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:48,480
don't want them to be things that are

613
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:50,480
posted quickly

614
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:52,320
and widely distributed and there's this

615
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:55,360
concept of internet permanency

616
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:56,240
where um once something is out there

617
00:23:55,360 --> 00:24:00,158
like the

618
00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:03,279
um the like kellyanne's daughter's

619
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:04,480
photo it's out there um unfortunately

620
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:07,520
it's very hard to

621
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:12,480
make things like that go away um so

622
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:18,000
understanding uh and undoing damage

623
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:21,760
may be challenging or impossible

624
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:25,279
victims may face violence or threats

625
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:27,440
um fear anxiety feeling unsafe

626
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:29,120
and it can be really stressful and

627
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:32,640
traumatic and we'll talk a little bit

628
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:36,000
later about how to deal with that um

629
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:37,279
in positive ways so now that i've scared

630
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,000
you

631
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:41,600
um here's an adorable puppy and i hope

632
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,799
you haven't given up yet because i'm

633
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:47,840
going to teach you how to protect

634
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:47,840
yourself from these things

635
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:52,720
your goal is to proactively decrease

636
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:54,480
your risk profile and that's why we're

637
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:56,640
here

638
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:58,400
um you want to be confident that you've

639
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:02,080
done everything you can to protect your

640
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:02,080
personal safety and take on the work

641
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:06,320
so how do we put ourselves out there

642
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:07,840
safely well

643
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:10,879
these are the steps this is your

644
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:14,320
personal risk management program

645
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:17,840
again personal safety is number one

646
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:19,918
got to protect your life then we

647
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:21,600
go and discover what info is out there

648
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:24,240
about us

649
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:25,678
we protect our assets we mitigate and

650
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:28,320
minimize threats

651
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:29,360
and then we monitor for indicators of

652
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:31,120
compromise

653
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:33,439
crimes harassment identity theft those

654
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:36,559
kinds of things we

655
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:37,679
actively defend our privacy as we go

656
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:40,080
forward

657
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:42,559
and we are prepared for the worst and

658
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:45,760
know what to do if it happens

659
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:48,080
so here's how that goes but first a note

660
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:50,320
on pseudonyms and hacker handles

661
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:52,559
they are security through obscurity

662
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:54,480
which we know doesn't work

663
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:55,600
so handles can almost always be tied

664
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:59,039
back to you

665
00:25:55,600 --> 00:26:02,559
don't rely on them for

666
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:02,960
privacy or safety feel free to use them

667
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:05,360
but

668
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:07,919
know that they will be tied back to you

669
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,918
at some point

670
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:13,760
so let's dig deep into ourselves

671
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:19,520
have you ever received a breach

672
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:21,520
notification of course you have

673
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,639
that means that your information is

674
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:25,360
probably

675
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:28,240
available on the dark web or in some

676
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:30,000
database somewhere

677
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:31,840
if you've ever used real answers to

678
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:35,760
security questions

679
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:38,720
that could put you at risk if you

680
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:39,600
have a business or own a home if you've

681
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:42,640
been arrested

682
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:45,120
married divorced anything that has a

683
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:48,799
public record

684
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:51,520
that's out there and it's permanent

685
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:53,279
so if you have your home address listed

686
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:56,320
on your business

687
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:58,559
registration with the state then

688
00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:00,480
people are going to be able to find that

689
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:03,678
so you want to take

690
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:05,039
a look at yourself from the inside using

691
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:07,200
what you know and then

692
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:08,559
take a look at yourself from the outside

693
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,919
pretending you don't know anything about

694
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:12,879
yourself and ideally

695
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:14,720
that step would be done by somebody like

696
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:17,200
a friend of yours or something who could

697
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:19,279
help you out

698
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:20,880
um you have to think like an attacker

699
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:21,760
and look at yourself from a malicious

700
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:24,399
point of view

701
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:24,799
um make sure that as you're doing this

702
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:26,799
uh

703
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:28,559
you're gonna save links to things you

704
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:30,879
think um

705
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:32,840
might be used against you like if you

706
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:34,080
find like an old live journal account or

707
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:36,158
something

708
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:37,600
search for yourself in incognito mode so

709
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:41,279
that you don't have

710
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:43,918
personalized results coming up

711
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:44,880
duckduckgo tour search engines use

712
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:48,000
multiple

713
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:49,679
and search for your pii

714
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,120
look at people search sites so you don't

715
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:53,600
have to pay for any reports unless you

716
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:56,239
really want to

717
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:58,799
find any reviews that you've posted of

718
00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:02,159
places that you frequent or have visited

719
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:05,120
like facebook reviews or google maps

720
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:06,480
or whatever so you're going to basically

721
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:08,559
build a profile of

722
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:10,399
yourself and your online presence and

723
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:11,840
that's your attack surface

724
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:14,080
and then we're going to matigo

725
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:16,399
everything you know about yourself

726
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:17,520
and we'll talk about that later too so

727
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:19,199
essentially you're trying to find out

728
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:22,559
what someone could find out about you

729
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:24,399
before they do so here's a quick ocean

730
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:26,720
tutorial

731
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:29,039
i got permission to do this from dfir

732
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:30,799
science on twitter thank you

733
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:32,720
um there are many paths that you can

734
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:33,440
follow to perform ocean this is just an

735
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:36,240
example

736
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:38,080
in uh some cases if someone is targeting

737
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:40,640
a company they might start with the

738
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:42,879
company's web about page and

739
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:44,159
or their contact page or something like

740
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,679
that linkedin

741
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:47,279
trying to find employees and then

742
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:49,520
drilling down into each one looking for

743
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:52,159
vulnerabilities for spearfishing

744
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:52,960
but here i'm starting with an individual

745
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:56,000
this is like

746
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:59,200
um if i was you know going to uh

747
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,720
stocks or stock or attack a person

748
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:02,320
this is more likely the path that i

749
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:06,640
would take

750
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:09,678
so uh dfir science's twitter page

751
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:11,279
uh has a website

752
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:13,360
at the bottom left you can see in the

753
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:16,720
blue box that

754
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:21,840
i visited and right away i've got a name

755
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:24,880
joshua i james got some links here

756
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:26,080
i did look at the tls certificate to see

757
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:29,200
if there was any

758
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:31,120
useful information uh i did a whois

759
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:33,440
uh search on the domain name and there

760
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:36,959
was no useful information so

761
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:37,520
that was um but i went to the contact

762
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:40,000
page

763
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:41,520
and i looked at both the links paypal

764
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,279
had a photo

765
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:45,320
which you can see here and also a

766
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:48,320
possible username

767
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:51,760
jijus so um

768
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:53,360
i note that down as you know a link

769
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:56,158
there's a piece of information it's a

770
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:58,240
crumb and then i enlarged the photo and

771
00:29:56,159 --> 00:30:00,000
did google reverse image search i found

772
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:02,159
some links

773
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,200
uh the first link was to researchgate

774
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:06,000
and dang

775
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:07,279
joshua has a lot of publications maybe

776
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,679
the doctor is jealous

777
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:11,520
of this you know body of work who knows

778
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:12,399
um so we also have a new connection as

779
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:15,520
soon on the right

780
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:16,479
uh the hallam university i hope i'm

781
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:19,360
pronouncing that correct

782
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:22,080
um in south korea so we we know that

783
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:24,879
these people are connected

784
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:25,760
or that that person in that university

785
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:27,919
so

786
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:30,240
one of the other links from from the

787
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:31,919
reverse image search was a youtube

788
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:34,399
uh the live stream was down there were

789
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:36,880
no videos

790
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:37,600
but i noticed uh there was a separate

791
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:41,120
youtube

792
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:42,158
account uh for dfir science versus for

793
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:43,840
joshua

794
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:46,480
so that indicates there's at least two

795
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:50,320
google accounts and that could be useful

796
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:53,440
later maybe if i was an attacker um

797
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:55,360
linkedin lives in the dc area probably

798
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:57,760
the area not the actual dc

799
00:30:55,360 --> 00:31:00,158
um we've got some employers contacts

800
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:03,519
i've got some mutual connections

801
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:07,120
confirmed it's the same joshua by

802
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:10,000
seeing uh halam university again uh on

803
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:11,840
on this page it's good to confirm that

804
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:14,480
you have the right person

805
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:15,760
so google and the website led to github

806
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:19,840
which has another username

807
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:19,840
j.i james so note that down

808
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:25,519
there's another website that uh

809
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:26,640
you could see the email addresses joshua

810
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:28,799
plus

811
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:29,840
something something something at dfir

812
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:33,200
science

813
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:35,439
so that means that it's probably a

814
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:40,240
catch-all email address

815
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:44,039
which is interesting and could be useful

816
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:45,600
hacker one had another username

817
00:31:44,039 --> 00:31:49,519
j-o-d-j-o-d-o-s-a

818
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:52,080
which could be reused on other sites

819
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:53,679
just some googling i found out um what

820
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:56,879
high school he went to because there was

821
00:31:53,679 --> 00:32:00,080
an article about how amazing he is

822
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:03,039
we can all hope for this um

823
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:03,519
and uh but it also gives us an idea of

824
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:06,720
um

825
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:08,159
the area that he grew up in and there

826
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:11,200
may still be family

827
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:13,279
possibly old friends there and we have

828
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:14,799
his uh right from the google search

829
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:19,200
results the

830
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:20,960
his university email address

831
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:22,799
i went to social catfish which is one of

832
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:25,519
those people search sites

833
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:27,440
i put them in there it looks like the

834
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:30,159
same person

835
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:32,399
as far as i can tell um and for less

836
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:33,360
than six dollars i could have all kinds

837
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:35,120
of information

838
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:37,039
including addresses and phone numbers

839
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:40,959
and whatever's out there

840
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:42,960
so i pulled up malthugo

841
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:44,480
and i'll well there there'll be a link

842
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:46,640
to this later um

843
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:48,880
pulled up maltigo i put in some of the

844
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:52,080
things that i know about them usernames

845
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:54,159
uh email addresses things like that

846
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:56,158
i ran some automated searches within

847
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:59,200
maltigo and i pulled up some of

848
00:32:56,159 --> 00:32:59,679
some other websites it found some links

849
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:03,360
to

850
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:05,279
different emails different websites etc

851
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:07,199
i kept running it on different things i

852
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:07,840
kept running it you run it over and over

853
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:12,080
again

854
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:15,678
and you come up with new and interesting

855
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:16,720
uh pieces of the puzzle so like i said i

856
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:20,399
do this regularly

857
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:23,519
this is me i keep this updated

858
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:25,360
for example uh here you know i have my

859
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:26,799
myself and my email address it links me

860
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:27,760
to boston everybody knows i live in

861
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:31,440
boston

862
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:35,200
um um and it's got my twitter username

863
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:37,200
and uh on the the right image uh it's

864
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,519
got the hashtag that's associated with

865
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:40,640
me

866
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:43,360
and and the website so i can keep

867
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:46,960
digging deeper into all of these things

868
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:48,320
so that's about to go in a nutshell

869
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:50,240
so there's no such thing as perfect

870
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:52,559
security and and we know this

871
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:54,399
um there's no such thing as perfect

872
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:57,279
privacy either

873
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:59,279
um you can't be known and obscure

874
00:33:57,279 --> 00:33:59,760
simultaneously bryce and bort had this

875
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:03,120
great

876
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:05,760
quote um you have to assume

877
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:06,479
that people are going to be able to find

878
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:10,480
you

879
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:14,320
um it's it's just the law of numbers

880
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:16,000
people are going to find you

881
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:17,679
no matter how careful you are and how

882
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:20,879
many precautions uh

883
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:21,520
but you can take steps to to limit the

884
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:24,560
damage

885
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:27,679
that is caused and you can take steps to

886
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:30,078
um to prevent it but it's never going to

887
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:30,079
be 100

888
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:34,800
so really all we can do is stay vigilant

889
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:39,119
do our best try our best

890
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:40,879
and sleep well at the end of the day

891
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:42,399
so here are some things to do before you

892
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:44,319
put yourself out there

893
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:46,319
use catch-all email address for each

894
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:48,720
site like joshua did

895
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:49,839
anonymize usernames for non-social media

896
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:52,719
like banking

897
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:53,679
so my twitter account is at april wright

898
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:56,480
do you think i use

899
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:57,599
april write for my banking username no

900
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:00,800
way

901
00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:02,720
right so uh don't use this don't reuse

902
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:04,880
usernames just like you wouldn't reuse

903
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:07,520
passwords

904
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:09,839
with a password manager it's super easy

905
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:11,520
to keep all these things straight

906
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:13,040
with mfa always try to use a

907
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:17,200
device-based

908
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:19,759
version versus sms or email if possible

909
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:21,118
make sure that your home physical

910
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:24,720
addresses

911
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:24,720
i'm sorry devices are

912
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:29,598
protected like wi-fi and routers and iot

913
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,640
and that they're patched and that kind

914
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:34,160
of thing

915
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:36,560
if you can set up

916
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:37,598
well i have two separate routers that

917
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:39,200
have

918
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:42,720
each have a guest network on a main

919
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:44,799
network so i i went a little crazy but

920
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:46,720
if you can put iot devices on a guest

921
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:50,240
network that only allows

922
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:53,439
outbound connections and doesn't allow

923
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:57,680
device to device lan connections

924
00:35:53,440 --> 00:36:00,000
that would be ideal considering

925
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:02,078
your final your credit report uh credit

926
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,599
freeze or credit lock may be appropriate

927
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:06,960
for you depending on

928
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:09,920
how often you need to um to

929
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:10,880
have someone check your credit i guess

930
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:12,720
make sure you

931
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:14,720
because one is a little harder to turn

932
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:18,000
off um

933
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:18,879
a vpn that has a good track record of

934
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,440
not logging

935
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:22,720
and that's offshore and use it on every

936
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:25,440
device including your phone

937
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:25,439
and your tablets

938
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:29,200
so you've figured out what your online

939
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:32,879
presence looks like

940
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:33,598
so let's clean before you put yourself

941
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:35,119
out there

942
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:37,359
clean up things you found in your risk

943
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:40,480
assessment close the exposure points

944
00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:41,119
um send take down notices and learn how

945
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:44,240
to do this

946
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:46,800
before you need to do this

947
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:48,879
you can you can learn how to do it and

948
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:50,960
may never need it but it's better to

949
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:53,440
know how to do it before you need to

950
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:54,560
so delete posted reviews that you think

951
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:56,640
are

952
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:58,240
potentially exposing things opt out of

953
00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:00,160
the people search sites

954
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:02,959
when you find yourself change your

955
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:06,399
secret questions to random things

956
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:07,200
when you do that it's not like a random

957
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:09,760
password

958
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:11,680
because you may have to say your secret

959
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:13,920
question over the phone one day

960
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:15,200
so if somebody says what's your mother's

961
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:18,560
maiden name and i say it's i

962
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:21,598
j f dollar sign k p whatever

963
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:25,119
it's much harder than saying my mother's

964
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:28,160
maiden name is spongebob table basket

965
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:30,240
um so it's

966
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:31,759
it's it should be something

967
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:35,118
pronounceable

968
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:38,880
but ridiculous and kind of long

969
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:40,400
um so also call your uh mobile provider

970
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:42,720
and have them put a pin on your account

971
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:45,119
to prevent sim jacking

972
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:45,759
change usernames as needed like i said

973
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:48,240
um

974
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:48,800
with uh you know banking versus social

975
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:50,720
media

976
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:52,640
don't reuse them change your phone

977
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:55,919
number um

978
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:59,359
if you want to delete old wi-fi profiles

979
00:37:55,920 --> 00:38:01,680
that you've connected to in your history

980
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:02,720
hide unsubscribe whatever you need to do

981
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:05,598
to

982
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:06,000
to clean up the things that you found

983
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:08,000
you'll

984
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,359
also want to get an alternate physical

985
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:12,480
address so

986
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:16,240
like a ups store

987
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:20,079
address for example or a virtual office

988
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:22,720
as well as a voiceover ip phone number

989
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:24,720
um that you can use that is separate

990
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:27,520
from your cell phone number

991
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:29,680
um get a domain name and an email

992
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:32,800
address at that domain

993
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:34,399
and then change uh your account

994
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:36,480
information on social media and other

995
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:38,400
places where it could be exposed

996
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:40,480
to that information rather than your

997
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:43,280
home information and your person

998
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:44,640
like your actual cell phone number

999
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:46,000
because your voice over ip is going to

1000
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:49,279
forward to your cell phone number

1001
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:51,119
but um you don't want to give out like

1002
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:52,640
i never buy things online with a debit

1003
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:54,240
card for example it's

1004
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:56,078
basically the same thing i never give

1005
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:58,319
out my actual cell phone number i give

1006
00:38:56,079 --> 00:39:00,079
out my voiceover ip number

1007
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:01,920
so another thing i recommend is setting

1008
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:04,720
up your own llc

1009
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:06,400
um you could set up an you can

1010
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:07,520
incorporate if you want but llc's are

1011
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:11,760
super easy

1012
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:15,200
um uh and you and when you do this

1013
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:18,960
it's very important make sure that you

1014
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:20,960
use that separate location and email

1015
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:23,200
and whatever else information they ask

1016
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:26,079
for not your real information

1017
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:27,279
because when you file for an llc

1018
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:30,400
registration

1019
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:32,880
that filing and anything you file with

1020
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:37,760
the state is going to be public record

1021
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:39,520
forever even if you make a correction

1022
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:41,359
so things you should do on social media

1023
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:43,520
limit old posts and remove

1024
00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:45,359
photos that don't have good upset i know

1025
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:49,359
facebook has a feature where you can

1026
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:52,319
basically uh you can limit um

1027
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:53,040
all of your old posts just to private or

1028
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:56,880
whatever

1029
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:59,839
um delete old accounts don't over share

1030
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:01,359
um do privacy checkup on google and

1031
00:39:59,839 --> 00:40:02,400
facebook and twitter and instagram and

1032
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:05,279
all those

1033
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:07,200
um go through your friends list remove

1034
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:08,240
anybody you don't know or talk to or

1035
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:10,160
care about

1036
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:11,279
and create groups for friend types like

1037
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:14,240
i have one for work

1038
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:15,440
and hackers and acquaintances and

1039
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:17,598
neighbors and whatever

1040
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:19,920
but don't rely on them because it's not

1041
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:23,040
a form of access control

1042
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:24,160
really um and maybe create a social

1043
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:26,160
media date of birth

1044
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:27,520
in the same way that you would use the

1045
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:31,040
uh the

1046
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:33,359
um the email the catch-all email

1047
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:35,359
um a lot of people use january 1st i

1048
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:37,279
don't recommend using that

1049
00:40:35,359 --> 00:40:38,880
too many people use it it's too obvious

1050
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:39,599
um so and you can have a separate date

1051
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:42,800
of birth for

1052
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:44,960
like any website basically and just

1053
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:47,680
store it in your password manager

1054
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:50,240
um and like putting your birthday as

1055
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:52,160
public on facebook

1056
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:53,520
i mean if you want to get all those you

1057
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:56,078
know happy birthday

1058
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:57,359
notes that's fine but i recommend making

1059
00:40:56,079 --> 00:41:00,400
it private

1060
00:40:57,359 --> 00:41:03,598
um and probably having it

1061
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:05,200
be not your real birthday um assume

1062
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:07,520
anything posted online can be made

1063
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:07,520
public

1064
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:11,680
so indicators of compromise

1065
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:15,920
new login notifications for important

1066
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:17,520
websites

1067
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:20,240
don't just turn these on make sure you

1068
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:21,680
review them and the last login date if

1069
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:23,520
it's ever shown

1070
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:25,040
you can set up financial notifications

1071
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:27,839
at your bank for anytime

1072
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:29,200
an email address changes or something

1073
00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:31,440
like that

1074
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:32,839
there's free tools that can help you if

1075
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:34,000
your bank doesn't offer good

1076
00:41:32,839 --> 00:41:36,319
notifications

1077
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,839
about like large outgoing payments or

1078
00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:41,200
transfers

1079
00:41:37,839 --> 00:41:43,759
tell the people around you um that

1080
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:45,520
there is a potential threat and what

1081
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:48,960
kinds of things they should look out for

1082
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:49,839
teach them optic set up google text

1083
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:52,079
alerts

1084
00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:53,520
you can do it for like any phrase set up

1085
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:55,200
your name your email

1086
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:57,359
your domain name something like that and

1087
00:41:55,200 --> 00:42:00,480
you'll get a note anytime

1088
00:41:57,359 --> 00:42:01,040
something is posted and credit

1089
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:02,240
monitoring

1090
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:04,240
alerts if you don't have credit

1091
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:08,879
monitoring by now after all the breaches

1092
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:12,000
um get it it's it's very important

1093
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:14,079
identity theft the irs says uh

1094
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,280
that there are three indicators of

1095
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:17,040
compromise um

1096
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:19,599
if more than one tax return was filed

1097
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:20,160
for you if you suddenly owe additional

1098
00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:22,560
tax

1099
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:24,480
or have a refund offset or have had

1100
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:27,839
collection action taken against you for

1101
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:31,760
a year you did not file a tax return

1102
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:33,520
or if uh the irs records indicate you

1103
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:36,560
received wages or other income from an

1104
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:39,280
employer from whom you did not work

1105
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:41,200
so you may be working under your social

1106
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:44,480
security number

1107
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:45,598
so once you've set up you know

1108
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:49,920
notifications

1109
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:49,920
and you've cleaned up your online

1110
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:55,040
what you want to do is practice opsec

1111
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:57,440
so there are some things that you want

1112
00:42:55,040 --> 00:43:00,400
to think about in terms of

1113
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:00,400
home surveillance

1114
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:05,760
these are all based on your risk and

1115
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:09,200
comfortable

1116
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:10,800
comfort with with having monitoring in

1117
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:13,839
your house

1118
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:15,119
it's much easier to break a window than

1119
00:43:13,839 --> 00:43:18,078
to

1120
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:19,119
hack a smart lock but it's also easy to

1121
00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:23,040
pick

1122
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:25,119
a you know standard

1123
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:26,240
tumbler lock so you know you got to

1124
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:29,599
think about these things

1125
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:33,118
in in how they fit into your life

1126
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:34,880
and how you want to um

1127
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:36,240
implement them because it's not going to

1128
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:39,359
be a one size fits all

1129
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:41,200
for everything make sure you don't

1130
00:43:39,359 --> 00:43:44,560
record places like your sofa

1131
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:48,319
and your bed focus on uh like

1132
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:51,200
ingress and egress doors windows um

1133
00:43:48,319 --> 00:43:52,640
garage doors things like that perimeter

1134
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:56,000
um

1135
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:59,680
you know don't have too many interior

1136
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:01,839
facing uh surveillance cameras because

1137
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:03,359
you know it all it takes is you know

1138
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:05,440
walking through your kitchen naked one

1139
00:44:03,359 --> 00:44:08,799
time and

1140
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:10,079
your uh your intro you may expose

1141
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:14,720
yourself so

1142
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:17,680
um uh exif data so um

1143
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:20,319
when a photo is taken by a camera that

1144
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:24,480
has a gps attached

1145
00:44:20,319 --> 00:44:27,520
it will note where the photo was taken

1146
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:30,240
exif data is also used to um

1147
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:32,000
to put in copyrights uh to put in the

1148
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:36,640
name of the person who took the photo

1149
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:40,640
to put in the focal length and the

1150
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:41,118
um the you know lighting and some other

1151
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:42,560
things

1152
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:44,560
like did the flash go off stuff like

1153
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:47,119
that but geotagging

1154
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:48,160
is a way that people can find you these

1155
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:51,359
are exact

1156
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:53,040
lat and long location of

1157
00:44:51,359 --> 00:44:55,520
a place and you can see it just by

1158
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:57,599
looking at the properties of an image

1159
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:59,280
now most social media sites ask if you

1160
00:44:57,599 --> 00:45:01,440
want to tag the location

1161
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:04,560
if you hadn't haven't like explicitly

1162
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:07,760
said no don't ever do this um

1163
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:08,400
and some apps will strip the geotag for

1164
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:11,119
you

1165
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:12,720
um and some message boards and apps do

1166
00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:14,480
not strip the geotags

1167
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:15,919
and everyone with access to that photo

1168
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:19,440
will be able to find the location

1169
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:21,680
very easily there's also metadata in

1170
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:24,319
documents like

1171
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:25,680
word docs and excel and those kinds of

1172
00:45:24,319 --> 00:45:28,480
things

1173
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:30,480
if you just look through the internet at

1174
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:31,920
these kinds of files

1175
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:33,920
you can get a lot of interesting

1176
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:36,319
information usernames phone numbers

1177
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:38,560
things like that

1178
00:45:36,319 --> 00:45:40,560
uh so don't accept friend requests from

1179
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:41,920
strangers and validate people offline

1180
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:43,440
just because they have

1181
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:46,240
three friends in common doesn't mean

1182
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:48,079
that they really know them

1183
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:50,078
um it's not that's not a good enough

1184
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:52,640
vetting um

1185
00:45:50,079 --> 00:45:54,079
warn people not to uh you know share

1186
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:57,040
information about you

1187
00:45:54,079 --> 00:45:58,720
uh again teach them opsec avoid those

1188
00:45:57,040 --> 00:46:01,440
polls and quizzes they're

1189
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:02,720
um they're really there to uh well

1190
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:05,200
advertising but also

1191
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:06,319
to collect personal information um when

1192
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:10,160
you post a

1193
00:46:06,319 --> 00:46:11,759
photo think before you post look at the

1194
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:13,440
photo look in the photograph in the

1195
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:17,040
background is somebody wearing a

1196
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:19,040
work badge is there any identifying

1197
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:22,319
information about where you are

1198
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:24,480
that you wouldn't want to share

1199
00:46:22,319 --> 00:46:25,759
those kinds of things just just think

1200
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:28,240
about the photo

1201
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:30,560
and look at it from all perspectives not

1202
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:34,479
just how does my smile look

1203
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:37,040
before you post it don't rsvp the

1204
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:39,760
physical events like on facebook

1205
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:41,680
and biometrics there's some convenience

1206
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:44,640
trade-offs that you'll need to

1207
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:46,640
think about when you enable them or

1208
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:48,480
disable it

1209
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:49,920
um if somebody asks you where you are

1210
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:53,200
from or what you do for a living

1211
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:54,240
you know i'm april from boston i work in

1212
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:57,279
i.t

1213
00:46:54,240 --> 00:47:00,319
that's all i need to say um

1214
00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:02,480
don't like give too much information

1215
00:47:00,319 --> 00:47:04,800
like you know to your uber driver or

1216
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:07,520
somebody at a bar or a coffee shop

1217
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:09,920
um don't check into places uh virtually

1218
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:12,160
be careful about reviews

1219
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:14,880
if you're really concerned you can vary

1220
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:17,440
your route and your routine

1221
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:19,680
if you use online dating make sure you

1222
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:20,400
use photos that can't be reverse image

1223
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:22,799
searched

1224
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:23,760
so you may need to take some new photos

1225
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:26,640
but um

1226
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:27,680
it's you know it's a small thing to do

1227
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:31,118
for protection

1228
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:31,118
against that um

1229
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:34,800
always be safe when you go out

1230
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:36,000
especially if you're alone

1231
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:38,079
you know if you need to have some sort

1232
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:41,680
of protection or body

1233
00:47:38,079 --> 00:47:43,760
body camera or whatever

1234
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:46,000
you know do what you need to do to be

1235
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:46,000
safe

1236
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:53,839
phones tablets computers uh i would

1237
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:57,119
highly recommend that you

1238
00:47:53,839 --> 00:47:59,119
disable location services um when

1239
00:47:57,119 --> 00:48:00,559
unless it's for like a maps app or

1240
00:47:59,119 --> 00:48:04,480
something like that

1241
00:48:00,559 --> 00:48:07,520
um if

1242
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:09,920
if an app doesn't need the

1243
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:10,880
mic and the camera and the location

1244
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:13,760
disable them

1245
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:14,240
you can always type in your address into

1246
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:17,520
the

1247
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:19,919
um the you know grub hub or whatever

1248
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:22,160
you don't always have to rely on the

1249
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:25,440
automatic feature

1250
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:28,480
and it provides you more privacy

1251
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:31,599
disable geotagging for photos

1252
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:31,599
if you don't need it

1253
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:35,359
look through your apps remove anything

1254
00:48:33,599 --> 00:48:36,319
that you don't use and if you don't

1255
00:48:35,359 --> 00:48:40,240
recognize it

1256
00:48:36,319 --> 00:48:41,759
it could be malicious so also remove it

1257
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:43,919
and cover cameras when they're not in

1258
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:46,160
use

1259
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:47,359
so basically you're being smart

1260
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:50,480
protecting your life

1261
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:53,279
number one covering your tracks trusting

1262
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:53,920
people but verifying and warning other

1263
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:56,160
people

1264
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:58,240
uh in writing especially if you're in

1265
00:48:56,160 --> 00:49:01,200
danger i once told my boss

1266
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:01,598
if i do not show up for work send help

1267
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:04,879
and

1268
00:49:01,599 --> 00:49:08,880
you can certainly do that so what to do

1269
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:08,880
if you are being doxxed or harassed

1270
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:12,319
first of all breathe take a step back

1271
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:14,399
calm down

1272
00:49:12,319 --> 00:49:15,599
take screenshots of everything back the

1273
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:19,359
captures up

1274
00:49:15,599 --> 00:49:20,559
um if uh they may be attempting to log

1275
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:23,839
into other accounts

1276
00:49:20,559 --> 00:49:25,839
um and uh get more info

1277
00:49:23,839 --> 00:49:26,880
um doxxing is against the terms of

1278
00:49:25,839 --> 00:49:29,759
service of nearly

1279
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:30,720
every social platform so report it and

1280
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:33,440
they'll

1281
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:35,839
take action make sure you reach out for

1282
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:38,640
moral support and contact authorities if

1283
00:49:35,839 --> 00:49:38,640
necessary

1284
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:43,680
take screenshots of chats posts fake

1285
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:47,119
websites

1286
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:49,919
tell other people and you may be

1287
00:49:47,119 --> 00:49:51,599
helping others by not hiding it so by

1288
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:54,240
telling other people what's going on

1289
00:49:51,599 --> 00:49:54,800
and these are some screenshots of from

1290
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:57,839
twitter

1291
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:58,559
that i got today of uh people helping

1292
00:49:57,839 --> 00:50:02,319
other people

1293
00:49:58,559 --> 00:50:04,960
figure out um who is a

1294
00:50:02,319 --> 00:50:06,480
uh you know who the bad people are

1295
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:07,839
basically

1296
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:10,720
so that you know again there's no

1297
00:50:07,839 --> 00:50:14,319
perfect defense against it um

1298
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:16,558
but uh after it happens you know log out

1299
00:50:14,319 --> 00:50:18,319
all your sessions that are logged into

1300
00:50:16,559 --> 00:50:21,040
accounts um

1301
00:50:18,319 --> 00:50:21,520
check permissions change things you can

1302
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:24,960
uh

1303
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:26,640
call any providers um that you know they

1304
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:29,920
might be targeting

1305
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:31,440
and uh eu residents can demand takedown

1306
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:33,680
of things under gdpr but

1307
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:35,359
um us residents can only ask the

1308
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:40,319
platform to take them down

1309
00:50:35,359 --> 00:50:42,000
um so you're pretty lucky

1310
00:50:40,319 --> 00:50:44,079
again make sure you have a support

1311
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:47,200
system it's really important

1312
00:50:44,079 --> 00:50:48,640
uh it's

1313
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:51,359
hard to go through things alone and

1314
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:53,759
nobody should have to so

1315
00:50:51,359 --> 00:50:54,799
be kind to yourself if anything happens

1316
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:56,079
to you

1317
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:58,480
make sure that you're caring for

1318
00:50:56,079 --> 00:50:58,480
yourself

1319
00:50:58,559 --> 00:51:04,240
uh it can be traumatizing and paranoia

1320
00:51:02,079 --> 00:51:05,680
as we many of us probably know is fairly

1321
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:08,160
exhausting

1322
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:10,078
every day make sure that you think some

1323
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:11,759
nice things about yourself

1324
00:51:10,079 --> 00:51:13,520
that you get positive reinforcement from

1325
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:16,480
your support system

1326
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:18,079
um doing things that make you feel good

1327
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:19,760
uh

1328
00:51:18,079 --> 00:51:22,559
telling yourself that you know you've

1329
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:24,720
done everything that you can

1330
00:51:22,559 --> 00:51:25,920
to prevent what happened and you're

1331
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:29,040
