just the discussions going nuts and it's

27
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:59,839

29
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,719

you um we have some great

34
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:19,280
comments it wasn't just the q and a

35
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:20,080
stuff but comments kind of blew up

36
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,159
during your

37
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:24,400
keynote one person said probably one of

38
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:26,000
my favorite talks so far i got a history

39
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:29,040
of how the term doxing came

40
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,960
to be also uh when i was

41
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,479
proofing your keynote i was like oh

42
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,640
that's where that came from

43
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:36,240
i was like oh cool yeah multiple people

44
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,479
were excited by that

45
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:40,399
um i personally loved your comment about

46
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:42,000
q a security you know i call it q a

47
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,759
question and answer security

48
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,360
and not using the actual you know what's

49
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:46,240
your mother's maiden name like people

50
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:49,280
who've known you

51
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:50,560
that's so easy you know um someone

52
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,479
actually said

53
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,079
uh i picked a new maiden name for my mom

54
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:55,520
i have one i use for security questions

55
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:57,360
and then the real one i picked a new

56
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:59,439
middle name for my dad like

57
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,640
come up with all these different things

58
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:03,119
personally i i

59
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,719
i go with crazy big long stupid things

60
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:05,840
all squished in like to have nothing to

61
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:07,520
do with that item

62
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,720
one time i had to call support center

63
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:11,120
and they asked me you know they're like

64
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:13,040
i need you to spell out letter by letter

65
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,400
you're the street you grew up on and so

66
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,319
i had to spell out

67
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,599
but i thought nah forget it yo homes to

68
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:20,720
bel air

69
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:21,040
so that was my i just you know i was

70
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,840
like

71
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,359
i forgot yeah it was pretty funny uh

72
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,040
there's some good comments in here for

73
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:29,040
linkedin you can disable google

74
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,400
seo and that solves many problems i

75
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,679
wasn't aware of that so that seems kind

76
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,519
of cool

77
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,280
i'm definitely gonna go do well i lied i

78
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:37,840
won't do that because i'm uh

79
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,959
an attention um someone asks a

80
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,640
good question here

81
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:42,400
i made several email accounts when i was

82
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,879
a teenager and i didn't know about any

83
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,959
of this

84
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:46,799
15 years later what can i do about all

85
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:50,239
the dumb stuff i signed up for

86
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:52,239
or all the silly accounts i made that is

87
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:55,840
a good question

88
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:58,159
it depends on

89
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,200
whether you still have access to the

90
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:02,480
email address

91
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:04,238
that you signed up for the account with

92
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:07,280
because if you don't then it makes it a

93
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:10,319
lot harder um but you could potentially

94
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:13,519
uh uh contact or

95
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:16,958
you know preferably phone the

96
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:18,560
company and ask them to give them like

97
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:20,000
all the information that you know about

98
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,440
yourself that you signed you may have

99
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,319
signed up with

100
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,799
they may even ask for like a photocopy

101
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:26,238
of your

102
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:27,840
id or something to make sure that you

103
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:31,120
are who you are but

104
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:33,599
um potentially you could have it

105
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:35,200
you could regain access that way if you

106
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:35,679
don't have access to the email account

107
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:40,000
to

108
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:42,799
recover the password for example um

109
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,040
that's probably my best answer because

110
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:48,400
otherwise

111
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:49,760
i mean internet permanency once it's out

112
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:53,120
there it's kind of out there

113
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:56,640
and um if you can't

114
00:03:53,120 --> 00:04:00,239
uh proof if they don't care who you are

115
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:03,839
and they just want to email you then

116
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:05,840
there's not much you can awesome thank

117
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,519

118
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,720
