33
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:15,200
you know um i absolutely loved some of

34
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,560
that stuff my favorite

35
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,000
personally was you know the breaking

36
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,720
into the cell phone oh we broke into the

37
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,240
cell phone

38
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:23,119
we have to be cracked like okay calm

39
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:24,720
down so really really cool stuff before

40
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:26,080
we get to the general q a are

41
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,679
there any things anything you want to

42
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,840
say specifically or you want to get to

43
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,840
it

44
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,479
all right let's do it we have a bunch of

45
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,520
good questions uh one of them i want to

46
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:40,880
start off with this one that actually

47
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:43,119
came from youtube

48
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,798
any discussion on verizon cyber

49
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:48,640
reporting most people

50
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:48,640
people excuse me believe it's credible

51
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:54,240
um i mean i've only seen the like dbir

52
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,679
report and

53
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,920
have used that to just cite some

54
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:01,520
examples of where people

55
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:03,920
have uh kind of said hey

56
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:05,119
in this stream then you know this mini

57
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:08,318
attack set

58
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:10,720
i think a lot of what they've mentioned

59
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:12,079
doesn't seem to fly in the face of any

60
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:15,359
other reporting around that

61
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:18,560
so it seems fine but i haven't like

62
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,560
dug too deep into it

63
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:23,519
so a little random background here um i

64
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,079
did a lot of thread intel for a while

65
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,040
the

66
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,840
verizon dvir when they request data from

67
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,440
people

68
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,280
they request that everything matches

69
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,560
what's known as the varus framework

70
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,720
which has been around since at least

71
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,720
2011 when i first learned about it

72
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:38,879
um i worked at a place where we actually

73
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,359
all of our stuff in our ticketing system

74
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:42,079
mapped

75
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,959
directly to varus which made it super

76
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,440
easy for

77
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:46,800
aligning our expectations and our goals

78
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,879
and whatever

79
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:51,040
on that report and reports like it so we

80
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:53,440
could look at that and go oh look this

81
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,079
terminology directly matches what we're

82
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,000
doing

83
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,159
the problem that i find is that there

84
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,800
are a number of organizations that say

85
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:00,159
most

86
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,319
don't you excuse me i don't know about

87
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:04,000
most that was stupid sorry but many

88
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:06,238
who don't map tavares or even know that

89
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,879
it exists so all of a sudden you have

90
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:09,040
whatever

91
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:10,799
taxonomy they're using in their threat

92
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,920
intelligence platform if they're in miss

93
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,319
but they're using you know

94
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:16,000
13 of the how many other now 100 or

95
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:18,159
whatever taxonomies

96
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,480
to categorize you know even just like an

97
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:23,040
ip address like what is that is that c2

98
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:24,319
is that cnc um is that just delivery

99
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,319
like how are they they're

100
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:27,599
aligning that and then when they report

101
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:30,238
to verizon

102
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:31,760
there has to be a mapping right of okay

103
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:32,720
well what is that actually in varus

104
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,640
language and

105
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:36,000
i personally think there's some fidelity

106
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:38,720
lost in there

107
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,879
and you may have some mismatches and

108
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:42,959
slightly misreporting because of that

109
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:44,840
but overall i mean i read them every

110
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:47,519
year i love them

111
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:50,120
so

112
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:51,280
another question can you guys talk about

113
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:54,560
portmap.io

114
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:56,319
ingrock or tor2web a bit more

115
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,799
i'm interested in cloud penetration

116
00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:00,399
testing or external perimeter testing

117
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:03,920
which would you say is the easiest to

118
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,920
set up for a poc

119
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:12,238
um i mean i kind of played with torque

120
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:14,080
web for some things but not anything it

121
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:17,120
was just more of just like oh cool

122
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:19,120
here's how you can view some four things

123
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,478
uh yeah i don't really know the details

124
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,240
and what the uh

125
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:24,719
i guess end goal for that would be so

126
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:29,840
i'm not sure

127
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:29,840
what to advise on that

128
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:34,639
oh here's a good one with tech reporting

129
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:36,080
and standard reporting the goal is to be

130
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:38,080
fast and accurate

131
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,280
how do you think tech journalists can do

132
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:41,440
the accurate part

133
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:42,960
better they're usually very fast to

134
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,560
release articles

135
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:46,320
that is a really good question because i

136
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,840
feel like the people the places that

137
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,360
are the fastest often have the most

138
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,599
errors because there is

139
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,560
kind of a trade-off um and so it's

140
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,040
really easy to say

141
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,720
like don't publish until you you have it

142
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,160
right but then there's also like the

143
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,440
problem of speed um

144
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,199
so one thing you can do is if you have

145
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,639
fact checkers on your team and i used to

146
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:04,479
do this when i um

147
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:06,560
i used to ghostwrite for this very

148
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:08,240
popular health site and i just like had

149
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,320
people checking like i'm like

150
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,919
please just read after me as i type it

151
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,360
and just double check these studies to

152
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:16,400
make sure they say what i

153
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,840
i think they say um so that that can

154
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,679
be one way to do it and then just the

155
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,400
more knowledge you have overall of a

156
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,160
beat the more

157
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,679
the less likely like i can just see

158
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,000
article headlines and be like this looks

159
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,639
a little

160
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,919
sketchy um and and then also just

161
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:30,560
building these sources

162
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:31,840
and just having i know there's like a

163
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,600
like you know hackers that are meteor

164
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,359
friendly that'll just answer questions

165
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,880
um that you can just have on speed dial

166
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,479
and be like oh i'm reading this thing

167
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:40,560
and i'll immediately be able to tell you

168
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:42,719
like no this is overblown you can't like

169
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,320
this isn't hacking signal or whatever

170
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,800
so it's kind of i think a combination of

171
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,800
those things

172
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,479
do you find in the industry that um

173
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:55,440
those

174
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:57,280
fact checkers are often technical in

175
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,600
nature or for that matter very technical

176
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:00,318
or

177
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,600
for that matter have the background of

178
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:03,840
infosec

179
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:06,000
um because i i would see that i would

180
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:07,359
think that would be very different

181
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,720
you know as far as research and knowing

182
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,919
how to do it and really understanding

183
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,800
like oh you know that's not even

184
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:13,198
possible do you see

185
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,880
a lot of like technical people in those

186
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:16,639
roles or is it primarily folks who have

187
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:19,120
just gone through journalism you know to

188
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:20,880
the point where they just become that

189
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,240
yeah i mean i think it depends on where

190
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,919
you work um

191
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,280
and so like sometimes there are fact

192
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:26,880
checkers that are really technical

193
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,400
but sometimes when i say fact checkers i

194
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,840
don't mean like somebody in the role of

195
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,919
a fact-checker i mean

196
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:33,119
you know that other tech reporter who

197
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:34,719
knows this really well

198
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,479
and it's you know like do they have a

199
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,919
chance to look over it really quickly

200
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:40,318
um but yeah i don't know it's hard to

201
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:42,159
find especially for editors it's hard to

202
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:42,800
find editors that both know how to edit

203
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,960
and

204
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,560
are technical because um you know you

205
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:48,080
don't get paid as much for editing most

206
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,479
people who are really technical go into

207
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,599
tech

208
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:53,440
um and so it's hard to find and i i

209
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:54,880
constantly am having to have not in my

210
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:57,039
current job but like when i was

211
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:58,960
freelancing constantly having to correct

212
00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:00,800
errors that editors introduced and try

213
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:03,840
to get them to change stuff and fix it

214
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:05,199
um so yeah it's it's not easy like i

215
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,359
don't think any of this is easy

216
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:09,199
especially um you know if you're trying

217
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,039
to get stuff out fast like you are gonna

218
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:12,479
sacrifice accuracy sometimes but then

219
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:13,840
there's also stories that

220
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:16,159
people have worked on for months that

221
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,359
have errors and so it's just

222
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,360
prioritizing that

223
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:21,759
and figuring out the best way to to kind

224
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,759
of do it

225
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:26,479
thank you kind of a follow-up to that

226
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,239
really i guess we're dovetailing into

227
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:31,199
this one

228
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:32,639
any thoughts on ways to incentivize

229
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:35,759
accurate reporting

230
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:38,240
profit motive is for flashiest headlines

231
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:38,240
these days

232
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,840
i know that that's always true like a

233
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,280
lot of people

234
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,560
say like oh this is clickbait and

235
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,000
they're just writing these headlines to

236
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:48,639
get me to click on it but a lot of the

237
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,400
sites that people say that about are

238
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:51,919
they don't that's not what the that's

239
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,280
not the metric they're going for

240
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:55,440
they're not going for clicks they're

241
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:57,198
going for like either subscribers or

242
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,160
like time spent on page or some other

243
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:59,919
metric so

244
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,680
i feel like that's kind of an inaccuracy

245
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:02,400
when people are like you know

246
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,680
clickbait

247
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:07,359
you know um but yeah i think i'm like

248
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:09,120
i think like maybe reaching out like i

249
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,319
get a lot of emails anytime somebody

250
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,879
thinks there's an error

251
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:14,080
um or and sometimes they're accurate but

252
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:15,599
a lot of times they're not

253
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:17,599
like a lot of times it's a matter of

254
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:18,159
opinion or maybe the person commenting

255
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:20,560
hasn't

256
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:22,319
done their research um so i think like a

257
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,840
good way to incentivize it is by like

258
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:26,800
spreading work that is good

259
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:28,318
and um you know talking to reporters who

260
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,160
do a good job like maybe

261
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:31,759
like when you're trying to tell somebody

262
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:34,320
about your story take it to people

263
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:35,279
you know like who you know will are care

264
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,320
about accuracy

265
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:39,838
and um um and just being

266
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,839
being good about doing that instead of

267
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:43,200
just like whatever the flashiest

268
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:44,560
headline is like i think that's a big

269
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:47,360
incentive for me is just kind of

270
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:50,160
building trust within the community

271
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:51,360
uh what do you think david i mean i

272
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,319
think a lot of those incentives are

273
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,240
already there

274
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:56,240
um journalists don't want to get a

275
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:58,560
reputation as being somebody that

276
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:00,160
is willfully inaccurate and full of

277
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:03,439
errors on the reporting

278
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:06,079
um otherwise they don't get a job um

279
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,480
so and it's already kind of a hard

280
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:09,920
enough

281
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:11,040
proposed proposition as it is uh that

282
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,839
being said like there's a lot of

283
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,319
reporting

284
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:15,680
done by a wide variety of news outlets

285
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,760
like it's not

286
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:19,519
news is not just the game of you know

287
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:21,760
the big broadcast companies and the big

288
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:23,839
papers anymore we have

289
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:25,760
a lot of independent media outlets with

290
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:27,440
a lot of other economic alignments that

291
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:31,839
are a little bit different than just

292
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:34,720
you know a giant you know corporate uh

293
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:36,800
kind of collection of papers i don't

294
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,680
want to name any specific ones but just

295
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,120
like

296
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,800
anybody in the media knows it's like

297
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,000
yeah they they just bought out this

298
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,240
thing that was

299
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,360
um but you know there's other stuff out

300
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,680
there there's probably

301
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:49,279
there's a markup there's like all these

302
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:52,640
other people doing really good work

303
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:55,200
um and i would recommend diversifying

304
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:57,040
your media intake

305
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:59,600
i think also like i i wish there was

306
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:01,519
less of um sort of a stigma attached to

307
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,240
making corrections in media like i feel

308
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:04,079
like if

309
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,920
if i mess something up i want to correct

310
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:06,959
it and and and so like sometimes you'll

311
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,800
hear people say like

312
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:10,319
oh isn't that the writer who had like

313
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,439
three corrections and got this thing

314
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,279
totally wrong

315
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,800
um and then you have reporters who just

316
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:16,399
doubled down when they're wrong and like

317
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:18,800
we'll never admit it like one of the

318
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:19,760
one of the people we roasted last year

319
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,359
like uh

320
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,880
like the like the it's like you have a

321
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,480
bad headline every person in the

322
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:26,000
industry is saying this isn't correct

323
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:28,160
and they just won't admit it and i think

324
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,519
it's because there's that stigma so i've

325
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:31,600
i wish it was a little bit more like

326
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:33,279
tech where it's like oh you just closed

327
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,680
all these bugs that's like a positive

328
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:35,680
thing

329
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:37,120
like if if there's an error in a story

330
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,079
and then also just realizing it's not

331
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,519
always the writer

332
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:40,800
sometimes it's the editor and they might

333
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:41,360
not want to admit it because you don't

334
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,120
want to

335
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,399
throw your editor under the bus but a

336
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,040
lot of stuff you might think like oh

337
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:47,120
this writer

338
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:48,719
got this wrong like like it wasn't

339
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,240
actually the writer so it was like a

340
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,519
last minute change they didn't even see

341
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:55,680
her

342
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:58,959
that that's a powerful sentiment thought

343
00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:00,479
i did so in tech and consulting

344
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:02,800
like a lot of us we write reports all

345
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,279
the time right we have a qa process we

346
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,640
have

347
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:06,720
where i work at blackberry another

348
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:09,600
sponsor of ours we have an amazing

349
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:10,399
tech editing and qa team but the

350
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,720
consultants

351
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:14,079
we still get the last view and the last

352
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,440
like all right yeah that's cool like we

353
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:17,279
have to click the approve button

354
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,800
right before that goes to the client

355
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:20,160
thinking about you know you can write

356
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:22,319
this article whether it be

357
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:23,760
a an hour long you know i spent an hour

358
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,440
on it or months long

359
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,640
and poured your heart and soul into it

360
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,000
and then all of a sudden the editor

361
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:30,480
essentially maybe has the last

362
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,200
say um thinking about not seeing the

363
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,959
last

364
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,399
version of that before it goes out like

365
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:37,599
as a consultant i was like ooh

366
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:39,519
no no no no that's

367
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,800
yeah yeah and there's also like weird

368
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:42,480
trickery where it's like

369
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,079
everybody's working in a google draft

370
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,600
and then like they'll make changes after

371
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:46,239
it's already in the cms and be like can

372
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,399
you read this

373
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,279
over and it's like oh i have to like cut

374
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:51,040
and paste it all

375
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:52,560
and then combine these to see what was

376
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:54,240
actually changed and

377
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,920
yeah and it's like sometimes really last

378
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,519
minute and so there's a lot but i mean

379
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:59,279
also editors do sometimes fix

380
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:01,360
writer errors at the last minute too so

381
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:02,399
it's not like editors are always bad

382
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,680
it's just that like

383
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:05,360
the person you think might have written

384
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:07,040
that bad headline or had that error like

385
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,560
it might not actually be done so just

386
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:11,839
being aware of that before you

387
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:14,479
paint them with a broad brush another

388
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:15,760
advantage to have an editor actually if

389
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,839
you're coming in from

390
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,959
more of a technical background into

391
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:22,000
writing which is like

392
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:25,359
most of what my writing is

393
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:28,639
it's really useful to see what changes

394
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:30,000
make to see like how they how

395
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:31,920
what you've written could be

396
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,240
misinterpreted um

397
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:36,160
so an editor is coming in saying like

398
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,680
let's simplify this graph into something

399
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:39,279
a little bit easier i'm like that's not

400
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,160
what i said but the fact that you read

401
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:41,920
what i said and

402
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:45,279
this was your take means that maybe we

403
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:45,279
should revisit this in some way

404
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:51,040
i think that's one of the things that we

405
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:53,439
consultants often do

406
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:55,279
blue team or red team whether it's ir or

407
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:57,120
pen testing especially pin testing

408
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:58,959
you have to have legal's take on it and

409
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,800
many times you have to this has to be

410
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:03,439
worded for legal right so we have

411
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:04,240
that and i have to just imagine you like

412
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,639
that's just

413
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,680
just part that's just one facet of the

414
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:08,800
type of people who are going to be

415
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:11,120
reading your stuff

416
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,479
and interpreting your stuff yeah i've

417
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:14,399
had that happen too

418
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:16,320
sorry i mean but i've had that happen

419
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:17,200
where legal like changed a headline or

420
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,040
changed

421
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,880
a phrase and it sounds really vague and

422
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:23,920
then people will attack it and be like

423
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:25,839
oh so you're not sure this is the case

424
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:27,519
no just legal told me that we had to

425
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:29,120
hedge a little just in case to try to

426
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:31,279
avoid this lawsuit

427
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,639
yup yup many times i'm like this

428
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:37,040
happened and legal's like

429
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:38,720
let's just say like all right i guess

430
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:40,560
another question right in the same vein

431
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,959
of all this great discussion by the way

432
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,279
think

433
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:44,319
i'm loving this should journalists that

434
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:46,240
work in tech be

435
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:48,320
vetted for their understanding of the

436
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:50,399
field on which they're reporting

437
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:52,240
most journals don't necessarily have

438
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:54,160
backgrounds in specific fields and with

439
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:56,880
so many getting tech things wrong

440
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:58,800
should there be some type of bar of for

441
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:01,120
entry

442
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:02,560
um okay so i have a couple of answers to

443
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,920
that and the first one people don't

444
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,760
really like to hear but i feel like if

445
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:07,439
you're really really really good at tech

446
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:09,600
you're not like it's hard to write for

447
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,639
like a normal audience like a general

448
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:13,199
audience

449
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:14,720
um and also like even if you really have

450
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:16,560
check chops you're writing about

451
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:18,560
broad things so even like say you're

452
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:19,760
like really really good in cloud or

453
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,560
android or whatever and then suddenly

454
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,600
you're writing about something

455
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,760
completely different

456
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,639
you wouldn't pass the litmus test for

457
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:27,120
that

458
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:28,880
um and i think it's less about like do

459
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,720
you have a tech background to be able to

460
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:32,480
know this off the top of your head

461
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:34,959
to like can you understand what people

462
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:36,480
are saying um and make corrections but

463
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:38,319
absolutely if you're trying to decide

464
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:40,079
whether or not to talk to media totally

465
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,920
you should bet that you're like look at

466
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:43,920
look at the journalists look at things

467
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:45,120
they've written and you know ask around

468
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,959
if they've interviewed people you know

469
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:49,120
like what was that experience like

470
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:50,959
um and you can also decide like there's

471
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,639
just different you can decide to answer

472
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:54,959
stuff over email if you don't want to

473
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:56,839
accidentally say the wrong thing um some

474
00:14:54,959 --> 00:15:00,079
some places will let people review their

475
00:14:56,839 --> 00:15:01,279
quotes before you publish so there's um

476
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:03,279
like if you're worried about being

477
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:06,000
misinterpreted i think that it's like

478
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:07,439
on you to vet the writer but i wouldn't

479
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,519
necessarily say it's

480
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:11,519
based on their technical expertise but

481
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:14,480
more about their like ethics and

482
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:14,480
kind of how they work

483
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:18,240
cool there are there are a lot of

484
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,959
questions we're definitely not going to

485
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,320
get to them all

486
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:21,680
just throwing that out there it just

487
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,040
shows that it was such a great

488
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,599
stimulating talk you know people were

489
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:26,639
like

490
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:28,720
wait a minute wait a minute um how

491
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:30,399
should orgs best present themselves

492
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:34,399
in your opinion rather than simply

493
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:34,399
saying we take security seriously

494
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:42,399
i so i do some writing around vpns

495
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:43,199
and the thing that i always look for is

496
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:46,240
the balance

497
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:48,959
of or i guess the ratio of like

498
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:51,279
jargon of like switzerland based you

499
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:54,399
know nsa proof not in the five eyes

500
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:55,680
versus like we didn't use the default

501
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:58,160
openvpn

502
00:15:55,680 --> 00:16:00,000
cybersweep because there's vulnerability

503
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:02,000
in this kind of in cbc or whatever and

504
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,920
then like we did this and this

505
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,519
and oh our wireguard implementation we

506
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:06,319
didn't just say we use wireguard we

507
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:08,480
actually looked at

508
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:09,839
like the august 2020 issue where like

509
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:12,959
there's default logging

510
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:15,759
on the server side um

511
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:16,638
so if they if they're on if they're

512
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:17,839
willing to go and

513
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:19,199
if you're willing to go into detail

514
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:20,639
that's a sign of credibility in my

515
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:21,599
opinion especially if you're going up

516
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:24,800
against

517
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:26,800
a writer that is particularly technical

518
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:29,279
and looks for those things

519
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:31,359
um or just somebody that is advising on

520
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:33,120
something like that because

521
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,880
you want to make sure that if you want

522
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,000
to be as transparent as possible on what

523
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:38,560
you're doing

524
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,600
um i do not want to run into a website's

525
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:42,638
about page or

526
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:44,560
product page and see like we use rsa

527
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:46,720
encryption i'm like

528
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:48,239
every literally everything uses rsa

529
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:51,360
encryption um that

530
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:53,759
doesn't really say anything uh but going

531
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:56,240
into depth having white papers

532
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:57,680
like really kind of like throwing it all

533
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,120
out there and letting people know

534
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:01,040
what your product is made of i think is

535
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,720
the best way to present yourself

536
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:05,280
yeah i agree with that and i'd also add

537
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:07,360
that um like being honest about

538
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:09,439
what you can and can't do like um like

539
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:11,119
don't just throw locks up all over your

540
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:12,720
page and say like

541
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:14,399
you can i don't like i feel like a lot

542
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,679
of the stories i've had that maybe

543
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,760
companies

544
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:19,199
didn't like or it's because they were

545
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,640
claiming to do things that they couldn't

546
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:22,000
do and then they get really weird when

547
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:24,799
you ask questions about it

548
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,640
um so just being honest about like like

549
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:28,559
no we can't do i think like um there's

550
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,600
some sites that do this really well like

551
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:32,639
um

552
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:34,240
um the new like hey doc the new uh

553
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,760
email service they're like no we're not

554
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,640
and then encrypted like they're very

555
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,720
like

556
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,679
honest about what what their limitations

557
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,840
are there was um

558
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:43,840
encrypt me did this too for their vpn

559
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:44,799
they were like um no this won't actually

560
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,240
help you

561
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:48,639
have additional security if you're

562
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:50,240
already using https on these sites and

563
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:53,440
and just being like really honest like

564
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:53,440
that's something that i look for

565
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,799
i i love that that combo it reminds me

566
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,799
of the general

567
00:17:56,799 --> 00:18:00,320
uh bingo card at a conference you know

568
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:02,799
like especially rsa that's the famous

569
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:03,918
one right your rsa bingo card when folks

570
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:05,360
come in and they're trying to sling

571
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:07,600
their products and it's all

572
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:08,959
you know over the years they've changed

573
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,719
obviously but big data in

574
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:12,160
one year was big data and then there was

575
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:14,000
a data lake and then it was you know

576
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,799
blockchain and you're just like come on

577
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,280
shut up

578
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:19,200
my uh i got a computer from my kid and

579
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,678
the motherboard the bios when you boot

580
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,400
it

581
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:24,080
it says military grade capacitors is

582
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,960
part is on the bios and i was like what

583
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:27,840
the

584
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:28,400
i was like shut up dude it's a great

585
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,760
computer

586
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,520
and i love him for selling it to me by

587
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,320
the way i hope you're watching uh but

588
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:34,000
it's just funny i was like

589
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:35,520
military-grade capacitors that's how

590
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,640
you're gonna sell okay that's gonna make

591
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,240
me buy the motherboard

592
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:40,480
it's the same thing with tech can you

593
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:41,440
see it all the time and i really love

594
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:44,559
that you mentioned

595
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:46,000
honesty and security but honestly in

596
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:47,678
terms of capability

597
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,120
you know um so many of us in the

598
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:51,039
security community

599
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:52,479
are like oh i can do this and i can do

600
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:54,559
that and i can do this

601
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:55,679
sure but when people ask them you know

602
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:57,600
can you comment on

603
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:59,039
so and so there are certain certain

604
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,639
people who will still comment on that

605
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:01,200
when they have no business commenting on

606
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:04,320
that

607
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:05,520
you know like myself zero red team true

608
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:07,600
capability right i

609
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:09,280
suck when it comes to pin testing or

610
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,639
exploit deb or any of that stuff and

611
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:12,320
my first thing is like i'm the wrong guy

612
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:14,000
don't don't even ask me and we see a lot

613
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:15,200
of folks in our field in security who

614
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,320
you know in their twitter accounts or

615
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,440
whatever they're commenting on these

616
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:19,200
things they're like that's not your

617
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:20,720
background that's not what you do

618
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,240
and so to see that from a journalist's

619
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:23,679
point of view that's you know and how

620
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:26,480
they kind of how they blend

621
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:27,120
is uh i think there's actually like um

622
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,559
the pr

623
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,840
the pr angle because a lot of people are

624
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:31,760
saying like should we vet journalists

625
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:33,360
it's like should you vet the pr people

626
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,919
in your own team who maybe are saying

627
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,678
things that

628
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:37,360
are wrong or like completely

629
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:38,960
contradictory to what you're saying

630
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:40,479
and so part of what i have to do because

631
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:42,160
i talk to a lot of pr people who really

632
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:43,120
don't understand the products which is

633
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:45,280
like

634
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:46,719
you know maybe i don't know exactly if

635
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:49,120
that's their job or not but

636
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:50,559
um to get to get them to take a question

637
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:52,239
from the media seriously and get the

638
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:53,760
right people on the phone like

639
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:55,200
like get the tech guy to answer this

640
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,640
question because clearly you're just

641
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,640
cutting and pasting something

642
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:00,160
from something they gave you a while ago

643
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:02,240
and there's really good pr people who do

644
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:03,679
understand tech and know how to delegate

645
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,960
that but um

646
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:06,400
like i don't know there's just a lot of

647
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:08,240
sites that they're like i'm like your

648
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,440
site says you do xyz but you don't

649
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,440
actually do that

650
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:13,200
and they'll be like oh yeah rpr people

651
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:15,360
and i'm like you know the company hires

652
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:17,919
the pr people it's not out of your hands

653
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:19,439
like like you can tell them like don't

654
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:20,080
say this thing about our product that's

655
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:23,760
incorrect

656
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:23,760
like like you have the power to do that

657
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:28,640
yes i agree i love it uh again whole

658
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,559
bunch of

659
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:32,840
awesome questions we're getting close on

660
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:36,080
time here so i'm just gonna pick

661
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:38,399
um here's a good one

662
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:39,918
thoughts on standard response slash

663
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:42,400
defense tactics of

664
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:43,919
documents information is stolen as

665
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:48,000
opposed to whistleblowing getting

666
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:49,600
multiple sources for information

667
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,880
oh like the ethics of reporting on

668
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:54,439
stolen on on like hack documents

669
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:56,320
i like that let's go with that

670
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:58,880
[Laughter]

671
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:00,720
the question i think it really depends

672
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:03,679
on the situation and if it's a pub like

673
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:05,440
in the public interest um so if somebody

674
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:07,120
gets you something that's really juicy

675
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,000
but it's and and like would be

676
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,760
interesting

677
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,679
i don't think that's always like for me

678
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:12,640
that doesn't always meet my bar for like

679
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:14,720
is this

680
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:16,000
is it ethical to report on this like is

681
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:19,039
this in the public interest

682
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:21,120
and it's kind of a personal decision um

683
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:23,039
and and conversation with the your

684
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:26,080
editor and the site you write for and

685
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:29,200
etc but for me like that the bar is

686
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:30,080
kind of high i don't know if that

687
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:33,039
answered the question though i don't

688
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:33,039
think i understood the question

689
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,880
uh nor did i but you know what i liked

690
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,960
your answer anyway

691
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:42,799
so again there are a bunch of questions

692
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,440
in the chat if you folks happen to have

693
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:45,120
