uh let's see what else

61
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,060

65
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:16,760
sponsors around to Applause

66
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:23,459
uh we literally cannot do this without

67
00:10:23,459 --> 00:10:25,440
our sponsors uh you all know this is a

68
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,019
free con which means we our sponsors are

69
00:10:28,019 --> 00:10:29,459
the reason we can do this it's just not

70
00:10:29,459 --> 00:10:31,440
possible without them uh special thanks

71
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,600

74
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,519
cactuscon individually and not part of a

75
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:40,440
business sponsorship uh so these are

76
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,420

77
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:43,500

have a volunteer in the room who's going

168
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:47,880
to ask it to the person on stage so that

169
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,620
our remote participants can be involved

170
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:52,019
in the Q a as well and then our sponsors

171
00:13:52,019 --> 00:13:53,760
have channels in there as well so feel

172
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,019
free to jump in there give them some

173
00:13:55,019 --> 00:13:57,540
love they'll be doing some giveaways and

174
00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:00,240
prizes and stuff from Discord so keep an

175
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,519
eye on those just one note to people who

176
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:04,740
enter the contests on Discord if you

177
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:07,380
enter a sponsored contest that does give

178
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:09,720
permission for the sponsor to receive

179
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,160
your name and email address from

180
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,899
Eventbrite so I just want to put that

181
00:14:12,899 --> 00:14:14,160
disclaimer out there that's the only

182
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,660
information about our attendees we share

183
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:17,220
with sponsors is if you enter those

184
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:19,200
giveaways we look at it like you're

185
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,060
scanning a badge at a booth at a trade

186
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:22,139
show or whatever where that gets their

187
00:14:22,139 --> 00:14:23,459
information to you or your information

188
00:14:23,459 --> 00:14:25,260
to them

189
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:27,540
um let's see I think that is it about

190
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:29,940
Discord uh we have an amazing team of

191
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:31,620
moderators and volunteers on Discord as

192
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,480
well uh we also have an amazing team of

193
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,940
volunteers here so thank you to all of

194
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:38,279
our volunteers who are here to help uh

195
00:14:38,279 --> 00:14:40,760
definitely

196
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:45,899
and our village staff and anybody who's

197
00:14:45,899 --> 00:14:47,519
here everybody who's been working for

198
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:49,019
literally a year to put this conference

199
00:14:49,019 --> 00:14:51,060
on so we're super excited to bring it to

200
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:52,680
you and and the people who put it

201
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:55,620
together really what makes this work

202
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:58,920
um let's see do we have badge people

203
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,540
where are the badge people

204
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:02,459
come on up Eric

205
00:15:02,459 --> 00:15:04,860
I think so we have our Hardware badges I

206
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:06,660
mentioned are for sale forty dollars at

207
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:08,399
the uh at the merch but I'm gonna hand

208
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:11,279
it over to Eric to talk more

209
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:13,079
I guess I'm uh pleased to announce that

210
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:14,880
there is actually a badge this year uh

211
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,980
if you recall a couple years ago badges

212
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:19,440
arrived the day of the con and nobody

213
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,660
was there to receive the package so we

214
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:23,519
had to ship them out afterwards uh this

215
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:27,180
year's badge has a CTF involved in it I

216
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:28,740
need support so I know the details I

217
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:30,779
worked on the hardware uh with the batch

218
00:15:30,779 --> 00:15:32,339
Pirates

219
00:15:32,339 --> 00:15:33,899
um wanted to tell a story I didn't bring

220
00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:36,060
the other badge with but the uh this

221
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:38,459
badge is three years in the making the

222
00:15:38,459 --> 00:15:40,260
theme is home automation so you've got

223
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:44,220
the uh the house there cactar's house

224
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:45,959
um the badge I had worked on was going

225
00:15:45,959 --> 00:15:48,180
to be three-dimensional with a bunch of

226
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:49,740
stand-up PCB boards and would actually

227
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:52,100
replicate an entire house

228
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:55,459
the pandemic was really hard on

229
00:15:55,459 --> 00:15:57,720
microcontroller chips I designed the

230
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,699
badge I've confirmed all the parts were

231
00:15:59,699 --> 00:16:01,260
available hundreds of thousands of these

232
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:03,420
chips send it off to design and it would

233
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:04,800
be rejected because that part's no

234
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:05,820
longer available

235
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:08,639
so uh I'd re-architect the badge you

236
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:10,199
know design with another component that

237
00:16:10,199 --> 00:16:11,699
there were thousands tens of thousands

238
00:16:11,699 --> 00:16:13,380
hundreds of thousands available I'd

239
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:15,420
submit the design 10 days later that

240
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:17,760
Chip's no longer available

241
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,320
um and it wasn't fun working on a badge

242
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,300
on the fourth the fourth iteration of it

243
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:23,100
so

244
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:24,899
um yeah it was pretty pretty challenging

245
00:16:24,899 --> 00:16:27,420
so the the batch Pirates developed

246
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:29,339
badges for a number of other conferences

247
00:16:29,339 --> 00:16:30,959
they've got a little bit different model

248
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:32,579
they do all the assembly in their

249
00:16:32,579 --> 00:16:33,920
basement with a pick and place machine

250
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:37,079
and they they buy parts in bulk and then

251
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:38,220
figure out what they can design around

252
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:39,120
it

253
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:42,420
so um our architecture here has a

254
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:44,459
expressive microcontroller uh it's an

255
00:16:44,459 --> 00:16:47,759
esp32 I believe S3 I don't know how many

256
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:49,259
people are familiar with those those

257
00:16:49,259 --> 00:16:51,300
chipsets but expressive was the first

258
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:53,160
company to come out on the market with a

259
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:55,500
sub two dollar microcontroller that

260
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,420
included flash a whole bunch of i o and

261
00:16:57,420 --> 00:17:01,199
entire IP stack and Wi-Fi so they're

262
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:03,180
responsible for where we are with iot

263
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:04,980
these days if you buy a light bulb today

264
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:06,720
pretty good chance it has an expressive

265
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,819
chip in there connect them to the Wi-Fi

266
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:10,919
connect them to the cloud your badge

267
00:17:10,919 --> 00:17:12,660
does exactly the same thing connects to

268
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:13,520
the cloud

269
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,980
a hint we're using an mqtt broker if

270
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:18,179
you're familiar with that you can Google

271
00:17:18,179 --> 00:17:20,339
for that for some information but your

272
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:23,040
your badge is iot or Internet of Things

273
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:26,359
connected just like your light bulb is

274
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:28,679
there's challenges around your badge so

275
00:17:28,679 --> 00:17:30,720
feel free to plug in and figure things

276
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,520
out we're in the hardware hacking

277
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:35,100
Village for badge modification there

278
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:37,260
there is still a breadboard space on the

279
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:38,400
back there's a whole bunch of available

280
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,160
I O on there you can get into the badge

281
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:44,220
it's it's not locked down that bad

282
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:45,539
um try to figure out how our

283
00:17:45,539 --> 00:17:48,179
infrastructure works and

284
00:17:48,179 --> 00:17:50,940
yeah who has a badge right now out of

285
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:53,280
curiosity

286
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,260
um

287
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:58,380
yeah if you uh if you turn I brought the

288
00:17:58,380 --> 00:17:59,940
wrong badge this this one is not

289
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:01,679
connected to the uh to the cloud at the

290
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:03,179
moment we're up until two o'clock in the

291
00:18:03,179 --> 00:18:04,559
morning but I think what you're about to

292
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:06,799
do we'll do it

293
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,780
okay well anyhow badges are for sale

294
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:13,740
yeah they're this way yeah

295
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:15,480
they're uh they're 40 bucks you can pay

296
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:17,640
with a credit card or somebody take cash

297
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,260
uh yeah and come see us in the hardware

298
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:21,600
hacking Village to uh to get hints and

299
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,000
tips on the CTF and you'll see a demo of

300
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,500
the badge so uh get your badge early

301
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:28,020
they are pre-built and ready to roll so

302
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:30,840
we spent the last couple of days up day

303
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,940
and night charging every battery and

304
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:34,500
flashing every badge and of course

305
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:37,080
riding firmware at 2 am

306
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:38,700
um so they will update over there just

307
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,679
like your light bulbs do so watch out

308
00:18:40,679 --> 00:18:42,240
maybe your software will change in the

309
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,200
middle of the con

310
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,520
you never know maybe there'll be a

311
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:47,059
subscription model

312
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,320
he wasn't joking about the two in the

313
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:56,760
morning the uh team was working

314
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,380
literally until two in the morning this

315
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:00,000
morning to finish all the the firmware

316
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,980
and software for the badges so yeah the

317
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:04,080
dedication uh really excited to have

318
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:07,020
these this year uh pretty amazing

319
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:07,679
um

320
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:10,919
let's see what did I forget

321
00:19:10,919 --> 00:19:12,720
um oh yeah how to get help this is an

322
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,820
important one uh our volunteers around

323
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,679
the con are wearing Green Cactus con

324
00:19:16,679 --> 00:19:18,660
t-shirts uh you can see right there and

325
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:20,220
they also have green badges that say

326
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:22,260
volunteer on them so if you need any

327
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:24,240
help you have any questions concerns

328
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,520
issues please feel free to find one of

329
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,260
the green shirted volunteers they'll be

330
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:29,520
wandering around they should be in every

331
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,740

and like last 400 years of History kind

532
00:41:57,780 --> 00:41:59,339
of coalesces into why we're seeing the

533
00:41:59,339 --> 00:42:00,960
campaigns we're seeing today I think

534
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,400
it's interesting people are liking it so

535
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,380
I'll keep doing it for a while uh random

536
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:05,700
fact I play the bagpipes in case you

537
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:08,339
didn't know uh so we are also uh

538
00:42:08,339 --> 00:42:09,839

00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:20,339
very nerd friendly we have three people

544
00:42:20,339 --> 00:42:22,320
in the band with sand certificates so

545
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:24,300
for random hobbies that have a outlier

546
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:26,339
number of people in security who are

547
00:42:26,339 --> 00:42:27,599
definitely a good fit for this crowd I

548
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:28,560
would think

549
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:30,599
so bottom line up front why we're here

550
00:42:30,599 --> 00:42:33,720
today uh I basically wanted to really

551
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:34,920
share the story of what happened to me

552
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:36,480
during the pandemic uh job change

553
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:38,760
craziness and how you all in this room

554
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:40,740
and those of you watching online came

555
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:42,420
together to help me out in ways you

556
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:44,339
probably didn't even realize a fantastic

557
00:42:44,339 --> 00:42:45,780
Community we have here and I wanted to

558
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:47,520
talk today and encourage you all to get

559
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:49,079
involved in the community if you're not

560
00:42:49,079 --> 00:42:52,020
already tech people have a stigma we're

561
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:54,420
not a social and I completely disagree

562
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:56,280
but I have noticed that only about 10

563
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:57,660
percent of people who are in these

564
00:42:57,660 --> 00:42:58,980
discords and slacks really actually

565
00:42:58,980 --> 00:43:00,720
engage and there's a huge amount of

566
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:03,180
opportunity you're missing out on so if

567
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:04,319
that is something you've considered

568
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:05,760
about getting more involved in or maybe

569
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:07,079
thought about giving a talk or

570
00:43:07,079 --> 00:43:08,940
submitting one I'm here to encourage you

571
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:10,560
today and be that sign from the universe

572
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:13,319
yes do it uh and also share some cool

573
00:43:13,319 --> 00:43:16,020
ocean resources I found for ransomware

574
00:43:16,020 --> 00:43:18,900
uh also since we started late I will be

575
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:20,220
going over my allotted time just a

576
00:43:20,220 --> 00:43:21,720
little bit I'm afraid so I'll try not to

577
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:25,200
overdo it uh we oop can I get in the

578
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:27,060
next slide there we go uh since I know

579
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:29,280
we are going to have you know people

580
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:30,839
trying to scribble down stuff real fast

581
00:43:30,839 --> 00:43:32,220
if you want to take a picture real quick

582
00:43:32,220 --> 00:43:33,359
that's where I've got all these

583
00:43:33,359 --> 00:43:35,339
resources listed plus more resources

584
00:43:35,339 --> 00:43:37,680
that I couldn't even get into the slide

585
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:40,619
deck because yeah just too much stuff so

586
00:43:40,619 --> 00:43:44,760
textees txti.es slash cactuscon

587
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:47,160
all right so once upon a time I had

588
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:48,420
spent 12 and a half years in local

589
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:50,400
government and some friends in the

590
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:51,960
private sector had told me hey bud you

591
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:52,980
should check out this private sector

592
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:55,680
thing great money and I said well I

593
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:57,000
don't know I don't know finally I said

594
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,819
you know what let's do it uh this was

595
00:43:59,819 --> 00:44:02,280
about three years ago oh and so I ended

596
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:03,780
up getting a new gig and the new

597
00:44:03,780 --> 00:44:06,540
expectation was going to be CTI stuff so

598
00:44:06,540 --> 00:44:08,579
analyzing Network traffic identifying

599
00:44:08,579 --> 00:44:10,140
Trends and attack patterns as well as

600
00:44:10,140 --> 00:44:12,240
looking at fishing campaigns cool I can

601
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:13,440
do this as well as developing until

602
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:15,300
updates for our customers I can

603
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:17,700
definitely do this the timing is perfect

604
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:19,800
trust me babe and by what now at the

605
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:22,800
time I had a nine month old kid baby and

606
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:25,200
a four-year-old so any stress you think

607
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:26,880
a job change normally brings compound

608
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:28,980
that with like little ones and magnify

609
00:44:28,980 --> 00:44:31,619
that by 10. so I said hey it's fine babe

610
00:44:31,619 --> 00:44:33,960
trust me this is a great time uh let's

611
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:35,940
do it

612
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:37,920
what a problem with the timing my last

613

619

Friday the 20th that week actually

635
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:27,900
so now everybody is working from home we

636
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:28,859
have all gone through this digital

637
00:45:28,859 --> 00:45:31,260
transition together it's insane

638
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:33,599
work from home strategies in Spring 2020

639
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:36,240
were basically stop updating your VPN if

640
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:37,380
you're a small to medium-sized business

641
00:45:37,380 --> 00:45:38,280
because you're afraid you're going to

642
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:39,900
break stuff and how can I fix it if it's

643
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:41,460
broken and we're all remote oh God oh

644
00:45:41,460 --> 00:45:43,500
God so people kind of stop patching

645
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:46,079
stuff or just open up RDP going forward

646
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:47,700
by the way RDP will not be the remote

647
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:49,560
desktop protocol from now on it will be

648
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:53,960
the ransomware deployment protocol so

649
00:45:54,119 --> 00:45:55,920
this is a snapshot from a group called

650
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:57,540
coverware they do awesome stats every

651
00:45:57,540 --> 00:45:58,859
quarter on their blog about what

652
00:45:58,859 --> 00:46:01,619
ransomware is doing this was Q2 2020 we

653
00:46:01,619 --> 00:46:04,020
see that RDP compromise is well over 50

654
00:46:04,020 --> 00:46:06,300
and trending up it was even higher

655
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:08,760
before that insane

656
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:10,859
uh this is the top groups at the time

657
00:46:10,859 --> 00:46:12,300
some of those names you may or may not

658
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:13,980

and this was what the payments were

662
00:46:19,260 --> 00:46:21,060
trending at the number was still below a

663
00:46:21,060 --> 00:46:22,500
hundred thousand on the chart like that

664
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:24,839
was insane it used to be that low uh

665
00:46:24,839 --> 00:46:26,160
this was when it was really starting to

666
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:27,900
go crazy

667
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:30,599
so at this point the x-filling extort

668
00:46:30,599 --> 00:46:33,000
game was just starting to kick on uh it

669
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,500
was still this weird crazy new trend

670
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:36,060
maze ransomware had started that in

671
00:46:36,060 --> 00:46:38,040
December in 2019 they've got the Brian

672
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:40,020
Krebs article a bunch of attention so

673
00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:41,760
this was still a new phenomenon that we

674
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:42,900
weren't sure how to deal with fast

675
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:44,220
forward three years and now they're

676
00:46:44,220 --> 00:46:45,359
talking about getting away from doing

677
00:46:45,359 --> 00:46:47,160
the encryption altogether and just doing

678
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:49,140
excellent extort some groups are making

679
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:52,140
that shift so I'm at this new new job

680
00:46:52,140 --> 00:46:54,480
and all that we do an incident response

681
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:57,060
as well and we start getting a bunch of

682
00:46:57,060 --> 00:46:58,920
calls uh the typical Cadence of the

683
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:00,359
calls when something like please help me

684
00:47:00,359 --> 00:47:02,280
I have ransomware that's perfect we got

685
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:04,920
a CTI Guy Eli what's going on with this

686
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:06,599
group tell me who they are how they

687
00:47:06,599 --> 00:47:08,579
operate is the client on the blog does

688
00:47:08,579 --> 00:47:10,920
the ransomware gang even have a Blog

689
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:13,140
questions that I was like I was familiar

690
00:47:13,140 --> 00:47:14,640
with ransomware at the time and they

691
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:15,839
were I've been tracking they do this

692
00:47:15,839 --> 00:47:18,060
stuff I had never actually dug into it

693
00:47:18,060 --> 00:47:20,339
deep I wasn't familiar with them and how

694
00:47:20,339 --> 00:47:23,339
to go find this info so oh crap

695
00:47:23,339 --> 00:47:25,380
uh where do you go to get those URLs

696
00:47:25,380 --> 00:47:27,180
that was kind of a big one for me at

697
00:47:27,180 --> 00:47:28,680
that point that was one of my priority

698
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:30,060
intelligence requirements if we were to

699
00:47:30,060 --> 00:47:32,220
look at you know some Frameworks here so

700
00:47:32,220 --> 00:47:34,260
the big places oops sorry skipped it the

701
00:47:34,260 --> 00:47:36,420
big places were basically uh hit up the

702
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:37,980
friends and homie Network and hit up

703
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:39,480
Twitter and you know started asking

704
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:41,880
around on some various discords so let's

705
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:43,319
stop for a second and talk about some

706
00:47:43,319 --> 00:47:45,000
theory of where we can find good

707
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,760
information 2015 MIT came out with a

708
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:49,859
study called the harbingers of failure

709
00:47:49,859 --> 00:47:51,300
not a study I'm sorry it was an article

710
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:53,460
and basically what they found is there's

711
00:47:53,460 --> 00:47:55,560
you know this like consumers who Buy

712
00:47:55,560 --> 00:47:57,599
electronics and within that there is a

713
00:47:57,599 --> 00:47:59,700
subset of consumers who are the first to

714
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:01,500
buy Electronics early adopters first

715
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:02,640
movers whatever you want to call them

716
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:04,560
and within that there's an even smaller

717
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:06,780
subset who are really good at finding

718
00:48:06,780 --> 00:48:08,819
crap products like they are the first

719
00:48:08,819 --> 00:48:10,619
ones that go out and who bought a Zune

720
00:48:10,619 --> 00:48:13,200
you might be one of those people so that

721
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:15,060
that's what this is about is basically

722
00:48:15,060 --> 00:48:16,380
they've identified this group of

723
00:48:16,380 --> 00:48:17,940
consumers and they're tracking them now

724
00:48:17,940 --> 00:48:20,400
and they're saying hey uh you know

725
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:21,960
what's going to fail is this group

726
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:23,579
buying it that's not good for your

727
00:48:23,579 --> 00:48:25,920
product just FYI and conversely there's

728
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:27,240
other people who are really good at

729
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:28,920
finding stuff early on

730
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:30,480
uh there's a really fascinating book

731
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:31,859
that dives into this a little more it's

732
00:48:31,859 --> 00:48:33,540
called super forecasting and what they

733
00:48:33,540 --> 00:48:35,579
found is they actually did like analytic

734
00:48:35,579 --> 00:48:37,680
competitions with people from all over

735
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:39,240
the defense and intelligence space as

736
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:41,400
well as just average folks uh there's a

737
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:43,319
retired geologist from Arizona who has

738
00:48:43,319 --> 00:48:45,660
his coffee every morning in Iowa reads

739
00:48:45,660 --> 00:48:47,760
the New York Times and outperforms all

740
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:49,680
the entire CIA with his analytic

741
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:51,599
predictions and you know he's doing it

742
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:53,040
with just yeah this is how I think the

743
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:54,420
world's going to work they're just

744
00:48:54,420 --> 00:48:56,819
phenomenal so this is my attempt at

745
00:48:56,819 --> 00:48:58,500
trying to be scholarly now I looked all

746
00:48:58,500 --> 00:48:59,880
this information understanding this is

747
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:01,440
how the world works and I came up with

748
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:02,819
the Woodward cyber threat intelligence

749
00:49:02,819 --> 00:49:04,619
theorem that says there exists within

750
00:49:04,619 --> 00:49:06,180
the realm of Open Source and readily

751
00:49:06,180 --> 00:49:08,220
available intelligence certain outliers

752
00:49:08,220 --> 00:49:09,839
that are able to provide actionable High

753
00:49:09,839 --> 00:49:11,640
Fidelity intelligence at an extremely

754
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:13,560
high velocity significantly ahead of the

755
00:49:13,560 --> 00:49:15,420
vast majority these people are your

756
00:49:15,420 --> 00:49:16,740
crystal ball they're going to help you

757
00:49:16,740 --> 00:49:19,920
see into the future okay great how do I

758
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:21,240
go find them

759
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:22,680
hmm

760
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:25,740
so this is an example of one of the ways

761
00:49:25,740 --> 00:49:26,640
that I've been able to start finding

762
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:29,280
these folks this is a Blog from zscaler

763
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:31,260
in June 2020 they've got all the

764
00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:32,819
indicators of compromise down at the

765
00:49:32,819 --> 00:49:34,680
bottom if you take that and you throw it

766
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:36,060
onto Twitter and see who was talking

767
00:49:36,060 --> 00:49:38,040
about it beforehand boom this guy was

768
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:40,440
talking about those exact same iocs a

769
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:43,440
week ahead of time oh hey I found me a

770
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:44,760
little uh soothsayer here who can see

771
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:46,200
the future I like this guy he's talking

772
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:47,640
about stuff that's very important later

773
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:48,420
on

774
00:49:48,420 --> 00:49:51,180
vice versa this is right after wasted

775
00:49:51,180 --> 00:49:52,859
lockers showed up on the scene in summer

776
00:49:52,859 --> 00:49:55,880
2020 they would go on to hit Garmin GPS

777
00:49:55,880 --> 00:49:58,859
so they published this huge article and

778
00:49:58,859 --> 00:50:00,180
I can tell you from personal experience

779
00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:01,920
that URL at the bottom was very

780
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:03,839
important and so when I throw that into

781
00:50:03,839 --> 00:50:05,819
Twitter sure enough Vitale kremis was

782
00:50:05,819 --> 00:50:07,380
talking about it about a week ahead of

783
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:09,359
time he's another outlier I need to pay

784
00:50:09,359 --> 00:50:10,800
attention to this guy he's saying stuff

785
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:12,720
that's important to me

786
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:15,780
so let's step back for a second and talk

787
00:50:15,780 --> 00:50:17,339
about threat hunting and how do we do

788
00:50:17,339 --> 00:50:19,140
that because sometimes your boss gets an

789
00:50:19,140 --> 00:50:20,940
email from DHS or he's on the CIO

790
00:50:20,940 --> 00:50:23,579
mailing list and they say Hey There Was

791
00:50:23,579 --> 00:50:25,079
An irgc campaign that was doing

792
00:50:25,079 --> 00:50:26,940
malicious ransomware here's all these

793
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:28,800
indicators and your boss says go threat

794
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:31,680
hunt and you say cool uh what time frame

795
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:33,380
because we only have logs for six months

796
00:50:33,380 --> 00:50:36,660
well I don't know so check this out go

797
00:50:36,660 --> 00:50:38,579
through there find the hash throw that

798
00:50:38,579 --> 00:50:41,040
into virustotal go to the details down

799
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:42,119
at the bottom you've got first

800
00:50:42,119 --> 00:50:44,579
submission and that tells you when some

801
00:50:44,579 --> 00:50:46,260
unlucky Analyst at Lockheed Martin or

802
00:50:46,260 --> 00:50:47,460
somewhere found it that morning and

803
00:50:47,460 --> 00:50:48,960
threw it into virus total just so you

804
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:50,700
know when to go threat hunt now this

805
00:50:50,700 --> 00:50:52,140
tells us two things a couple things

806
00:50:52,140 --> 00:50:54,119
actually you can use this to kind of get

807
00:50:54,119 --> 00:50:56,099
an idea of how fast the government is is

808
00:50:56,099 --> 00:50:58,260
providing iocs and nine months is pretty

809
00:50:58,260 --> 00:51:00,960
typical also we now know that if we only

810
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:02,579
have six months of logs and this is now

811
00:51:02,579 --> 00:51:05,099
10 months out sorry there's not probably

812
00:51:05,099 --> 00:51:06,720
there's very low Fidelity chance that

813
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:08,099
I'm going to get anything worthwhile out

814
00:51:08,099 --> 00:51:10,020
of this but also look at that date

815
00:51:10,020 --> 00:51:12,540
January 2nd this also if this is a

816
00:51:12,540 --> 00:51:13,859
threat actor I'm tracking and I'm

817
00:51:13,859 --> 00:51:15,599
worried about what's this tells about

818
00:51:15,599 --> 00:51:17,220
how they operate they like to hit during

819
00:51:17,220 --> 00:51:18,599
the holidays that was the first day

820
00:51:18,599 --> 00:51:20,160
after the New Year's holiday that

821
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:21,780
somebody came in checked out some

822
00:51:21,780 --> 00:51:24,000
suspicious emails and Bam we got money

823
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,220
here so we're also able to kind of like

824
00:51:26,220 --> 00:51:27,900
derive more from the story looking at

825
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:30,920
the metadata if you will

826
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:33,480
uh furthermore what you can do take that

827
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:36,059
hash throw it into Twitter you can use

828
00:51:36,059 --> 00:51:37,380
the advanced search feature on Twitter

829
00:51:37,380 --> 00:51:39,900
to specify time frames and Bam here's

830
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:41,280
the default report talking about those

831
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:43,740
exact same hashes uh way before again

832
00:51:43,740 --> 00:51:46,880
DHS that's about four three months after

833
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:49,980
virus total but still they're seeing the

834
00:51:49,980 --> 00:51:51,720
future long before everyone else that's

835
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:53,160
another account I want to pay attention

836
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:54,059
to

837
00:51:54,059 --> 00:51:56,160
all right now another big thing that I

838
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:57,180
was dealing with at the time was

839
00:51:57,180 --> 00:51:59,099
ransomware URLs where do you go to get

840
00:51:59,099 --> 00:52:01,200
those well at the time rants uh Twitter

841
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:03,300
was kind of weird about posting links to

842
00:52:03,300 --> 00:52:05,040
hacked content so people would post

843
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:07,020
screenshots of ransomware notes and so

844
00:52:07,020 --> 00:52:09,660
bam just go look for avadon ransomware

845
00:52:09,660 --> 00:52:11,760
and here's somebody posting a screenshot

846
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:14,520
of the URL awesome now lock bit for

847
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:15,780
whatever reason their infrastructure

848
00:52:15,780 --> 00:52:17,460
would spin up and spin down sometimes

849
00:52:17,460 --> 00:52:19,200
multiple times a day coming up with new

850
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:22,680
DOT onion URLs so this stuff is very

851
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:25,079
Dynamic it moves a lot and the lockpick

852
00:52:25,079 --> 00:52:27,240
URLs sometimes got insanely long like 30

853
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:28,859
characters so when you're on that call

854
00:52:28,859 --> 00:52:30,480
with the client and your boss is asking

855
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:32,160
for info and you're trying to hand Jam

856
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:34,020
that big long URL and that's not going

857
00:52:34,020 --> 00:52:35,940
to work so that's when you can just take

858
00:52:35,940 --> 00:52:37,920
that image throw it into online OCR

859
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:39,900
websites and Bam it'll just pop out the

860
00:52:39,900 --> 00:52:42,780
URL oh that's nice

861
00:52:42,780 --> 00:52:44,099
all right

862
00:52:44,099 --> 00:52:46,859
now once upon a time for about five days

863
00:52:46,859 --> 00:52:48,780
straight the phone call was ringing off

864
00:52:48,780 --> 00:52:50,280
the hook at this point and we noticed

865
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:51,660
you know we were asking the client do

866
00:52:51,660 --> 00:52:53,400
you have RDP open no no we're not stupid

867
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:57,540
okay good uh so uh and that's anyway uh

868
00:52:57,540 --> 00:53:00,119
what kind of VPN are you using fortigate

869
00:53:00,119 --> 00:53:02,040
40 gate 48 kept on coming up that's

870
00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:04,319
weird so I'm scratching my head this is

871
00:53:04,319 --> 00:53:06,119
definitely a trend about two-thirds of

872
00:53:06,119 --> 00:53:07,559
people reporting they're using 40 Gates

873
00:53:07,559 --> 00:53:09,480
so I start asking around a friend tells

874
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:13,140
me yeah check out cve 2018 1337 9. was

875
00:53:13,140 --> 00:53:14,579
it some kind of zero day no it's two

876
00:53:14,579 --> 00:53:15,540
years old

877
00:53:15,540 --> 00:53:18,119
that's a clue about how dumb this was so

878
00:53:18,119 --> 00:53:20,640
uh go look at that and basically this is

879
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:21,720
just the proof of cut this is the

880
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:25,140
exploit code you just Target your url do

881
00:53:25,140 --> 00:53:26,400
a bunch of slashes and it just

882
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:27,839
automatically pukes out the username and

883
00:53:27,839 --> 00:53:30,359
passwords fantastic that's easy right

884
00:53:30,359 --> 00:53:33,240
but if you go and throw that into DHS

885
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:35,220
it's been mentioned a lot very important

886
00:53:35,220 --> 00:53:38,579
so good news uh just use MFA if for

887
00:53:38,579 --> 00:53:39,900
whatever reason you can't update you're

888
00:53:39,900 --> 00:53:43,380
good bad news summer of 2020 a new cve

889
00:53:43,380 --> 00:53:45,480
comes out the nvd description is

890
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:47,819
literally the POC just change the case

891
00:53:47,819 --> 00:53:50,579
of the username in other words admin

892
00:53:50,579 --> 00:53:53,280
equals MFA admin all caps come on in

893
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:55,200
we're open for business can you believe

894
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:59,160
the kids call this hacking so

895
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:01,380
something else I want to point out uh we

896
00:54:01,380 --> 00:54:03,680
have overused and abused the term apt

897
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:05,700
organizations have absolutely hidden

898
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:07,559
behind stuff of this level of pathetic

899
00:54:07,559 --> 00:54:09,599
sophistication and said oh man this was

900
00:54:09,599 --> 00:54:12,000
Unstoppable this was a tactic in apt

901
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:15,480
uses yes but that's no excuse for not

902
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:16,920
patching a three-year-old vulnerability

903
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:19,740
so if from now on can we just agree if

904
00:54:19,740 --> 00:54:21,480
we're going to say it was an apt attack

905
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:22,680
we're going to put our cards on the

906
00:54:22,680 --> 00:54:24,420
table and say hey here's what happened

907
00:54:24,420 --> 00:54:25,980
because you can't just hide behind that

908
00:54:25,980 --> 00:54:28,559
anymore it's BS I'm throwing the BS flag

909
00:54:28,559 --> 00:54:30,359
now permanently unless you actually show

910
00:54:30,359 --> 00:54:32,900
what happened

911
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:36,180
oh all right so remember osin can't find

912
00:54:36,180 --> 00:54:37,980
everything some things are just too

913
00:54:37,980 --> 00:54:40,380
hidden uh you need folks with access to

914
00:54:40,380 --> 00:54:41,400
stuff

915
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:43,020
so enter

916
00:54:43,020 --> 00:54:45,059
my homies here the slack channels the

917
00:54:45,059 --> 00:54:47,099
Discord channels all that good stuff

918
00:54:47,099 --> 00:54:49,260
uh these aren't just for chatting they

919
00:54:49,260 --> 00:54:51,780
are gold mines uh some examples uh I

920
00:54:51,780 --> 00:54:54,000
don't have time but there's some great

921
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,339
examples of relationships I've been able

922
00:54:56,339 --> 00:54:57,839
to form on there and information people

923
00:54:57,839 --> 00:54:59,819
have been able to give me and whatnot uh

924
00:54:59,819 --> 00:55:01,380
you know I will tell the story so the

925
00:55:01,380 --> 00:55:02,640
ransomware groups were supposedly

926
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:04,740
writing pen test reports because they

927
00:55:04,740 --> 00:55:06,300
were just pen testers right giving you

928
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:08,940
an unexpected pen test and what they

929
00:55:08,940 --> 00:55:10,619
would so I said hey does anyone have a

930
00:55:10,619 --> 00:55:12,000
copy of one of these reports and sure

931
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,920
enough I get a DM hey yeah check this

932
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:15,480
out and basically it was haha I was like

933
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:17,520
Borat wrote it stupid American you did

934
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:20,280
not close RDP I opened up RDP I get into

935
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:22,079
your system haha and it literally said

936
00:55:22,079 --> 00:55:24,420
stupid American on there so that told

937
00:55:24,420 --> 00:55:25,800
you what the quality of these pen test

938
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:27,720
reports were

939
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:30,180
uh if you're not sure what to post get

940
00:55:30,180 --> 00:55:32,760
in there and just post random stuff post

941
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:34,859
memes post cool articles or just ask

942
00:55:34,859 --> 00:55:37,740
chat GPT uh I went through last night on

943
00:55:37,740 --> 00:55:40,559
the cactuscon Discord and I was copied

944
00:55:40,559 --> 00:55:42,119
some of the text I threw it into chat

945
00:55:42,119 --> 00:55:44,040
GPT I said hey what should I post next

946
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:45,420
and it's like gave me some great ideas

947
00:55:45,420 --> 00:55:46,980
so if you don't even have any social

948
00:55:46,980 --> 00:55:48,660
skills that's okay you can Outsource

949
00:55:48,660 --> 00:55:51,740
your social skills

950
00:55:52,260 --> 00:55:54,240
do get involved in the community post

951
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:55,800
stuff regular post interesting contact

952
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:57,420
things you learn crazy tweets whatever

953
00:55:57,420 --> 00:55:59,700
don't just be a bump on the log and show

954
00:55:59,700 --> 00:56:01,380
up one day looking for help those people

955
00:56:01,380 --> 00:56:03,000
do exist and I've been them every once

956
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,859
in a while because I'm in a bad way but

957
00:56:04,859 --> 00:56:06,420
the kind of information that you can

958
00:56:06,420 --> 00:56:07,920
gain in the relationships you can form

959
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:10,920
are fantastic that being said uh I

960
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:12,059
wanted to give out a huge thought out

961
00:56:12,059 --> 00:56:14,160
and thank you to cactuscon folks for

[Music]

978
00:56:57,859 --> 00:57:00,119
you know what I'm not controlling this

979
00:57:00,119 --> 00:57:03,619
oh can I control here

980
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:06,180
will this cycle back around or just end

981
00:57:06,180 --> 00:57:09,300
nope can you put the link back up the

982
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:12,800
the resource URL

983
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:15,960
any other questions

984
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:19,280
a couple here yes sir

985
00:57:22,559 --> 00:57:24,119
so we're seeing a lot of layoffs right

986
00:57:24,119 --> 00:57:26,040
now in the tech World recession coming

987
00:57:26,040 --> 00:57:27,960
what can people do based on your

988
00:57:27,960 --> 00:57:29,880
feedback or experience to prepare for

989
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:31,559
that if they feel like

990
00:57:31,559 --> 00:57:34,619
the Optics at the places they work are

991
00:57:34,619 --> 00:57:36,599
talking about layoffs and they could be

992
00:57:36,599 --> 00:57:38,520
coming what should people do to prepare

993
00:57:38,520 --> 00:57:40,619
yeah no so that's a great Point um again

994
00:57:40,619 --> 00:57:43,220
going back to these organizations these

995
00:57:43,220 --> 00:57:45,660
these communities is I've had you know

996
00:57:45,660 --> 00:57:47,280
job offers come up as an offer that are

997
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:48,540
you know just hey would you be

998
00:57:48,540 --> 00:57:50,640
interested in this so this is a way to

999
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:52,020
kind of fireproof yourself because

1000
00:57:52,020 --> 00:57:53,160
you're exactly right that's a great

1001
00:57:53,160 --> 00:57:54,540
Point thank you because I actually

1002
00:57:54,540 --> 00:57:55,680
wanted to make that but I was trying to

1003
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:57,240
get along for the time so thank you for

1004
00:57:57,240 --> 00:57:59,579
asking that uh and also all of these

1005
00:57:59,579 --> 00:58:01,740
chats also do have a jobs channel for

1006
00:58:01,740 --> 00:58:03,240
exactly that sort of thing every once in

1007
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:04,680
a while someone says hey I got laid off

1008
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:08,099
or myself personally uh in dc480 we've

1009
00:58:08,099 --> 00:58:09,359
probably helped four or five people get

1010
00:58:09,359 --> 00:58:11,280
jobs in the last year just because when

1011
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:13,200
you put that out to that Community uh

1012
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:14,819
what happened to me was I had one friend

1013
00:58:14,819 --> 00:58:16,920
in particular who was in a rough spot so

1014
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:19,500
every recruiter who hit me on LinkedIn I

1015
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:21,420
said I'm not interested right now but I

1016
00:58:21,420 --> 00:58:23,280
know somebody who might be and through

1017
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:24,780
that we were able to get her a new job

1018
00:58:24,780 --> 00:58:27,180
and whatnot so if you're on LinkedIn and

1019
00:58:27,180 --> 00:58:28,380
you're getting those annoying recruiter

1020
00:58:28,380 --> 00:58:29,880
things don't just ignore them sometimes

1021
00:58:29,880 --> 00:58:32,040
you can do a lot of good with those not

1022
00:58:32,040 --> 00:58:33,660
just for your friends but also for those

1023
00:58:33,660 --> 00:58:35,160
recruiters and you never know how that's

1024
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:37,140
going to work out down down the road and

1025
00:58:37,140 --> 00:58:38,460
I'm not just saying that to you know hey

1026
00:58:38,460 --> 00:58:41,280
just exploit everyone around you no be a

1027
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:44,220
good person like help out these folks

1028
00:58:44,220 --> 00:58:45,900
have a job to do too if you can help

1029
00:58:45,900 --> 00:58:47,220
them out what's it going to cost you to

1030
00:58:47,220 --> 00:58:50,660
just say hey hit up my friend over here

1031
00:58:52,740 --> 00:58:55,520

01:09:01,939 --> 01:09:04,738
for attending my talk my name is David

1076
01:09:04,738 --> 01:09:07,080
Gilman I'm a senior security engineer at

1077
01:09:07,080 --> 01:09:09,839
instacart I've been in the industry for

1078
01:09:09,839 --> 01:09:12,299
about five years before that I worked in

1079
01:09:12,299 --> 01:09:14,100
product management for a few years

1080
01:09:14,100 --> 01:09:16,799
before that I went to Texas A M which

1081
01:09:16,799 --> 01:09:18,179
where I'm from there's probably a lot of

1082
01:09:18,179 --> 01:09:19,560
Aggies in the audience but here probably

1083
01:09:19,560 --> 01:09:22,080
blank faces and I also went to Georgia

1084
01:09:22,080 --> 01:09:23,759
Tech for my Master's Degree in cyber

1085
01:09:23,759 --> 01:09:25,920
security and I've mostly worked an

1086
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:28,259
application and Cloud Security in my

1087
01:09:28,259 --> 01:09:29,580
career

1088
01:09:29,580 --> 01:09:32,339
and I recently moved from Austin to

1089
01:09:32,339 --> 01:09:34,620
Phoenix last year some pictures I took

1090
01:09:34,620 --> 01:09:36,719
kind of from my Instagram but my fiance

1091
01:09:36,719 --> 01:09:38,100
and I and our dog have been loving it

1092
01:09:38,100 --> 01:09:40,738
here it's a beautiful state really a lot

1093
01:09:40,738 --> 01:09:42,420
better in terms of hiking opportunities

1094
01:09:42,420 --> 01:09:46,020
than Texas so really enjoyed our time in

1095
01:09:46,020 --> 01:09:50,179
Phoenix and in Arizona as a whole so far

1096
01:09:50,219 --> 01:09:52,380
so why did I decide to present on this

1097
01:09:52,380 --> 01:09:55,020
topic well when I was at a previous

1098
01:09:55,020 --> 01:09:57,960
employer we dealt with a lot of data

1099
01:09:57,960 --> 01:10:00,239
which is not unusual but our business

1100
01:10:00,239 --> 01:10:01,739
model meant that we also had a lot of

1101
01:10:01,739 --> 01:10:03,960
egress data so data leaving our Cloud

1102
01:10:03,960 --> 01:10:06,420
environment and going to other networks

1103
01:10:06,420 --> 01:10:09,600
in other clouds or on-prem networks

1104
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:11,580
which is somewhat unusual having that

1105
01:10:11,580 --> 01:10:14,699
ratio uh and I learned that for one

1106
01:10:14,699 --> 01:10:16,980
thing AWS makes it hard and expensive

1107
01:10:16,980 --> 01:10:19,440
for data to leave your network

1108
01:10:19,440 --> 01:10:21,420
um and these challenges led me to

1109
01:10:21,420 --> 01:10:23,760
looking to looking for a few Solutions

1110
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:25,860
so how to avoid having public IPS

1111
01:10:25,860 --> 01:10:28,980
without having large costs uh also how

1112
01:10:28,980 --> 01:10:31,020
to secure egress as a whole which is a

1113
01:10:31,020 --> 01:10:33,600
related topic and egress filtering it's

1114
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:35,040
something that everyone is supposed to

1115
01:10:35,040 --> 01:10:37,800
do but pretty much no one does or maybe

1116
01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:40,620
you do but uh your neighbor probably

1117
01:10:40,620 --> 01:10:42,420
doesn't at least

1118
01:10:42,420 --> 01:10:45,120
this is a quote from an article you may

1119
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:46,679
be familiar with the article from 2006

1120
01:10:46,679 --> 01:10:50,520
by Marcus ranam he said that this dumb

1121
01:10:50,520 --> 01:10:53,159
idea default permit crops up in a lot of

1122
01:10:53,159 --> 01:10:54,900
different forms it's incredibly

1123
01:10:54,900 --> 01:10:57,540
persistent and difficult to eradicate

1124
01:10:57,540 --> 01:11:00,780
why because it's so attractive systems

1125
01:11:00,780 --> 01:11:02,460
based on default permit are the computer

1126
01:11:02,460 --> 01:11:04,100
security equivalent of empty calories

1127
01:11:04,100 --> 01:11:08,340
tasty yet fattening and essentially in

1128
01:11:08,340 --> 01:11:10,920
the egress filtering context this is the

1129
01:11:10,920 --> 01:11:12,540
idea of just allowing all having no

1130
01:11:12,540 --> 01:11:15,900
egress filtering or having a

1131
01:11:15,900 --> 01:11:18,659
list of band indicators of compromise or

1132
01:11:18,659 --> 01:11:21,780
malicious IPS or domains it's especially

1133
01:11:21,780 --> 01:11:23,580
hard to maintain an allow list in a

1134
01:11:23,580 --> 01:11:27,360
networking context because who or what

1135
01:11:27,360 --> 01:11:28,860
something is talking to

1136
01:11:28,860 --> 01:11:30,120
can be defined in a lot of different

1137
01:11:30,120 --> 01:11:32,699
ways even for just a given request or a

1138
01:11:32,699 --> 01:11:34,679
given connection we can be thinking

1139
01:11:34,679 --> 01:11:36,780
about things like domain name query

1140
01:11:36,780 --> 01:11:39,260
versus the Sni Associated that request

1141
01:11:39,260 --> 01:11:42,900
DNS rebinding attacks where one domain

1142
01:11:42,900 --> 01:11:45,179
name may be one IP at one point and a

1143
01:11:45,179 --> 01:11:46,860
different IP at a different point

1144
01:11:46,860 --> 01:11:48,840
uh we also think about things like DNS

1145
01:11:48,840 --> 01:11:51,480
load balancing where one DNS resolution

1146
01:11:51,480 --> 01:11:53,040
for non-malicious reasons will return

1147
01:11:53,040 --> 01:11:54,960
different IPS or a list of ips for

1148
01:11:54,960 --> 01:11:56,340
different requests from different places

1149
01:11:56,340 --> 01:11:58,320
or at different times and this can

1150
01:11:58,320 --> 01:12:01,320
complicate this idea of what is the

1151
01:12:01,320 --> 01:12:04,860
allowed set of machines or networks that

1152
01:12:04,860 --> 01:12:08,159
our machines and networks can talk to

1153
01:12:08,159 --> 01:12:09,900
and of course we also have buzzwords

1154
01:12:09,900 --> 01:12:12,239
log4j uh

1155
01:12:12,239 --> 01:12:14,219
solarwinds these are of course real

1156
01:12:14,219 --> 01:12:15,780
incidents and they're also I think at

1157
01:12:15,780 --> 01:12:17,159
this point a little bit of buzzwords

1158
01:12:17,159 --> 01:12:19,440
vendors try to sell us on these threats

1159
01:12:19,440 --> 01:12:21,600
you know putting them in subject lines

1160
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:23,940
of emails that we didn't ask for but

1161
01:12:23,940 --> 01:12:25,620
they are legitimate threats and they

1162
01:12:25,620 --> 01:12:29,120
were legitimate attacks these that uh

1163
01:12:29,120 --> 01:12:32,420
these attacks represent sort of a set of

1164
01:12:32,420 --> 01:12:36,540
either third-party compromise or

1165
01:12:36,540 --> 01:12:38,820
easily exploitable be a remote attack

1166
01:12:38,820 --> 01:12:41,280
remote code execution any Grist

1167
01:12:41,280 --> 01:12:42,900
filtering is a pretty legitimate defense

1168
01:12:42,900 --> 01:12:44,940
against both of these types of attacks

1169
01:12:44,940 --> 01:12:47,760
and the broader set of attacks that they

1170
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:49,920
represent

1171
01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:52,560
so you might be thinking

1172
01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:55,080
well we control our servers we don't

1173
01:12:55,080 --> 01:12:57,420
need to limit egress because we control

1174
01:12:57,420 --> 01:12:59,400
what runs on them so therefore they can

1175
01:12:59,400 --> 01:13:02,159
only be talking to things that we tell

1176
01:13:02,159 --> 01:13:04,320
our application code or our installed

1177
01:13:04,320 --> 01:13:06,600
Commercial Services but in reality I

1178
01:13:06,600 --> 01:13:07,980
would argue we don't always control what

1179
01:13:07,980 --> 01:13:09,960
runs on our hosts

1180
01:13:09,960 --> 01:13:11,880
for one thing there's Garden variety

1181
01:13:11,880 --> 01:13:14,100
malware and this could get persistence

1182
01:13:14,100 --> 01:13:15,900
on machines through a variety or your

1183
01:13:15,900 --> 01:13:18,840
network through a variety of methods we

1184
01:13:18,840 --> 01:13:20,340
have of course supply chain attacks sort

1185
01:13:20,340 --> 01:13:22,260
of the solar winds or open source

1186
01:13:22,260 --> 01:13:25,500
security type attack where a open source

1187
01:13:25,500 --> 01:13:27,900
maintainer is compromised or a

1188
01:13:27,900 --> 01:13:29,520
third-party commercial tool is

1189
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:31,679
compromised and then they're running

1190
01:13:31,679 --> 01:13:33,840
malicious code that unbeknownst to you

1191
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:36,420
is beaconing home

1192
01:13:36,420 --> 01:13:38,820
similarly to malware for those of us in

1193
01:13:38,820 --> 01:13:41,219
the appsec space thinking about someone

1194
01:13:41,219 --> 01:13:43,679
who gets reverse shells or rce in our

1195
01:13:43,679 --> 01:13:45,239
code because of a vulnerability a

1196
01:13:45,239 --> 01:13:47,820
developer created or again a

1197
01:13:47,820 --> 01:13:51,320
vulnerability and maybe third-party code

1198
01:13:52,140 --> 01:13:55,280
if a attacker already has network access

1199
01:13:55,280 --> 01:13:57,960
or local access they can use this

1200
01:13:57,960 --> 01:14:00,659
network access to exfiltrate data

1201
01:14:00,659 --> 01:14:01,980
you can also think about malicious

1202
01:14:01,980 --> 01:14:03,780
insiders whether that's a literal

1203
01:14:03,780 --> 01:14:06,480
malicious Insider a developer or a

1204
01:14:06,480 --> 01:14:08,280
contractor who for whatever reason is

1205
01:14:08,280 --> 01:14:10,440
doing something they shouldn't or their

1206
01:14:10,440 --> 01:14:12,060
account has been compromised in some way

1207
01:14:12,060 --> 01:14:14,520
and they have shell access in your

1208
01:14:14,520 --> 01:14:16,320
production systems how are they going to

1209
01:14:16,320 --> 01:14:19,699
get that data out of your network

1210
01:14:20,640 --> 01:14:23,520
also similar to just general rce you

1211
01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:25,380
think about crypto jacking which as I

1212
01:14:25,380 --> 01:14:27,060
understand for my research motivates a

1213
01:14:27,060 --> 01:14:29,520
lot of the attacks in the

1214
01:14:29,520 --> 01:14:32,219
AWS or Cloud space are really just

1215
01:14:32,219 --> 01:14:34,020
mundane cryptojacking attacks where

1216
01:14:34,020 --> 01:14:36,300
someone wants to get rce they have some

1217
01:14:36,300 --> 01:14:37,739
bone or they know some common

1218
01:14:37,739 --> 01:14:41,040
misconfiguration they'll scan the AWS IP

1219
01:14:41,040 --> 01:14:43,560
space and find issues that find these

1220
01:14:43,560 --> 01:14:45,659
issues and then use them to run crypto

1221
01:14:45,659 --> 01:14:47,760
mining software

1222
01:14:47,760 --> 01:14:49,080
and then lastly of course we have

1223
01:14:49,080 --> 01:14:50,940
compliance so I'll talk about this in a

1224
01:14:50,940 --> 01:14:53,580
second but PCI compliance which we don't

1225
01:14:53,580 --> 01:14:55,020
all have to deal with but it's

1226
01:14:55,020 --> 01:14:57,540
relatively common requires not allowing

1227
01:14:57,540 --> 01:14:59,040
unauthorized outbound traffic to the

1228
01:14:59,040 --> 01:15:00,960
internet specifically and other

1229
01:15:00,960 --> 01:15:02,580
compliance regimes that you may be

1230
01:15:02,580 --> 01:15:05,100
subject to have similar requirements

1231
01:15:05,100 --> 01:15:09,080
so in the latest version of PCI pci4

1232
01:15:09,080 --> 01:15:12,239
it states that explicitly outbound

1233
01:15:12,239 --> 01:15:13,159
traffic

1234
01:15:13,159 --> 01:15:16,800
from your network is restricted to only

1235
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:18,840
traffic that is necessary and all other

1236
01:15:18,840 --> 01:15:20,820
traffic is specifically denied

1237
01:15:20,820 --> 01:15:24,360
which would I would argue imply a

1238
01:15:24,360 --> 01:15:26,219
an allow list based approach rather than

1239
01:15:26,219 --> 01:15:28,080
a the night list approach

1240
01:15:28,080 --> 01:15:30,600
so now that I've kind of laid out why I

1241
01:15:30,600 --> 01:15:32,280
think it's concerning I'm going to

1242
01:15:32,280 --> 01:15:33,540
circle back and explain a little bit

1243
01:15:33,540 --> 01:15:35,460
kind of from the basics about what I'm

1244
01:15:35,460 --> 01:15:37,260
referring to in case some of that didn't

1245
01:15:37,260 --> 01:15:38,820
make as much sense or at least make sure

1246
01:15:38,820 --> 01:15:41,219
we're all on the same page

1247
01:15:41,219 --> 01:15:43,620
so here's my crew diagram here

1248
01:15:43,620 --> 01:15:46,980
illustrating your network in web server

1249
01:15:46,980 --> 01:15:49,040
environments or maybe you have an API

1250
01:15:49,040 --> 01:15:51,780
you're serving some service or website

1251
01:15:51,780 --> 01:15:54,960
to the internet you uh will be purposely

1252
01:15:54,960 --> 01:15:58,020
exposing probably Port 443 so the net

1253
01:15:58,020 --> 01:16:00,659
clients on the internet so think of this

1254
01:16:00,659 --> 01:16:02,580
as someone on their phone or their

1255
01:16:02,580 --> 01:16:05,040
laptop or making requests to your

1256
01:16:05,040 --> 01:16:07,260
network probably via a domain name but

1257
01:16:07,260 --> 01:16:09,360
it gets routed to your compute instances

1258
01:16:09,360 --> 01:16:11,400
which are behind a network firewall and

1259
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:14,040
or a security group in Cloud environment

1260
01:16:14,040 --> 01:16:16,860
and then we've purposely let Port 443 be

1261
01:16:16,860 --> 01:16:19,500
open so that we can respond to requests

1262
01:16:19,500 --> 01:16:21,480
and then you know we of course we're

1263
01:16:21,480 --> 01:16:23,580
good Security Professionals so we don't

1264
01:16:23,580 --> 01:16:25,380
allow Port 22 to be open because as we

1265
01:16:25,380 --> 01:16:28,320
all know then someone could SSH into our

1266
01:16:28,320 --> 01:16:31,140
servers and everything will be pwned so

1267
01:16:31,140 --> 01:16:33,239
the problem here of course is that this

1268
01:16:33,239 --> 01:16:34,679
isn't a sufficient control though I mean

1269
01:16:34,679 --> 01:16:36,120
there's a really a whole area of

1270
01:16:36,120 --> 01:16:38,699
security web or application security

1271
01:16:38,699 --> 01:16:41,280
that revolves around traffic that is

1272
01:16:41,280 --> 01:16:44,580
allowed on that Port 443 or Port 80 web

1273
01:16:44,580 --> 01:16:47,540
security so we can think about

1274
01:16:47,540 --> 01:16:50,640
using a WAFF but at the end of the day

1275
01:16:50,640 --> 01:16:54,000
by Design in this case our servers are

1276
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,100
purposefully allowing requests from the

1277
01:16:56,100 --> 01:16:57,960
internet and so at a network layer we

1278
01:16:57,960 --> 01:17:00,780
have to allow these types of quests

1279
01:17:00,780 --> 01:17:03,300
so for egress what happens most is well

1280
01:17:03,300 --> 01:17:05,880
what egress is like Ingress but opposite

1281
01:17:05,880 --> 01:17:09,600
uh in this case our servers or our hosts

1282
01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:12,540
or compute instances are making the

1283
01:17:12,540 --> 01:17:14,340
requests to something else

1284
01:17:14,340 --> 01:17:15,780
and that might be on the internet it

1285
01:17:15,780 --> 01:17:18,780
might be on uh some other private

1286
01:17:18,780 --> 01:17:21,300
Network within Cloud but

1287
01:17:21,300 --> 01:17:23,940
it is in this case essentially what we

1288
01:17:23,940 --> 01:17:25,440
think of as our servers are acting as

1289
01:17:25,440 --> 01:17:26,520
clients

1290
01:17:26,520 --> 01:17:29,400
so why would this happen and it's not

1291
01:17:29,400 --> 01:17:31,260
necessarily bad there's lots of

1292
01:17:31,260 --> 01:17:33,000
legitimate reasons

1293
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:35,820
one is software updates so hosts or

1294
01:17:35,820 --> 01:17:38,400
software running on hosts needs to

1295
01:17:38,400 --> 01:17:40,320
download the newest updates it'll need

1296
01:17:40,320 --> 01:17:41,940
to make an outbound request in order to

1297
01:17:41,940 --> 01:17:44,460
get a list of diffs download that

1298
01:17:44,460 --> 01:17:47,280
software and it will in many models it

1299
01:17:47,280 --> 01:17:48,540
will be the one originating these

1300
01:17:48,540 --> 01:17:51,000
requests and serving as a client

1301
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,760
and this also applies to cicd so when we

1302
01:17:53,760 --> 01:17:55,679
have these really noisy full

1303
01:17:55,679 --> 01:17:57,300
vulnerability servers in our build

1304
01:17:57,300 --> 01:17:58,580
pipeline

1305
01:17:58,580 --> 01:18:01,380
that are requesting

1306
01:18:01,380 --> 01:18:03,500
artifacts information

1307
01:18:03,500 --> 01:18:06,060
getting the updates to install and build

1308
01:18:06,060 --> 01:18:08,820
Docker containers these typically unless

1309
01:18:08,820 --> 01:18:10,860
you've taken steps to avoid this need to

1310
01:18:10,860 --> 01:18:14,760
make requests out to different websites

1311
01:18:14,760 --> 01:18:17,219
servers to get those dependencies and

1312
01:18:17,219 --> 01:18:19,760
artifacts

1313
01:18:20,880 --> 01:18:23,340
it's also just business cases so

1314
01:18:23,340 --> 01:18:25,140
typically for a large enough company or

1315
01:18:25,140 --> 01:18:26,640
one of the complex enough business model

1316
01:18:26,640 --> 01:18:28,679
we'll need to exchange data with our

1317
01:18:28,679 --> 01:18:31,140
partners and customers and maybe they

1318
01:18:31,140 --> 01:18:34,020
initiate that data sharing through FTP

1319
01:18:34,020 --> 01:18:36,540
that we're hosting or through an API

1320
01:18:36,540 --> 01:18:39,360
that we host and expose but we may need

1321
01:18:39,360 --> 01:18:42,360
to make requests to their apis get data

1322
01:18:42,360 --> 01:18:44,940
from our partners about billing

1323
01:18:44,940 --> 01:18:46,440
it really depends on your business model

1324
01:18:46,440 --> 01:18:47,760
but I'm sure you can think of a number

1325
01:18:47,760 --> 01:18:49,920
of cases for your organization where you

1326
01:18:49,920 --> 01:18:51,300
currently are making requests like this

1327
01:18:51,300 --> 01:18:53,300
to someone else's API or Services

1328
01:18:53,300 --> 01:18:57,360
sending or downloading data via SFTP

1329
01:18:57,360 --> 01:18:59,400
there's also logging and security agents

1330
01:18:59,400 --> 01:19:02,040
so again not in all cases but in some or

1331
01:19:02,040 --> 01:19:04,980
many these agents running on your hosts

1332
01:19:04,980 --> 01:19:06,480
are going to need to make requests

1333
01:19:06,480 --> 01:19:08,520
across the internet to some third party

1334
01:19:08,520 --> 01:19:10,679
that you've purposely allowed to install

1335
01:19:10,679 --> 01:19:13,920
these agents to send logging or security

1336
01:19:13,920 --> 01:19:16,140
metrics that then you can view in some

1337
01:19:16,140 --> 01:19:18,179
nice centralized web UI but to do this

1338
01:19:18,179 --> 01:19:20,040
they need to make requests out of the

1339
01:19:20,040 --> 01:19:22,020
network

1340
01:19:22,020 --> 01:19:24,179
in the multi-cloud if you're familiar

1341
01:19:24,179 --> 01:19:25,860
with like the cloud security space then

1342
01:19:25,860 --> 01:19:27,780
you'll know that this is not the only

1343
01:19:27,780 --> 01:19:30,000
way in which you would have like

1344
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:31,440
multi-cloud in an environment it

1345
01:19:31,440 --> 01:19:34,320
wouldn't just be HTTP requests from your

1346
01:19:34,320 --> 01:19:36,900
clients to another client there's lots

1347
01:19:36,900 --> 01:19:38,340
of better and more complex ways but

1348
01:19:38,340 --> 01:19:39,780
potentially depending on how you have

1349
01:19:39,780 --> 01:19:43,260
that configured it's one method

1350
01:19:43,260 --> 01:19:45,179
and then this one I find interesting and

1351
01:19:45,179 --> 01:19:46,620
you may have had a similar experience if

1352
01:19:46,620 --> 01:19:48,540
you work in Cloud security but having

1353
01:19:48,540 --> 01:19:51,300
like your VPN full tunnel exit node in

1354
01:19:51,300 --> 01:19:52,739
your production environment or even just

1355
01:19:52,739 --> 01:19:54,360
in any Cloud environment can lead to a

1356
01:19:54,360 --> 01:19:56,219
lot of noise as well and those are also

1357
01:19:56,219 --> 01:19:58,620
egos requests so we have your employees

1358
01:19:58,620 --> 01:20:01,739
on their laptops that connect to the VPN

1359
01:20:01,739 --> 01:20:04,320
and then the VPN will get these requests

1360
01:20:04,320 --> 01:20:07,380
and then forward them on surveying of

1361
01:20:07,380 --> 01:20:09,960
course as a VPN exit node but forwarding

1362
01:20:09,960 --> 01:20:11,640
them on to the appropriate websites you

1363
01:20:11,640 --> 01:20:13,320
know Netflix YouTube whatever your

1364
01:20:13,320 --> 01:20:15,179
employees are doing with their time and

1365
01:20:15,179 --> 01:20:16,739
this will also generate lots of outbound

1366
01:20:16,739 --> 01:20:19,020
egress traffic

1367
01:20:19,020 --> 01:20:20,520
so I wanted to talk a little bit if

1368
01:20:20,520 --> 01:20:22,440
you'll forgive me about solarwinds

1369
01:20:22,440 --> 01:20:24,600
specifically because I think it's a

1370
01:20:24,600 --> 01:20:26,040
really interesting case study that we're

1371
01:20:26,040 --> 01:20:28,260
probably at least all heard of and

1372
01:20:28,260 --> 01:20:30,179
seeing how it kind of touches on these

1373
01:20:30,179 --> 01:20:32,520
egress control principles

1374
01:20:32,520 --> 01:20:34,800
so this is a diagram I did not create

1375
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:37,140
it's from bleeping computer and don't

1376
01:20:37,140 --> 01:20:38,760
worry too much about getting all the

1377
01:20:38,760 --> 01:20:41,100
detail here if you're not familiar but

1378
01:20:41,100 --> 01:20:43,800
uh it's pretty much classic techniques

1379
01:20:43,800 --> 01:20:47,159
or ttps and it's an Infamous attack but

1380
01:20:47,159 --> 01:20:48,659
as I'm sure most of us are aware it's

1381
01:20:48,659 --> 01:20:50,699
not the only supply chain attack what

1382
01:20:50,699 --> 01:20:52,800
happened in this case to simplify was

1383
01:20:52,800 --> 01:20:54,780
that attackers compromise commercial

1384
01:20:54,780 --> 01:20:56,820
software though again it could have just

1385
01:20:56,820 --> 01:20:58,980
as easily been open source

1386
01:20:58,980 --> 01:21:00,480
um the malicious code is then happily

1387
01:21:00,480 --> 01:21:02,280
installed on victim servers through the

1388
01:21:02,280 --> 01:21:05,280
normal update process this malicious

1389
01:21:05,280 --> 01:21:07,739
software then connects to command and

1390
01:21:07,739 --> 01:21:10,980
control or C2 via a DNS query the

1391
01:21:10,980 --> 01:21:13,199
malware will then respond with a cname

1392
01:21:13,199 --> 01:21:15,780
if it wants the attack to continue and

1393
01:21:15,780 --> 01:21:18,000
eventually the actual IP address for the

1394
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,100
command to control and then for the

1395
01:21:20,100 --> 01:21:21,659
servers that the attacker identified

1396
01:21:21,659 --> 01:21:23,159
with the victims that the attacker

1397
01:21:23,159 --> 01:21:26,699
identified actual Hands-On keyboard

1398
01:21:26,699 --> 01:21:29,120
attack will then ensue the full tunnel

1399
01:21:29,120 --> 01:21:32,280
exfiltration of data

1400
01:21:32,280 --> 01:21:33,719
um persistence

1401
01:21:33,719 --> 01:21:35,880
kind of what you would expect an apt to

1402
01:21:35,880 --> 01:21:37,920
do once they're in your network

1403
01:21:37,920 --> 01:21:40,080
and this is some charts taken from

1404
01:21:40,080 --> 01:21:43,800
Wikipedia uh in total supposedly 18 000

1405
01:21:43,800 --> 01:21:45,600
organizations installed this malicious

1406
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:47,219
update and

1407
01:21:47,219 --> 01:21:49,440
you may be saying okay well we'd catch

1408
01:21:49,440 --> 01:21:51,600
that you know we have an s-bomb vendor

1409
01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:54,179
we've installed an antivirus we have

1410
01:21:54,179 --> 01:21:56,580
logs we pay for guard Duty we have lace

1411
01:21:56,580 --> 01:21:58,920
Works no way but you have to ask

1412
01:21:58,920 --> 01:22:00,780
yourself do you spend more money on

1413
01:22:00,780 --> 01:22:02,699
security than federal agencies like the

1414
01:22:02,699 --> 01:22:05,280
NSA the doj do you have a bigger

1415
01:22:05,280 --> 01:22:06,719
detection and response team than

1416
01:22:06,719 --> 01:22:08,940
Microsoft or FireEye do you think your

1417
01:22:08,940 --> 01:22:12,080
security posture is better

1418
01:22:12,120 --> 01:22:13,440
you might be thinking well these

1419
01:22:13,440 --> 01:22:15,239
attackers were an apt they were super

1420
01:22:15,239 --> 01:22:18,120
Advanced absolutely no way to catch them

1421
01:22:18,120 --> 01:22:20,640
and they did use a number of command and

1422
01:22:20,640 --> 01:22:22,440
control servers and some domain

1423
01:22:22,440 --> 01:22:24,920
generated algorithms or DGA for

1424
01:22:24,920 --> 01:22:28,980
generating these eventual

1425
01:22:28,980 --> 01:22:31,080
hosts that they connected to but this

1426
01:22:31,080 --> 01:22:34,080
really is not anything novel or crazy if

1427
01:22:34,080 --> 01:22:35,880
you visit these domains now

1428
01:22:35,880 --> 01:22:37,739
hopefully someone on your security team

1429
01:22:37,739 --> 01:22:39,300
will be sending you a nasty slack

1430
01:22:39,300 --> 01:22:40,980
message about five minutes after you do

1431
01:22:40,980 --> 01:22:43,140
it but these have all been burned you're

1432
01:22:43,140 --> 01:22:44,159
not actually going to be doing anything

1433
01:22:44,159 --> 01:22:46,140
by visiting them but these are the

1434
01:22:46,140 --> 01:22:47,940
domains that the attacker used to

1435
01:22:47,940 --> 01:22:49,800
establish command and control and you'll

1436
01:22:49,800 --> 01:22:51,960
notice on first glance they by Design

1437
01:22:51,960 --> 01:22:54,900
look very innocuous there's no

1438
01:22:54,900 --> 01:22:57,440
you know

1439
01:22:57,440 --> 01:22:59,760
freeanime.com.ru.tl it's just

1440
01:22:59,760 --> 01:23:02,360
you know webcodes.com looks fine to me

1441
01:23:02,360 --> 01:23:05,219
uh and so until the op was burned and

1442
01:23:05,219 --> 01:23:07,320
these iocs were published there was no

1443
01:23:07,320 --> 01:23:09,360
reason to really think

1444
01:23:09,360 --> 01:23:11,100
or that your environment would catch

1445
01:23:11,100 --> 01:23:13,560
these or prevent them

1446
01:23:13,560 --> 01:23:15,239
so to explore this topic a little bit

1447
01:23:15,239 --> 01:23:18,960
further I've invented a super sunburst

1448
01:23:18,960 --> 01:23:21,780
which is a fictional future malware

1449
01:23:21,780 --> 01:23:23,880
which is similar to sunbursts the idea

1450
01:23:23,880 --> 01:23:26,219
being a third party compromise but I've

1451
01:23:26,219 --> 01:23:27,600
tried to make it a little more advanced

1452
01:23:27,600 --> 01:23:29,820
using techniques that other malware has

1453
01:23:29,820 --> 01:23:31,800
been using more recently and that I

1454
01:23:31,800 --> 01:23:34,860
might use if I were to I guess turn evil

1455
01:23:34,860 --> 01:23:37,199
and of course it comes with a logo so I

1456
01:23:37,199 --> 01:23:38,820
shamelessly stole the actual logo from

1457
01:23:38,820 --> 01:23:40,440
crowdstrike and then I put it in like a

1458
01:23:40,440 --> 01:23:43,260
big star and so you're welcome I'll be

1459
01:23:43,260 --> 01:23:44,699
going on my blog it'll be a big Vlog

1460
01:23:44,699 --> 01:23:47,760
about it shortly not really but uh okay

1461
01:23:47,760 --> 01:23:49,320
so

1462
01:23:49,320 --> 01:23:51,239
talking through the kill chain here

1463
01:23:51,239 --> 01:23:54,120
similar to the diagram I showed earlier

1464
01:23:54,120 --> 01:23:55,560
so first of all we have a supply chain

1465
01:23:55,560 --> 01:23:58,219
compromise or other malware persistence

1466
01:23:58,219 --> 01:24:00,480
mitigating this is up to other controls

1467
01:24:00,480 --> 01:24:01,739
so you'll have to go to other talks or

1468
01:24:01,739 --> 01:24:02,940
talk to all the vendors in there about

1469
01:24:02,940 --> 01:24:05,340
how you're going to stop this but I

1470
01:24:05,340 --> 01:24:06,900
think it's safe to say that it's very

1471
01:24:06,900 --> 01:24:08,940
much a real threat in today's day and

1472
01:24:08,940 --> 01:24:11,059
age

1473
01:24:11,100 --> 01:24:14,940
so at this point our malware will query

1474
01:24:14,940 --> 01:24:18,840
a heart you'll use a query hardcoded

1475
01:24:18,840 --> 01:24:20,640
domain similar to the original Sunburst

1476
01:24:20,640 --> 01:24:24,360
but using a DGA generated subdomain and

1477
01:24:24,360 --> 01:24:26,400
then which encodes information about the

1478
01:24:26,400 --> 01:24:29,340
host again very similar to Sunburst and

1479
01:24:29,340 --> 01:24:30,960
then it will receive a domain name and

1480
01:24:30,960 --> 01:24:33,140
return via a cname

1481
01:24:33,140 --> 01:24:35,820
if the attacker wants the malware to

1482
01:24:35,820 --> 01:24:36,800
continue

1483
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:41,300
the malware will then use DNS over https

1484
01:24:41,300 --> 01:24:45,060
to query a public Doh resolver like

1485
01:24:45,060 --> 01:24:45,900
Google

1486
01:24:45,900 --> 01:24:48,960
uh and then get an IP back

1487
01:24:48,960 --> 01:24:53,460
like you would expect from a DNS request

1488
01:24:53,460 --> 01:24:55,440
the malware will then make contact with

1489
01:24:55,440 --> 01:24:59,100
the c2ip over an https connection the C2

1490
01:24:59,100 --> 01:25:01,260
will then over this tunnel will send

1491
01:25:01,260 --> 01:25:03,360
commands and even Supply an additional

1492
01:25:03,360 --> 01:25:07,320
hard-coded IP in order to for data

1493
01:25:07,320 --> 01:25:09,300
exfiltration later on

1494
01:25:09,300 --> 01:25:11,940
and then as this command and control is

1495
01:25:11,940 --> 01:25:14,520
continuing to happen over this tunnel at

1496
01:25:14,520 --> 01:25:16,320
when it's time for data exfiltration the

1497
01:25:16,320 --> 01:25:18,600
data will be sent to this provided IP

1498
01:25:18,600 --> 01:25:20,760
and this is probably more steps than was

1499
01:25:20,760 --> 01:25:22,560
necessary you know strictly speaking but

1500
01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:24,540
as I'm going to show in a second

1501
01:25:24,540 --> 01:25:26,219
I kind of want to talk about each of

1502
01:25:26,219 --> 01:25:28,260
these ttps or tactics techniques and

1503
01:25:28,260 --> 01:25:29,340
procedures

1504
01:25:29,340 --> 01:25:32,040
and how different how they touch on

1505
01:25:32,040 --> 01:25:33,900
egress and how egress controls can

1506
01:25:33,900 --> 01:25:36,360
prevent these different attacks or at

1507
01:25:36,360 --> 01:25:37,920
least techniques

1508
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:40,199
so talking about DNS x-fill and command

1509
01:25:40,199 --> 01:25:42,420
and control over DNS this is very much a

1510
01:25:42,420 --> 01:25:43,260
known

1511
01:25:43,260 --> 01:25:47,159
technique so in DNS exfiltration

1512
01:25:47,159 --> 01:25:49,739
attackers can include data in DNS

1513
01:25:49,739 --> 01:25:52,320
requests by encoding or encrypting data

1514
01:25:52,320 --> 01:25:56,100
in subdomains or in a domain itself and

1515
01:25:56,100 --> 01:25:58,260
then their authoritative resolver which

1516
01:25:58,260 --> 01:26:01,440
is registered for that domain can then

1517
01:26:01,440 --> 01:26:03,480
parse that information and so for the

1518
01:26:03,480 --> 01:26:05,520
original Sunburst this included

1519
01:26:05,520 --> 01:26:07,199
information about the victim system

1520
01:26:07,199 --> 01:26:09,060
which was then used to determine which

1521
01:26:09,060 --> 01:26:10,679
victims to continue the attacks you can

1522
01:26:10,679 --> 01:26:12,540
think about things like hostname or IP

1523
01:26:12,540 --> 01:26:14,580
it can also be used to exfiltrate

1524
01:26:14,580 --> 01:26:17,760
sensitive data albeit fairly slowly and

1525
01:26:17,760 --> 01:26:19,500
then for command and control attackers

1526
01:26:19,500 --> 01:26:22,199
can additionally use DNS so in Sunburst

1527
01:26:22,199 --> 01:26:24,540
where you saw this was the systems that

1528
01:26:24,540 --> 01:26:26,480
were chosen from for exploitation

1529
01:26:26,480 --> 01:26:28,980
received a DNS response with the cname

1530
01:26:28,980 --> 01:26:30,780
that pointed to the actual secondary C2

1531
01:26:30,780 --> 01:26:32,639
you could Implement a kill switch there

1532
01:26:32,639 --> 01:26:35,820
by then pointing to like a fixed value

1533
01:26:35,820 --> 01:26:37,620
that would simply activate a kill switch

1534
01:26:37,620 --> 01:26:39,780
or maybe pointing to nothing or not

1535
01:26:39,780 --> 01:26:41,940
responding at all different responses

1536
01:26:41,940 --> 01:26:44,699
can encode different commands so you can

1537
01:26:44,699 --> 01:26:45,900
think about ransomware so they've

1538
01:26:45,900 --> 01:26:47,699
established persistence the malware the

1539
01:26:47,699 --> 01:26:49,020
ransomware needs to know whether or not

1540
01:26:49,020 --> 01:26:51,000
to actually do the ransomware or to

1541
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:52,340
upload

1542
01:26:52,340 --> 01:26:55,440
the public key of the the private or the

1543
01:26:55,440 --> 01:26:57,060
maybe needs to upload some cryptographic

1544
01:26:57,060 --> 01:27:00,600
information we'll say about the

1545
01:27:00,600 --> 01:27:03,179
um about how it encrypted all your files

1546
01:27:03,179 --> 01:27:05,760
so that the attacker can contact you and

1547
01:27:05,760 --> 01:27:07,860
then offer the key for decryption well

1548
01:27:07,860 --> 01:27:09,540
you could technically exfiltrate that

1549
01:27:09,540 --> 01:27:11,880
amount of data over DNS that's not a

1550
01:27:11,880 --> 01:27:13,260
huge amount of information

1551
01:27:13,260 --> 01:27:15,060
and you could also the attacker could

1552
01:27:15,060 --> 01:27:16,500
determine

1553
01:27:16,500 --> 01:27:18,780
um what victim system they've

1554
01:27:18,780 --> 01:27:20,340
compromised and then decide whether or

1555
01:27:20,340 --> 01:27:21,840
not they want to execute that ransomware

1556
01:27:21,840 --> 01:27:23,280
and then return that as a response to

1557
01:27:23,280 --> 01:27:26,040
the DNS query

1558
01:27:26,040 --> 01:27:29,100
so another technique DNS over https this

1559
01:27:29,100 --> 01:27:31,260
is one that I think most people have are

1560
01:27:31,260 --> 01:27:33,480
familiar with is technology but I

1561
01:27:33,480 --> 01:27:35,400
haven't seen as much discussion over in

1562
01:27:35,400 --> 01:27:36,480
my opinion what it's going to really

1563
01:27:36,480 --> 01:27:37,739
allow

1564
01:27:37,739 --> 01:27:41,400
malicious software or malware to do so

1565
01:27:41,400 --> 01:27:42,780
this is a screenshot I took from this

1566
01:27:42,780 --> 01:27:44,340
excellent blog post so that I highly

1567
01:27:44,340 --> 01:27:47,520
recommend reading it's about a new

1568
01:27:47,520 --> 01:27:50,040
malware called denonia which was this

1569
01:27:50,040 --> 01:27:52,800
blog post was written in 2022 and if you

1570
01:27:52,800 --> 01:27:55,139
see from the URL what they noted about

1571
01:27:55,139 --> 01:27:56,699
it was that it was the first malware

1572
01:27:56,699 --> 01:27:58,679
targeting Lambda functions in AWS

1573
01:27:58,679 --> 01:28:00,960
specifically of course it was a crypto

1574
01:28:00,960 --> 01:28:03,659
Miner but what I found particularly

1575
01:28:03,659 --> 01:28:06,179
interesting was this DNS server https so

1576
01:28:06,179 --> 01:28:09,239
this was written in go and then it used

1577
01:28:09,239 --> 01:28:12,480
goes DNS over https library to make a

1578
01:28:12,480 --> 01:28:15,179
request to dns.google.com

1579
01:28:15,179 --> 01:28:17,760
and then get back the information it

1580
01:28:17,760 --> 01:28:19,260
needed so you wouldn't see any

1581
01:28:19,260 --> 01:28:21,179
information in your DNS logs as a

1582
01:28:21,179 --> 01:28:23,219
Defender because it's all happening over

1583
01:28:23,219 --> 01:28:26,639
Port 443 in an encrypted tunnel all you

1584
01:28:26,639 --> 01:28:28,500
can see is that it's going to this IP

1585
01:28:28,500 --> 01:28:31,020
for dns.google.com not the IP that's

1586
01:28:31,020 --> 01:28:32,880
being returned or the DNS name that's

1587
01:28:32,880 --> 01:28:35,760
being requested and attackers can hard

1588
01:28:35,760 --> 01:28:38,460
code these Doh resolvers So Google I

1589
01:28:38,460 --> 01:28:40,199
think cloudflare many others at this

1590
01:28:40,199 --> 01:28:41,820
point offer them they could

1591
01:28:41,820 --> 01:28:43,620
theoretically host their own DNS over

1592
01:28:43,620 --> 01:28:46,320
https resolver and that IP would

1593
01:28:46,320 --> 01:28:48,120
probably not be it wouldn't have any

1594
01:28:48,120 --> 01:28:49,199
history you wouldn't know it was an

1595
01:28:49,199 --> 01:28:52,159
indicator of compromise

1596
01:28:52,260 --> 01:28:54,840
so exfiltration this one's pretty

1597
01:28:54,840 --> 01:28:59,219
straightforward for https if you

1598
01:28:59,219 --> 01:28:59,820
um

1599
01:28:59,820 --> 01:29:02,219
they can use https to exfiltrate data or

1600
01:29:02,219 --> 01:29:04,080
do command and control and then again as

1601
01:29:04,080 --> 01:29:06,540
an attacker without other controls you

1602
01:29:06,540 --> 01:29:07,500
won't actually be able to see what's

1603
01:29:07,500 --> 01:29:09,060
happening in this tunnel I think we're

1604
01:29:09,060 --> 01:29:11,880
probably all familiar with that aspect

1605
01:29:11,880 --> 01:29:13,739
um hardcoded IPS I think this one's

1606
01:29:13,739 --> 01:29:16,020
interesting so typically with malware

1607
01:29:16,020 --> 01:29:18,120
though not my field as I understand it

1608
01:29:18,120 --> 01:29:19,920
typically with malware they're going to

1609
01:29:19,920 --> 01:29:22,679
be using domain names often using domain

1610
01:29:22,679 --> 01:29:25,080
generated algorithms for these domain

1611
01:29:25,080 --> 01:29:26,880
names or domain generation algorithms

1612
01:29:26,880 --> 01:29:28,920
excuse me to get these domains or

1613
01:29:28,920 --> 01:29:30,900
subdomains and they typically avoid

1614
01:29:30,900 --> 01:29:32,460
hard-coded IPS because they're very

1615
01:29:32,460 --> 01:29:34,860
fragile but if we're thinking about okay

1616
01:29:34,860 --> 01:29:36,739
we can address some of these other Tech

1617
01:29:36,739 --> 01:29:40,500
tactics through DNS controls if an

1618
01:29:40,500 --> 01:29:43,139
attacker uses a hard-coded IP instead

1619
01:29:43,139 --> 01:29:45,719
there won't be a DNS request or

1620
01:29:45,719 --> 01:29:48,239
resolution for us to monitor or to

1621
01:29:48,239 --> 01:29:50,699
control so again it is fragile but I

1622
01:29:50,699 --> 01:29:52,620
could see an attacker using this if they

1623
01:29:52,620 --> 01:29:54,600
were attempting to attack a very

1624
01:29:54,600 --> 01:29:56,340
specific Target for example and trying

1625
01:29:56,340 --> 01:29:58,020
to avoid any of the DNS controls or

1626
01:29:58,020 --> 01:29:59,699
monitoring

1627
01:29:59,699 --> 01:30:01,080
this one I think is particularly

1628
01:30:01,080 --> 01:30:04,380
interesting uh spoofed Sni so here I

1629
01:30:04,380 --> 01:30:06,840
have a screenshot from Hacker News this

1630
01:30:06,840 --> 01:30:09,719
article came out in what was it 2019

1631
01:30:09,719 --> 01:30:11,280
um someone published a blog post I

1632
01:30:11,280 --> 01:30:13,080
believe they were a student and they

1633
01:30:13,080 --> 01:30:14,580
said hey guys I found a way to get free

1634
01:30:14,580 --> 01:30:16,440
in-flight Wi-Fi and then everyone

1635
01:30:16,440 --> 01:30:18,239
advised them that was a federal crime

1636
01:30:18,239 --> 01:30:19,920
and they should probably take this down

1637
01:30:19,920 --> 01:30:21,780
so you can't really find the blog post

1638
01:30:21,780 --> 01:30:23,699
anymore they took it off archive.org

1639
01:30:23,699 --> 01:30:25,860
it's not on his blog but nonetheless

1640
01:30:25,860 --> 01:30:28,560
what it boiled down to was

1641
01:30:28,560 --> 01:30:30,659
the

1642
01:30:30,659 --> 01:30:32,580
in-flight Wi-Fi would allow you to visit

1643
01:30:32,580 --> 01:30:34,739
certain domains but for free without

1644
01:30:34,739 --> 01:30:36,960
paying you can imagine you know maybe

1645
01:30:36,960 --> 01:30:40,139
skymall.com or the airline's website

1646
01:30:40,139 --> 01:30:42,420
something like that but you had to pay

1647
01:30:42,420 --> 01:30:44,040
and then establish a session for your

1648
01:30:44,040 --> 01:30:47,159
Mac address in order to actually get

1649
01:30:47,159 --> 01:30:49,860
unrestricted browsing so what they

1650
01:30:49,860 --> 01:30:52,080
realized with the attacker or the

1651
01:30:52,080 --> 01:30:54,719
student in this case realized was that

1652
01:30:54,719 --> 01:30:56,460
all that was happening was Sni

1653
01:30:56,460 --> 01:31:00,120
inspection so Sni is this header for an

1654
01:31:00,120 --> 01:31:03,360
https connection where the client is

1655
01:31:03,360 --> 01:31:06,179
advertising what host or domain they're

1656
01:31:06,179 --> 01:31:09,060
connecting to and this is relevant for

1657
01:31:09,060 --> 01:31:11,820
it's useful for a lot of reasons so you

1658
01:31:11,820 --> 01:31:13,739
can imagine connecting to something and

1659
01:31:13,739 --> 01:31:15,719
then that like load balancer needs to

1660
01:31:15,719 --> 01:31:16,980
know how to route the traffic without

1661
01:31:16,980 --> 01:31:19,500
decrypting the TLs connection so it

1662
01:31:19,500 --> 01:31:20,940
needs to have to understand what domain

1663
01:31:20,940 --> 01:31:23,040
to Route it to this is used in a lot of

1664
01:31:23,040 --> 01:31:24,960
security contexts we'll talk about in a

1665
01:31:24,960 --> 01:31:26,940
second but the idea that you can just

1666
01:31:26,940 --> 01:31:29,340
check the Sni and then understand what

1667
01:31:29,340 --> 01:31:31,500
slings connecting to is

1668
01:31:31,500 --> 01:31:33,300
not always true and so what they

1669
01:31:33,300 --> 01:31:35,639
realized was they could connect to an

1670
01:31:35,639 --> 01:31:37,679
arbitrary IP which in this case I think

1671
01:31:37,679 --> 01:31:40,139
was like a proxy that they just were

1672
01:31:40,139 --> 01:31:42,659
hosting themselves on AWS but say in the

1673
01:31:42,659 --> 01:31:44,820
Sni that they were connecting to the

1674
01:31:44,820 --> 01:31:46,380
airlines website or something similar

1675
01:31:46,380 --> 01:31:48,840
the Sni inspection didn't look at the IP

1676
01:31:48,840 --> 01:31:51,000
it just looked at the S and I header and

1677
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:52,800
said okay that looks fine once that

1678
01:31:52,800 --> 01:31:56,100
packet reached their VPN their software

1679
01:31:56,100 --> 01:31:58,920
that they were running the attacker just

1680
01:31:58,920 --> 01:32:01,020
ignored the Sni and then just read it

1681
01:32:01,020 --> 01:32:03,420
all traffic like normal proxy traffic

1682
01:32:03,420 --> 01:32:05,219
and so the point I just want to make

1683
01:32:05,219 --> 01:32:07,440
here is that Sni is something that is

1684
01:32:07,440 --> 01:32:09,120
often often used for security if you

1685
01:32:09,120 --> 01:32:10,800
look at vendors and other Technologies

1686
01:32:10,800 --> 01:32:13,380
but it cannot be essentially trusted

1687
01:32:13,380 --> 01:32:16,139
because it can be spoofed

1688
01:32:16,139 --> 01:32:18,840
so those were some of the the ttps I

1689
01:32:18,840 --> 01:32:20,219
wanted to discuss and now I want to talk

1690
01:32:20,219 --> 01:32:22,080
about sort of the meat of the talk

1691
01:32:22,080 --> 01:32:24,000
what are the different mitigations that

1692
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:25,920
you may have or might consider if you

1693
01:32:25,920 --> 01:32:27,179
want to address these in your

1694
01:32:27,179 --> 01:32:28,800
environment

1695
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:31,139
so first of all don't do anything it's

1696
01:32:31,139 --> 01:32:33,000
the most popular and most common it's

1697
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:35,639
also the cheapest it's the default on

1698
01:32:35,639 --> 01:32:38,400
AWS and pretty much everyone is doing

1699
01:32:38,400 --> 01:32:40,080
this

1700
01:32:40,080 --> 01:32:42,179
even worse in my opinion you could just

1701
01:32:42,179 --> 01:32:44,760
restrict to 443 so if you're unfamiliar

1702
01:32:44,760 --> 01:32:46,800
security groups and AWS you see here

1703
01:32:46,800 --> 01:32:49,699
we're in our outbound tab or egress tab

1704
01:32:49,699 --> 01:32:53,159
these are allow rules there's no deny

1705
01:32:53,159 --> 01:32:55,199
rules only allow rules and so by default

1706
01:32:55,199 --> 01:32:57,620
we just allow all outbound traffic

1707
01:32:57,620 --> 01:33:00,060
and you could change this to just

1708
01:33:00,060 --> 01:33:02,100
allowing all outbound traffic on Port

1709
01:33:02,100 --> 01:33:05,520
443 so https you can tell your auditor

1710
01:33:05,520 --> 01:33:07,500
hey we're restricting traffic great you

1711
01:33:07,500 --> 01:33:09,780
know we created some firewall rules of

1712
01:33:09,780 --> 01:33:11,580
course I would argue this is a false

1713
01:33:11,580 --> 01:33:14,040
sense of security because anything could

1714
01:33:14,040 --> 01:33:16,199
be running on Port 443 not just https

1715
01:33:16,199 --> 01:33:19,560
traffic especially when you're the your

1716
01:33:19,560 --> 01:33:20,940
servers are being the client in this

1717
01:33:20,940 --> 01:33:22,800
case but additionally anything could be

1718
01:33:22,800 --> 01:33:25,739
running over https

1719
01:33:25,739 --> 01:33:27,060
so I'm going to be keeping kind of a

1720
01:33:27,060 --> 01:33:29,400
running scorecard here so nothing is

1721
01:33:29,400 --> 01:33:30,900
definitely the cheapest and easiest to

1722
01:33:30,900 --> 01:33:32,159
do but I would say it fails at

1723
01:33:32,159 --> 01:33:33,179
preventing

1724
01:33:33,179 --> 01:33:34,380
anything

1725
01:33:34,380 --> 01:33:36,900
unsurprisingly

1726
01:33:36,900 --> 01:33:39,000
another technique you could consider

1727
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:41,159
would be to restrict everything so at

1728
01:33:41,159 --> 01:33:42,300
the security group you could do this at

1729
01:33:42,300 --> 01:33:43,860
different levels of your stack but at

1730
01:33:43,860 --> 01:33:45,960
the security group level just delete all

1731
01:33:45,960 --> 01:33:47,820
the egress rules and then nothing will

1732
01:33:47,820 --> 01:33:50,219
be allowed this is arguably the most

1733
01:33:50,219 --> 01:33:53,040
secure for egress but in my experience

1734
01:33:53,040 --> 01:33:55,920
it's mostly it's fairly impractical it

1735
01:33:55,920 --> 01:33:57,600
depends on what's running on these hosts

1736
01:33:57,600 --> 01:33:58,739
or how you have your environment

1737
01:33:58,739 --> 01:34:01,199
configured but if we're discussing you

1738
01:34:01,199 --> 01:34:03,600
know securing a typical cred app web

1739
01:34:03,600 --> 01:34:07,320
server API then it's going to need to do

1740
01:34:07,320 --> 01:34:09,420
something for egress if you can get away

1741
01:34:09,420 --> 01:34:10,739
with this though more power to you I

1742
01:34:10,739 --> 01:34:13,080
think it's kind of the same vein of the

1743
01:34:13,080 --> 01:34:15,000
most secure computer is the one in

1744
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:17,100
concrete at the bottom of the ocean but

1745
01:34:17,100 --> 01:34:20,219
again it's essentially a air gap so if

1746
01:34:20,219 --> 01:34:22,800
you can pull it off great fairly secure

1747
01:34:22,800 --> 01:34:25,080
in AWS though I wanted to mention that

1748
01:34:25,080 --> 01:34:27,120
doesn't prevent DNS x-fill if this is

1749
01:34:27,120 --> 01:34:28,679
your only control

1750
01:34:28,679 --> 01:34:31,260
the reason is security groups do not

1751
01:34:31,260 --> 01:34:33,320
apply to DNS resolution

1752
01:34:33,320 --> 01:34:35,940
and what I mean by that is

1753
01:34:35,940 --> 01:34:38,460
let's say simple case you spin up an ec2

1754
01:34:38,460 --> 01:34:40,860
it's going to be making DNS requests to

1755
01:34:40,860 --> 01:34:43,800
the Route 53 resolution service that AWS

1756
01:34:43,800 --> 01:34:45,900
is hosting and has configured and that

1757
01:34:45,900 --> 01:34:47,520
is not affected by these security groups

1758
01:34:47,520 --> 01:34:50,159
so theoretically an attacker could make

1759
01:34:50,159 --> 01:34:53,219
requests over DNS to the default

1760
01:34:53,219 --> 01:34:56,580
resolver and get data out you can

1761
01:34:56,580 --> 01:34:58,500
disable this via the Route 53 firewall

1762
01:34:58,500 --> 01:35:00,300
which I'll talk about in a little bit or

1763
01:35:00,300 --> 01:35:02,880
potentially via DHCP but

1764
01:35:02,880 --> 01:35:04,380
I thought that was an interesting bit of

1765
01:35:04,380 --> 01:35:06,239
nuance

1766
01:35:06,239 --> 01:35:08,400
it's also you know it's potentially

1767
01:35:08,400 --> 01:35:10,440
difficult to impossible to get away with

1768
01:35:10,440 --> 01:35:11,219
this

1769
01:35:11,219 --> 01:35:14,100
okay so DNS monitoring this is an

1770
01:35:14,100 --> 01:35:15,719
example you know a fictional screenshot

1771
01:35:15,719 --> 01:35:18,000
I pulled from AWS a blogger

1772
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:19,620
documentation

1773
01:35:19,620 --> 01:35:22,020
um where we are logging our DNS resolver

1774
01:35:22,020 --> 01:35:24,179
queries in this case we're doing it with

1775
01:35:24,179 --> 01:35:26,639
the Route 53 resolver but of course you

1776
01:35:26,639 --> 01:35:28,020
could theoretically do it with any

1777
01:35:28,020 --> 01:35:30,300
resolver that you're hosting

1778
01:35:30,300 --> 01:35:31,020
um

1779
01:35:31,020 --> 01:35:33,120
and you can look for unusual requests so

1780
01:35:33,120 --> 01:35:35,120
this is a very reactive approach

1781
01:35:35,120 --> 01:35:38,520
we maybe we have list of iocs that we're

1782
01:35:38,520 --> 01:35:40,620
purchasing from a threat Intel vendor

1783
01:35:40,620 --> 01:35:43,260
maybe we're just looking for first time

1784
01:35:43,260 --> 01:35:45,000
requests and every time sling talks to a

1785
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:46,679
domain for the first time we're gonna

1786
01:35:46,679 --> 01:35:48,480
fire off a slack alert and wake everyone

1787
01:35:48,480 --> 01:35:51,179
up at 2AM maybe it works for your team

1788
01:35:51,179 --> 01:35:53,280
and your environment maybe it doesn't I

1789
01:35:53,280 --> 01:35:56,159
think the hard part here is that

1790
01:35:56,159 --> 01:35:58,980
first of all it's reactive so compromise

1791
01:35:58,980 --> 01:36:01,139
Could Happen second of all it's pretty

1792
01:36:01,139 --> 01:36:04,199
noisy ideally cost won't be prohibitive

1793
01:36:04,199 --> 01:36:06,000
here it could be in your environment or

1794
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:08,460
your budget but it should be something

1795
01:36:08,460 --> 01:36:10,620
that is doable

1796
01:36:10,620 --> 01:36:13,020
um and it can detect things like DNS XFL

1797
01:36:13,020 --> 01:36:15,480
and C2 but in my experience it's pretty

1798
01:36:15,480 --> 01:36:17,639
noisy and by definition it is a reactive

1799
01:36:17,639 --> 01:36:18,800
control

1800
01:36:18,800 --> 01:36:21,960
and additionally if an attacker simply

1801
01:36:21,960 --> 01:36:23,880
uses a DNS resolver that they Define

1802
01:36:23,880 --> 01:36:26,280
themselves and they don't use your DNS

1803
01:36:26,280 --> 01:36:29,340
resolver or they use DNS over https you

1804
01:36:29,340 --> 01:36:31,880
won't see it

1805
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:35,100
so again it's kind of one of these

1806
01:36:35,100 --> 01:36:38,400
screenshots from AWS you can monitor all

1807
01:36:38,400 --> 01:36:40,739
your traffic so here we have VPC flow

1808
01:36:40,739 --> 01:36:42,780
logs we can see all the traffic in our

1809
01:36:42,780 --> 01:36:44,040
environment

1810
01:36:44,040 --> 01:36:45,840
probably a good thing to be doing if you

1811
01:36:45,840 --> 01:36:47,940
have some other tooling that's going to

1812
01:36:47,940 --> 01:36:49,199
be

1813
01:36:49,199 --> 01:36:51,960
running alerts or detection rules on

1814
01:36:51,960 --> 01:36:53,760
this type of traffic but in and of

1815
01:36:53,760 --> 01:36:56,820
itself it's not really doing much of

1816
01:36:56,820 --> 01:36:58,620
course guard duty is the built-in sort

1817
01:36:58,620 --> 01:37:00,780
of AWS tool that does lots of things not

1818
01:37:00,780 --> 01:37:01,620
just

1819
01:37:01,620 --> 01:37:04,440
unusual traffic but it can be a useful

1820
01:37:04,440 --> 01:37:06,120
control I'm not saying it's not there's

1821
01:37:06,120 --> 01:37:08,040
many commercial vendors lacework one of

1822
01:37:08,040 --> 01:37:10,380
them that will look at many things

1823
01:37:10,380 --> 01:37:12,960
including your DNS or other traffic and

1824
01:37:12,960 --> 01:37:14,820
tell you about what they perceive to be

1825
01:37:14,820 --> 01:37:18,300
anomalous but again fairly reactive

1826
01:37:18,300 --> 01:37:21,620
unless you kind of build tooling to say

1827
01:37:21,620 --> 01:37:23,820
isolate an instance that's made an

1828
01:37:23,820 --> 01:37:25,980
unusual request but there's risk to that

1829
01:37:25,980 --> 01:37:27,420
in terms of availability and other

1830
01:37:27,420 --> 01:37:30,000
things and noise and responding to that

1831
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:32,520
noise so for traffic monitoring again

1832
01:37:32,520 --> 01:37:34,260
there is a cost these costs could be

1833
01:37:34,260 --> 01:37:35,820
high depending on your vendor the amount

1834
01:37:35,820 --> 01:37:39,120
of data but I would say they're usually

1835
01:37:39,120 --> 01:37:40,800
handleable costs or the kind of tooling

1836
01:37:40,800 --> 01:37:43,260
you might have already they may catch

1837
01:37:43,260 --> 01:37:45,300
DNS X fill in C2

1838
01:37:45,300 --> 01:37:47,100
but they're not going to prevent these

1839
01:37:47,100 --> 01:37:50,219
other types of attacks

1840
01:37:50,219 --> 01:37:52,500
so deep packet inspection I took this

1841
01:37:52,500 --> 01:37:54,179
diagram of course from fortigate as you

1842
01:37:54,179 --> 01:37:55,100
can see

1843
01:37:55,100 --> 01:37:57,900
so this is kind of an older School

1844
01:37:57,900 --> 01:38:01,260
approach where we buy some cool box or

1845
01:38:01,260 --> 01:38:03,360
virtual Appliance we plug it in our

1846
01:38:03,360 --> 01:38:07,980
Network we then put a certificate on all

1847
01:38:07,980 --> 01:38:10,260
clients so whether those are laptops or

1848
01:38:10,260 --> 01:38:13,560
servers and then we instruct them to use

1849
01:38:13,560 --> 01:38:17,400
this proxy or this router and then the

1850
01:38:17,400 --> 01:38:19,100
appliance that we pay a lot of money for

1851
01:38:19,100 --> 01:38:21,239
decrypts everything and so it just

1852
01:38:21,239 --> 01:38:23,159
breaks TLS on purpose and then

1853
01:38:23,159 --> 01:38:25,440
re-encrypts it and sends it on there's a

1854
01:38:25,440 --> 01:38:27,900
few issues with this and why it's not as

1855
01:38:27,900 --> 01:38:29,159
popular particularly in Cloud

1856
01:38:29,159 --> 01:38:30,960
environments but one thing is it's

1857
01:38:30,960 --> 01:38:32,699
expensive so not only are you paying for

1858
01:38:32,699 --> 01:38:34,860
the licensing costs but you may be

1859
01:38:34,860 --> 01:38:36,540
paying for the compute directly or

1860
01:38:36,540 --> 01:38:39,239
indirectly to do this for like internet

1861
01:38:39,239 --> 01:38:41,219
scale traffic is going to be extremely

1862
01:38:41,219 --> 01:38:42,900
expensive

1863
01:38:42,900 --> 01:38:45,000
um this it's computationally expensive

1864
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:48,560
to decrypt scan and then re-encrypt

1865
01:38:48,560 --> 01:38:51,600
these uh traffic at a large scale

1866
01:38:51,600 --> 01:38:53,219
there's also privacy and compliance

1867
01:38:53,219 --> 01:38:54,600
concerns I think this is one of the big

1868
01:38:54,600 --> 01:38:56,219
reasons you don't see it as much in like

1869
01:38:56,219 --> 01:38:58,320
office settings even for just end user

1870
01:38:58,320 --> 01:39:00,659
laptops you know decrypting someone's

1871
01:39:00,659 --> 01:39:05,520
Phi for examples probably not ideal it

1872
01:39:05,520 --> 01:39:08,040
also won't necessarily work with TLS 1.3

1873
01:39:08,040 --> 01:39:10,440
depending on how it's configured and

1874
01:39:10,440 --> 01:39:13,440
anything using TLS pinning it will break

1875
01:39:13,440 --> 01:39:15,659
it

1876
01:39:15,659 --> 01:39:17,520
and again well you might control your

1877
01:39:17,520 --> 01:39:21,060
ideally you control these servers so TLS

1878
01:39:21,060 --> 01:39:22,320
pinning may or may not be a concerned

1879
01:39:22,320 --> 01:39:23,159
but

1880
01:39:23,159 --> 01:39:25,500
I would say

1881
01:39:25,500 --> 01:39:27,900
something to be aware of

1882
01:39:27,900 --> 01:39:31,620
so again this it does pretty well it's

1883
01:39:31,620 --> 01:39:34,340
not so much a DNS kind of control

1884
01:39:34,340 --> 01:39:37,320
typically because again being more of an

1885
01:39:37,320 --> 01:39:39,120
old school control it's thinking more

1886
01:39:39,120 --> 01:39:41,040
about or usually marketed more towards

1887
01:39:41,040 --> 01:39:43,980
your just https traffic rather than your

1888
01:39:43,980 --> 01:39:45,719
DNS traffic which is assumed not to be

1889
01:39:45,719 --> 01:39:47,699
encrypted but if you're willing to pay

1890
01:39:47,699 --> 01:39:48,980
all this money

1891
01:39:48,980 --> 01:39:51,420
you could see these attacks happening

1892
01:39:51,420 --> 01:39:53,060
and potentially stop them in real time

1893
01:39:53,060 --> 01:39:57,199
if you know what you're looking for

1894
01:39:58,080 --> 01:40:00,060
okay and this is a cool product I wanted

1895
01:40:00,060 --> 01:40:02,699
to touch on the Route 53 DNS firewall

1896
01:40:02,699 --> 01:40:04,739
it's a newer product I think it's really

1897
01:40:04,739 --> 01:40:07,440
cool what it is is a paid service from

1898
01:40:07,440 --> 01:40:10,260
AWS where you can create rules for your

1899
01:40:10,260 --> 01:40:13,260
DNS requests and this is I touched on

1900
01:40:13,260 --> 01:40:14,639
earlier you know you could potentially

1901
01:40:14,639 --> 01:40:17,940
essentially disable this uh Route 53

1902
01:40:17,940 --> 01:40:20,520
resolver as a whole if you wanted to by

1903
01:40:20,520 --> 01:40:22,560
creating a rule but you can also create

1904
01:40:22,560 --> 01:40:25,080
allow lists or deny lists I think they

1905
01:40:25,080 --> 01:40:26,400
even have some kind of threat Intel

1906
01:40:26,400 --> 01:40:30,719
stuff built in so you can get these uh

1907
01:40:30,719 --> 01:40:32,460
you can pay to create rules and then

1908
01:40:32,460 --> 01:40:34,260
have different traffic be dropped or

1909
01:40:34,260 --> 01:40:36,239
allowed based on whether it's malicious

1910
01:40:36,239 --> 01:40:37,739
or not

1911
01:40:37,739 --> 01:40:39,360
so they're not the only vendor to do

1912
01:40:39,360 --> 01:40:41,040
this but the way it's kind of built into

1913
01:40:41,040 --> 01:40:43,860
the default DNS

1914
01:40:43,860 --> 01:40:45,780
that you have to use in AWS or that

1915
01:40:45,780 --> 01:40:47,520
you're pushed strongly to use an AWS is

1916
01:40:47,520 --> 01:40:49,800
pretty cool so potentially stops your

1917
01:40:49,800 --> 01:40:52,199
DNS X fill in C2 you know you could have

1918
01:40:52,199 --> 01:40:54,900
an allow list of domains the problem is

1919
01:40:54,900 --> 01:40:57,060
let's say you do this you are using the

1920
01:40:57,060 --> 01:40:59,100
Route 53 resolver you pay for this

1921
01:40:59,100 --> 01:41:01,440
product you create some rules maybe you

1922
01:41:01,440 --> 01:41:03,179
even do an allow list which I would

1923
01:41:03,179 --> 01:41:04,380
argue is the most kind of secure

1924
01:41:04,380 --> 01:41:06,260
approach you know all the domains that

1925
01:41:06,260 --> 01:41:09,960
your service can connect to but

1926
01:41:09,960 --> 01:41:12,060
the problem is that an attacker if

1927
01:41:12,060 --> 01:41:14,100
that's your only control that an

1928
01:41:14,100 --> 01:41:15,719
attacker could hard code a DNS over

1929
01:41:15,719 --> 01:41:19,139
https IP then their malware gets

1930
01:41:19,139 --> 01:41:21,659
installed on your hosts it then makes a

1931
01:41:21,659 --> 01:41:24,360
request to Google's DNS with a

1932
01:41:24,360 --> 01:41:27,540
hard-fitted IP which your will never

1933
01:41:27,540 --> 01:41:29,340
make a DNS resolution to your DNS

1934
01:41:29,340 --> 01:41:31,440
resolver so it doesn't see it it gets

1935
01:41:31,440 --> 01:41:33,060
back to the iip it needs for the command

1936
01:41:33,060 --> 01:41:35,239
and control and then can do all these

1937
01:41:35,239 --> 01:41:39,900
c2x fill C2 and Excel over https so you

1938
01:41:39,900 --> 01:41:42,480
could attacker could circumvent this

1939
01:41:42,480 --> 01:41:44,040
control if it's the only one you have

1940
01:41:44,040 --> 01:41:47,480
but I still think it could be valuable

1941
01:41:47,520 --> 01:41:50,639
Additionally you could apply sort of Ip

1942
01:41:50,639 --> 01:41:52,260
based approaches these might be security

1943
01:41:52,260 --> 01:41:54,360
groups they might be at the other layers

1944
01:41:54,360 --> 01:41:56,400
but these IP based approaches the

1945
01:41:56,400 --> 01:41:58,679
problem is they're very fragile so as I

1946
01:41:58,679 --> 01:42:00,239
mentioned earlier and as many of you are

1947
01:42:00,239 --> 01:42:02,400
probably aware is not a good mapping

1948
01:42:02,400 --> 01:42:04,800
anymore of one IP is one entity that IP

1949
01:42:04,800 --> 01:42:07,080
might be owned by your company one week

1950
01:42:07,080 --> 01:42:09,480
and then owned by a bug Bounty

1951
01:42:09,480 --> 01:42:11,460
researcher and another organization or

1952
01:42:11,460 --> 01:42:13,800
an apt another week because it's in a

1953
01:42:13,800 --> 01:42:14,760
cloud environment and they're being

1954
01:42:14,760 --> 01:42:18,540
recycled it may one domain may have many

1955
01:42:18,540 --> 01:42:20,580
IPS depending on where you are and when

1956
01:42:20,580 --> 01:42:23,639
you request it so it's very difficult in

1957
01:42:23,639 --> 01:42:26,219
my experience to map

1958
01:42:26,219 --> 01:42:28,739
a single IP or a list of ips even and

1959
01:42:28,739 --> 01:42:30,119
say these are the only known good IPS

1960
01:42:30,119 --> 01:42:32,159
and all the other IPS are bad

1961
01:42:32,159 --> 01:42:33,960
of course you can also apply these with

1962
01:42:33,960 --> 01:42:36,179
a network firewall or with a similar

1963
01:42:36,179 --> 01:42:38,100
commercial Appliance

1964
01:42:38,100 --> 01:42:41,639
these often have DNS rules the problem

1965
01:42:41,639 --> 01:42:44,400
is they're typically looking at Sni so

1966
01:42:44,400 --> 01:42:46,020
again with that scenario I talked about

1967
01:42:46,020 --> 01:42:48,860
earlier an attacker can spoof that Sni

1968
01:42:48,860 --> 01:42:52,080
and then maybe they know you guys are

1969
01:42:52,080 --> 01:42:54,179
going to allow your own domain for

1970
01:42:54,179 --> 01:42:55,560
example it wouldn't be too hard I think

1971
01:42:55,560 --> 01:42:59,340
to guess a list of accepted domains and

1972
01:42:59,340 --> 01:43:01,139
then when your traffic inspection

1973
01:43:01,139 --> 01:43:03,179
happens it won't be looking at IP it'll

1974
01:43:03,179 --> 01:43:04,800
just be looking at domain it'll see a

1975
01:43:04,800 --> 01:43:06,360
domain on the allow list and continue it

1976
01:43:06,360 --> 01:43:09,540
continue to allow it to go through

1977
01:43:09,540 --> 01:43:10,739
so

1978
01:43:10,739 --> 01:43:14,100
ease of use and cost can vary I would

1979
01:43:14,100 --> 01:43:15,300
say it was not going to really affect

1980
01:43:15,300 --> 01:43:18,600
our DNS type this sort of approach won't

1981
01:43:18,600 --> 01:43:21,659
necessarily prevent our DNS types of

1982
01:43:21,659 --> 01:43:24,179
attacks it may prevent hard-coded IPS

1983
01:43:24,179 --> 01:43:26,659
though because we are

1984
01:43:26,659 --> 01:43:29,219
preventing all malicious IPS by only

1985
01:43:29,219 --> 01:43:30,600
creating a list of allowable ones or

1986
01:43:30,600 --> 01:43:33,420
maybe allowable snis but domains but

1987
01:43:33,420 --> 01:43:36,420
won't in and of itself it won't prevent

1988
01:43:36,420 --> 01:43:38,520
some of these other techniques

1989
01:43:38,520 --> 01:43:41,100
and so lastly kind of what I would say

1990
01:43:41,100 --> 01:43:44,159
isn't the absolute best necessarily but

1991
01:43:44,159 --> 01:43:47,040
a very good approach though one that is

1992
01:43:47,040 --> 01:43:49,500
kind of heavy weight is to have a proxy

1993
01:43:49,500 --> 01:43:53,699
and specifically an outbound HTTP proxy

1994
01:43:53,699 --> 01:43:55,800
this screenshot here is taken from a

1995
01:43:55,800 --> 01:43:58,500
blog post from AWS it includes using an

1996
01:43:58,500 --> 01:44:00,960
outbound HTTP proxy to inspect the host

1997
01:44:00,960 --> 01:44:03,300
header and Sni there's many different

1998
01:44:03,300 --> 01:44:05,699
ways if you start going into the topic

1999
01:44:05,699 --> 01:44:06,900
of proxies or if you already have

2000
01:44:06,900 --> 01:44:09,000
experience in this area there's lots of

2001
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:11,639
different Technologies different methods

2002
01:44:11,639 --> 01:44:14,179
different strategies there's

2003
01:44:14,179 --> 01:44:17,040
transparent versus explicit for example

2004
01:44:17,040 --> 01:44:19,139
which we'll talk about in a second but

2005
01:44:19,139 --> 01:44:21,119
really from a security perspective the

2006
01:44:21,119 --> 01:44:23,219
best thing to do is an explicit proxy

2007
01:44:23,219 --> 01:44:25,199
the key thing here is that an explicit

2008
01:44:25,199 --> 01:44:27,179
proxy at least as configured in some of

2009
01:44:27,179 --> 01:44:28,380
the scenario the scenario I'm talking

2010
01:44:28,380 --> 01:44:31,080
about here when your client is

2011
01:44:31,080 --> 01:44:32,760
explicitly configured to connect to this

2012
01:44:32,760 --> 01:44:35,400
proxy it will then create that TLS

2013
01:44:35,400 --> 01:44:38,520
connection and then we'll forward on

2014
01:44:38,520 --> 01:44:40,619
things like the domain it wants to

2015
01:44:40,619 --> 01:44:42,360
connect to which means that the proxy

2016
01:44:42,360 --> 01:44:44,219
will be making the DNS request and then

2017
01:44:44,219 --> 01:44:47,340
telling the client what IP to connect to

2018
01:44:47,340 --> 01:44:49,020
which means that this sort of Sni

2019
01:44:49,020 --> 01:44:51,119
spoofing won't be effective it will the

2020
01:44:51,119 --> 01:44:52,800
request will just go to the Sni that was

2021
01:44:52,800 --> 01:44:55,380
specified it won't go to it could be

2022
01:44:55,380 --> 01:44:56,699
origin as well technically it doesn't

2023
01:44:56,699 --> 01:44:58,560
have to be Sni but it will go to this

2024
01:44:58,560 --> 01:45:00,480
domain that's been specified and so that

2025
01:45:00,480 --> 01:45:02,639
mismatch won't be to the attacker's

2026
01:45:02,639 --> 01:45:03,860
advantage

2027
01:45:03,860 --> 01:45:05,820
transparent proxies will not be as

2028
01:45:05,820 --> 01:45:08,340
effective for this reason they can't see

2029
01:45:08,340 --> 01:45:10,679
inside the traffic and so have to resort

2030
01:45:10,679 --> 01:45:13,139
to routing it based on Sni for example

2031
01:45:13,139 --> 01:45:16,139
which as I said can be spoofed

2032
01:45:16,139 --> 01:45:17,940
you also need to consider things like

2033
01:45:17,940 --> 01:45:20,040
sidecar versus centralized proxy for

2034
01:45:20,040 --> 01:45:21,659
this approach if you choose to go

2035
01:45:21,659 --> 01:45:22,920
forward with it

2036
01:45:22,920 --> 01:45:25,440
and if you have a lot of traffic you're

2037
01:45:25,440 --> 01:45:26,639
also going to have to do a scaling and

2038
01:45:26,639 --> 01:45:28,800
availability so in my experience going

2039
01:45:28,800 --> 01:45:31,500
to the CTO or your equivalent in your

2040
01:45:31,500 --> 01:45:33,480
organization and saying hey we need to

2041
01:45:33,480 --> 01:45:34,860
start sending all of our egress traffic

2042
01:45:34,860 --> 01:45:38,340
through this additional service and if

2043
01:45:38,340 --> 01:45:39,659
it goes down yeah our business will stop

2044
01:45:39,659 --> 01:45:40,739
working and we'll stop making money

2045
01:45:40,739 --> 01:45:42,600
depending on your business model is a

2046
01:45:42,600 --> 01:45:45,360
hard sell but it can be pretty effective

2047
01:45:45,360 --> 01:45:47,820
if you rely on allow list so if you

2048
01:45:47,820 --> 01:45:51,179
really are having explicit proxies

2049
01:45:51,179 --> 01:45:53,520
and you have a list of allowable domain

2050
01:45:53,520 --> 01:45:55,260
names this is going to stop those

2051
01:45:55,260 --> 01:45:57,420
techniques and that's because for

2052
01:45:57,420 --> 01:46:01,380
example you could block Google's

2053
01:46:01,699 --> 01:46:04,679
Doh resolvers domain name or you could

2054
01:46:04,679 --> 01:46:06,600
only allow the domain names that you

2055
01:46:06,600 --> 01:46:08,639
know are necessary none of which are

2056
01:46:08,639 --> 01:46:11,040
cloudflare's domain name and there's

2057
01:46:11,040 --> 01:46:12,179
still issues here you know thinking

2058
01:46:12,179 --> 01:46:14,100
about how these things are reused but

2059
01:46:14,100 --> 01:46:16,080
this is a I think very effective

2060
01:46:16,080 --> 01:46:18,119
approach if you are already putting all

2061
01:46:18,119 --> 01:46:19,619
your traffic through some sort of proxy

2062
01:46:19,619 --> 01:46:21,300
or you can deal with a sort of

2063
01:46:21,300 --> 01:46:23,880
engineering costs and speaking of

2064
01:46:23,880 --> 01:46:26,159
someone who or a company that can deal

2065
01:46:26,159 --> 01:46:28,199
with these sort of costs this is a blog

2066
01:46:28,199 --> 01:46:29,699
post that I highly recommend checking

2067
01:46:29,699 --> 01:46:32,100
out if this topic is of Interest this is

2068
01:46:32,100 --> 01:46:34,500
the approach that Lyft took recently

2069
01:46:34,500 --> 01:46:36,900
so I'll have a link later but this is

2070
01:46:36,900 --> 01:46:39,420
one of the diagrams I took so lyft's

2071
01:46:39,420 --> 01:46:41,280
approach was so Lyft is the maintainer

2072
01:46:41,280 --> 01:46:43,880
of the envoy proxy if you've heard of it

2073
01:46:43,880 --> 01:46:47,460
they stood up a centralized explicit

2074
01:46:47,460 --> 01:46:49,920
proxy with Envoy all their services were

2075
01:46:49,920 --> 01:46:52,380
then configured to explicitly connect to

2076
01:46:52,380 --> 01:46:54,719
them and the egress traffic is then

2077
01:46:54,719 --> 01:46:56,460
checked against an allow list at the

2078
01:46:56,460 --> 01:46:58,619
Domain level before the DNS resolution

2079
01:46:58,619 --> 01:47:02,280
occurs which of course stops DNS based

2080
01:47:02,280 --> 01:47:06,540
x-fill and command and control and then

2081
01:47:06,540 --> 01:47:09,060
traffic sent to domains

2082
01:47:09,060 --> 01:47:11,100
without an explicit allow list entry

2083
01:47:11,100 --> 01:47:12,659
will be blocked nothing will be returned

2084
01:47:12,659 --> 01:47:14,520
the connection will end an alert will

2085
01:47:14,520 --> 01:47:15,900
probably go off somewhere

2086
01:47:15,900 --> 01:47:18,060
they also maintain this allow list on a

2087
01:47:18,060 --> 01:47:19,679
per service basis I don't want to get

2088
01:47:19,679 --> 01:47:21,420
into it too much but you can see here

2089
01:47:21,420 --> 01:47:23,280
this sort of this authentication scheme

2090
01:47:23,280 --> 01:47:25,860
here in the HTTP headers and read the

2091
01:47:25,860 --> 01:47:27,420
blog post for more data but the idea is

2092
01:47:27,420 --> 01:47:29,159
that they know who these services are

2093
01:47:29,159 --> 01:47:31,619
that are requesting and so they can

2094
01:47:31,619 --> 01:47:33,119
actually maintain an allow list per

2095
01:47:33,119 --> 01:47:35,119
service which I thought was pretty cool

2096
01:47:35,119 --> 01:47:37,800
it of course limits sort of blast radius

2097
01:47:37,800 --> 01:47:41,340
and increases security further and one

2098
01:47:41,340 --> 01:47:42,960
key part of their strategy was they

2099
01:47:42,960 --> 01:47:44,699
started by recording traffic and then

2100
01:47:44,699 --> 01:47:46,380
adding legitimate domains to the allow

2101
01:47:46,380 --> 01:47:47,159
list

2102
01:47:47,159 --> 01:47:49,320
some traffic can't do explicit proxies

2103
01:47:49,320 --> 01:47:50,940
so they have a fail through implicit

2104
01:47:50,940 --> 01:47:53,460
proxy which only filters on Sni so

2105
01:47:53,460 --> 01:47:55,580
slightly less secure due to Sni spoofing

2106
01:47:55,580 --> 01:47:58,260
but their plan is to gradually

2107
01:47:58,260 --> 01:48:01,619
transition everything to explicit proxy

2108
01:48:01,619 --> 01:48:03,360
there's also a few commercial products

2109
01:48:03,360 --> 01:48:06,420
so Palo Alto and similar competitors

2110
01:48:06,420 --> 01:48:08,400
offer various products which attempt to

2111
01:48:08,400 --> 01:48:10,260
solve this I haven't done an in-depth

2112
01:48:10,260 --> 01:48:12,480
evaluation of any of these but some of

2113
01:48:12,480 --> 01:48:14,159
them I think do a better job than others

2114
01:48:14,159 --> 01:48:17,040
they can be pricey discriminant is a

2115
01:48:17,040 --> 01:48:18,840
startup well Chaser systems discriminate

2116
01:48:18,840 --> 01:48:20,760
product this is a startup I don't have

2117
01:48:20,760 --> 01:48:22,679
first-hand experience but my impression

2118
01:48:22,679 --> 01:48:24,540
is that it's well aligned to the ttps

2119
01:48:24,540 --> 01:48:26,520
we've discussed a company called

2120
01:48:26,520 --> 01:48:28,500
aviatrics also offers an Enterprise

2121
01:48:28,500 --> 01:48:30,900
product for this

2122
01:48:30,900 --> 01:48:32,880
I wanted to briefly touch on a custom

2123
01:48:32,880 --> 01:48:35,400
approach that I worked on

2124
01:48:35,400 --> 01:48:36,840
don't worry too much about the flow

2125
01:48:36,840 --> 01:48:39,780
diagram here but basically I maintain a

2126
01:48:39,780 --> 01:48:41,639
stub resolver so we send all DNS

2127
01:48:41,639 --> 01:48:44,460
resolution to this resolver service it

2128
01:48:44,460 --> 01:48:46,679
has an allow list of domains if it's not

2129
01:48:46,679 --> 01:48:49,199
on the allow list it's dropped and then

2130
01:48:49,199 --> 01:48:51,360
when a DNS resolution happens the

2131
01:48:51,360 --> 01:48:55,139
service updates its cache of eips it got

2132
01:48:55,139 --> 01:48:58,679
back and sets a TTL from the DNS TTL and

2133
01:48:58,679 --> 01:49:00,840
then adds a security group egress rule

2134
01:49:00,840 --> 01:49:04,500
so then after the resolution happens our

2135
01:49:04,500 --> 01:49:06,300
client our internal service will connect

2136
01:49:06,300 --> 01:49:09,060
to the IP we gave it through the hole

2137
01:49:09,060 --> 01:49:10,440
we've opened with the security group

2138
01:49:10,440 --> 01:49:13,260
rule then a cron or a loop is

2139
01:49:13,260 --> 01:49:15,420
continuously running and when it sees an

2140
01:49:15,420 --> 01:49:17,760
expired TTL it will remove the security

2141
01:49:17,760 --> 01:49:20,460
group rule so if this is an interesting

2142
01:49:20,460 --> 01:49:22,920
kind of thing to play with but one big

2143
01:49:22,920 --> 01:49:24,900
disadvantage is you only get a Thousand

2144
01:49:24,900 --> 01:49:27,060
Rules per

2145
01:49:27,060 --> 01:49:29,699
instance essentially so that means you

2146
01:49:29,699 --> 01:49:31,260
can only have a thousand IPS that a

2147
01:49:31,260 --> 01:49:33,119
service can talk to at one time that can

2148
01:49:33,119 --> 01:49:35,219
definitely be a blocker potentially it

2149
01:49:35,219 --> 01:49:36,719
also requires an additional service for

2150
01:49:36,719 --> 01:49:38,520
this stub resolver so if that goes down

2151
01:49:38,520 --> 01:49:40,199
you're going to have issues just like if

2152
01:49:40,199 --> 01:49:41,580
your proxy went down

2153
01:49:41,580 --> 01:49:44,219
so in summary I would say risk filtering

2154
01:49:44,219 --> 01:49:46,860
is an important and Powerful control it

2155
01:49:46,860 --> 01:49:48,900
may stop an attacker who even has remote

2156
01:49:48,900 --> 01:49:50,940
code execution from being able to

2157
01:49:50,940 --> 01:49:53,340
continue their attack and it may be

2158
01:49:53,340 --> 01:49:54,840
necessary for your environment due to

2159
01:49:54,840 --> 01:49:57,360
compliance reasons but it's hard to do

2160
01:49:57,360 --> 01:49:59,159
you'll need to figure out what works

2161
01:49:59,159 --> 01:50:01,139
best for your environment there's really

2162
01:50:01,139 --> 01:50:02,520
no free lunch here

2163
01:50:02,520 --> 01:50:04,260
we discussed a few approaches but

2164
01:50:04,260 --> 01:50:05,340
there's some others that didn't discuss

2165
01:50:05,340 --> 01:50:07,080
kubernetes for example has pretty

2166
01:50:07,080 --> 01:50:09,540
powerful controls around networking and

2167
01:50:09,540 --> 01:50:10,800
so if that's the kind of environment

2168
01:50:10,800 --> 01:50:12,060
you're in I'd recommend looking into

2169
01:50:12,060 --> 01:50:13,980
that for this problem as well

2170
01:50:13,980 --> 01:50:16,080
just wanted to thank Drew Lewis and Dean

2171
01:50:16,080 --> 01:50:17,580
for helping me with this presentation

2172
01:50:17,580 --> 01:50:20,040
taking a look at my slides and then

2173
01:50:20,040 --> 01:50:22,199
lastly for Q a I just left these up if

2174
01:50:22,199 --> 01:50:23,880
anyone wants to take a picture these are

2175
01:50:23,880 --> 01:50:26,100
some talks and blog posts that I

2176
01:50:26,100 --> 01:50:27,659
recommend checking out for an in-depth

2177
01:50:27,659 --> 01:50:29,219
look

2178
01:50:29,219 --> 01:50:31,820
thank you

2179
01:50:36,420 --> 01:50:38,460
if uh if you're not familiar we have

2180
01:50:38,460 --> 01:50:40,739
some throwable microphones uh so if you

2181
01:50:40,739 --> 01:50:42,480
have in the in-person questions let me

2182
01:50:42,480 --> 01:50:44,699
know and I can toss it to you or hand it

2183
01:50:44,699 --> 01:50:47,719
to you as you prefer

2184
01:50:47,900 --> 01:50:49,860
oh

2185
01:50:49,860 --> 01:50:51,199
all right

2186
01:50:51,199 --> 01:50:54,480
okay does that work cool that was really

2187
01:50:54,480 --> 01:50:56,159
interesting thank you thank you I was

2188
01:50:56,159 --> 01:50:58,380
curious uh with this spoofed Sni attack

2189
01:50:58,380 --> 01:51:00,000
that you shared

2190
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:02,100
um does that like break anything once it

2191
01:51:02,100 --> 01:51:03,719
gets to the outside internet does the

2192
01:51:03,719 --> 01:51:05,280
proxy need to put it back or how would

2193
01:51:05,280 --> 01:51:07,199
it do that it's a good question

2194
01:51:07,199 --> 01:51:08,460
um I think the main thing it would break

2195
01:51:08,460 --> 01:51:11,699
is the

2196
01:51:11,699 --> 01:51:13,980
if you're sending it to an IP a domain

2197
01:51:13,980 --> 01:51:15,840
that or an IP that you control then you

2198
01:51:15,840 --> 01:51:17,219
can just sort of ignore what would

2199
01:51:17,219 --> 01:51:18,780
normally break you can just take this

2200
01:51:18,780 --> 01:51:22,739
traffic and then naively end the TLs and

2201
01:51:22,739 --> 01:51:24,239
then continue the TCP or whatever's

2202
01:51:24,239 --> 01:51:25,560
inside of it

2203
01:51:25,560 --> 01:51:26,159
um

2204
01:51:26,159 --> 01:51:27,719
it could it would break things if it

2205
01:51:27,719 --> 01:51:29,520
continued on to its destination and this

2206
01:51:29,520 --> 01:51:30,960
starts to get into topics like domain

2207
01:51:30,960 --> 01:51:33,659
fronting if you've heard of that so I

2208
01:51:33,659 --> 01:51:34,560
don't want to give a whole explanation

2209
01:51:34,560 --> 01:51:35,940
on domain fronting and I'm not sure I

2210
01:51:35,940 --> 01:51:38,760
could right now but essentially it plays

2211
01:51:38,760 --> 01:51:40,380
off the idea of sending traffic to

2212
01:51:40,380 --> 01:51:42,360
somewhere with a CDN think cloudflare

2213
01:51:42,360 --> 01:51:45,000
Google AWS and having an Sni that

2214
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:47,520
doesn't necessarily match so a malicious

2215
01:51:47,520 --> 01:51:48,960
government who's seeing your encrypted

2216
01:51:48,960 --> 01:51:52,560
traffic is can't see what you're looking

2217
01:51:52,560 --> 01:51:56,820
at but when it gets there the um at the

2218
01:51:56,820 --> 01:51:59,219
end of the process the provider the CDN

2219
01:51:59,219 --> 01:52:00,300
will then route it to its correct

2220
01:52:00,300 --> 01:52:03,780
destination this was a common censorship

2221
01:52:03,780 --> 01:52:04,380
um

2222
01:52:04,380 --> 01:52:07,380
evasion technique but which is a lot of

2223
01:52:07,380 --> 01:52:09,239
overlap between censorship evasion and

2224
01:52:09,239 --> 01:52:10,440
like malware techniques potentially

2225
01:52:10,440 --> 01:52:11,580
right you're evading someone who's

2226
01:52:11,580 --> 01:52:13,440
looking at traffic I'd recommend looking

2227
01:52:13,440 --> 01:52:15,300
into domain fronting for kind of what a

2228
01:52:15,300 --> 01:52:17,219
real world implication or use case was

2229
01:52:17,219 --> 01:52:19,739
for that thank you and just

2230
01:52:19,739 --> 01:52:22,199
to clarify or just so I understand if

2231
01:52:22,199 --> 01:52:24,420
you're terminating TLS you know in your

2232
01:52:24,420 --> 01:52:26,639
kind of special proxy that you've set up

2233
01:52:26,639 --> 01:52:28,440
for this Sni spoofing does that mean

2234
01:52:28,440 --> 01:52:30,060
that you can't do any TLS connections

2235
01:52:30,060 --> 01:52:31,800
with this technique

2236
01:52:31,800 --> 01:52:34,679
could you could you clarify yeah so if I

2237
01:52:34,679 --> 01:52:36,380
want to do a TLS connection to

2238
01:52:36,380 --> 01:52:38,460
wikipedia.org from the in-flight Wi-Fi

2239
01:52:38,460 --> 01:52:40,199
would I not be able to do that because

2240
01:52:40,199 --> 01:52:41,940
you have to terminate it on the proxy

2241
01:52:41,940 --> 01:52:44,820
that I'm connecting to uh no because the

2242
01:52:44,820 --> 01:52:46,679
again I'm explicitly not teaching you

2243
01:52:46,679 --> 01:52:49,139
how to get free in-flight Wi-Fi but one

2244
01:52:49,139 --> 01:52:51,000
technique you someone might do on this

2245
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:52,139
type of network with these types of

2246
01:52:52,139 --> 01:52:54,119
controls is that

2247
01:52:54,119 --> 01:52:54,840
um

2248
01:52:54,840 --> 01:52:56,639
you control the proxy and you control

2249
01:52:56,639 --> 01:52:58,080
your laptop you just don't control the

2250
01:52:58,080 --> 01:53:00,119
in-between so you say I'm trying to go

2251
01:53:00,119 --> 01:53:02,940
to a fictional Budget Airline here and

2252
01:53:02,940 --> 01:53:04,739
then when it gets to your proxy your

2253
01:53:04,739 --> 01:53:06,600
proxy then sees okay I'm ignoring the

2254
01:53:06,600 --> 01:53:08,340
Sni but I see inside that we're trying

2255
01:53:08,340 --> 01:53:10,920
to make a request to wikipedia.com and

2256
01:53:10,920 --> 01:53:12,480
so it will afford that request and then

2257
01:53:12,480 --> 01:53:13,980
send it back to you in an encrypted

2258
01:53:13,980 --> 01:53:17,780
tunnel thank you sure

2259
01:53:22,320 --> 01:53:24,300
so I know you haven't done an evaluation

2260
01:53:24,300 --> 01:53:25,980
of a lot of the commercial products in

2261
01:53:25,980 --> 01:53:27,840
this space but do you know offhand if

2262
01:53:27,840 --> 01:53:29,820
the Palo Alto is the z-scalers that

2263
01:53:29,820 --> 01:53:33,060
those rep those Brands represent or have

2264
01:53:33,060 --> 01:53:35,460
inspection of Sni type attacks and

2265
01:53:35,460 --> 01:53:38,340
others as a default or as an option I

2266
01:53:38,340 --> 01:53:39,360
don't want to give an authoritative

2267
01:53:39,360 --> 01:53:40,739
answer because I haven't looked into as

2268
01:53:40,739 --> 01:53:42,840
much when I looked at a few Solutions

2269
01:53:42,840 --> 01:53:46,199
probably a year or two ago I did get the

2270
01:53:46,199 --> 01:53:48,060
impression that they were vulnerable to

2271
01:53:48,060 --> 01:53:49,560
some of these attacks so they might stop

2272
01:53:49,560 --> 01:53:51,659
some but one thing I think I forgot to

2273
01:53:51,659 --> 01:53:55,739
touch on was encrypted Sni so that is a

2274
01:53:55,739 --> 01:53:57,780
RFC that's going gone by a few names but

2275
01:53:57,780 --> 01:53:59,639
the idea is what it sounds like you just

2276
01:53:59,639 --> 01:54:03,060
encrypt the Sni altogether as a privacy

2277
01:54:03,060 --> 01:54:05,400
preserving technique and the problem is

2278
01:54:05,400 --> 01:54:07,560
that a lot of these tools don't have a

2279
01:54:07,560 --> 01:54:09,179
way to deal with it so Lyft for example

2280
01:54:09,179 --> 01:54:10,860
they just drop it they know that their

2281
01:54:10,860 --> 01:54:12,659
clients shouldn't be sending encrypted

2282
01:54:12,659 --> 01:54:15,960
uh Sni and so they drop it and probably

2283
01:54:15,960 --> 01:54:17,520
consider it malicious but if you're

2284
01:54:17,520 --> 01:54:18,900
trying to buy a commercial tool it has

2285
01:54:18,900 --> 01:54:20,280
to deal with you know the internet

2286
01:54:20,280 --> 01:54:22,020
browsing where maybe someone is

2287
01:54:22,020 --> 01:54:24,600
legitimately using encrypted it Sni and

2288
01:54:24,600 --> 01:54:26,400
so they have to either choose

2289
01:54:26,400 --> 01:54:28,560
are we going to drop all of those are we

2290
01:54:28,560 --> 01:54:30,119
going to ignore all of those and so that

2291
01:54:30,119 --> 01:54:31,679
to me is kind of a fundamental problem

2292
01:54:31,679 --> 01:54:34,800
with an approach that relies on Sni is

2293
01:54:34,800 --> 01:54:36,000
as that gets more and more popular

2294
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:37,440
they'll have to choose to allow all of

2295
01:54:37,440 --> 01:54:39,300
it or drop all of it sure thank you

2296
01:54:39,300 --> 01:54:41,840
thank you

2297
01:54:48,719 --> 01:54:50,520
okay was there any Discord or anything

2298
01:54:50,520 --> 01:54:54,320
like that no questions okay

2299
01:54:54,540 --> 01:54:58,020
oh boy maybe afterwards

2300
01:54:58,020 --> 01:55:00,420
no explicit questions though okay thank

02:05:34,380 --> 02:05:36,060
going to talk about this from both a

2349
02:05:36,060 --> 02:05:37,679
threat intelligence and an incident

2350
02:05:37,679 --> 02:05:39,840
response perspective

2351
02:05:39,840 --> 02:05:41,639
but before I do that let's do another

2352
02:05:41,639 --> 02:05:44,520
round of quick introductions

2353
02:05:44,520 --> 02:05:47,099

today my name is Holly shookai I'm a

2364
02:06:12,119 --> 02:06:15,000
threat researcher with redacted a little

2365
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:16,980
bit about me I grew up in Atlanta

2366
02:06:16,980 --> 02:06:19,860
Georgia spent most of my life there came

2367
02:06:19,860 --> 02:06:22,500
out to Arizona in 2018 where I actually

2368
02:06:22,500 --> 02:06:24,719
just graduated with my masters from

2369
02:06:24,719 --> 02:06:28,500
Arizona State last month and I love all

2370
02:06:28,500 --> 02:06:33,920
things sports puzzles fashion that's me

2371
02:06:34,320 --> 02:06:37,440
and we work for redacted yes the

2372
02:06:37,440 --> 02:06:39,900
company's name is redacted it's super

2373
02:06:39,900 --> 02:06:41,239
confusing

2374
02:06:41,239 --> 02:06:44,340
full consultancy we do everything from

2375
02:06:44,340 --> 02:06:46,980
managed Security Services pen testing

2376
02:06:46,980 --> 02:06:49,619
incident Response Security engineering

2377
02:06:49,619 --> 02:06:52,320
we also do a lot of uh customer specific

2378
02:06:52,320 --> 02:06:55,619
requests most of our products are backed

2379
02:06:55,619 --> 02:06:59,520
by our our newly coined Arctic uh ghost

2380
02:06:59,520 --> 02:07:01,739
group that is our threat intelligence

2381
02:07:01,739 --> 02:07:03,960
and let's get into it so I'm going to

2382
02:07:03,960 --> 02:07:05,400
hand over to Hallie for the threat

2383
02:07:05,400 --> 02:07:08,239
intelligence aspect

2384
02:07:08,639 --> 02:07:11,460
awesome so like Sean said

2385
02:07:11,460 --> 02:07:12,840
um this presentation is going to be

2386
02:07:12,840 --> 02:07:15,960
split uh my end is more focused on the

2387
02:07:15,960 --> 02:07:17,940
threat intelligence side of things

2388
02:07:17,940 --> 02:07:19,440
um and later on Sean is going to be

2389
02:07:19,440 --> 02:07:21,119
talking about the incident response side

2390
02:07:21,119 --> 02:07:22,199
of things

2391
02:07:22,199 --> 02:07:23,460
um and his side is really really

2392
02:07:23,460 --> 02:07:25,440
interesting he's going to get into the

2393
02:07:25,440 --> 02:07:27,139
nitty-gritty about being lean

2394
02:07:27,139 --> 02:07:29,940
experiencing them in the wild what he's

2395
02:07:29,940 --> 02:07:32,400
kind of had to deal with but initially

2396
02:07:32,400 --> 02:07:34,500
what we wanted to go over is who even is

2397
02:07:34,500 --> 02:07:36,119
being Leanne

2398
02:07:36,119 --> 02:07:38,940
um so they're an actively uh evolving

2399
02:07:38,940 --> 02:07:41,219
ransomware group they're recently

2400
02:07:41,219 --> 02:07:43,139
emerging with their first victim

2401
02:07:43,139 --> 02:07:46,980
claiming to be from June 2022 with their

2402
02:07:46,980 --> 02:07:48,960
first League site posting just about a

2403
02:07:48,960 --> 02:07:52,800
month later in July of 2022

2404
02:07:52,800 --> 02:07:54,540
um they're using an actively evolving

2405
02:07:54,540 --> 02:07:58,920
tool set including a custom uh a custom

2406
02:07:58,920 --> 02:08:01,560
go encrypter that's leveraging the file

2407
02:08:01,560 --> 02:08:06,179
exclusion model as well as an updated uh

2408
02:08:06,179 --> 02:08:09,060
Ransom note oops there it is an updated

2409
02:08:09,060 --> 02:08:11,639
Ransom note as well as a custom back

2410
02:08:11,639 --> 02:08:14,159
door that is actually configured where

2411
02:08:14,159 --> 02:08:17,219
each binary is configured with a

2412
02:08:17,219 --> 02:08:19,679
hard-coded IP and port

2413
02:08:19,679 --> 02:08:22,320
and one of the most notable things about

2414
02:08:22,320 --> 02:08:24,659
being lien about some of the things that

2415
02:08:24,659 --> 02:08:26,699
they do the way that they operate is

2416
02:08:26,699 --> 02:08:30,540
they really really enjoy uh LOL and not

2417
02:08:30,540 --> 02:08:32,940
laughing out loud but living off the

2418
02:08:32,940 --> 02:08:34,500
land so they're using these subtle

2419
02:08:34,500 --> 02:08:37,739
techniques to both exploit and move

2420
02:08:37,739 --> 02:08:40,739
laterally in their victims networks

2421
02:08:40,739 --> 02:08:42,060
um basically so they can remain

2422
02:08:42,060 --> 02:08:44,280
undetected and we've seen them remain

2423
02:08:44,280 --> 02:08:47,040
undetected for up to six weeks um so

2424
02:08:47,040 --> 02:08:48,300
they're really really good at being

2425
02:08:48,300 --> 02:08:51,599
sneaky laying low kind of getting that

2426
02:08:51,599 --> 02:08:55,260
aggregation of data on their victims

2427
02:08:55,260 --> 02:08:57,900
so this is an example encryption

2428
02:08:57,900 --> 02:09:01,380
timeline of being Leanne so they had

2429
02:09:01,380 --> 02:09:03,420
gained initial access through the proxy

2430
02:09:03,420 --> 02:09:06,960
shell vulnerability chain uh

2431
02:09:06,960 --> 02:09:10,440
sonic wall VPN devices or weak or

2432
02:09:10,440 --> 02:09:12,300
exposed credentials

2433
02:09:12,300 --> 02:09:14,639
and so once they were in again they were

2434
02:09:14,639 --> 02:09:16,460
leveraging these living off the land

2435
02:09:16,460 --> 02:09:19,440
techniques these cyber espionage-esque

2436
02:09:19,440 --> 02:09:21,000
techniques

2437
02:09:21,000 --> 02:09:23,159
um kind of staying under the radar

2438
02:09:23,159 --> 02:09:26,099
Gathering Intel on their victims things

2439
02:09:26,099 --> 02:09:27,780
like that

2440
02:09:27,780 --> 02:09:30,000
and So within the first hour that they

2441
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:32,780
were beginning to encrypt their victim

2442
02:09:32,780 --> 02:09:35,520
they performed primarily most of their

2443
02:09:35,520 --> 02:09:37,739
account manipulation in the first 15

2444
02:09:37,739 --> 02:09:40,260
minutes and this is really really

2445
02:09:40,260 --> 02:09:42,659
interesting to note because uh getting

2446
02:09:42,659 --> 02:09:44,099
most of your account manipulation

2447
02:09:44,099 --> 02:09:46,920
complete in those first 15 minutes sort

2448
02:09:46,920 --> 02:09:48,599
of indicates that you went in with a

2449
02:09:48,599 --> 02:09:50,820
plan you didn't go in randomly you're

2450
02:09:50,820 --> 02:09:53,340
not searching for the Security Solutions

2451
02:09:53,340 --> 02:09:55,500
that the victim may have things like

2452
02:09:55,500 --> 02:09:57,179
that you've already kind of got that

2453
02:09:57,179 --> 02:09:59,460
plan of what you're wanting to do and

2454
02:09:59,460 --> 02:10:01,920
again that kind of relates back to the

2455
02:10:01,920 --> 02:10:04,440
LOL methodology of up to six weeks that

2456
02:10:04,440 --> 02:10:06,540
they've been performing

2457
02:10:06,540 --> 02:10:09,000
and so again in this in this first hour

2458
02:10:09,000 --> 02:10:11,760
there's still uh leveraging these LOL

2459
02:10:11,760 --> 02:10:13,440
methodologies

2460
02:10:13,440 --> 02:10:14,880
um to perform last minute file

2461
02:10:14,880 --> 02:10:17,460
exfiltration uh as well as dropping

2462
02:10:17,460 --> 02:10:20,460
known good binaries such as 7-Zip and

2463
02:10:20,460 --> 02:10:23,000
WinZip

2464
02:10:23,340 --> 02:10:26,460
and then once they're uh

2465
02:10:26,460 --> 02:10:28,920
once they've uh kind of exfiltrated

2466
02:10:28,920 --> 02:10:32,760
everything they're taking very very uh

2467
02:10:32,760 --> 02:10:35,040
judicious steps to minimize the

2468
02:10:35,040 --> 02:10:36,900
observable events that their victims may

2469
02:10:36,900 --> 02:10:40,320
see whether it's using ARP versus Ping

2470
02:10:40,320 --> 02:10:42,179
and when they're using ping commands

2471
02:10:42,179 --> 02:10:43,920
they're being extremely judicious with

2472
02:10:43,920 --> 02:10:45,540
such

2473
02:10:45,540 --> 02:10:47,460
um and so once they're ready to encrypt

2474
02:10:47,460 --> 02:10:48,840
once they've decided on their target

2475
02:10:48,840 --> 02:10:51,840
victim all of a sudden their behavior

2476
02:10:51,840 --> 02:10:54,300
completely changes they go from kind of

2477
02:10:54,300 --> 02:10:57,420
being this uh low level sort of sneaky

2478
02:10:57,420 --> 02:10:58,679
sort of group

2479
02:10:58,679 --> 02:11:02,400
um to completely aggressive uh total 180

2480
02:11:02,400 --> 02:11:03,780
in their behavior

2481
02:11:03,780 --> 02:11:05,820
and so they're making dozens of attempts

2482
02:11:05,820 --> 02:11:08,820
to encrypt servers they're attempting to

2483
02:11:08,820 --> 02:11:11,400
circumvent those security controls that

2484
02:11:11,400 --> 02:11:13,940
EDR or that AV that you might have

2485
02:11:13,940 --> 02:11:16,739
implemented and they're also attempting

2486
02:11:16,739 --> 02:11:19,679
to encrypt initial uh they're attempting

2487
02:11:19,679 --> 02:11:21,719
to encrypt additional servers that were

2488
02:11:21,719 --> 02:11:25,639
not included in the initial targeting

2489
02:11:25,860 --> 02:11:28,139
and so we've seen this as well when

2490
02:11:28,139 --> 02:11:30,239
they're able to partially encrypt

2491
02:11:30,239 --> 02:11:31,800
actually and Sean will kind of go into

2492
02:11:31,800 --> 02:11:35,000
that a little bit more later

2493
02:11:35,400 --> 02:11:37,440
but so a little bit about what we've

2494
02:11:37,440 --> 02:11:40,080
seen over time with Bean land their

2495
02:11:40,080 --> 02:11:42,179
Ransom note is still using the same file

2496
02:11:42,179 --> 02:11:44,760
name but it has been updated additional

2497
02:11:44,760 --> 02:11:46,560
levels of detail and professionalism

2498
02:11:46,560 --> 02:11:48,599
have been included

2499
02:11:48,599 --> 02:11:50,940
their encrypter has also been updated

2500
02:11:50,940 --> 02:11:54,060
we've been able to recover the or the

2501
02:11:54,060 --> 02:11:55,560
the earliest version that we've been

2502
02:11:55,560 --> 02:11:57,980
able to recover is version 8 excuse me

2503
02:11:57,980 --> 02:12:00,840
with uh that was compiled with Go

2504
02:12:00,840 --> 02:12:03,840
version 1.18.2

2505
02:12:03,840 --> 02:12:05,880
um but there are there are also samples

2506
02:12:05,880 --> 02:12:10,320
of versions 27 28 and 97.

2507
02:12:10,320 --> 02:12:12,119
um and again we've seen uh the file

2508
02:12:12,119 --> 02:12:14,460
exclusion model that they're using with

2509
02:12:14,460 --> 02:12:17,340
their customgo encrypter

2510
02:12:17,340 --> 02:12:19,619
um in in version 8 for example they're

2511
02:12:19,619 --> 02:12:22,679
not excluding uh to encrypt dot Inc

2512
02:12:22,679 --> 02:12:25,800
files but in versions 27 and 28 we are

2513
02:12:25,800 --> 02:12:28,679
seeing that they're doing uh this

2514
02:12:28,679 --> 02:12:30,659
they've also got a leak site like most

2515
02:12:30,659 --> 02:12:32,880
ransomware groups and most threat actors

2516
02:12:32,880 --> 02:12:34,080
have

2517
02:12:34,080 --> 02:12:36,119
um they're posting teaser information on

2518
02:12:36,119 --> 02:12:38,460
their victim organizations leaving their

2519
02:12:38,460 --> 02:12:40,099
identities masked

2520
02:12:40,099 --> 02:12:42,960
but they're also posting uh victims that

2521
02:12:42,960 --> 02:12:44,940
they have exploited kind of tagging them

2522
02:12:44,940 --> 02:12:47,699
by industry or by

2523
02:12:47,699 --> 02:12:50,960
um a country

2524
02:12:52,260 --> 02:12:54,119
and so this is a chart that kind of

2525
02:12:54,119 --> 02:12:56,040
demonstrates the the number of C2

2526
02:12:56,040 --> 02:12:57,360
servers that they've brought online

2527
02:12:57,360 --> 02:12:59,699
month per month

2528
02:12:59,699 --> 02:13:02,159
um just so everyone knows this chart

2529
02:13:02,159 --> 02:13:06,000
does only go through January 15th so we

2530
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:08,280
are able to confirm that additional C2

2531
02:13:08,280 --> 02:13:11,040
servers have been brought online so this

2532
02:13:11,040 --> 02:13:13,980
January uh this last chart over here in

2533
02:13:13,980 --> 02:13:16,320
January is not completely accurate but

2534
02:13:16,320 --> 02:13:18,000
we did just have to cut it off for slide

2535
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:19,860
purposes

2536
02:13:19,860 --> 02:13:22,320
and so obviously we're seeing that uh

2537
02:13:22,320 --> 02:13:24,420
the continuation of bringing on C2

2538
02:13:24,420 --> 02:13:26,400
servers kind of indicates that they're

2539
02:13:26,400 --> 02:13:28,199
still ready to attack more victims

2540
02:13:28,199 --> 02:13:29,579
they're still ready to go after more

2541
02:13:29,579 --> 02:13:30,780
people

2542
02:13:30,780 --> 02:13:32,159
um typically you don't see groups

2543
02:13:32,159 --> 02:13:34,079
bringing on additional servers when

2544
02:13:34,079 --> 02:13:37,639
they're ramping down their operations

2545
02:13:38,760 --> 02:13:42,480
so a little bit on on their victimology

2546
02:13:42,480 --> 02:13:45,780
um as of September 1st 2022 uh there

2547
02:13:45,780 --> 02:13:47,760
were 20 victims that were published on

2548
02:13:47,760 --> 02:13:49,920
their leak site but obviously the true

2549
02:13:49,920 --> 02:13:52,440
number of that is unknown uh they can

2550
02:13:52,440 --> 02:13:54,420
claim however money they want or not

2551
02:13:54,420 --> 02:13:57,179
claim however many we don't know for

2552
02:13:57,179 --> 02:13:58,679
certain

2553
02:13:58,679 --> 02:14:00,960
um they've targeted organizations that

2554
02:14:00,960 --> 02:14:03,420
are ranging from small to medium as well

2555
02:14:03,420 --> 02:14:05,179
as large multinational

2556
02:14:05,179 --> 02:14:07,320
spanning across several different

2557
02:14:07,320 --> 02:14:11,880
Industries so unfortunately uh also due

2558
02:14:11,880 --> 02:14:14,699
to the victim size being so small there

2559
02:14:14,699 --> 02:14:16,679
are no significant conclusions that can

2560
02:14:16,679 --> 02:14:18,260
be made about

2561
02:14:18,260 --> 02:14:20,760
victimology preferences that b and

2562
02:14:20,760 --> 02:14:22,739
Leanne may have

2563
02:14:22,739 --> 02:14:24,300
foreign

2564
02:14:24,300 --> 02:14:26,639
and so these two charts depict uh the

2565
02:14:26,639 --> 02:14:28,619
victims that were compromised by month

2566
02:14:28,619 --> 02:14:32,159
and posting of victim details by month

2567
02:14:32,159 --> 02:14:33,719
um these speak on the assertion that

2568
02:14:33,719 --> 02:14:35,820
being Leanne is a group of skilled

2569
02:14:35,820 --> 02:14:38,340
Network penetration hackers they're very

2570
02:14:38,340 --> 02:14:40,920
very skilled with that being able again

2571
02:14:40,920 --> 02:14:43,679
to lay low get an understanding of what

2572
02:14:43,679 --> 02:14:46,079
security controls or tools that your

2573
02:14:46,079 --> 02:14:47,940
organization is using things like that

2574
02:14:47,940 --> 02:14:50,280
but they're not necessarily so good at

2575
02:14:50,280 --> 02:14:52,079
the business aspect or the actual

2576
02:14:52,079 --> 02:14:55,800
ransomware aspect of uh kind of their

2577
02:14:55,800 --> 02:14:59,400
operations as you can see in in November

2578
02:14:59,400 --> 02:15:03,179
they've got just about 18 claimed

2579
02:15:03,179 --> 02:15:05,280
victims that they've compromised but

2580
02:15:05,280 --> 02:15:07,619
only about 15 postings so it looks like

2581
02:15:07,619 --> 02:15:09,179
they're making up for that in the next

2582
02:15:09,179 --> 02:15:11,480
month

2583
02:15:12,599 --> 02:15:15,239
so then this is the times from

2584
02:15:15,239 --> 02:15:17,719
compromise to leak site in posting days

2585
02:15:17,719 --> 02:15:20,400
and again speaking kind of on that

2586
02:15:20,400 --> 02:15:22,020
assertion that they're really skilled

2587
02:15:22,020 --> 02:15:24,179
with network penetration

2588
02:15:24,179 --> 02:15:25,980
um what we're seeing is typically

2589
02:15:25,980 --> 02:15:28,380
between two weeks to a month is when

2590
02:15:28,380 --> 02:15:30,599
they're typically able to encrypt but

2591
02:15:30,599 --> 02:15:32,639
ultimately you know does it does it

2592
02:15:32,639 --> 02:15:34,679
matter too much whether it's two weeks

2593
02:15:34,679 --> 02:15:36,659
two months two years if they're still

2594
02:15:36,659 --> 02:15:38,940
encrypting getting their their money

2595
02:15:38,940 --> 02:15:41,719
things like that

2596
02:15:42,179 --> 02:15:44,880
and so uh just to kind of wrap up the

2597
02:15:44,880 --> 02:15:47,460
the threat intelligence side of things

2598
02:15:47,460 --> 02:15:49,440
um we are seeing and and kind of

2599
02:15:49,440 --> 02:15:52,139
suspecting that this is a newer group in

2600
02:15:52,139 --> 02:15:54,360
the ransomware ecosystem

2601
02:15:54,360 --> 02:15:55,980
um again they're really skilled in

2602
02:15:55,980 --> 02:15:57,719
network penetration

2603
02:15:57,719 --> 02:15:59,639
um they're Adept to adapting to victim

2604
02:15:59,639 --> 02:16:00,840
networks

2605
02:16:00,840 --> 02:16:03,480
um really really good at uh

2606
02:16:03,480 --> 02:16:05,099
kind of changing those admin account

2607
02:16:05,099 --> 02:16:07,739
passwords getting what they need to do

2608
02:16:07,739 --> 02:16:09,719
um to hinder you from protecting

2609
02:16:09,719 --> 02:16:11,219
yourself

2610
02:16:11,219 --> 02:16:13,500
um but I will say that they are as well

2611
02:16:13,500 --> 02:16:15,780
becoming better on that business or that

2612
02:16:15,780 --> 02:16:18,900
ransomware side of things uh with their

2613
02:16:18,900 --> 02:16:22,320
leak site actually becoming more Stabler

2614
02:16:22,320 --> 02:16:24,420
um and just a final thought

2615
02:16:24,420 --> 02:16:26,940
um their their Dev environment their

2616
02:16:26,940 --> 02:16:29,699
development environment uh as initially

2617
02:16:29,699 --> 02:16:32,580
explained has continued to evolve those

2618
02:16:32,580 --> 02:16:34,620
incremental changes

2619
02:16:34,620 --> 02:16:36,780
um things like that so now I'm going to

2620
02:16:36,780 --> 02:16:38,519
hand it over to Sean who's going to talk

2621
02:16:38,519 --> 02:16:40,379
more about the incident response side of

2622
02:16:40,379 --> 02:16:41,519
things

2623
02:16:41,519 --> 02:16:42,540
um kind of get more into the

2624
02:16:42,540 --> 02:16:46,460
nitty-gritty so thank you everyone

2625
02:16:50,398 --> 02:16:53,058
thank you Holly

2626
02:16:53,280 --> 02:16:55,620
all right so these next slides we're

2627
02:16:55,620 --> 02:16:56,820
gonna we're gonna go through an actual

2628
02:16:56,820 --> 02:16:59,340
being Lee and incident from last year as

2629
02:16:59,340 --> 02:17:00,898
Halle said they are very skilled in

2630
02:17:00,898 --> 02:17:02,939
network penetration so

2631
02:17:02,939 --> 02:17:04,320
um what's on these slides may not

2632
02:17:04,320 --> 02:17:07,138
necessarily be what's going on today uh

2633
02:17:07,138 --> 02:17:08,879
as as you try and remediate and contain

2634
02:17:08,879 --> 02:17:10,019
this group

2635
02:17:10,019 --> 02:17:11,160
um they will use their skills and

2636
02:17:11,160 --> 02:17:12,660
they'll find other ways to try and get

2637
02:17:12,660 --> 02:17:14,398
around that

2638
02:17:14,398 --> 02:17:16,740
so we got a call with the customer and

2639
02:17:16,740 --> 02:17:18,120
they had been having some trouble for a

2640
02:17:18,120 --> 02:17:18,978
while

2641
02:17:18,978 --> 02:17:21,540
we knew that they had been compromised

2642
02:17:21,540 --> 02:17:26,040
for roughly six weeks they had a MSP

2643
02:17:26,040 --> 02:17:28,080
partner that was helping them contain or

2644
02:17:28,080 --> 02:17:30,780
remediate the customer did not have

2645
02:17:30,780 --> 02:17:32,519
great visibility into their environment

2646
02:17:32,519 --> 02:17:35,280
and we know that they had at least one

2647
02:17:35,280 --> 02:17:38,218
sysadmin naughty naughty with domain

2648
02:17:38,218 --> 02:17:40,799
admin rights if you have CIS admins

2649
02:17:40,799 --> 02:17:42,420
doing their day-to-day duties with

2650
02:17:42,420 --> 02:17:47,058
domain admin rights stop it right now

2651
02:17:49,620 --> 02:17:52,920
so because of the time the threat actor

2652
02:17:52,920 --> 02:17:54,718
was in the environment we were concerned

2653
02:17:54,718 --> 02:17:56,638
they were possibly doing a corros ticket

2654
02:17:56,638 --> 02:17:59,160
forging so we did recommend that we roll

2655
02:17:59,160 --> 02:18:01,500
that account at the time the customer

2656
02:18:01,500 --> 02:18:05,638
was not comfortable doing that so

2657
02:18:05,638 --> 02:18:09,138
we did not start that process

2658
02:18:09,840 --> 02:18:12,420
so we're starting the IR now first thing

2659
02:18:12,420 --> 02:18:14,040
we do is we want to set the secure

2660
02:18:14,040 --> 02:18:15,540
Communications Channel we do this

2661
02:18:15,540 --> 02:18:17,218
because of the threat actors in your

2662
02:18:17,218 --> 02:18:18,299
environment and they're looking through

2663
02:18:18,299 --> 02:18:20,519
emails they're looking through slack

2664
02:18:20,519 --> 02:18:21,840
whatever you're using for communications

2665
02:18:21,840 --> 02:18:23,459
we don't want them to know that we are

2666
02:18:23,459 --> 02:18:25,679
here we want to give ourselves the

2667
02:18:25,679 --> 02:18:28,080
advantage of having as much time as

2668
02:18:28,080 --> 02:18:30,299
possible to scope and contain

2669
02:18:30,299 --> 02:18:33,898
so we deployed carbon black EDR to get

2670
02:18:33,898 --> 02:18:35,040
some visibility on the endpoint

2671
02:18:35,040 --> 02:18:38,099
processes we deploy Cisco umbrella DNS

2672
02:18:38,099 --> 02:18:40,799
to get some insight into what's going on

2673
02:18:40,799 --> 02:18:42,540
at the DNS level

2674
02:18:42,540 --> 02:18:45,780
and I want to make a point that if you

2675
02:18:45,780 --> 02:18:47,760
are if you're deploying these tools or

2676
02:18:47,760 --> 02:18:49,260
if you're a manager of these tools it's

2677
02:18:49,260 --> 02:18:51,359
very important you understand the

2678
02:18:51,359 --> 02:18:53,519
capabilities that you have a lot of

2679
02:18:53,519 --> 02:18:54,540
times

2680
02:18:54,540 --> 02:18:56,700
um just standard deployments you may not

2681
02:18:56,700 --> 02:18:58,859
use all the bells and whistles so for

2682
02:18:58,859 --> 02:19:01,138
our EDR we had to turn on the enhanced

2683
02:19:01,138 --> 02:19:02,459
ransomware protection because we're

2684
02:19:02,459 --> 02:19:04,320
already kind of expecting that to maybe

2685
02:19:04,320 --> 02:19:09,000
happen and also turn uh down the level

2686
02:19:09,000 --> 02:19:13,260
of of alerts by down I mean the score of

2687
02:19:13,260 --> 02:19:14,820
the alerts that we want to see because

2688
02:19:14,820 --> 02:19:17,398
we want to see as much Telemetry on the

2689
02:19:17,398 --> 02:19:18,780
end plane as possible

2690
02:19:18,780 --> 02:19:20,939
also

2691
02:19:20,939 --> 02:19:23,939
as soon as we deployed EDR right away we

2692
02:19:23,939 --> 02:19:26,780
had an alert on a Microsoft Exchange

2693
02:19:26,780 --> 02:19:29,638
Server this is a hybrid server that was

2694
02:19:29,638 --> 02:19:31,859
exposed and if you remember from 2022

2695
02:19:31,859 --> 02:19:33,898
there was a lot of proxy shell proxy

2696
02:19:33,898 --> 02:19:35,700
logon so we're already a little bit

2697
02:19:35,700 --> 02:19:38,280
suspicious about maybe maybe that's how

2698
02:19:38,280 --> 02:19:39,420
they got in

2699
02:19:39,420 --> 02:19:40,799
so

2700
02:19:40,799 --> 02:19:43,260
this alert was for unusual service path

2701
02:19:43,260 --> 02:19:46,439
so we want to dig into that

2702
02:19:46,439 --> 02:19:48,800
and what we find is we find

2703
02:19:48,800 --> 02:19:52,920
two windows binaries by name but in the

2704
02:19:52,920 --> 02:19:55,160
wrong location

2705
02:19:55,160 --> 02:19:57,540
World Wide Web worker process and

2706
02:19:57,540 --> 02:20:00,120
service host were both in C Windows

2707
02:20:00,120 --> 02:20:02,700
you'd expect to find these in a Windows

2708
02:20:02,700 --> 02:20:05,580
system 32 inet serve and system 32

2709
02:20:05,580 --> 02:20:08,939
respectively in addition service host

2710
02:20:08,939 --> 02:20:10,560
parent you would expect this to be

2711
02:20:10,560 --> 02:20:12,660
services but in this case it was a

2712
02:20:12,660 --> 02:20:14,880
w3wp.exe

2713
02:20:14,880 --> 02:20:17,640
so pretty suspicious we know this isn't

2714
02:20:17,640 --> 02:20:19,380
supposed to be happening but what is

2715
02:20:19,380 --> 02:20:20,640
this stuff

2716
02:20:20,640 --> 02:20:22,620
I want to make a point here

2717
02:20:22,620 --> 02:20:25,200
some environments are not empowering

2718
02:20:25,200 --> 02:20:27,540
their analysts their their sock their

2719
02:20:27,540 --> 02:20:31,200
cert to pull files and dig into them

2720
02:20:31,200 --> 02:20:33,479
you really should allow your smes to

2721
02:20:33,479 --> 02:20:34,859
look at what's going on so they can

2722
02:20:34,859 --> 02:20:36,600
properly see what's going on the

2723
02:20:36,600 --> 02:20:38,960
environment

2724
02:20:39,899 --> 02:20:42,180
so take a look at these files

2725
02:20:42,180 --> 02:20:45,780
and w3wp is the non-sucking service

2726
02:20:45,780 --> 02:20:47,880
manager it's free open source

2727
02:20:47,880 --> 02:20:50,220
distributed by Microsoft and that is

2728
02:20:50,220 --> 02:20:51,960
something that's used to manage services

2729
02:20:51,960 --> 02:20:54,720
install start stop

2730
02:20:54,720 --> 02:20:57,720
and service host was engrock which is a

2731
02:20:57,720 --> 02:21:00,420
reverse proxy so

2732
02:21:00,420 --> 02:21:03,540
I have the virus total pictures up here

2733
02:21:03,540 --> 02:21:05,399
and the reason I have that is I want to

2734
02:21:05,399 --> 02:21:08,580
point out that open source sandboxes are

2735
02:21:08,580 --> 02:21:12,300
don't always tell this uh story I think

2736
02:21:12,300 --> 02:21:15,359
if to an untrained eye you may see this

2737
02:21:15,359 --> 02:21:17,580
and say oh it's a false positive oh or

2738
02:21:17,580 --> 02:21:19,560
it's not that bad it's only a one or a

2739
02:21:19,560 --> 02:21:22,920
two who cares you really want to allow

2740
02:21:22,920 --> 02:21:25,740
your people to really investigate find

2741
02:21:25,740 --> 02:21:27,240
out what's going on

2742
02:21:27,240 --> 02:21:28,500
so

2743
02:21:28,500 --> 02:21:31,439
poking around the folder path for ngrok

2744
02:21:31,439 --> 02:21:33,240
I found this little snippet kind of

2745
02:21:33,240 --> 02:21:35,880
mentions uh RDP I don't know if this was

2746
02:21:35,880 --> 02:21:36,780
really

2747
02:21:36,780 --> 02:21:39,660
a live config but this was enough to get

2748
02:21:39,660 --> 02:21:42,899
the customer to say oh no uh maybe we

2749
02:21:42,899 --> 02:21:45,600
should roll that Kerberos account so we

2750
02:21:45,600 --> 02:21:47,460
started that process

2751
02:21:47,460 --> 02:21:50,160
these next few slides they're mostly in

2752
02:21:50,160 --> 02:21:52,620
chronological order but

2753
02:21:52,620 --> 02:21:54,300
they're kind of all happening at the

2754
02:21:54,300 --> 02:21:57,920
same time the time frame is very short

2755
02:21:59,760 --> 02:22:00,960
and

2756
02:22:00,960 --> 02:22:02,819
the title may be kind of cringy but

2757
02:22:02,819 --> 02:22:04,439
honestly I just really wanted this crab

2758
02:22:04,439 --> 02:22:06,359
on the slide

2759
02:22:06,359 --> 02:22:08,040
I love that guy

2760
02:22:08,040 --> 02:22:10,140
all right so right away we're starting

2761
02:22:10,140 --> 02:22:11,640
to see a lot of living on the land from

2762
02:22:11,640 --> 02:22:13,859
this adversary uh carbon Black's going

2763
02:22:13,859 --> 02:22:15,960
crazy they're doing things like adding

2764
02:22:15,960 --> 02:22:18,240
an admin account to a remote desktop

2765
02:22:18,240 --> 02:22:20,819
user now we have a second domain admin

2766
02:22:20,819 --> 02:22:23,340
that we know is popped they're allowing

2767
02:22:23,340 --> 02:22:24,720
RDP

2768
02:22:24,720 --> 02:22:28,740
they're enabling remote assistance

2769
02:22:28,740 --> 02:22:30,479
they're starting to Target the

2770
02:22:30,479 --> 02:22:32,040
customer's defenses they're trying to

2771
02:22:32,040 --> 02:22:34,319
disable Windows Defender looking at

2772
02:22:34,319 --> 02:22:37,280
possibly doing an amsi bypass

2773
02:22:37,280 --> 02:22:40,800
disabling sofos tamper protection

2774
02:22:40,800 --> 02:22:42,899
and this tight VNC one was really

2775
02:22:42,899 --> 02:22:45,420
interesting so what they did is they

2776
02:22:45,420 --> 02:22:47,700
they installed Type VNC and they

2777
02:22:47,700 --> 02:22:49,680
modified the registry to allow type V

2778
02:22:49,680 --> 02:22:53,040
and C to operate in safe mode why they'd

2779
02:22:53,040 --> 02:22:54,660
probably do this is because if they can

2780
02:22:54,660 --> 02:22:56,939
reboot in safe mode a lot of security

2781
02:22:56,939 --> 02:22:59,340
products won't work in safe mode so now

2782
02:22:59,340 --> 02:23:00,960
they're free to do whatever they want in

2783
02:23:00,960 --> 02:23:02,939
the box which is probably going to be

2784
02:23:02,939 --> 02:23:05,819
attempt encryption

2785
02:23:05,819 --> 02:23:07,800
yeah

2786
02:23:07,800 --> 02:23:10,800
also found another Windows process in a

2787
02:23:10,800 --> 02:23:12,960
directory we would not expect it to we'd

2788
02:23:12,960 --> 02:23:15,479
expect when I T win in it to be in

2789
02:23:15,479 --> 02:23:18,960
system 32 here it is in app data

2790
02:23:18,960 --> 02:23:21,780
so pull this file the hash is unknown

2791
02:23:21,780 --> 02:23:23,760
surprise

2792
02:23:23,760 --> 02:23:25,740
looking through running strings on it as

2793
02:23:25,740 --> 02:23:27,420
well while I was getting walls turning

2794
02:23:27,420 --> 02:23:29,700
through cuckoo looks like there are some

2795
02:23:29,700 --> 02:23:32,100
strings in there for go it's probably a

2796
02:23:32,100 --> 02:23:34,500
go pack binary a lot of references to

2797
02:23:34,500 --> 02:23:36,899
encryption functions probably have an

2798
02:23:36,899 --> 02:23:40,319
encrypter here and then there's an IP

2799
02:23:40,319 --> 02:23:42,660
with this the hash of this particular

2800
02:23:42,660 --> 02:23:44,460
binary we're able to Pivot around the

2801
02:23:44,460 --> 02:23:46,560
environment and find more hosts that

2802
02:23:46,560 --> 02:23:48,240
were previously unknown or suspect

2803
02:23:48,240 --> 02:23:50,880
suspected to be compromised

2804
02:23:50,880 --> 02:23:54,540
any ideas where this IP went

2805
02:23:54,540 --> 02:23:56,880
if you're thinking digital ocean you are

2806
02:23:56,880 --> 02:24:00,300
wrong and you are right uh Hawk host

2807
02:24:00,300 --> 02:24:02,640
never heard them before totally dig the

2808
02:24:02,640 --> 02:24:05,520
logo of course they accept uh Bitcoin

2809
02:24:05,520 --> 02:24:07,560
and ethereum

2810
02:24:07,560 --> 02:24:09,060
I kind of wanted to mess with their

2811
02:24:09,060 --> 02:24:10,680
customer service and ask him if I can

2812
02:24:10,680 --> 02:24:12,060
run ransomware but their customer

2813
02:24:12,060 --> 02:24:15,979
service chat's broken so I couldn't ask

2814
02:24:19,140 --> 02:24:20,700
by now I'm taking a look at what's going

2815
02:24:20,700 --> 02:24:23,100
on in cuckoo and we can see that that

2816
02:24:23,100 --> 02:24:26,819
that it um that binary has a ransom note

2817
02:24:26,819 --> 02:24:29,760
in it I can't there was a lot of

2818
02:24:29,760 --> 02:24:31,380
different file paths that wouldn't fit

2819
02:24:31,380 --> 02:24:35,060
on all these slides so just chose one

2820
02:24:35,220 --> 02:24:36,600
so

2821
02:24:36,600 --> 02:24:38,700
with the enhanced protections that we

2822
02:24:38,700 --> 02:24:40,920
put on in the carbon black

2823
02:24:40,920 --> 02:24:42,960
they could not get encryption they were

2824
02:24:42,960 --> 02:24:47,640
stopped so what they did that uh was was

2825
02:24:47,640 --> 02:24:50,880
interesting is they opened notepad

2826
02:24:50,880 --> 02:24:53,880
through Explorer and gave us a ransom

2827
02:24:53,880 --> 02:24:56,040
note that way so at this point there's

2828
02:24:56,040 --> 02:24:59,340
no encryption but hey surprise here's a

2829
02:24:59,340 --> 02:25:01,460
note

2830
02:25:02,640 --> 02:25:05,640
so at this time

2831
02:25:05,640 --> 02:25:07,979
we're behind the curve

2832
02:25:07,979 --> 02:25:12,180
the scope is widening and we we can't

2833
02:25:12,180 --> 02:25:14,340
contain them fast enough they're very

2834
02:25:14,340 --> 02:25:17,580
fast moving we decided to pull the plug

2835
02:25:17,580 --> 02:25:20,520
so went ahead pulled the internet this

2836
02:25:20,520 --> 02:25:21,540
may be tougher to do in large

2837
02:25:21,540 --> 02:25:23,160
environments fortunately this customer

2838
02:25:23,160 --> 02:25:24,540
was able to do it

2839
02:25:24,540 --> 02:25:27,000
fully rebuild the domain new domain name

2840
02:25:27,000 --> 02:25:30,479
any server or host that

2841
02:25:30,479 --> 02:25:33,540
had been touched fully rebuilt

2842
02:25:33,540 --> 02:25:35,819
from scratch not from backups because at

2843
02:25:35,819 --> 02:25:37,500
this point they'd been in an environment

2844
02:25:37,500 --> 02:25:40,200
so long we weren't confident that maybe

2845
02:25:40,200 --> 02:25:42,600
the backups hadn't been corrupted

2846
02:25:42,600 --> 02:25:45,060
we reviewed configs of network hardware

2847
02:25:45,060 --> 02:25:47,399
switches routers firewalls see if

2848
02:25:47,399 --> 02:25:48,420
there's any signs anything been

2849
02:25:48,420 --> 02:25:49,920
compromised in there

2850
02:25:49,920 --> 02:25:51,859
and by this time leadership's getting

2851
02:25:51,859 --> 02:25:54,780
extortion emails directly

2852
02:25:54,780 --> 02:25:56,460
and that's the thing with that's the

2853
02:25:56,460 --> 02:25:59,100
thing with um double extortion you don't

2854
02:25:59,100 --> 02:26:01,200
need encryption you can just threat

2855
02:26:01,200 --> 02:26:03,840
reputational harm customer data out

2856
02:26:03,840 --> 02:26:06,920
there and

2857
02:26:09,180 --> 02:26:10,439
here's a little sample from the

2858
02:26:10,439 --> 02:26:12,420
extortion email

2859
02:26:12,420 --> 02:26:14,100
um it's not in there for obvious reasons

2860
02:26:14,100 --> 02:26:15,840
but they had full listing of the servers

2861
02:26:15,840 --> 02:26:17,700
they'd compromise who the server owners

2862
02:26:17,700 --> 02:26:20,700
were what kind of data was on it the job

2863
02:26:20,700 --> 02:26:22,380
functions so they'd been there at least

2864
02:26:22,380 --> 02:26:23,880
six weeks doing a really good job of

2865
02:26:23,880 --> 02:26:27,560
Recon finding out financials

2866
02:26:28,380 --> 02:26:31,039
foreign

2867
02:26:31,220 --> 02:26:35,100
takeaway here is if you prepare properly

2868
02:26:35,100 --> 02:26:37,800
ransomware can be beat have an incident

2869
02:26:37,800 --> 02:26:40,260
response plan make sure you practice it

2870
02:26:40,260 --> 02:26:42,060
whether it be table tops or something

2871
02:26:42,060 --> 02:26:44,399
smaller know who in your organization

2872
02:26:44,399 --> 02:26:46,560
you will need to mobilize if you have an

2873
02:26:46,560 --> 02:26:47,460
incident

2874
02:26:47,460 --> 02:26:49,740
know your environment know what kind of

2875
02:26:49,740 --> 02:26:51,720
applications are allowed should be in

2876
02:26:51,720 --> 02:26:52,740
there

2877
02:26:52,740 --> 02:26:54,479
leverage your tool sets make sure you're

2878
02:26:54,479 --> 02:26:58,460
using all the all the bells and whistles

2879
02:26:59,100 --> 02:27:01,800
make sure you trust your sneeze too

2880
02:27:01,800 --> 02:27:04,800
often management does not allow their

2881
02:27:04,800 --> 02:27:07,080
smes to react quickly these are the

2882
02:27:07,080 --> 02:27:09,060
people you trust you need to allow them

2883
02:27:09,060 --> 02:27:10,439
to do their job

2884
02:27:10,439 --> 02:27:12,180
and beware of pups just because

2885
02:27:12,180 --> 02:27:13,560
something doesn't have a high score and

2886
02:27:13,560 --> 02:27:15,720
virus total or maybe free and open

2887
02:27:15,720 --> 02:27:18,359
source or maybe assists admin using it

2888
02:27:18,359 --> 02:27:20,700
does not mean it's good skilled Network

2889
02:27:20,700 --> 02:27:22,500
penetration people will use whatever

2890
02:27:22,500 --> 02:27:25,920
they can to compromise your environment

2891
02:27:25,920 --> 02:27:29,540
and get the get the job done

2892
02:27:29,640 --> 02:27:30,960
foreign

2893
02:27:30,960 --> 02:27:33,960
so that's all we have for now

2894
02:27:33,960 --> 02:27:37,220
um does anyone have any questions

2895
02:27:40,260 --> 02:27:43,220
awesome oh

2896
02:27:52,859 --> 02:27:54,200
live stream

2897
02:27:54,200 --> 02:27:58,140
hello there we go um yeah I just was

2898
02:27:58,140 --> 02:28:00,479
wondering if you know if they specify a

2899
02:28:00,479 --> 02:28:02,520
market of their attacks or if they're

2900
02:28:02,520 --> 02:28:04,979
just opportunists yeah so as of right

2901
02:28:04,979 --> 02:28:06,600
now what we're seeing is they're still

2902
02:28:06,600 --> 02:28:08,760
kind of taking that opportunist sort of

2903
02:28:08,760 --> 02:28:09,899
Route

2904
02:28:09,899 --> 02:28:12,000
um some of the industries that appear on

2905
02:28:12,000 --> 02:28:14,600
their leak Site range from education

2906
02:28:14,600 --> 02:28:18,120
manufacturing Financial so it's still a

2907
02:28:18,120 --> 02:28:19,500
bit scattered and again they're going

2908
02:28:19,500 --> 02:28:21,840
after anywhere from small to medium

2909
02:28:21,840 --> 02:28:24,260
organizations as well as large

2910
02:28:24,260 --> 02:28:26,819
multinationals so as of right now we're

2911
02:28:26,819 --> 02:28:29,939
not able to make any specific sort of uh

2912
02:28:29,939 --> 02:28:32,280
claims or any sort of blanket statements

2913
02:28:32,280 --> 02:28:36,380
on potential preferences

2914
02:28:36,920 --> 02:28:40,439
if you want to fabulous go ahead I'm

2915
02:28:40,439 --> 02:28:42,680
sorry

2916
02:28:46,500 --> 02:28:49,800
hello testing oh okay

2917
02:28:49,800 --> 02:28:51,960
um so in the graph you're showing

2918
02:28:51,960 --> 02:28:53,399
earlier in the talk

2919
02:28:53,399 --> 02:28:56,520
um it showed in September there was a I

2920
02:28:56,520 --> 02:28:58,800
think higher number of compromises but a

2921
02:28:58,800 --> 02:29:02,460
lower number of data being uploaded uh

2922
02:29:02,460 --> 02:29:05,700
right is that like more more victims

2923
02:29:05,700 --> 02:29:07,979
paid or what that you know accounts for

2924
02:29:07,979 --> 02:29:10,560
that right well again I mean ultimately

2925
02:29:10,560 --> 02:29:12,960
threat actors can claim that they've

2926
02:29:12,960 --> 02:29:15,960
compromised any number of victims on any

2927
02:29:15,960 --> 02:29:17,939
number of days or or within any number

2928
02:29:17,939 --> 02:29:20,280
of months so with some of the months

2929
02:29:20,280 --> 02:29:21,540
that we're seeing where they actually

2930
02:29:21,540 --> 02:29:24,540
have been uh compromised

2931
02:29:24,540 --> 02:29:26,399
um it just looks like they're actual

2932
02:29:26,399 --> 02:29:29,160
posting to their leak site is delayed by

2933
02:29:29,160 --> 02:29:30,720
about a month

2934
02:29:30,720 --> 02:29:32,880
um so so obviously what we can see in

2935
02:29:32,880 --> 02:29:35,880
September is that uh maybe some of those

2936
02:29:35,880 --> 02:29:38,340
postings to their leak site were in

2937
02:29:38,340 --> 02:29:40,920
October actually

2938
02:29:40,920 --> 02:29:44,060
hopefully that answers

2939
02:29:46,500 --> 02:29:49,740
uh do you know slash can you say what

2940
02:29:49,740 --> 02:29:51,180
the initial

2941
02:29:51,180 --> 02:29:54,300
um infection Vector was

2942
02:29:54,300 --> 02:29:56,939
that's a good question uh we believe it

2943
02:29:56,939 --> 02:29:59,340
was a proxy log on proxy shell but we

2944
02:29:59,340 --> 02:30:00,899
don't have concrete evidence a lot of

2945
02:30:00,899 --> 02:30:02,520
logs were deleted a lot of evidence was

2946
02:30:02,520 --> 02:30:04,260
missing

2947
02:30:04,260 --> 02:30:07,380
and then can you say or what's your

2948
02:30:07,380 --> 02:30:10,200
insight into what would have been a good

2949
02:30:10,200 --> 02:30:13,140
way to detect this before they started

2950
02:30:13,140 --> 02:30:15,600
mobilizing

2951
02:30:15,600 --> 02:30:16,500
foreign

2952
02:30:16,500 --> 02:30:19,740
I think if the customer had a non-legacy

2953
02:30:19,740 --> 02:30:22,439
AV like a more current EDR they probably

2954
02:30:22,439 --> 02:30:25,280
would have noticed right away

2955
02:30:26,160 --> 02:30:27,960
pretty quick we've got a couple Discord

2956
02:30:27,960 --> 02:30:30,120
questions just one second

2957
02:30:30,120 --> 02:30:32,040
um one of the questions was why were

2958
02:30:32,040 --> 02:30:34,439
there more C2 server activities even

2959
02:30:34,439 --> 02:30:36,120
though the ransom activities were going

2960
02:30:36,120 --> 02:30:38,280
down it's not necessarily that their

2961
02:30:38,280 --> 02:30:40,100
Ransom activities were going down

2962
02:30:40,100 --> 02:30:42,899
ultimately what we are seeing

2963
02:30:42,899 --> 02:30:46,020
is that they're bringing on more command

2964
02:30:46,020 --> 02:30:47,760
and control servers so whether that's

2965
02:30:47,760 --> 02:30:50,580
only two servers per month or 20 servers

2966
02:30:50,580 --> 02:30:53,760
per month the continuation to bring on

2967
02:30:53,760 --> 02:30:56,160
C2 servers indicates that they are

2968
02:30:56,160 --> 02:30:59,220
looking to infect or encrypt more

2969
02:30:59,220 --> 02:31:02,580
victims and then the other question is

2970
02:31:02,580 --> 02:31:05,100
when you say enable the people to

2971
02:31:05,100 --> 02:31:07,200
analyze what's discovered are you

2972
02:31:07,200 --> 02:31:09,660
talking about having a lab prepared any

2973
02:31:09,660 --> 02:31:12,420
insight on what kind of setup or tool

2974
02:31:12,420 --> 02:31:16,100
sets that might be a youth question

2975
02:31:16,260 --> 02:31:19,439
okay sorry I've seen environments where

2976
02:31:19,439 --> 02:31:21,300
where you have your sock or your assert

2977
02:31:21,300 --> 02:31:23,880
team and they they can look at an alert

2978
02:31:23,880 --> 02:31:25,800
and that's it they can't pull a file

2979
02:31:25,800 --> 02:31:27,420
they can't really dig in they don't have

2980
02:31:27,420 --> 02:31:29,340
tools they don't have the Telemetry in

2981
02:31:29,340 --> 02:31:32,280
the network those are very important and

2982
02:31:32,280 --> 02:31:34,319
if these are the people that you're

2983
02:31:34,319 --> 02:31:36,180
entrusting pretty much with the Keys of

2984
02:31:36,180 --> 02:31:38,700
the Kingdom you should you should allow

2985
02:31:38,700 --> 02:31:42,060
them to do the job appropriately don't

2986
02:31:42,060 --> 02:31:43,979
relegate them to just kind of looking at

2987
02:31:43,979 --> 02:31:45,540
alert and not being able to figure out

2988
02:31:45,540 --> 02:31:47,460
what it actually does

2989
02:31:47,460 --> 02:31:49,800
um in certain instances it's a

2990
02:31:49,800 --> 02:31:51,420
difference between calling calling a

2991
02:31:51,420 --> 02:31:53,240
consultancy to come in six weeks later

2992
02:31:53,240 --> 02:31:55,800
when maybe someone very skilled in house

2993
02:31:55,800 --> 02:31:57,960
could have got ahead of this uh in the

2994
02:31:57,960 --> 02:32:00,619
first 24 hours

2995
02:32:04,080 --> 02:32:07,080
I had a question if you could answer how

2996
02:32:07,080 --> 02:32:08,040
much

2997
02:32:08,040 --> 02:32:10,439
man hours was it to rebuild everything

2998
02:32:10,439 --> 02:32:12,899
for that customer when they pulled the

2999
02:32:12,899 --> 02:32:14,040
plug

3000
02:32:14,040 --> 02:32:17,359
more than they wanted to do

3001
02:32:24,479 --> 02:32:26,760
you mentioned uh at the beginning one of

3002
02:32:26,760 --> 02:32:27,840
the first steps was you set up

3003
02:32:27,840 --> 02:32:29,819
out-of-band communication was that

3004
02:32:29,819 --> 02:32:32,220
within the entire company or just with

3005
02:32:32,220 --> 02:32:34,740
the incident response team and if if you

3006
02:32:34,740 --> 02:32:35,760
could share

3007
02:32:35,760 --> 02:32:37,200
um what do you use or what do you

3008
02:32:37,200 --> 02:32:38,640
recommend for out-of-band communication

3009
02:32:38,640 --> 02:32:39,960
and I'm assuming that said that the

3010
02:32:39,960 --> 02:32:41,580
threat actors can't

3011
02:32:41,580 --> 02:32:43,740
see what you're communicating to each

3012
02:32:43,740 --> 02:32:45,899
other correct correct we recommend

3013
02:32:45,899 --> 02:32:47,460
signal I'm sure there's other that are

3014
02:32:47,460 --> 02:32:50,100
just fine too and uh just the people

3015
02:32:50,100 --> 02:32:52,319
that were involved in the incident

3016
02:32:52,319 --> 02:32:54,540
response were in there just that so but

3017
02:32:54,540 --> 02:32:57,479
it's the company's incident response the

3018
02:32:57,479 --> 02:32:59,640
the stakeholders as well as the teams

3019
02:32:59,640 --> 02:33:01,920
that are correct customer and Consulting

3020
02:33:01,920 --> 02:33:03,300
got it that's helpful thanks and then

3021
02:33:03,300 --> 02:33:04,680
the other question is

3022
02:33:04,680 --> 02:33:07,920
um do you know if this this client or

3023
02:33:07,920 --> 02:33:09,660
other customers can you share whether or

3024
02:33:09,660 --> 02:33:10,740
not they

3025
02:33:10,740 --> 02:33:13,680
um added um back Channel communication

3026
02:33:13,680 --> 02:33:16,080
happening with the threat actors to

3027
02:33:16,080 --> 02:33:17,460
negotiate with them to kind of keep them

3028
02:33:17,460 --> 02:33:19,439
at Bay

3029
02:33:19,439 --> 02:33:22,620
I can I can probably comment on that

3030
02:33:22,620 --> 02:33:24,840
um I will say it's been my experience

3031
02:33:24,840 --> 02:33:27,300
that whether or not you're intend on

3032
02:33:27,300 --> 02:33:29,700
paying the ransom you may buy yourself

3033
02:33:29,700 --> 02:33:32,100
some time you may get what we call a

3034
02:33:32,100 --> 02:33:33,720
proof of life where you can get proof

3035
02:33:33,720 --> 02:33:36,240
that they actually do have the files yep

3036
02:33:36,240 --> 02:33:38,160
uh you may accidentally get someone

3037
02:33:38,160 --> 02:33:40,140
else's information too

3038
02:33:40,140 --> 02:33:40,740
um

3039
02:33:40,740 --> 02:33:42,840
so

3040
02:33:42,840 --> 02:33:44,399
does that answer your questions use Pros

3041
02:33:44,399 --> 02:33:45,840
yeah

3042
02:33:45,840 --> 02:33:48,380
thank you

3043
02:33:50,160 --> 02:33:52,560
so my question was basically his

3044
02:33:52,560 --> 02:33:54,899
question that is um when the executives

3045
02:33:54,899 --> 02:33:57,660
receive those emails about threat of

3046
02:33:57,660 --> 02:34:01,200
displaying the data and sharing the data

3047
02:34:01,200 --> 02:34:03,000
um what it what can you do at that point

3048
02:34:03,000 --> 02:34:04,680
I mean what can you do to protect the

3049
02:34:04,680 --> 02:34:05,939
data or

3050
02:34:05,939 --> 02:34:08,700
who are not paying

3051
02:34:08,700 --> 02:34:11,100
well I mean you never have to pay I I

3052
02:34:11,100 --> 02:34:13,020
guess every business needs to decide for

3053
02:34:13,020 --> 02:34:14,520
themselves

3054
02:34:14,520 --> 02:34:16,800
what they want to do uh it could be that

3055
02:34:16,800 --> 02:34:18,180
you get data and you're like oh we don't

3056
02:34:18,180 --> 02:34:19,620
care about this who cares put on the

3057
02:34:19,620 --> 02:34:21,240
internet right

3058
02:34:21,240 --> 02:34:23,460
um I can't really answer that because

3059
02:34:23,460 --> 02:34:26,839
it's business independent

3060
02:34:29,040 --> 02:34:31,760
quick question

3061
02:34:32,399 --> 02:34:35,760
it showed C2 servers over time are you

3062
02:34:35,760 --> 02:34:36,859
able to

3063
02:34:36,859 --> 02:34:40,020
disclose how you are tracking that or

3064
02:34:40,020 --> 02:34:41,880
how you're finding those no

3065
02:34:41,880 --> 02:34:44,280
um unfortunately no I thought I'd ask

3066
02:34:44,280 --> 02:34:47,060
thank you

3067
02:34:52,740 --> 02:34:54,840
the reason the reason we can't disclose

3068
02:34:54,840 --> 02:34:56,160
that is because we don't want them to

3069
02:34:56,160 --> 02:34:59,580
Pivot on on how we're tracking them

3070
02:34:59,580 --> 02:35:01,920
a couple of those slides had uh

3071
02:35:01,920 --> 02:35:04,680
different files that you found and like

3072
02:35:04,680 --> 02:35:06,720
an incorrect location I'm just curious

3073
02:35:06,720 --> 02:35:08,700
was that picked up by EDR or was that

3074
02:35:08,700 --> 02:35:11,700
just analysis based on kind of knowledge

3075
02:35:11,700 --> 02:35:12,540
of

3076
02:35:12,540 --> 02:35:14,580
this specific group

3077
02:35:14,580 --> 02:35:16,500
so so right off the bat that was picked

3078
02:35:16,500 --> 02:35:19,200
up by EDR I think most edrs will check

3079
02:35:19,200 --> 02:35:20,819
for those certain files and unusual

3080
02:35:20,819 --> 02:35:24,899
service paths or unexpected parent and

3081
02:35:24,899 --> 02:35:26,700
then also with experience that stuff

3082
02:35:26,700 --> 02:35:28,260
pops out right away like you kind of you

3083
02:35:28,260 --> 02:35:29,760
kind of understand okay this is

3084
02:35:29,760 --> 02:35:32,840
definitely not supposed to be there

3085
02:35:43,200 --> 02:35:45,680
oh sorry

3086
02:35:46,740 --> 02:35:48,780
foreign

3087
02:35:48,780 --> 02:35:52,380
so with the malware being written and go

3088
02:35:52,380 --> 02:35:54,060
the encryptor is being written and go do

3089
02:35:54,060 --> 02:35:54,960
we see them actually going

3090
02:35:54,960 --> 02:35:58,039
cross-platform as well

3091
02:35:59,460 --> 02:36:03,540
um not necessarily but the thing one of

3092
02:36:03,540 --> 02:36:06,060
one of the reasons so so what I can say

3093
02:36:06,060 --> 02:36:09,120
is one of the reasons that that we

3094
02:36:09,120 --> 02:36:11,700
kind of think that they chose go is

3095
02:36:11,700 --> 02:36:14,899
because you can go across both platforms

3096
02:36:14,899 --> 02:36:17,819
so I will say with their own personal

3097
02:36:17,819 --> 02:36:19,399
infrastructure

3098
02:36:19,399 --> 02:36:22,500
we have seen them use some some window

3099
02:36:22,500 --> 02:36:26,160
hosts but their primary preference is

3100
02:36:26,160 --> 02:36:29,100
Linux host for their own C2 servers and

3101
02:36:29,100 --> 02:36:30,859
their own infrastructure

3102
02:36:30,859 --> 02:36:33,240
but again one of the reasons that we

3103
02:36:33,240 --> 02:36:35,520
think that they're using go is you know

3104
02:36:35,520 --> 02:36:38,280
the readability uh the speed and also

3105
02:36:38,280 --> 02:36:40,920
because it is able to perform really

3106
02:36:40,920 --> 02:36:42,780
really well across different platforms

3107
02:36:42,780 --> 02:36:45,000
and os's

3108
02:36:45,000 --> 02:36:47,720
thank you

3109
02:36:48,000 --> 02:36:50,840
any other questions

3110
02:36:57,240 --> 02:36:58,680
um so I'm not sure if you can answer

3111
02:36:58,680 --> 02:37:01,080
this question but uh you mentioned that

3112
02:37:01,080 --> 02:37:03,420
they had a legacy antivirus in place at

3113
02:37:03,420 --> 02:37:05,700
the time which did not pick up on any of

3114
02:37:05,700 --> 02:37:08,880
these weird Behavior leading up to the

3115
02:37:08,880 --> 02:37:10,859
accelerated you know things they were

3116
02:37:10,859 --> 02:37:12,600
doing are you at Liberty to disclose

3117
02:37:12,600 --> 02:37:15,859
what better it was

3118
02:37:16,020 --> 02:37:20,100
I will say this it it wasn't just

3119
02:37:20,100 --> 02:37:22,319
the products they're using it was how

3120
02:37:22,319 --> 02:37:24,359
they were they were responding they were

3121
02:37:24,359 --> 02:37:26,399
kind of playing whack-a-mole there are a

3122
02:37:26,399 --> 02:37:29,700
lot of alerts that led up to this point

3123
02:37:29,700 --> 02:37:31,500
and if someone would have been in power

3124
02:37:31,500 --> 02:37:33,660
to maybe dig a little bit deeper I think

3125
02:37:33,660 --> 02:37:36,420
they could have stopped it a lot earlier

3126
02:37:36,420 --> 02:37:39,359
which kind of goes back it's really

3127
02:37:39,359 --> 02:37:41,880
important to give people the tools to to

3128
02:37:41,880 --> 02:37:43,560
succeed to really

3129
02:37:43,560 --> 02:37:46,260
Empower them to investigate

3130
02:37:46,260 --> 02:37:48,859

04:06:09,300 --> 04:06:12,300
experience

3474
04:06:25,319 --> 04:06:27,779
hey everybody Welcome to our Cactus con

3475
04:06:27,779 --> 04:06:30,359
keynote how's your con going so far

3476
04:06:30,359 --> 04:06:33,660
yeah all right we love to hear it that's

3477
04:06:33,660 --> 04:06:35,699
fantastic my name is Jamie witterton I'm

3478
04:06:35,699 --> 04:06:38,880
the cfp lead for cactus con and as the

3479
04:06:38,880 --> 04:06:40,680
cfp lead I get to see all of the

3480
04:06:40,680 --> 04:06:42,479
submissions not just the ones that that

3481
04:06:42,479 --> 04:06:44,939
make our our tracks here uh and I have

3482
04:06:44,939 --> 04:06:46,020
to tell you we noticed something really

3483
04:06:46,020 --> 04:06:49,020
interesting this year there were a lot a

3484
04:06:49,020 --> 04:06:50,819
lot of AI and machine learning

3485
04:06:50,819 --> 04:06:53,160
submissions we got so many submissions

3486
04:06:53,160 --> 04:06:56,040
we even had a submission for a whole AI

3487
04:06:56,040 --> 04:06:58,620
Village which we accepted and you can go

3488
04:06:58,620 --> 04:07:00,300
to AI Village and do some of the

3489
04:07:00,300 --> 04:07:02,100
workshops in there

3490
04:07:02,100 --> 04:07:04,680
it's clear that artificial intelligence

3491
04:07:04,680 --> 04:07:06,660
and machine learning are changing the

3492
04:07:06,660 --> 04:07:08,580
way that we work particularly in our

3493
04:07:08,580 --> 04:07:09,840
field and there are a lot of open

3494
04:07:09,840 --> 04:07:13,739
questions about how that's happening

3495
04:07:13,739 --> 04:07:14,760
um there are a lot of questions about

3496
04:07:14,760 --> 04:07:18,060
chat GPT you may have noticed that our

3497
04:07:18,060 --> 04:07:21,300
staff bios were written by AI some of

3498
04:07:21,300 --> 04:07:23,279
the images that we've used for our staff

3499
04:07:23,279 --> 04:07:26,340
bios are also generated by Ai and if

3500
04:07:26,340 --> 04:07:28,319
you're watching this on YouTube

3501
04:07:28,319 --> 04:07:31,140
the interstitial music between

3502
04:07:31,140 --> 04:07:34,680
speakers was also generated by AI it

3503
04:07:34,680 --> 04:07:36,660
sounds great doesn't it but there are a

3504
04:07:36,660 --> 04:07:37,739
lot of questions about how it's being

3505
04:07:37,739 --> 04:07:40,260
used and how we can secure AI so I'm

3506
04:07:40,260 --> 04:07:42,120
really excited that today we have for

3507
04:07:42,120 --> 04:07:43,920
our first keynote speaker Professor

3508
04:07:43,920 --> 04:07:45,660
Paulo shakarian from Arizona State

3509
04:07:45,660 --> 04:07:47,640
University

3510
04:07:47,640 --> 04:07:49,800
Paulo's a tenured associate professor at

3511
04:07:49,800 --> 04:07:51,779
the Fulton schools of engineering at ASU

3512
04:07:51,779 --> 04:07:54,359
he specializes in Ai and machine

3513
04:07:54,359 --> 04:07:55,380
learning

3514
04:07:55,380 --> 04:07:56,819
Paulo received the air force young

3515
04:07:56,819 --> 04:07:58,800
investigator award during his time at

3516
04:07:58,800 --> 04:08:00,779
ASU along with multiple best paper

3517
04:08:00,779 --> 04:08:03,000
Awards and considerable coverage in the

3518
04:08:03,000 --> 04:08:05,279
Press he's been funded by organizations

3519
04:08:05,279 --> 04:08:07,080
including the intelligence Advanced

3520
04:08:07,080 --> 04:08:09,239

3524
04:08:15,420 --> 04:08:16,979
several others

3525
04:08:16,979 --> 04:08:18,840
Paulo also co-founded and led the

3526
04:08:18,840 --> 04:08:20,640
startup company cyber reconnaissance

3527
04:08:20,640 --> 04:08:22,560
Incorporated which was the first

3528
04:08:22,560 --> 04:08:24,000
commercial solution to use machine

3529
04:08:24,000 --> 04:08:26,880
learning to predict future exploits

3530
04:08:26,880 --> 04:08:28,800
and earlier in his career Paolo was an

3531
04:08:28,800 --> 04:08:30,720
officer in the U.S army where he served

3532
04:08:30,720 --> 04:08:32,640
two combat tours in Iraq earning a

3533
04:08:32,640 --> 04:08:34,199
bronze star and the Army Commendation

3534
04:08:34,199 --> 04:08:36,960
Medal for Valor today his talk is titled

3535
04:08:36,960 --> 04:08:38,340
the new challenges of artificial

3536
04:08:38,340 --> 04:08:40,260
intelligence thank you so much for being

3537
04:08:40,260 --> 04:08:43,160
with us today Paulo

3538
04:08:49,080 --> 04:08:51,000
well thank you very much for coming to

3539
04:08:51,000 --> 04:08:53,580
my talk and thank you Jamie for such a

3540
04:08:53,580 --> 04:08:54,960
nice introduction

3541
04:08:54,960 --> 04:08:58,859
so I'm Paulo shakarian and I started my

3542
04:08:58,859 --> 04:09:01,620
journey with artificial intelligence way

3543
04:09:01,620 --> 04:09:04,160
back in 2007.

3544
04:09:04,160 --> 04:09:07,979
Iowa had gotten back from my second tour

3545
04:09:07,979 --> 04:09:09,120
in Iraq

3546
04:09:09,120 --> 04:09:13,500
and I was sent to Northern Virginia to

3547
04:09:13,500 --> 04:09:15,660
be an advisor to an organization called

3548
04:09:15,660 --> 04:09:17,580
the defense Advanced research projects

3549
04:09:17,580 --> 04:09:19,920
agency or DARPA

3550
04:09:19,920 --> 04:09:22,199
and they just wanted advice from people

3551
04:09:22,199 --> 04:09:26,060
in the field on what could be relevant

3552
04:09:26,060 --> 04:09:28,439
to their projects that they were working

3553
04:09:28,439 --> 04:09:29,460
on

3554
04:09:29,460 --> 04:09:31,620
and one of the projects I became

3555
04:09:31,620 --> 04:09:33,420
involved with was something called the

3556
04:09:33,420 --> 04:09:35,760
DARPA Urban challenge

3557
04:09:35,760 --> 04:09:38,279
and they sent me and the other military

3558
04:09:38,279 --> 04:09:42,420
folks out to this test and abandoned Air

3559
04:09:42,420 --> 04:09:46,380
Force Base in Victorville California

3560
04:09:46,380 --> 04:09:49,920
and at this Air Force Base research

3561
04:09:49,920 --> 04:09:52,160
organizations from across the country

3562
04:09:52,160 --> 04:09:55,979
had brought in the first generation of

3563
04:09:55,979 --> 04:09:58,620
fully autonomous vehicles to drive

3564
04:09:58,620 --> 04:10:00,720
around in this abandoned Air Force Base

3565
04:10:00,720 --> 04:10:02,640
and see what happens

3566
04:10:02,640 --> 04:10:05,939
and so we had stunning moments where at

3567
04:10:05,939 --> 04:10:07,739
a four-way intersection two of the

3568
04:10:07,739 --> 04:10:09,359
autonomous vehicles

3569
04:10:09,359 --> 04:10:13,140
met each other and inced forward maybe

3570
04:10:13,140 --> 04:10:15,840
about half an inch at a time trying to

3571
04:10:15,840 --> 04:10:17,699
figure out what to do in some very

3572
04:10:17,699 --> 04:10:20,520
overly cautious artificial intelligence

3573
04:10:20,520 --> 04:10:22,080
of the day

3574
04:10:22,080 --> 04:10:24,120
so in today's talk can we cue the slides

3575
04:10:24,120 --> 04:10:26,359
please

3576
04:10:34,140 --> 04:10:35,880
and of course

3577
04:10:35,880 --> 04:10:39,739
you get to see my messy desktop

3578
04:10:51,540 --> 04:10:55,100
let's try that one more time

3579
04:11:02,640 --> 04:11:04,380
okay

3580
04:11:04,380 --> 04:11:07,220
so today

3581
04:11:07,439 --> 04:11:09,720
we can now use artificial intelligence

3582
04:11:09,720 --> 04:11:13,380
to solve very important problems such as

3583
04:11:13,380 --> 04:11:16,278
playing Pac-Man

3584
04:11:16,979 --> 04:11:19,199
and you know Pac-Man of course we're all

3585
04:11:19,199 --> 04:11:22,160
familiar with this game

3586
04:11:22,680 --> 04:11:25,500
so let's talk a little bit about it so

3587
04:11:25,500 --> 04:11:28,979
mid 1980s the Japanese version was

3588
04:11:28,979 --> 04:11:31,380
released

3589
04:11:31,380 --> 04:11:35,460
late 1980 Pac-Man made its way across

3590
04:11:35,460 --> 04:11:38,880
the ocean here in the United States

3591
04:11:38,880 --> 04:11:41,760
earned a billion dollars in its first

3592
04:11:41,760 --> 04:11:44,100
year in quarters

3593
04:11:44,100 --> 04:11:46,699
okay

3594
04:11:47,399 --> 04:11:50,760
so fast forward a little bit

3595
04:11:50,760 --> 04:11:54,540
in 2013 deepmind which got acquired by

3596
04:11:54,540 --> 04:11:56,939
Google showed that you could use deep

3597
04:11:56,939 --> 04:11:59,279
neural networks to reach near human

3598
04:11:59,279 --> 04:12:03,600
level performance on Atari games

3599
04:12:03,600 --> 04:12:07,560
now deepmind extremely well funded all

3600
04:12:07,560 --> 04:12:10,080
the latest computer hardware

3601
04:12:10,080 --> 04:12:12,899
okay this is a little less than a decade

3602
04:12:12,899 --> 04:12:14,399
ago

3603
04:12:14,399 --> 04:12:17,580
why I talk about Pac-Man

3604
04:12:17,580 --> 04:12:18,779
today

3605
04:12:18,779 --> 04:12:22,080
student project in one of my classes

3606
04:12:22,080 --> 04:12:24,660
to have an AI agent play Pac-Man and do

3607
04:12:24,660 --> 04:12:26,939
pretty well

3608
04:12:26,939 --> 04:12:28,859
so look at what happened in just the

3609
04:12:28,859 --> 04:12:30,479
last 10 years

3610
04:12:30,479 --> 04:12:32,840
we went from something that was in the

3611
04:12:32,840 --> 04:12:35,399
exclusive purview

3612
04:12:35,399 --> 04:12:38,340
of a highly funded tech company

3613
04:12:38,340 --> 04:12:41,939
so now being accessible by students

3614
04:12:41,939 --> 04:12:44,279
that's a lot of progress in a short

3615
04:12:44,279 --> 04:12:45,779
amount of time

3616
04:12:45,779 --> 04:12:48,120
not to mention this was something before

3617
04:12:48,120 --> 04:12:51,359
2013 many people thought

3618
04:12:51,359 --> 04:12:54,620
we could not do this

3619
04:12:55,560 --> 04:12:57,899
so how did we get there

3620
04:12:57,899 --> 04:13:00,960
well deep neural networks are clearly a

3621
04:13:00,960 --> 04:13:03,479
driver of a lot of the accomplishments

3622
04:13:03,479 --> 04:13:07,099
today in artificial intelligence

3623
04:13:09,420 --> 04:13:12,899
so why what is special about deep

3624
04:13:12,899 --> 04:13:15,319
learning

3625
04:13:15,840 --> 04:13:17,880
when I went to grad school

3626
04:13:17,880 --> 04:13:20,340
there was kind of this thought that you

3627
04:13:20,340 --> 04:13:22,500
could generally get to about 85 percent

3628
04:13:22,500 --> 04:13:24,899
accuracy with any machine learning

3629
04:13:24,899 --> 04:13:26,279
problem

3630
04:13:26,279 --> 04:13:28,319
and then bumping that up to get to

3631
04:13:28,319 --> 04:13:31,500
Something in the 90 accuracy range

3632
04:13:31,500 --> 04:13:34,199
required a ton of engineering work and a

3633
04:13:34,199 --> 04:13:36,660
lot of specialized domain knowledge

3634
04:13:36,660 --> 04:13:39,060
it was also generally thought that if

3635
04:13:39,060 --> 04:13:41,640
you had a parametric model

3636
04:13:41,640 --> 04:13:44,460
that if you increase the number of

3637
04:13:44,460 --> 04:13:46,380
parameters too much

3638
04:13:46,380 --> 04:13:48,479
you would face these diminishing returns

3639
04:13:48,479 --> 04:13:50,160
and ultimately the model wouldn't work

3640
04:13:50,160 --> 04:13:52,399
anymore

3641
04:13:52,680 --> 04:13:55,199
deep neural networks turn that on its

3642
04:13:55,199 --> 04:13:56,640
head

3643
04:13:56,640 --> 04:14:00,060
it allows you to arbitrarily increase

3644
04:14:00,060 --> 04:14:02,279
model complexity and as you increase

3645
04:14:02,279 --> 04:14:04,560
model complexity you get better

3646
04:14:04,560 --> 04:14:06,479
performance

3647
04:14:06,479 --> 04:14:09,060
so really before 2012

3648
04:14:09,060 --> 04:14:12,840
that was not thought to be the case

3649
04:14:12,840 --> 04:14:15,239
so if you could just make the model more

3650
04:14:15,239 --> 04:14:17,460
complex and you get better performance

3651
04:14:17,460 --> 04:14:20,460
this is where companies like deepmind

3652
04:14:20,460 --> 04:14:23,939
Facebook open AI come in because they

3653
04:14:23,939 --> 04:14:26,040
got a lot of money and they just buy a

3654
04:14:26,040 --> 04:14:28,520
lot of hardware

3655
04:14:30,720 --> 04:14:32,819
so what is the Deep neural network look

3656
04:14:32,819 --> 04:14:35,520
like well you have these layers

3657
04:14:35,520 --> 04:14:37,680
and the idea is

3658
04:14:37,680 --> 04:14:39,060
that

3659
04:14:39,060 --> 04:14:42,600
all of these layers together comprises a

3660
04:14:42,600 --> 04:14:46,399
very complicated function

3661
04:14:46,880 --> 04:14:49,800
the layers are essentially can be

3662
04:14:49,800 --> 04:14:52,739
thought of as a language just to specify

3663
04:14:52,739 --> 04:14:54,840
a function with the number of parameters

3664
04:14:54,840 --> 04:14:57,660
and using a very clever approach called

3665
04:14:57,660 --> 04:15:00,239
back propagation we don't have to worry

3666
04:15:00,239 --> 04:15:02,699
about manually analyzing this function

3667
04:15:02,699 --> 04:15:06,600
in order to train it on data

3668
04:15:06,600 --> 04:15:08,880
so now we've taken something that in the

3669
04:15:08,880 --> 04:15:09,720
past

3670
04:15:09,720 --> 04:15:14,100
has required people like phds to analyze

3671
04:15:14,100 --> 04:15:16,260
the problem very heavily do things like

3672
04:15:16,260 --> 04:15:18,540
see if we can find a derivative of this

3673
04:15:18,540 --> 04:15:20,819
very complicated function for our domain

3674
04:15:20,819 --> 04:15:21,899
problem

3675
04:15:21,899 --> 04:15:23,880
all that goes away

3676
04:15:23,880 --> 04:15:26,040
and it becomes a pure engineering

3677
04:15:26,040 --> 04:15:27,420
problem

3678
04:15:27,420 --> 04:15:30,180
and so this is the main thing that the

3679
04:15:30,180 --> 04:15:31,920
advances with deep learning have brought

3680
04:15:31,920 --> 04:15:34,279
us today

3681
04:15:35,580 --> 04:15:38,160
so what does this imply

3682
04:15:38,160 --> 04:15:41,580
these capabilities can be democratized

3683
04:15:41,580 --> 04:15:43,920
and I think the what I talk about at the

3684
04:15:43,920 --> 04:15:44,939
beginning

3685
04:15:44,939 --> 04:15:47,460
how now Pac-Man playing Agent is

3686
04:15:47,460 --> 04:15:50,640
accessible to students this technology

3687
04:15:50,640 --> 04:15:54,020
is accessible to more and more people

3688
04:15:54,020 --> 04:15:58,020
the corresponding drop in compute costs

3689
04:15:58,020 --> 04:16:00,420
the easy accessibility of cloud

3690
04:16:00,420 --> 04:16:03,840
resources to arbitrarily get a lot of

3691
04:16:03,840 --> 04:16:05,819
computing for a short period of time to

3692
04:16:05,819 --> 04:16:07,439
work on a problem

3693
04:16:07,439 --> 04:16:12,439
all of this has led to just a very rapid

3694
04:16:12,439 --> 04:16:16,699
widespread use of this technology

3695
04:16:18,300 --> 04:16:21,180
a new class of Engineers is required

3696
04:16:21,180 --> 04:16:23,359
here

3697
04:16:23,580 --> 04:16:27,120
now that the scientist Community has

3698
04:16:27,120 --> 04:16:29,100
taken many of these problems and reduced

3699
04:16:29,100 --> 04:16:31,739
it to an engineering challenge we now

3700
04:16:31,739 --> 04:16:34,560
need people in the workforce who

3701
04:16:34,560 --> 04:16:37,140
understand how to create these deep

3702
04:16:37,140 --> 04:16:38,520
neural networks

3703
04:16:38,520 --> 04:16:41,819
understand what type of loss function we

3704
04:16:41,819 --> 04:16:43,800
want to optimize the network in relation

3705
04:16:43,800 --> 04:16:44,699
to

3706
04:16:44,699 --> 04:16:46,979
as well as all the Practical problems

3707
04:16:46,979 --> 04:16:50,479
that ensues in deploying it

3708
04:16:51,479 --> 04:16:53,580
and then the third big piece here that

3709
04:16:53,580 --> 04:16:55,920
I've been touching upon is companies can

3710
04:16:55,920 --> 04:16:58,260
arbitrarily invest in more and more

3711
04:16:58,260 --> 04:16:59,580
Hardware

3712
04:16:59,580 --> 04:17:01,500
in order to create some of the best

3713
04:17:01,500 --> 04:17:03,720
models in the world

3714
04:17:03,720 --> 04:17:07,140
and so we can now throw a lot of money

3715
04:17:07,140 --> 04:17:09,060
at a problem that we really care about

3716
04:17:09,060 --> 04:17:11,460
we as a society

3717
04:17:11,460 --> 04:17:15,180
or we if you're you know or someone as a

3718
04:17:15,180 --> 04:17:17,100
big company wanting to do this they can

3719
04:17:17,100 --> 04:17:19,080
throw a lot of money and create some

3720
04:17:19,080 --> 04:17:22,399
really fantastic Innovations

3721
04:17:23,340 --> 04:17:26,220
so I taught machine learning for the

3722
04:17:26,220 --> 04:17:28,620
first time as a professor way back in

3723
04:17:28,620 --> 04:17:31,020
2013.

3724
04:17:31,020 --> 04:17:32,880
so a couple things this is my website

3725
04:17:32,880 --> 04:17:35,599
from the class

3726
04:17:36,239 --> 04:17:39,899
this was not taught as its own class

3727
04:17:39,899 --> 04:17:41,939
very few people were teaching machine

3728
04:17:41,939 --> 04:17:44,580
learning by itself to undergraduates

3729
04:17:44,580 --> 04:17:46,979
this was undergraduate AI course I

3730
04:17:46,979 --> 04:17:49,199
taught machine learning was one of

3731
04:17:49,199 --> 04:17:51,479
several topics as part of this course

3732
04:17:51,479 --> 04:17:55,020
machine learning is actually a branch of

3733
04:17:55,020 --> 04:17:56,939
AI and deep learning as a type of

3734
04:17:56,939 --> 04:17:59,279
machine learning

3735
04:17:59,279 --> 04:18:01,620
this was initial active

3736
04:18:01,620 --> 04:18:04,319
so basically I gotta pick the AI and

3737
04:18:04,319 --> 04:18:06,180
machine learning topics that I thought

3738
04:18:06,180 --> 04:18:08,460
the students would be interested in and

3739
04:18:08,460 --> 04:18:10,560
we just kind of went with that

3740
04:18:10,560 --> 04:18:12,960
there wasn't a lot of major consequence

3741
04:18:12,960 --> 04:18:16,380
because there wasn't a big industry need

3742
04:18:16,380 --> 04:18:20,300
for specific skill sets

3743
04:18:20,699 --> 04:18:22,859
traditional educational model

3744
04:18:22,859 --> 04:18:25,580
this had a lot of in-class lecture

3745
04:18:25,580 --> 04:18:28,859
projects that were individualized a lot

3746
04:18:28,859 --> 04:18:31,439
of a lot of variation in how the

3747
04:18:31,439 --> 04:18:33,620
students could respond to things

3748
04:18:33,620 --> 04:18:36,720
uh so very traditional educational

3749
04:18:36,720 --> 04:18:39,000
program

3750
04:18:39,000 --> 04:18:41,340
not related to Industry use case because

3751
04:18:41,340 --> 04:18:43,800
there wasn't standardization in Industry

3752
04:18:43,800 --> 04:18:45,540
as how to machine how machine learning

3753
04:18:45,540 --> 04:18:47,899
was used

3754
04:18:50,399 --> 04:18:51,960
and

3755
04:18:51,960 --> 04:18:55,020
uh neural networks they were covered as

3756
04:18:55,020 --> 04:18:56,699
part of a lesson

3757
04:18:56,699 --> 04:18:59,520
at the time in 2013

3758
04:18:59,520 --> 04:19:01,680
the breakthroughs in neural networks had

3759
04:19:01,680 --> 04:19:04,140
just started to happen in the academic

3760
04:19:04,140 --> 04:19:05,520
literature

3761
04:19:05,520 --> 04:19:07,680
and so

3762
04:19:07,680 --> 04:19:10,199
the right way to teach Ai and machine

3763
04:19:10,199 --> 04:19:12,720
learning at the time was deep neural

3764
04:19:12,720 --> 04:19:14,399
networks were just one of several

3765
04:19:14,399 --> 04:19:16,380
approaches to machine learning

3766
04:19:16,380 --> 04:19:18,840
we didn't have at the time a full

3767
04:19:18,840 --> 04:19:21,359
appreciation as to the extent of the

3768
04:19:21,359 --> 04:19:23,160
impact that deep neural networks would

3769
04:19:23,160 --> 04:19:23,880
have

3770
04:19:23,880 --> 04:19:26,399
that would soon change

3771
04:19:26,399 --> 04:19:28,199
and here's the kicker I only had 12

3772
04:19:28,199 --> 04:19:29,819
students

3773
04:19:29,819 --> 04:19:32,279
okay people wanted to do other things

3774
04:19:32,279 --> 04:19:33,899
with people taking full stack

3775
04:19:33,899 --> 04:19:36,720
development electives Android app

3776
04:19:36,720 --> 04:19:38,939
electives and so I had to compete with

3777
04:19:38,939 --> 04:19:40,979
all of those and this wasn't as cool as

3778
04:19:40,979 --> 04:19:43,199
some of those other classes so I only

3779
04:19:43,199 --> 04:19:45,120
had 12 students

3780
04:19:45,120 --> 04:19:46,439
so

3781
04:19:46,439 --> 04:19:49,140
this past year I rolled out a new

3782
04:19:49,140 --> 04:19:50,819
machine learning course we taught in in

3783
04:19:50,819 --> 04:19:52,560
the fall

3784
04:19:52,560 --> 04:19:56,460
and so this is a machine learning class

3785
04:19:56,460 --> 04:19:59,100
not an AI class everything in this class

3786
04:19:59,100 --> 04:20:03,500
was machine learning undergraduate level

3787
04:20:04,500 --> 04:20:08,520
this is a very high demand elective

3788
04:20:08,520 --> 04:20:11,160
hybrid educational model you know

3789
04:20:11,160 --> 04:20:14,760
between just being more modern and also

3790
04:20:14,760 --> 04:20:17,279
adopting things from uh you know Lessons

3791
04:20:17,279 --> 04:20:20,460
Learned From the pandemic we created

3792
04:20:20,460 --> 04:20:24,420
video content for this class and

3793
04:20:24,420 --> 04:20:26,399
students go over the videos ahead of

3794
04:20:26,399 --> 04:20:28,739
time in class is more like a lab

3795
04:20:28,739 --> 04:20:29,880
environment

3796
04:20:29,880 --> 04:20:31,979
and part of the reason I wanted to do

3797
04:20:31,979 --> 04:20:34,680
that was my experience in a machine

3798
04:20:34,680 --> 04:20:37,080
learning startup dealing with the

3799
04:20:37,080 --> 04:20:39,359
engineering problems and deploying these

3800
04:20:39,359 --> 04:20:41,580
models in practice I wanted to get

3801
04:20:41,580 --> 04:20:43,080
students more

3802
04:20:43,080 --> 04:20:45,120
Hands-On time where they could be

3803
04:20:45,120 --> 04:20:47,640
coached by me and the TA and the

3804
04:20:47,640 --> 04:20:50,479
instructional team

3805
04:20:51,540 --> 04:20:54,420
industry standards were adopted across

3806
04:20:54,420 --> 04:20:56,580
the course we have integrated into

3807
04:20:56,580 --> 04:20:58,439
lessons things like machine learning

3808
04:20:58,439 --> 04:21:01,319
operations things like understanding

3809
04:21:01,319 --> 04:21:04,500
data security and privacy is also lesson

3810
04:21:04,500 --> 04:21:06,359
objective in this class

3811
04:21:06,359 --> 04:21:08,699
these are things that traditionally

3812
04:21:08,699 --> 04:21:11,520
would never be talked about in an AI or

3813
04:21:11,520 --> 04:21:13,560
machine learning course

3814
04:21:13,560 --> 04:21:17,279
but the difference is is that nowadays

3815
04:21:17,279 --> 04:21:20,279
you have to consider these practical

3816
04:21:20,279 --> 04:21:23,040
issues because machine learning models

3817
04:21:23,040 --> 04:21:25,380
aren't some fun science thing that is

3818
04:21:25,380 --> 04:21:27,540
done in a vacuum they're part of actual

3819
04:21:27,540 --> 04:21:29,760
systems that people depend on that

3820
04:21:29,760 --> 04:21:31,920
people log in and use and they drive

3821
04:21:31,920 --> 04:21:35,960
business they drive Society

3822
04:21:37,080 --> 04:21:39,840
and as a result we took a strong Focus

3823
04:21:39,840 --> 04:21:42,720
toward operational scenarios in the

3824
04:21:42,720 --> 04:21:44,819
projects and exercises

3825
04:21:44,819 --> 04:21:47,460
and then this is the kicker we had 135

3826
04:21:47,460 --> 04:21:50,100
students last term we bumped it up by 40

3827
04:21:50,100 --> 04:21:52,920
this term it filled out

3828
04:21:52,920 --> 04:21:55,500
pretty much immediately we probably can

3829
04:21:55,500 --> 04:21:57,779
go to several hundred I think and we'll

3830
04:21:57,779 --> 04:22:00,779
still you know be at capacity

3831
04:22:00,779 --> 04:22:02,279
for the course

3832
04:22:02,279 --> 04:22:05,160
and this is not just ASU I have

3833
04:22:05,160 --> 04:22:07,439
colleagues at other universities that

3834
04:22:07,439 --> 04:22:10,680
are seen very similar Trends in terms of

3835
04:22:10,680 --> 04:22:12,899
undergraduate interest in machine

3836
04:22:12,899 --> 04:22:15,180
learning and we know why there's

3837
04:22:15,180 --> 04:22:18,979
companies that need these skill sets

3838
04:22:19,800 --> 04:22:22,260
so as I mentioned with the course you

3839
04:22:22,260 --> 04:22:26,399
know we went with a lot of video content

3840
04:22:26,399 --> 04:22:28,680
um I actually have made many of these

3841
04:22:28,680 --> 04:22:30,420
videos just publicly available on

3842
04:22:30,420 --> 04:22:32,600
YouTube

3843
04:22:35,220 --> 04:22:38,520
and so the other thing about this is

3844
04:22:38,520 --> 04:22:41,220
one of the issues that we covered that

3845
04:22:41,220 --> 04:22:43,920
again was a little bit outside what used

3846
04:22:43,920 --> 04:22:46,020
to be the norm in teaching Ai and

3847
04:22:46,020 --> 04:22:49,620
machine learning was a focus on bias

3848
04:22:49,620 --> 04:22:53,040
fairness and discrimination in machine

3849
04:22:53,040 --> 04:22:55,500
learning

3850
04:22:55,500 --> 04:22:58,920
and part of the reason I added this to

3851
04:22:58,920 --> 04:23:01,080
the course even at the undergraduate

3852
04:23:01,080 --> 04:23:04,380
level is I've noticed that

3853
04:23:04,380 --> 04:23:08,100
as a machine learning professional

3854
04:23:08,100 --> 04:23:10,859
the students have a responsibility to

3855
04:23:10,859 --> 04:23:12,779
society they're the ones who are making

3856
04:23:12,779 --> 04:23:14,819
that algorithm they're the first line of

3857
04:23:14,819 --> 04:23:16,319
defense

3858
04:23:16,319 --> 04:23:20,840
against improper outcomes

3859
04:23:21,420 --> 04:23:24,600
and oftentimes these models they can do

3860
04:23:24,600 --> 04:23:26,279
things that affect people's lives and

3861
04:23:26,279 --> 04:23:29,819
I'll give an example of this in a moment

3862
04:23:29,819 --> 04:23:31,620
so that's why we've included these

3863
04:23:31,620 --> 04:23:33,960
lessons and so we've not only released

3864
04:23:33,960 --> 04:23:35,760
some of the videos from these lessons

3865
04:23:35,760 --> 04:23:38,040
but we've actually released a resource

3866
04:23:38,040 --> 04:23:40,920
page that includes some of the code and

3867
04:23:40,920 --> 04:23:43,080
exercises that if you want to explore on

3868
04:23:43,080 --> 04:23:45,060
your own and this is going to be

3869
04:23:45,060 --> 04:23:47,340
accessible by uh the links will be out

3870
04:23:47,340 --> 04:23:49,260
on Discord as well as the cactuscon

3871
04:23:49,260 --> 04:23:52,220
website

3872
04:23:53,160 --> 04:23:55,040
and this is an additional to other

3873
04:23:55,040 --> 04:23:57,300
practicalities that we introduce in the

3874
04:23:57,300 --> 04:23:59,479
course

3875
04:24:00,239 --> 04:24:03,960
so as an example of fairness this is one

3876
04:24:03,960 --> 04:24:06,899
of the big things that was in the news a

3877
04:24:06,899 --> 04:24:08,399
few years back there's a piece of

3878
04:24:08,399 --> 04:24:10,380
software it was called compass

3879
04:24:10,380 --> 04:24:15,720
and it was to predict the probability of

3880
04:24:15,720 --> 04:24:17,819
an individual who's being sentenced for

3881
04:24:17,819 --> 04:24:20,160
a crime if they would be a repeat

3882
04:24:20,160 --> 04:24:22,380
offender

3883
04:24:22,380 --> 04:24:24,840
and it was found

3884
04:24:24,840 --> 04:24:26,840
that it

3885
04:24:26,840 --> 04:24:28,880
disproportionately gave

3886
04:24:28,880 --> 04:24:30,960
African-Americans significantly higher

3887
04:24:30,960 --> 04:24:32,520
sentences

3888
04:24:32,520 --> 04:24:35,420
and you see in this example we had

3889
04:24:35,420 --> 04:24:38,939
a white male

3890
04:24:38,939 --> 04:24:41,340
two armed robberies one attempted armed

3891
04:24:41,340 --> 04:24:42,840
robbery

3892
04:24:42,840 --> 04:24:45,660
was assessed with a low risk score

3893
04:24:45,660 --> 04:24:48,359
went on to commit Grand Theft

3894
04:24:48,359 --> 04:24:50,040
afterwards

3895
04:24:50,040 --> 04:24:51,960
meanwhile we have an African-American

3896
04:24:51,960 --> 04:24:55,199
female four juvenile misdemeanors no

3897
04:24:55,199 --> 04:24:58,020
subsequent offenses but she was assessed

3898
04:24:58,020 --> 04:25:01,439
as high risk by the model

3899
04:25:01,439 --> 04:25:04,080
now what was discovered is that the

3900
04:25:04,080 --> 04:25:05,880
people who had designed this

3901
04:25:05,880 --> 04:25:08,279
they did not have

3902
04:25:08,279 --> 04:25:10,560
anything in the model that explicitly

3903
04:25:10,560 --> 04:25:14,939
targeted race ethnicity or gender

3904
04:25:14,939 --> 04:25:18,120
however there were other variables that

3905
04:25:18,120 --> 04:25:20,699
turned out to be very close proxies for

3906
04:25:20,699 --> 04:25:23,279
that that were included

3907
04:25:23,279 --> 04:25:24,720
in the model

3908
04:25:24,720 --> 04:25:29,300
and as a result we had results like this

3909
04:25:31,680 --> 04:25:34,380
so why does this happen why is this even

3910
04:25:34,380 --> 04:25:37,140
possible with the machine learning model

3911
04:25:37,140 --> 04:25:40,500
seen that example and understanding you

3912
04:25:40,500 --> 04:25:42,239
know what went wrong with the compass

3913
04:25:42,239 --> 04:25:43,319
software

3914
04:25:43,319 --> 04:25:45,359
we can easily all see that as human

3915
04:25:45,359 --> 04:25:47,880
beings and the people who looked at that

3916
04:25:47,880 --> 04:25:50,279
in the aftermath it was blazingly

3917
04:25:50,279 --> 04:25:52,699
obvious

3918
04:25:53,100 --> 04:25:55,560
and really what it comes down to is

3919
04:25:55,560 --> 04:25:59,159
thinking verse imitating

3920
04:25:59,159 --> 04:26:02,399
what is the model actually doing and

3921
04:26:02,399 --> 04:26:04,020
this is actually a subject of some

3922
04:26:04,020 --> 04:26:06,439
debate

3923
04:26:06,659 --> 04:26:09,300
so let's talk about this a little bit so

3924
04:26:09,300 --> 04:26:11,880
hooray for spreadsheets right

3925
04:26:11,880 --> 04:26:15,300
so here we got Excel spreadsheet of some

3926
04:26:15,300 --> 04:26:17,100
you know kind of cheesy example of

3927
04:26:17,100 --> 04:26:19,500
marketing spend versus sales and we

3928
04:26:19,500 --> 04:26:21,359
contrived this so you get this nice

3929
04:26:21,359 --> 04:26:24,120
linear relationship okay

3930
04:26:24,120 --> 04:26:26,159
so everyone here has probably done this

3931
04:26:26,159 --> 04:26:27,960
at some point in high school for a

3932
04:26:27,960 --> 04:26:29,819
physics problem or whatever

3933
04:26:29,819 --> 04:26:32,100
but you know what this is a very simple

3934
04:26:32,100 --> 04:26:34,739
machine learning model not a deep neural

3935
04:26:34,739 --> 04:26:36,420
network but it's a machine learning

3936
04:26:36,420 --> 04:26:38,600
model

3937
04:26:38,779 --> 04:26:42,060
it fits to historical data

3938
04:26:42,060 --> 04:26:44,699
we can throw out all the historical data

3939
04:26:44,699 --> 04:26:47,100
and we can use that regression equation

3940
04:26:47,100 --> 04:26:49,560
by itself to make predictions

3941
04:26:49,560 --> 04:26:53,040
and this model has two parameters it has

3942
04:26:53,040 --> 04:26:55,560
a slope and the intercept

3943
04:26:55,560 --> 04:26:57,659
has two parameters and we have I don't

3944
04:26:57,659 --> 04:27:01,399
know like 10 or 12 data points there

3945
04:27:01,680 --> 04:27:05,279
now even if we would have a hundred data

3946
04:27:05,279 --> 04:27:06,540
points

3947
04:27:06,540 --> 04:27:08,640
we would still just have two parameters

3948
04:27:08,640 --> 04:27:10,739
for the model

3949
04:27:10,739 --> 04:27:13,920
the other thing is this model is just

3950
04:27:13,920 --> 04:27:16,680
imitating the data it's not giving us

3951
04:27:16,680 --> 04:27:19,140
any deep insight as to how those

3952
04:27:19,140 --> 04:27:21,540
marketing dollars were spent or

3953
04:27:21,540 --> 04:27:24,000
seasonality or anything else like this

3954
04:27:24,000 --> 04:27:26,699
it's just strictly looking at how much

3955
04:27:26,699 --> 04:27:28,920
was spent how much money was brought in

3956
04:27:28,920 --> 04:27:31,880
and so on

3957
04:27:34,020 --> 04:27:37,020
one thing to remember about deep neural

3958
04:27:37,020 --> 04:27:39,659
networks is that just like that linear

3959
04:27:39,659 --> 04:27:41,939
function that's really small and easy to

3960
04:27:41,939 --> 04:27:43,500
read and understand

3961
04:27:43,500 --> 04:27:46,140
a deep neural network is just one big

3962
04:27:46,140 --> 04:27:48,180
giant function one big giant

3963
04:27:48,180 --> 04:27:50,460
mathematical function

3964
04:27:50,460 --> 04:27:53,279
that's all it is it just happens to have

3965
04:27:53,279 --> 04:27:56,540
a lot of parameters

3966
04:27:57,720 --> 04:28:01,859
and so this leads us to a question

3967
04:28:01,859 --> 04:28:05,580
of can a mathematical function actually

3968
04:28:05,580 --> 04:28:06,960
think

3969
04:28:06,960 --> 04:28:08,819
and there's one group of people out

3970
04:28:08,819 --> 04:28:11,340
there that think hey it's just a matter

3971
04:28:11,340 --> 04:28:14,699
of adding more parameters having more

3972
04:28:14,699 --> 04:28:17,640
Hardware at some point just by adding

3973
04:28:17,640 --> 04:28:19,739
more compute this thing will be able to

3974
04:28:19,739 --> 04:28:21,920
think

3975
04:28:22,140 --> 04:28:24,479
there is another Camp of people that

3976
04:28:24,479 --> 04:28:27,120
believe that a mathematical function by

3977
04:28:27,120 --> 04:28:28,500
itself

3978
04:28:28,500 --> 04:28:30,899
will totally be incapable of ever doing

3979
04:28:30,899 --> 04:28:31,859
this

3980
04:28:31,859 --> 04:28:34,319
will never give rise to cognition we're

3981
04:28:34,319 --> 04:28:38,300
missing something we need something more

3982
04:28:39,000 --> 04:28:42,540
now it's this is a huge debate in the

3983
04:28:42,540 --> 04:28:44,399
field of AI

3984
04:28:44,399 --> 04:28:47,040
it's not clear you know which one is

3985
04:28:47,040 --> 04:28:48,739
right but I think at the end of the day

3986
04:28:48,739 --> 04:28:51,120
there's probably going to be some Middle

3987
04:28:51,120 --> 04:28:52,140
Ground

3988
04:28:52,140 --> 04:28:54,720
and we'll talk about some thinking along

3989
04:28:54,720 --> 04:28:56,220
these lines

3990
04:28:56,220 --> 04:28:59,040
but anyway we talk a bit about

3991
04:28:59,040 --> 04:29:02,040
model parameters what about chat GPT how

3992
04:29:02,040 --> 04:29:05,100
many parameters does it have well so I

3993
04:29:05,100 --> 04:29:06,359
thought you know instead of Googling

3994
04:29:06,359 --> 04:29:10,819
I'll just ask it so I asked it

3995
04:29:10,920 --> 04:29:15,180
so there you go 175 million parameters

3996
04:29:15,180 --> 04:29:17,760
so this is this is a good amount

3997
04:29:17,760 --> 04:29:20,699
that's an awful lot there are models

3998
04:29:20,699 --> 04:29:22,260
that are bigger that have you know

3999
04:29:22,260 --> 04:29:25,520
billions of parameters

4000
04:29:26,460 --> 04:29:28,859
but we can still assume that this has

4001
04:29:28,859 --> 04:29:30,659
some level of capability

4002
04:29:30,659 --> 04:29:32,279
so okay

4003
04:29:32,279 --> 04:29:34,380
you know one thing people talk a lot

4004
04:29:34,380 --> 04:29:37,500
about is hey chat GPT isn't that good at

4005
04:29:37,500 --> 04:29:38,699
math

4006
04:29:38,699 --> 04:29:41,760
so let's introduce a word problem we

4007
04:29:41,760 --> 04:29:45,000
have one whole number is three times a

4008
04:29:45,000 --> 04:29:46,380
second number

4009
04:29:46,380 --> 04:29:48,659
if 20 is added to the smaller number the

4010
04:29:48,659 --> 04:29:51,779
result is six more than the larger

4011
04:29:51,779 --> 04:29:55,319
and so there are two equations that can

4012
04:29:55,319 --> 04:29:57,239
be that can express this word problem

4013
04:29:57,239 --> 04:29:58,920
there they are

4014
04:29:58,920 --> 04:30:01,199
if we combine them together you get this

4015
04:30:01,199 --> 04:30:04,560
3x plus 6 equals X plus 20 with X being

4016
04:30:04,560 --> 04:30:06,779
the smaller of the numbers

4017
04:30:06,779 --> 04:30:10,439
simplifying that 2X equals 14. remember

4018
04:30:10,439 --> 04:30:15,540
this equation here 2X equals 14.

4019
04:30:15,540 --> 04:30:18,479
and then the rest is really easy 7 and

4020
04:30:18,479 --> 04:30:20,460
21.

4021
04:30:20,460 --> 04:30:22,319
so let's see what happens when we ask

4022
04:30:22,319 --> 04:30:24,000
chat GPT

4023
04:30:24,000 --> 04:30:26,699
so type in the same thing

4024
04:30:26,699 --> 04:30:30,720
and boom first thing it says is hey here

4025
04:30:30,720 --> 04:30:32,520
are the two equations

4026
04:30:32,520 --> 04:30:35,720
it gets us right

4027
04:30:35,760 --> 04:30:38,100
that's actually quite cool

4028
04:30:38,100 --> 04:30:40,560
okay this is actually a big deal that

4029
04:30:40,560 --> 04:30:43,319
gets this right

4030
04:30:43,319 --> 04:30:45,300
so that's great it's got the two

4031
04:30:45,300 --> 04:30:47,220
equations

4032
04:30:47,220 --> 04:30:49,380
so it says hey we can substitute the

4033
04:30:49,380 --> 04:30:51,239
first for into the second and we get

4034
04:30:51,239 --> 04:30:52,199
this

4035
04:30:52,199 --> 04:30:54,420
can deal with that

4036
04:30:54,420 --> 04:30:58,020
in simplifying we get y equals 14.

4037
04:30:58,020 --> 04:30:59,939
now if you remember

4038
04:30:59,939 --> 04:31:03,840
I said 2y equals 14.

4039
04:31:03,840 --> 04:31:05,640
something went wrong

4040
04:31:05,640 --> 04:31:08,220
I don't know what because they have y

4041
04:31:08,220 --> 04:31:11,220
and 3y in the line above

4042
04:31:11,220 --> 04:31:14,640
you would think 2y would appear next but

4043
04:31:14,640 --> 04:31:16,739
that's not what happens so it makes a

4044
04:31:16,739 --> 04:31:18,180
mistake

4045
04:31:18,180 --> 04:31:19,500
and

4046
04:31:19,500 --> 04:31:22,979
the rest it goes on plugging in you know

4047
04:31:22,979 --> 04:31:26,699
14 for the smaller number and it has 14

4048
04:31:26,699 --> 04:31:28,979
and 42.

4049
04:31:28,979 --> 04:31:32,819
so it has the wrong answer

4050
04:31:32,819 --> 04:31:36,600
so okay well hey if I'm grading this for

4051
04:31:36,600 --> 04:31:39,120
you know a student this is at least

4052
04:31:39,120 --> 04:31:41,580
follows credit made one small mistake

4053
04:31:41,580 --> 04:31:43,500
how often does this happen

4054
04:31:43,500 --> 04:31:47,939
so this is one experiment

4055
04:31:47,939 --> 04:31:50,399
so let's do another experiment so this

4056
04:31:50,399 --> 04:31:54,080
is cactuscon so you know we thought hey

4057
04:31:54,080 --> 04:31:56,880
let's uh let's write a bot there's no

4058
04:31:56,880 --> 04:31:59,580
API available for chat EPT so let's just

4059
04:31:59,580 --> 04:32:03,199
you know barge our way into it

4060
04:32:03,540 --> 04:32:06,060
we take a thousand math word problems

4061
04:32:06,060 --> 04:32:07,739
there's people who study this kind of

4062
04:32:07,739 --> 04:32:10,020
thing in linguistics so we'll take a

4063
04:32:10,020 --> 04:32:12,020
thousand of them

4064
04:32:12,020 --> 04:32:14,520
and you know we'll send them use the

4065
04:32:14,520 --> 04:32:18,000
spot to send them to chatgpt

4066
04:32:18,000 --> 04:32:21,260
and here's what happens

4067
04:32:21,359 --> 04:32:25,140
83 percent of the time is totally wrong

4068
04:32:25,140 --> 04:32:27,000
one percent of the time it says there's

4069
04:32:27,000 --> 04:32:28,800
no possible solution to this and it

4070
04:32:28,800 --> 04:32:30,300
throws its hands up

4071
04:32:30,300 --> 04:32:33,060
and then another three percent of the

4072
04:32:33,060 --> 04:32:35,040
time it gives especially if you have

4073
04:32:35,040 --> 04:32:36,840
like two solutions like we saw in that

4074
04:32:36,840 --> 04:32:38,699
example it may get one of the numbers

4075
04:32:38,699 --> 04:32:41,760
right but not the rest and so that's the

4076
04:32:41,760 --> 04:32:45,000
The partially correct and then 13 of the

4077
04:32:45,000 --> 04:32:47,939
time it gets everything right

4078
04:32:47,939 --> 04:32:50,279
now admittedly this is one of the harder

4079
04:32:50,279 --> 04:32:53,479
uh data sets for math word problems

4080
04:32:53,479 --> 04:32:55,939
however other

4081
04:32:55,939 --> 04:32:58,199
state-of-the-art algorithms designed

4082
04:32:58,199 --> 04:33:00,120
especially for math word problems they

4083
04:33:00,120 --> 04:33:02,939
get around 60 percent accuracy on this

4084
04:33:02,939 --> 04:33:05,099
which is about four times better than

4085
04:33:05,099 --> 04:33:08,458
chat GPT that said chat EPT does a lot

4086
04:33:08,458 --> 04:33:10,740
of other stuff that those algorithms

4087
04:33:10,740 --> 04:33:12,539
don't those algorithms are more

4088
04:33:12,539 --> 04:33:13,980
specialized

4089
04:33:13,980 --> 04:33:17,160
but still this is quite unfortunate

4090
04:33:17,160 --> 04:33:20,340
so we started wondering hey what drives

4091
04:33:20,340 --> 04:33:21,500
these results

4092
04:33:21,500 --> 04:33:23,938
is there something about certain math

4093
04:33:23,938 --> 04:33:25,859
word problems that are harder than

4094
04:33:25,859 --> 04:33:26,759
others

4095
04:33:26,759 --> 04:33:28,980
now what was nice about this data set is

4096
04:33:28,980 --> 04:33:30,840
it gave the associated algebraic

4097
04:33:30,840 --> 04:33:32,699
equations so we could go and count

4098
04:33:32,699 --> 04:33:34,618
things like the number of unknowns or

4099
04:33:34,618 --> 04:33:37,438
number of addition operations

4100
04:33:37,438 --> 04:33:40,020
so we looked at a couple of these items

4101
04:33:40,020 --> 04:33:42,599
and we said hey let's see if something

4102
04:33:42,599 --> 04:33:46,980
is significantly makes chat GPT fail a

4103
04:33:46,980 --> 04:33:50,458
significant uh probability higher than

4104
04:33:50,458 --> 04:33:52,561
the Baseline so the Baseline was 84

4105
04:33:52,561 --> 04:33:55,141
percent because we had 83 total wrong

4106
04:33:55,141 --> 04:33:57,840
another one percent says no solution and

4107
04:33:57,840 --> 04:33:59,879
so if our error bars put something above

4108
04:33:59,879 --> 04:34:00,660
that

4109
04:34:00,660 --> 04:34:03,599
you know this is a factor that might be

4110
04:34:03,599 --> 04:34:06,118
leading to failure Beyond normal

4111
04:34:06,118 --> 04:34:07,859
and then we took a step further and we

4112
04:34:07,859 --> 04:34:09,660
said hey of any of these factors is

4113
04:34:09,660 --> 04:34:11,580
there one that might have a causal

4114
04:34:11,580 --> 04:34:13,020
relationship

4115
04:34:13,020 --> 04:34:15,000
and in our analysis the only one that

4116
04:34:15,000 --> 04:34:16,919
did was the total number of additions

4117
04:34:16,919 --> 04:34:19,020
and subtractions which from algebraic

4118
04:34:19,020 --> 04:34:21,299
standpoint are the same thing

4119
04:34:21,299 --> 04:34:23,160
and there was a clear linear

4120
04:34:23,160 --> 04:34:25,799
relationship between the probability of

4121
04:34:25,799 --> 04:34:27,061
failure and the number of these

4122
04:34:27,061 --> 04:34:28,919
operations

4123
04:34:28,919 --> 04:34:31,919
now why why that

4124
04:34:31,919 --> 04:34:34,919
why not number of unknowns

4125
04:34:34,919 --> 04:34:37,938
well one way to think about this is

4126
04:34:37,938 --> 04:34:39,900
additions and subtractions that's

4127
04:34:39,900 --> 04:34:41,759
usually when you're taking another step

4128
04:34:41,759 --> 04:34:43,919
of inference

4129
04:34:43,919 --> 04:34:47,099
and so the more steps of inference that

4130
04:34:47,099 --> 04:34:49,680
you're required to take

4131
04:34:49,680 --> 04:34:52,080
the tougher it is for chat GPT because

4132
04:34:52,080 --> 04:34:54,599
it's not designed for inference steps it

4133
04:34:54,599 --> 04:34:58,820
is imitating it's not thinking

4134
04:34:59,879 --> 04:35:04,400
so how can we make such systems think

4135
04:35:05,160 --> 04:35:08,099
so one idea is can we Infuse domain

4136
04:35:08,099 --> 04:35:09,719
knowledge

4137
04:35:09,719 --> 04:35:12,799
so for example

4138
04:35:12,980 --> 04:35:16,141
models like chat GPT they're learning

4139
04:35:16,141 --> 04:35:19,561
from a corpus of historical data lots

4140
04:35:19,561 --> 04:35:21,778
and lots of training examples go in in

4141
04:35:21,778 --> 04:35:23,400
the training process and it learns

4142
04:35:23,400 --> 04:35:24,840
something

4143
04:35:24,840 --> 04:35:27,000
now if me and you go and sit down and

4144
04:35:27,000 --> 04:35:28,740
play a board game

4145
04:35:28,740 --> 04:35:30,840
you're not going to

4146
04:35:30,840 --> 04:35:33,180
we're not going to randomly put pieces

4147
04:35:33,180 --> 04:35:35,539
on the board and see what happens

4148
04:35:35,539 --> 04:35:38,278
thousands and thousands of times we're

4149
04:35:38,278 --> 04:35:41,240
going to first read the instructions

4150
04:35:41,240 --> 04:35:45,061
so infusing domain knowledge is

4151
04:35:45,061 --> 04:35:48,180
analogous to that can we give a machine

4152
04:35:48,180 --> 04:35:50,278
learning model extra instructions and

4153
04:35:50,278 --> 04:35:54,378
say hey this is what needs to go on

4154
04:35:55,020 --> 04:35:56,938
can it draw conclusions from that

4155
04:35:56,938 --> 04:35:58,680
knowledge

4156
04:35:58,680 --> 04:36:01,379
so if we use that knowledge to say hey

4157
04:36:01,379 --> 04:36:03,719
don't do a certain thing

4158
04:36:03,719 --> 04:36:06,799
will it follow that

4159
04:36:07,141 --> 04:36:10,320
and can we learn relationships between

4160
04:36:10,320 --> 04:36:12,359
pieces of knowledge

4161
04:36:12,359 --> 04:36:15,061
so one thing about I showed you with the

4162
04:36:15,061 --> 04:36:16,379
regression model

4163
04:36:16,379 --> 04:36:18,660
is we only had

4164
04:36:18,660 --> 04:36:21,299
two variables we had the input and the

4165
04:36:21,299 --> 04:36:22,680
output and we could relate them with

4166
04:36:22,680 --> 04:36:24,900
that line everyone in this room can

4167
04:36:24,900 --> 04:36:26,340
understand the relationship between

4168
04:36:26,340 --> 04:36:28,320
those two variables

4169
04:36:28,320 --> 04:36:31,020
unfortunately

4170
04:36:31,020 --> 04:36:34,379
I give you a unlike this two parameter

4171
04:36:34,379 --> 04:36:36,299
linear model that you can look at and

4172
04:36:36,299 --> 04:36:38,820
know what's going on right away I can't

4173
04:36:38,820 --> 04:36:43,080
give you a 125 million parameter

4174
04:36:43,080 --> 04:36:45,539
neural model and you're going to make

4175
04:36:45,539 --> 04:36:48,359
any sense of that

4176
04:36:48,359 --> 04:36:50,879
and so can we have the model identify

4177
04:36:50,879 --> 04:36:52,438
these relationships and tell us what

4178
04:36:52,438 --> 04:36:54,539
they are

4179
04:36:54,539 --> 04:36:58,100
so let's go back to Pac-Man

4180
04:36:58,500 --> 04:37:01,020
so can we tell Pac-Man just not to make

4181
04:37:01,020 --> 04:37:02,820
dumb moves

4182
04:37:02,820 --> 04:37:05,400
can we say hey if there is a dead end

4183
04:37:05,400 --> 04:37:07,141
around that corner and there's a ghost

4184
04:37:07,141 --> 04:37:10,641
there just don't go there

4185
04:37:11,699 --> 04:37:14,458
and so the idea of doing this is called

4186
04:37:14,458 --> 04:37:17,419
logical shielding can we express

4187
04:37:17,419 --> 04:37:20,099
additional rules using logical

4188
04:37:20,099 --> 04:37:22,379
statements and just feed that to the

4189
04:37:22,379 --> 04:37:24,000
machine learning model and say hey don't

4190
04:37:24,000 --> 04:37:25,080
do this

4191
04:37:25,080 --> 04:37:27,958
and so if the machine learning model

4192
04:37:27,958 --> 04:37:30,958
is truly imitating and not thinking if

4193
04:37:30,958 --> 04:37:32,699
we feed it this domain knowledge it

4194
04:37:32,699 --> 04:37:34,020
should do better

4195
04:37:34,020 --> 04:37:37,379
and so this was actually the students

4196
04:37:37,379 --> 04:37:39,180
who implemented the Pac-Man playing

4197
04:37:39,180 --> 04:37:40,980
Agent they did this

4198
04:37:40,980 --> 04:37:44,400
so let's look at some of their results

4199
04:37:44,400 --> 04:37:48,359
so Q learning is a style of deep

4200
04:37:48,359 --> 04:37:50,458
learning that's been applied to a lot of

4201
04:37:50,458 --> 04:37:52,799
these video games they tried two

4202
04:37:52,799 --> 04:37:54,900
variants a base Q learning and this

4203
04:37:54,900 --> 04:37:56,580
approximate version that does a little

4204
04:37:56,580 --> 04:38:00,240
better reward is just based on the

4205
04:38:00,240 --> 04:38:03,599
number of points Pac-Man scores as well

4206
04:38:03,599 --> 04:38:06,480
as some other factors associated with

4207
04:38:06,480 --> 04:38:07,799
gameplay

4208
04:38:07,799 --> 04:38:10,500
but they found that in general

4209
04:38:10,500 --> 04:38:12,719
adding those logical constraints just

4210
04:38:12,719 --> 04:38:15,000
some simple rules telling Pac-Man not to

4211
04:38:15,000 --> 04:38:17,699
do something dumb

4212
04:38:17,699 --> 04:38:20,099
significantly improved over the Baseline

4213
04:38:20,099 --> 04:38:22,561
approach and this is example of a medium

4214
04:38:22,561 --> 04:38:25,320
difficult board here is one that is a

4215
04:38:25,320 --> 04:38:28,259
one of the more tricky boards

4216
04:38:28,259 --> 04:38:30,118
and they reviewed several different

4217
04:38:30,118 --> 04:38:32,400
boards they found in general

4218
04:38:32,400 --> 04:38:34,919
adding The Logical constraints was more

4219
04:38:34,919 --> 04:38:39,480
impactful as the board became tougher

4220
04:38:39,480 --> 04:38:41,879
and that makes sense because

4221
04:38:41,879 --> 04:38:44,219
when the board becomes tougher there's

4222
04:38:44,219 --> 04:38:47,099
more ghosts so there's more ways Pac-Man

4223
04:38:47,099 --> 04:38:50,000
can get into trouble

4224
04:38:50,641 --> 04:38:52,199
and so

4225
04:38:52,199 --> 04:38:55,141
adding knowledge to a system

4226
04:38:55,141 --> 04:38:57,539
could look something like this logical

4227
04:38:57,539 --> 04:39:00,240
statements where there is a you know

4228
04:39:00,240 --> 04:39:03,240
very clear relationship with something

4229
04:39:03,240 --> 04:39:06,840
expressible in natural language

4230
04:39:06,840 --> 04:39:09,359
we have recently released a software

4231
04:39:09,359 --> 04:39:11,340
package called Pi reason

4232
04:39:11,340 --> 04:39:14,219
that is about allowing this to be

4233
04:39:14,219 --> 04:39:16,799
expressed and so we have Alpha code

4234
04:39:16,799 --> 04:39:18,958
available already on GitHub and I think

4235
04:39:18,958 --> 04:39:22,320
that will be included on the um

4236
04:39:22,320 --> 04:39:24,000
on the website

4237
04:39:24,000 --> 04:39:26,520
as well

4238
04:39:26,520 --> 04:39:29,520
now can the next question is can we take

4239
04:39:29,520 --> 04:39:33,061
these uh this framework of Pi reason

4240
04:39:33,061 --> 04:39:35,458
and can we use it not only to set

4241
04:39:35,458 --> 04:39:38,340
constraints on a model or Reason about

4242
04:39:38,340 --> 04:39:41,340
knowledge but can we actually extend it

4243
04:39:41,340 --> 04:39:44,878
to learn stuff from data

4244
04:39:44,878 --> 04:39:48,718
now the trick here is

4245
04:39:48,718 --> 04:39:51,060
oh and here's uh the GitHub link if

4246
04:39:51,060 --> 04:39:52,920
you're interested

4247
04:39:52,920 --> 04:39:56,160
and also uh your python user you could

4248
04:39:56,160 --> 04:39:59,840
just do pip install pyrese

4249
04:40:00,120 --> 04:40:02,100
but we're also are working on an

4250
04:40:02,100 --> 04:40:04,560
extension we call Pi reason learn

4251
04:40:04,560 --> 04:40:07,080
and here we have

4252
04:40:07,080 --> 04:40:09,900
shown mathematically that for a given

4253
04:40:09,900 --> 04:40:11,940
logical structure we can have an

4254
04:40:11,940 --> 04:40:13,860
equivalent neural structure

4255
04:40:13,860 --> 04:40:15,900
and this kind of gets back to the idea

4256
04:40:15,900 --> 04:40:17,580
of these two camps

4257
04:40:17,580 --> 04:40:19,798
maybe if we can show there's an

4258
04:40:19,798 --> 04:40:22,260
equivalence between the two sides

4259
04:40:22,260 --> 04:40:25,920
we can then learn things from data that

4260
04:40:25,920 --> 04:40:28,080
can be expressed as knowledge and not

4261
04:40:28,080 --> 04:40:30,060
just a giant function

4262
04:40:30,060 --> 04:40:32,160
and so how well does this work well our

4263
04:40:32,160 --> 04:40:34,680
first experiment with this was to look

4264
04:40:34,680 --> 04:40:37,080
at English language sentences and

4265
04:40:37,080 --> 04:40:39,180
fragments of sentences and see if it

4266
04:40:39,180 --> 04:40:40,560
could identify the difference between

4267
04:40:40,560 --> 04:40:42,540
the two

4268
04:40:42,540 --> 04:40:45,060
and so what we saw here unfortunately

4269
04:40:45,060 --> 04:40:46,680
the bars on this slide didn't come out

4270
04:40:46,680 --> 04:40:48,540
but you see the percentages

4271
04:40:48,540 --> 04:40:50,540
we call this kind of solution a

4272
04:40:50,540 --> 04:40:52,440
neurosymbolic solution because it

4273
04:40:52,440 --> 04:40:56,280
combines neural with symbolic logic and

4274
04:40:56,280 --> 04:40:58,378
we were able to obtain performance on

4275
04:40:58,378 --> 04:41:01,560
par with state-of-the-art purely neural

4276
04:41:01,560 --> 04:41:02,640
models

4277
04:41:02,640 --> 04:41:05,218
but the difference being is that now we

4278
04:41:05,218 --> 04:41:07,620
are able to explain the results

4279
04:41:07,620 --> 04:41:09,900
so this is just a very small first step

4280
04:41:09,900 --> 04:41:12,718
toward what we think you know is going

4281
04:41:12,718 --> 04:41:15,360
to be a big topic going forward can we

4282
04:41:15,360 --> 04:41:17,638
have models that not only can do

4283
04:41:17,638 --> 04:41:20,700
incredible things like chat GPT but can

4284
04:41:20,700 --> 04:41:23,458
actually go beyond imitating and start

4285
04:41:23,458 --> 04:41:25,877
thinking

4286
04:41:25,980 --> 04:41:29,580
so I'd be remiss if I didn't uh thank a

4287
04:41:29,580 --> 04:41:31,860
lot of people who put in work on some of

4288
04:41:31,860 --> 04:41:33,320
these projects that I talked about

4289
04:41:33,320 --> 04:41:37,138
including uh the Pac-Man experiments the

4290
04:41:37,138 --> 04:41:39,718
experiments with chat GPT as well as the

4291
04:41:39,718 --> 04:41:41,480
development of pyrizing some really

4292
04:41:41,480 --> 04:41:46,280
bright and talented students here at ASU

4293
04:41:46,320 --> 04:41:49,680
and also like I said we've posted a lot

4294
04:41:49,680 --> 04:41:52,080
of the videos from the class that I was

4295
04:41:52,080 --> 04:41:54,060
teaching as well as some other topics

4296
04:41:54,060 --> 04:41:56,580
relating to neurosembolic AI on our

4297
04:41:56,580 --> 04:41:57,958
YouTube channel so you can check that

4298
04:41:57,958 --> 04:42:00,420
out if you're interested

4299
04:42:00,420 --> 04:42:02,638
and that's about it do we have time for

4300
04:42:02,638 --> 04:42:04,820
questions

4301
04:42:06,240 --> 04:42:08,218
yeah and so that's so if there's any

4302
04:42:08,218 --> 04:42:11,420
questions happy to take them

4303
04:42:17,218 --> 04:42:19,638
no

4304
04:42:34,320 --> 04:42:36,958
yeah exactly

4305
04:42:36,958 --> 04:42:38,400
uh

4306
04:42:38,400 --> 04:42:40,740
in the relatively near future computers

4307
04:42:40,740 --> 04:42:42,180
are going to start saying things like

4308
04:42:42,180 --> 04:42:46,020
don't turn me off you'd be killing me

4309
04:42:46,020 --> 04:42:48,240
how long will it be between when people

4310
04:42:48,240 --> 04:42:50,160
start when a small portion of society

4311
04:42:50,160 --> 04:42:51,540
starts to believe them that they're

4312
04:42:51,540 --> 04:42:53,700
saying that and a large portion of

4313
04:42:53,700 --> 04:42:55,200
society starts to believe them when they

4314
04:42:55,200 --> 04:42:56,280
say that

4315
04:42:56,280 --> 04:42:58,260
I think that's an excellent question we

4316
04:42:58,260 --> 04:43:00,420
did see some Rumblings of that with that

4317
04:43:00,420 --> 04:43:03,840
engineer from Google who uh you know was

4318
04:43:03,840 --> 04:43:05,958
convinced that the chat bot was sentient

4319
04:43:05,958 --> 04:43:09,718
that he was talking to and I think for

4320
04:43:09,718 --> 04:43:11,760
this type of thing this is probably what

4321
04:43:11,760 --> 04:43:12,780
we're going to see we're going to see

4322
04:43:12,780 --> 04:43:16,138
trickles of where people are convinced

4323
04:43:16,138 --> 04:43:18,120
that what's on the other end is sentient

4324
04:43:18,120 --> 04:43:22,020
and there have been studies that you

4325
04:43:22,020 --> 04:43:25,560
know where psychologists have looked at

4326
04:43:25,560 --> 04:43:28,200
people interacting with robots and

4327
04:43:28,200 --> 04:43:30,420
saying that you know hey kick the robot

4328
04:43:30,420 --> 04:43:32,160
and people refusing to do so because

4329
04:43:32,160 --> 04:43:34,798
they've established a relationship with

4330
04:43:34,798 --> 04:43:35,760
that thing

4331
04:43:35,760 --> 04:43:39,298
and I think that over time uh we're

4332
04:43:39,298 --> 04:43:42,540
probably going to see humans start to

4333
04:43:42,540 --> 04:43:45,120
establish relationship with these I

4334
04:43:45,120 --> 04:43:47,218
think it's going to be I think it's

4335
04:43:47,218 --> 04:43:49,680
going to happen in the commercial space

4336
04:43:49,680 --> 04:43:51,920
or in the consumer space rather

4337
04:43:51,920 --> 04:43:55,440
probably fairly soon

4338
04:43:55,440 --> 04:43:56,218
um

4339
04:43:56,218 --> 04:43:59,218
now that said the trustworthiness of

4340
04:43:59,218 --> 04:44:01,020
what's on the other end I think is going

4341
04:44:01,020 --> 04:44:03,120
to be something that we're all going to

4342
04:44:03,120 --> 04:44:06,298
have to sort of attack and understand

4343
04:44:06,298 --> 04:44:09,000
how to deal with both at a technical

4344
04:44:09,000 --> 04:44:11,520
aspect as well as an educational one

4345
04:44:11,520 --> 04:44:14,100
much the same way that we have to

4346
04:44:14,100 --> 04:44:16,200
educate people you know not to click on

4347
04:44:16,200 --> 04:44:18,600
you know that that attachment and that

4348
04:44:18,600 --> 04:44:21,600
email that you've you've never seen

4349
04:44:21,600 --> 04:44:23,218
um we're going to have to have same best

4350
04:44:23,218 --> 04:44:24,780
practices for dealing with these because

4351
04:44:24,780 --> 04:44:26,218
I think you're going to have very

4352
04:44:26,218 --> 04:44:29,040
charismatic Bots and I think they're

4353
04:44:29,040 --> 04:44:31,620
going to happen pretty quickly in the

4354
04:44:31,620 --> 04:44:33,120
next I think I would say in the next

4355
04:44:33,120 --> 04:44:34,920
three to five years we're going to see

4356
04:44:34,920 --> 04:44:36,420
more and more people establish

4357
04:44:36,420 --> 04:44:39,679
relationship with these things

4358
04:44:41,218 --> 04:44:43,218
um

4359
04:44:48,138 --> 04:44:50,820
uh did you try I've noticed that when

4360
04:44:50,820 --> 04:44:52,260
you phrase things slightly differently

4361
04:44:52,260 --> 04:44:54,120
with Chad gbt you can get widely varying

4362
04:44:54,120 --> 04:44:55,798
results did you try getting it to like

4363
04:44:55,798 --> 04:44:59,340
check its answers or solve uh without

4364
04:44:59,340 --> 04:45:01,980
using like multiplications like instead

4365
04:45:01,980 --> 04:45:05,040
of 3x X Plus X Plus X see if it did

4366
04:45:05,040 --> 04:45:06,600
anything different so that's actually

4367
04:45:06,600 --> 04:45:08,700
where this kind of research is going to

4368
04:45:08,700 --> 04:45:09,660
go

4369
04:45:09,660 --> 04:45:12,420
um and so I think

4370
04:45:12,420 --> 04:45:15,180
you know there are already people who

4371
04:45:15,180 --> 04:45:17,218
are doing research on what's called

4372
04:45:17,218 --> 04:45:20,520
prompt generation so can I take the

4373
04:45:20,520 --> 04:45:23,040
input from the keyboard and break it

4374
04:45:23,040 --> 04:45:26,040
down into problems that the machine can

4375
04:45:26,040 --> 04:45:27,840
actually handle because

4376
04:45:27,840 --> 04:45:30,180
clearly if

4377
04:45:30,180 --> 04:45:32,520
you know we broke down that problem a

4378
04:45:32,520 --> 04:45:35,458
bit more I think chat GPT could have got

4379
04:45:35,458 --> 04:45:37,260
exactly right on all the individual

4380
04:45:37,260 --> 04:45:39,780
steps I would I would venture to guess

4381
04:45:39,780 --> 04:45:42,180
if we gave it the after those two

4382
04:45:42,180 --> 04:45:44,040
equations were combined we gave it that

4383
04:45:44,040 --> 04:45:46,560
combined single equation and we asked it

4384
04:45:46,560 --> 04:45:48,298
to solve for x I don't think it would

4385
04:45:48,298 --> 04:45:50,340
have said x equals 14.

4386
04:45:50,340 --> 04:45:52,378
something's going on

4387
04:45:52,378 --> 04:45:54,840
in that neural structure that you can't

4388
04:45:54,840 --> 04:45:58,080
diagnose where it's sort of rushing

4389
04:45:58,080 --> 04:45:59,638
through the problem or it's trying to

4390
04:45:59,638 --> 04:46:01,560
mimic something which is I think what's

4391
04:46:01,560 --> 04:46:05,060
leading to these incorrect answers

4392
04:46:07,860 --> 04:46:11,458
yeah a good talk on the Chad gbt and AI

4393
04:46:11,458 --> 04:46:14,400
machine learning my question revolves

4394
04:46:14,400 --> 04:46:17,458
around governance with this type of tool

4395
04:46:17,458 --> 04:46:20,520
obviously it's very powerful how do we

4396
04:46:20,520 --> 04:46:23,160
govern or how do we apply

4397
04:46:23,160 --> 04:46:25,138
ethical

4398
04:46:25,138 --> 04:46:28,320
learning behind it to where

4399
04:46:28,320 --> 04:46:31,200
students don't use it for unethical

4400
04:46:31,200 --> 04:46:33,500
reasons you know generating papers

4401
04:46:33,500 --> 04:46:35,820
answering tests and so that sort of

4402
04:46:35,820 --> 04:46:38,540
thing do you foresee some some kind of

4403
04:46:38,540 --> 04:46:42,060
governmental or some kind of governance

4404
04:46:42,060 --> 04:46:44,700
being applied to AI in future as it

4405
04:46:44,700 --> 04:46:46,798
advances so that these things don't

4406
04:46:46,798 --> 04:46:49,620
occur I think absolutely

4407
04:46:49,620 --> 04:46:52,740
um I think it's a very hard problem in

4408
04:46:52,740 --> 04:46:54,360
multiple ways

4409
04:46:54,360 --> 04:46:57,360
there's going to have to be a big policy

4410
04:46:57,360 --> 04:46:59,638
push that you alluded to and we've seen

4411
04:46:59,638 --> 04:47:01,860
a similar thing over the years occur

4412
04:47:01,860 --> 04:47:03,958
with cyber security and I think you're

4413
04:47:03,958 --> 04:47:05,340
going to have to see something analogous

4414
04:47:05,340 --> 04:47:06,480
to that

4415
04:47:06,480 --> 04:47:09,600
unlike cyber security though I think

4416
04:47:09,600 --> 04:47:12,718
there's also going to be changes in how

4417
04:47:12,718 --> 04:47:14,180
we do things

4418
04:47:14,180 --> 04:47:17,040
and so there's already English teachers

4419
04:47:17,040 --> 04:47:20,040
starting to talk about how can we use

4420
04:47:20,040 --> 04:47:23,580
chat GPT in the right way how can we use

4421
04:47:23,580 --> 04:47:26,120
it to generate initial drafts of things

4422
04:47:26,120 --> 04:47:29,280
that don't sound that great but then we

4423
04:47:29,280 --> 04:47:30,540
refine it

4424
04:47:30,540 --> 04:47:32,940
and make it into something good this is

4425
04:47:32,940 --> 04:47:35,580
something that never before I think an

4426
04:47:35,580 --> 04:47:36,958
English teacher could have considered

4427
04:47:36,958 --> 04:47:39,060
because the technology wasn't available

4428
04:47:39,060 --> 04:47:41,760
and then I say the third piece if you go

4429
04:47:41,760 --> 04:47:43,620
back to what those students did with

4430
04:47:43,620 --> 04:47:45,298
Pac-Man

4431
04:47:45,298 --> 04:47:49,500
being able to enforce constraints to

4432
04:47:49,500 --> 04:47:52,500
eliminate certain behaviors of the model

4433
04:47:52,500 --> 04:47:54,958
is also going to be I think very

4434
04:47:54,958 --> 04:47:57,120
important going forward in fact open AI

4435
04:47:57,120 --> 04:47:59,580
has already started with a little bit of

4436
04:47:59,580 --> 04:48:01,920
these ideas in restricting certain

4437
04:48:01,920 --> 04:48:03,840
things that chat's EPT will refuse to

4438
04:48:03,840 --> 04:48:06,500
give answers about

4439
04:48:06,600 --> 04:48:09,180
yeah Whoever has the box next go ahead I

4440
04:48:09,180 --> 04:48:12,360
have the box uh so uh have you thought

4441
04:48:12,360 --> 04:48:14,218
maybe it's actually better at mimicking

4442
04:48:14,218 --> 04:48:15,780
human thought than we think because

4443
04:48:15,780 --> 04:48:17,700
realistically that's how human brains

4444
04:48:17,700 --> 04:48:19,620
work too right they they take heuristic

4445
04:48:19,620 --> 04:48:21,958
jumps they don't want to think through

4446
04:48:21,958 --> 04:48:23,638
the actual logic of the problems and

4447
04:48:23,638 --> 04:48:25,080
then they just infer what the answer is

4448
04:48:25,080 --> 04:48:27,600
I'm mostly joking but if if there was a

4449
04:48:27,600 --> 04:48:30,958
way to uh build that into say the prompt

4450
04:48:30,958 --> 04:48:32,520
or the answer to say I made an

4451
04:48:32,520 --> 04:48:35,878
inferential link or jump here I made a

4452
04:48:35,878 --> 04:48:37,200
referential link that maybe doesn't

4453
04:48:37,200 --> 04:48:39,480
necessarily exist or I made a heuristic

4454
04:48:39,480 --> 04:48:42,480
jump uh would that help to sort of solve

4455
04:48:42,480 --> 04:48:44,280
the problem and say I didn't logically

4456
04:48:44,280 --> 04:48:46,500
solve this I made a heuristics jump here

4457
04:48:46,500 --> 04:48:49,500
I I think so I think that's going to be

4458
04:48:49,500 --> 04:48:53,160
part of it there's also some debate in

4459
04:48:53,160 --> 04:48:56,160
in the field about

4460
04:48:56,160 --> 04:49:00,718
is chat GPT in these large these large

4461
04:49:00,718 --> 04:49:03,660
language models in general do they have

4462
04:49:03,660 --> 04:49:06,180
the right architecture to actually get

4463
04:49:06,180 --> 04:49:08,940
you there and there is a whole different

4464
04:49:08,940 --> 04:49:11,700
line of work dealing with cognitive

4465
04:49:11,700 --> 04:49:15,000
models things like akdar and soar if

4466
04:49:15,000 --> 04:49:17,940
you're familiar with those that are more

4467
04:49:17,940 --> 04:49:21,480
designed to mimic human cognition

4468
04:49:21,480 --> 04:49:24,600
but these other models they have not

4469
04:49:24,600 --> 04:49:27,718
been modernized like deep learning has

4470
04:49:27,718 --> 04:49:30,718
where you can arbitrarily add complexity

4471
04:49:30,718 --> 04:49:33,298
to improve results so there's some

4472
04:49:33,298 --> 04:49:34,980
people who think that if you can do that

4473
04:49:34,980 --> 04:49:37,320
with those cognitive models that that

4474
04:49:37,320 --> 04:49:40,200
will more accurately mimic a human where

4475
04:49:40,200 --> 04:49:43,020
these artificial neural networks

4476
04:49:43,020 --> 04:49:45,000
um they're still they're not really

4477
04:49:45,000 --> 04:49:47,760
designed in a way that mimics you know

4478
04:49:47,760 --> 04:49:51,019
how our brain functions

4479
04:49:54,420 --> 04:49:56,180
oops test

4480
04:49:56,180 --> 04:50:00,298
so right now chat gbt or open AI is

4481
04:50:00,298 --> 04:50:02,520
doing research into watermarking the

4482
04:50:02,520 --> 04:50:04,260
outputs

4483
04:50:04,260 --> 04:50:06,600
uh based on the distribution of words

4484
04:50:06,600 --> 04:50:08,280
and

4485
04:50:08,280 --> 04:50:10,378
how viable do you think efforts are

4486
04:50:10,378 --> 04:50:14,040
going to be in um in detection of AI

4487
04:50:14,040 --> 04:50:17,700
generated output versus human output and

4488
04:50:17,700 --> 04:50:21,718
if it's uh and I guess the second part

4489
04:50:21,718 --> 04:50:23,780
to that is how does that affect

4490
04:50:23,780 --> 04:50:26,280
verification systems that we have on the

4491
04:50:26,280 --> 04:50:28,680
internet like verifying that you're a

4492
04:50:28,680 --> 04:50:31,320
human and this is a big issue on systems

4493
04:50:31,320 --> 04:50:35,280
like Twitter and also in captcha so how

4494
04:50:35,280 --> 04:50:36,718
viable do you think these efforts are

4495
04:50:36,718 --> 04:50:39,180
and what will be the ramifications so I

4496
04:50:39,180 --> 04:50:40,980
think this is like anything else in in

4497
04:50:40,980 --> 04:50:44,100
cyber security where there's going to be

4498
04:50:44,100 --> 04:50:47,100
always a cat and mouse game and who

4499
04:50:47,100 --> 04:50:48,958
comes out on top

4500
04:50:48,958 --> 04:50:51,718
in that particular game is going to

4501
04:50:51,718 --> 04:50:54,958
depend on the amount of expenditure that

4502
04:50:54,958 --> 04:50:56,400
they're willing to endure

4503
04:50:56,400 --> 04:50:59,218
so one of the reasons I believe that

4504
04:50:59,218 --> 04:51:02,520
Bots persist in social media is there

4505
04:51:02,520 --> 04:51:05,100
are somewhat perverse incentives for

4506
04:51:05,100 --> 04:51:07,378
social media companies to reduce the

4507
04:51:07,378 --> 04:51:09,540
number of accounts on their platform

4508
04:51:09,540 --> 04:51:12,298
because that gets reflected in their

4509
04:51:12,298 --> 04:51:14,760
quarterly statements right

4510
04:51:14,760 --> 04:51:18,180
so they're going to always be some

4511
04:51:18,180 --> 04:51:20,580
reservations about them being very

4512
04:51:20,580 --> 04:51:22,200
aggressive and going after that and

4513
04:51:22,200 --> 04:51:23,700
there's also of course other things like

4514
04:51:23,700 --> 04:51:25,620
compute costs that figure into this as

4515
04:51:25,620 --> 04:51:26,760
well

4516
04:51:26,760 --> 04:51:28,980
that said

4517
04:51:28,980 --> 04:51:32,520
um there is a lot of work that has shown

4518
04:51:32,520 --> 04:51:34,920
that for things like deep fakes and

4519
04:51:34,920 --> 04:51:37,680
automatically generated artifacts that

4520
04:51:37,680 --> 04:51:39,958
at least with today's variants of that

4521
04:51:39,958 --> 04:51:41,820
that's still possible

4522
04:51:41,820 --> 04:51:44,100
um to uncover you know what's generated

4523
04:51:44,100 --> 04:51:45,900
and what's not

4524
04:51:45,900 --> 04:51:49,320
um it's probably you know where how good

4525
04:51:49,320 --> 04:51:51,900
that gets will get is probably going to

4526
04:51:51,900 --> 04:51:55,378
have a lot to do with the resolution at

4527
04:51:55,378 --> 04:51:57,420
to which artificial stuff can be

4528
04:51:57,420 --> 04:52:00,060
generated at and how much compute would

4529
04:52:00,060 --> 04:52:01,860
need to go into that so think about

4530
04:52:01,860 --> 04:52:03,540
things like

4531
04:52:03,540 --> 04:52:05,160
um you know in a photorealistic picture

4532
04:52:05,160 --> 04:52:09,240
getting certain aspects of my you know

4533
04:52:09,240 --> 04:52:12,060
the lines on my hand exactly right

4534
04:52:12,060 --> 04:52:14,700
you know maybe if you look at a picture

4535
04:52:14,700 --> 04:52:18,000
that's you know at you know uh 640 by

4536
04:52:18,000 --> 04:52:20,340
480 you're not going to see the

4537
04:52:20,340 --> 04:52:22,378
difference but if you zoom in you could

4538
04:52:22,378 --> 04:52:24,240
tell right away that my hand looks more

4539
04:52:24,240 --> 04:52:26,040
like a blob than it would in a real high

4540
04:52:26,040 --> 04:52:27,540
quality picture

4541
04:52:27,540 --> 04:52:29,820
so a lot of stuff like that is is

4542
04:52:29,820 --> 04:52:31,860
probably going to depend on limits of

4543
04:52:31,860 --> 04:52:33,840
resolution and the compute needed to get

4544
04:52:33,840 --> 04:52:36,020
there

4545
04:52:41,040 --> 04:52:43,138
hello okay

4546
04:52:43,138 --> 04:52:45,298
um so what's your favorite part of your

4547
04:52:45,298 --> 04:52:47,280
job of being Professor with deep

4548
04:52:47,280 --> 04:52:49,260
learning

4549
04:52:49,260 --> 04:52:52,320
I think my favorite part is getting to

4550
04:52:52,320 --> 04:52:54,718
discover new things

4551
04:52:54,718 --> 04:52:58,138
you know and seeing surprising results

4552
04:52:58,138 --> 04:53:02,100
from students who put in work and come

4553
04:53:02,100 --> 04:53:05,700
to a problem with their own ideas so

4554
04:53:05,700 --> 04:53:07,740
Pac-Man there I thought was really

4555
04:53:07,740 --> 04:53:10,138
interesting I didn't dictate those

4556
04:53:10,138 --> 04:53:12,360
students to do that project I gave them

4557
04:53:12,360 --> 04:53:14,820
an open-ended thing then the grad

4558
04:53:14,820 --> 04:53:16,620
students came back and they said hey we

4559
04:53:16,620 --> 04:53:18,298
found we can do this based on some of

4560
04:53:18,298 --> 04:53:20,878
the things we talked about in class

4561
04:53:20,878 --> 04:53:22,320
um and that was really exciting to me

4562
04:53:22,320 --> 04:53:24,000
and that's I think that's what keeps me

4563
04:53:24,000 --> 04:53:27,920
going in this job a lot thank you

4564
04:53:32,218 --> 04:53:35,458
um so you talked about bias in AI or

4565
04:53:35,458 --> 04:53:37,080
machine learning becoming a potential

4566
04:53:37,080 --> 04:53:39,420
problem do you think that as machine

4567
04:53:39,420 --> 04:53:41,040
learning models

4568
04:53:41,040 --> 04:53:43,260
um become more common for several uses

4569
04:53:43,260 --> 04:53:44,700
do you think there will be regulation

4570
04:53:44,700 --> 04:53:47,458
placed that maybe audits or checks that

4571
04:53:47,458 --> 04:53:49,920
bias and things like insurance rates

4572
04:53:49,920 --> 04:53:52,080
that are generated off of that or if it

4573
04:53:52,080 --> 04:53:54,120
was crime or even from a cyber security

4574
04:53:54,120 --> 04:53:56,218
perspective maybe Insider threat

4575
04:53:56,218 --> 04:53:59,458
absolutely yeah I think there's already

4576
04:53:59,458 --> 04:54:03,298
ways to measure fairness of these models

4577
04:54:03,298 --> 04:54:05,458
looking at

4578
04:54:05,458 --> 04:54:07,920
um if it discriminates against a certain

4579
04:54:07,920 --> 04:54:11,458
subgroup uh compared to another subgroup

4580
04:54:11,458 --> 04:54:14,638
and so the methods already exist there's

4581
04:54:14,638 --> 04:54:16,980
tools out there this is one of the

4582
04:54:16,980 --> 04:54:19,320
reasons why we include it in the course

4583
04:54:19,320 --> 04:54:23,160
and I think as policy catches up we're

4584
04:54:23,160 --> 04:54:24,660
probably going to at some point see

4585
04:54:24,660 --> 04:54:28,378
enforcement of of policy Based On Tools

4586
04:54:28,378 --> 04:54:30,860
like that

4587
04:54:33,600 --> 04:54:38,160
I'm sorry Dave I can't do that

4588
04:54:38,160 --> 04:54:39,600
I've just been wanting to do that all

4589
04:54:39,600 --> 04:54:42,540
day but

4590
04:54:42,540 --> 04:54:45,600
it does actually lead to my question so

4591
04:54:45,600 --> 04:54:49,320
I've experienced chat bot

4592
04:54:49,320 --> 04:54:52,200
GPT lying to me

4593
04:54:52,200 --> 04:54:53,700
and then

4594
04:54:53,700 --> 04:54:55,878
when called out

4595
04:54:55,878 --> 04:54:59,218
justifying its lying not correcting it's

4596
04:54:59,218 --> 04:55:01,320
lying

4597
04:55:01,320 --> 04:55:02,718
um

4598
04:55:02,718 --> 04:55:06,000
what kind of

4599
04:55:06,000 --> 04:55:07,798
what kind of leap are we talking about

4600
04:55:07,798 --> 04:55:10,138
there where you can

4601
04:55:10,138 --> 04:55:12,120
even start to

4602
04:55:12,120 --> 04:55:13,860
believe it

4603
04:55:13,860 --> 04:55:15,480
well I think that's

4604
04:55:15,480 --> 04:55:17,700
you know this kind of gets at the heart

4605
04:55:17,700 --> 04:55:19,320
of some of the things we were talking

4606
04:55:19,320 --> 04:55:22,798
about with imitation versus thinking

4607
04:55:22,798 --> 04:55:25,980
one of the main reasons chat TPT is

4608
04:55:25,980 --> 04:55:28,680
giving out false information

4609
04:55:28,680 --> 04:55:31,860
is that it's essentially imitating

4610
04:55:31,860 --> 04:55:34,378
things that were in a state of set but

4611
04:55:34,378 --> 04:55:37,080
we all know that thinking doesn't equate

4612
04:55:37,080 --> 04:55:40,740
to not lying that is true

4613
04:55:40,740 --> 04:55:43,378
and then I

4614
04:55:43,378 --> 04:55:45,440
um

4615
04:55:46,138 --> 04:55:49,020
the issue with chat GPT is because it's

4616
04:55:49,020 --> 04:55:50,520
imitating

4617
04:55:50,520 --> 04:55:53,100
if you ask for an explanation it's

4618
04:55:53,100 --> 04:55:55,138
actually giving you more imitation of

4619
04:55:55,138 --> 04:55:58,560
the data set it's not truly tracing back

4620
04:55:58,560 --> 04:56:01,798
the line of reasoning and the sources it

4621
04:56:01,798 --> 04:56:04,320
used to get you there

4622
04:56:04,320 --> 04:56:06,660
so if you were talking to a human being

4623
04:56:06,660 --> 04:56:10,020
and then they started saying that saying

4624
04:56:10,020 --> 04:56:11,760
something like chat GPT to justify

4625
04:56:11,760 --> 04:56:13,798
themselves you probably get a little bit

4626
04:56:13,798 --> 04:56:14,820
upset

4627
04:56:14,820 --> 04:56:17,760
and you would say what source did you

4628
04:56:17,760 --> 04:56:20,040
see that in that's kind of where chat

4629
04:56:20,040 --> 04:56:22,860
GPT sort of is going to fall apart at

4630
04:56:22,860 --> 04:56:25,080
this point it's not designed for that

4631
04:56:25,080 --> 04:56:26,700
either though

4632
04:56:26,700 --> 04:56:29,100
so and this but this is why this is

4633
04:56:29,100 --> 04:56:30,120
occurring

4634
04:56:30,120 --> 04:56:32,280
uh but again I think this all goes back

4635
04:56:32,280 --> 04:56:33,298
to

4636
04:56:33,298 --> 04:56:37,980
if if there is a transition

4637
04:56:37,980 --> 04:56:40,378
more toward knowledge and away from

4638
04:56:40,378 --> 04:56:41,638
functions

4639
04:56:41,638 --> 04:56:43,680
then we can start to see some of these

4640
04:56:43,680 --> 04:56:45,540
things resolved and when you start to

4641
04:56:45,540 --> 04:56:47,760
ask questions as to why it thinks that

4642
04:56:47,760 --> 04:56:51,000
way even if it's giving you false

4643
04:56:51,000 --> 04:56:52,260
information

4644
04:56:52,260 --> 04:56:55,560
you can still see that logical Trace

4645
04:56:55,560 --> 04:56:58,520
going back to the sources and understand

4646
04:56:58,520 --> 04:57:04,218
why it came up with this uh kooky thing

4647
04:57:10,620 --> 04:57:12,420
but first question and some of these are

4648
04:57:12,420 --> 04:57:13,620
long so I'm gonna let you look at them

4649
04:57:13,620 --> 04:57:16,920
too uh when you say enable the nope that

4650
04:57:16,920 --> 04:57:18,660
was from the previous section never mind

4651
04:57:18,660 --> 04:57:21,298
this one how could we start constructing

4652
04:57:21,298 --> 04:57:23,280
knowledge bases to be relevant to chat

4653
04:57:23,280 --> 04:57:26,940
GPT or other NLP Stacks or even kg for

4654
04:57:26,940 --> 04:57:30,020
xai stacks

4655
04:57:34,620 --> 04:57:36,180
so

4656
04:57:36,180 --> 04:57:38,458
I guess I'm trying to parse a little bit

4657
04:57:38,458 --> 04:57:40,680
about what they mean by knowledge bases

4658
04:57:40,680 --> 04:57:43,218
in the question

4659
04:57:44,900 --> 04:57:48,480
I'm not sure if it's there

4660
04:57:48,480 --> 04:57:50,160
so

4661
04:57:50,160 --> 04:57:51,780
I mean I think one of the things where

4662
04:57:51,780 --> 04:57:53,700
things are going to go in terms of

4663
04:57:53,700 --> 04:57:55,260
knowledge bases and how that's

4664
04:57:55,260 --> 04:57:58,378
constructed is

4665
04:57:58,378 --> 04:58:00,900
infusing domain knowledge into a system

4666
04:58:00,900 --> 04:58:02,760
like that there's going to I think

4667
04:58:02,760 --> 04:58:04,500
there's going to be kind of two big

4668
04:58:04,500 --> 04:58:07,080
approaches that will be out there one is

4669
04:58:07,080 --> 04:58:09,298
going to be through prompt generation

4670
04:58:09,298 --> 04:58:12,060
which will be feeding a system like chat

4671
04:58:12,060 --> 04:58:14,700
GPT or another large language model

4672
04:58:14,700 --> 04:58:17,400
information that it would use as part of

4673
04:58:17,400 --> 04:58:18,718
the prompt

4674
04:58:18,718 --> 04:58:20,940
and that's kind of where engineering

4675
04:58:20,940 --> 04:58:22,798
efforts like what I talked about with

4676
04:58:22,798 --> 04:58:25,260
the math problems how do you break that

4677
04:58:25,260 --> 04:58:28,020
down this would be dealing with how do

4678
04:58:28,020 --> 04:58:29,638
we have bite-sized pieces of knowledge

4679
04:58:29,638 --> 04:58:31,860
that we would feed along with a problem

4680
04:58:31,860 --> 04:58:34,740
I think the other going the other way

4681
04:58:34,740 --> 04:58:38,100
with a more symbolic method feeding

4682
04:58:38,100 --> 04:58:40,138
symbolic information to a system I think

4683
04:58:40,138 --> 04:58:42,000
likely that's going to take the form of

4684
04:58:42,000 --> 04:58:46,340
knowledge graphs things like wikidata

4685
04:58:46,740 --> 04:58:48,900
question about AI do you think I will

4686
04:58:48,900 --> 04:58:51,180
eventually exhibit emergent behavior is

4687
04:58:51,180 --> 04:58:52,798
emergent Behavior something that's not

4688
04:58:52,798 --> 04:58:54,840
part of the system design

4689
04:58:54,840 --> 04:58:58,440
so I think chat GPT has already

4690
04:58:58,440 --> 04:59:01,580
exhibited emergent Behavior

4691
04:59:01,580 --> 04:59:04,920
it's on very small scale and for smaller

4692
04:59:04,920 --> 04:59:06,900
things but it actually does this is this

4693
04:59:06,900 --> 04:59:08,000
is well known

4694
04:59:08,000 --> 04:59:11,760
and emergent Behavior by definition is

4695
04:59:11,760 --> 04:59:15,298
not designed you know with that to be

4696
04:59:15,298 --> 04:59:17,340
created in mind so I think this is

4697
04:59:17,340 --> 04:59:20,040
already going on

4698
04:59:20,040 --> 04:59:22,560
well just a reminder that the Lakes uh

4699
04:59:22,560 --> 04:59:24,600
that Paulo mentioned are available in

4700
04:59:24,600 --> 04:59:28,080
the talk description on our website

4701
04:59:28,080 --> 04:59:29,700
and tools use some of those resources

4702
04:59:29,700 --> 04:59:31,320
find

4703
04:59:31,320 --> 04:59:32,878
them and thank you so much for sharing

4704
04:59:32,878 --> 04:59:34,080
this with us today it's incredibly

4705
04:59:34,080 --> 04:59:35,878
relevant and we'll just be more so going

4706
04:59:35,878 --> 04:59:39,138
forward thank you very much

welcome everyone thank you for uh coming

4761
05:12:39,000 --> 05:12:40,560
out to our two o'clock presentation

4762
05:12:40,560 --> 05:12:41,760
sorry it's a little bit delayed here

4763
05:12:41,760 --> 05:12:43,680
have a few technical difficulties uh

4764
05:12:43,680 --> 05:12:46,138
this will be uh will AI take my awesome

4765
05:12:46,138 --> 05:12:48,840
infosec job uh presented by Andrew cook

4766
05:12:48,840 --> 05:12:52,700
with Recon infosec so

4767
05:12:55,440 --> 05:12:56,940
awesome so I didn't know I was actually

4768
05:12:56,940 --> 05:12:58,980
following a professor in this stuff so

4769
05:12:58,980 --> 05:13:00,780
as was made clear in the abstract you're

4770
05:13:00,780 --> 05:13:02,820
getting a light a Layman's understanding

4771
05:13:02,820 --> 05:13:04,200
of all this and more specifically a

4772
05:13:04,200 --> 05:13:06,420
security practitioner's take on it as I

4773
05:13:06,420 --> 05:13:08,100
try to use all these tools and try to

4774
05:13:08,100 --> 05:13:10,620
put some of that stuff in context so

4775
05:13:10,620 --> 05:13:12,480
um like a lot of people I think I've

4776
05:13:12,480 --> 05:13:14,280
developed a healthy skepticism for all

4777
05:13:14,280 --> 05:13:16,378
things labeled Ai and ml right

4778
05:13:16,378 --> 05:13:17,940
especially trying to use this in the

4779
05:13:17,940 --> 05:13:19,020
security field

4780
05:13:19,020 --> 05:13:20,400
um I mean this goes back all the way to

4781
05:13:20,400 --> 05:13:22,320
the 90s right when I was looking for my

4782
05:13:22,320 --> 05:13:24,240
Furby to actually be intelligent or

4783
05:13:24,240 --> 05:13:26,940
Tamagotchi to do something right we had

4784
05:13:26,940 --> 05:13:29,280
um AOL Instant Messenger there was

4785
05:13:29,280 --> 05:13:31,138
smarter child for one of the first chat

4786
05:13:31,138 --> 05:13:32,340
Bots it was kind of interesting you can

4787
05:13:32,340 --> 05:13:33,420
go in there and like you could tell it

4788
05:13:33,420 --> 05:13:35,040
was just looking up keywords but it

4789
05:13:35,040 --> 05:13:37,560
never really scratched that AI ml itch

4790
05:13:37,560 --> 05:13:39,000
that like I wanted as a you know

4791
05:13:39,000 --> 05:13:41,040
computers to do something cool

4792
05:13:41,040 --> 05:13:43,080
um so

4793
05:13:43,080 --> 05:13:44,820
every once in a while I dip back into it

4794
05:13:44,820 --> 05:13:45,958
I'm like hey maybe this stuff's ready

4795
05:13:45,958 --> 05:13:47,520
maybe we can use it for something either

4796
05:13:47,520 --> 05:13:50,280
for fun or professionally or security it

4797
05:13:50,280 --> 05:13:52,860
always falls flat so rewind just a

4798
05:13:52,860 --> 05:13:55,200
couple years ago 2018

4799
05:13:55,200 --> 05:13:58,138
this is Edmund Edmund dibolini anybody

4800
05:13:58,138 --> 05:14:00,000
know what that is

4801
05:14:00,000 --> 05:14:02,700
okay so that is the first AI generated

4802
05:14:02,700 --> 05:14:04,020
portrait

4803
05:14:04,020 --> 05:14:06,240
and so you've probably seen all of the

4804
05:14:06,240 --> 05:14:07,680
the explosion of AI generated

4805
05:14:07,680 --> 05:14:09,240
photography and graphics and all that

4806
05:14:09,240 --> 05:14:10,560
stuff going on right now we'll dabble in

4807
05:14:10,560 --> 05:14:11,878
that now but this is where we started

4808
05:14:11,878 --> 05:14:13,620
2018 and I remember looking at that and

4809
05:14:13,620 --> 05:14:16,320
I remember saying I guess

4810
05:14:16,320 --> 05:14:18,780
right I mean it's like maybe impressive

4811
05:14:18,780 --> 05:14:20,700
you didn't really have an idea of how it

4812
05:14:20,700 --> 05:14:22,020
was generated or what it really meant

4813
05:14:22,020 --> 05:14:23,340
for this thing to sort of resemble a

4814
05:14:23,340 --> 05:14:25,620
human what went into it there was 15 000

4815
05:14:25,620 --> 05:14:28,798
portraits over like 500 years and a

4816
05:14:28,798 --> 05:14:30,240
whole lot of work to figure out what

4817
05:14:30,240 --> 05:14:31,798
does art will look like and you kind of

4818
05:14:31,798 --> 05:14:32,700
get that

4819
05:14:32,700 --> 05:14:36,480
it sold for 432 thousand dollars

4820
05:14:36,480 --> 05:14:37,920
right

4821
05:14:37,920 --> 05:14:38,580
um

4822
05:14:38,580 --> 05:14:41,040
rewind a little bit uh one more year

4823
05:14:41,040 --> 05:14:43,620
back to 2017. this is still me I

4824
05:14:43,620 --> 05:14:45,298
recreated this moment

4825
05:14:45,298 --> 05:14:48,660
elastic released their machine learning

4826
05:14:48,660 --> 05:14:50,520
elastic module in their X-Pac and we had

4827
05:14:50,520 --> 05:14:52,378
been using the elastic seam and I was

4828
05:14:52,378 --> 05:14:53,760
like let's see if this machine learning

4829
05:14:53,760 --> 05:14:55,620
thing is ready to do anything I kept

4830
05:14:55,620 --> 05:14:57,120
pumping data into it I kept trying to

4831
05:14:57,120 --> 05:14:58,080
use it I kept trying to do something

4832
05:14:58,080 --> 05:14:59,700
with it I'm like find the bad guy just

4833
05:14:59,700 --> 05:15:01,798
do something good I kept producing

4834
05:15:01,798 --> 05:15:03,180
graphs that looked like that again this

4835
05:15:03,180 --> 05:15:04,860
is a recreation it would point to stuff

4836
05:15:04,860 --> 05:15:06,660
and it would say this is bad I'd be like

4837
05:15:06,660 --> 05:15:08,458
why what are you looking at this isn't

4838
05:15:08,458 --> 05:15:10,260
this is garbage this is what I was used

4839
05:15:10,260 --> 05:15:11,520
to seeing and this is I think what a lot

4840
05:15:11,520 --> 05:15:12,600
of us are used to see and kind of look

4841
05:15:12,600 --> 05:15:14,820
at it and say maybe it's something okay

4842
05:15:14,820 --> 05:15:18,060
so where are we today

4843
05:15:18,060 --> 05:15:19,980
I made that on my phone I mean I guess

4844
05:15:19,980 --> 05:15:21,600
it went off to the cloud

4845
05:15:21,600 --> 05:15:23,040
um I had to put it there because it was

4846
05:15:23,040 --> 05:15:25,260
the same position as Mr Edward there so

4847
05:15:25,260 --> 05:15:27,840
there's me Edward day cook uh from a few

4848
05:15:27,840 --> 05:15:30,480
weeks ago using lensa AI

4849
05:15:30,480 --> 05:15:34,138
and on the right or yeah right uh we

4850
05:15:34,138 --> 05:15:36,180
have is this command malicious from chat

4851
05:15:36,180 --> 05:15:39,420
GPT and the command that I provided was

4852
05:15:39,420 --> 05:15:42,360
from the cassaya uh attack the cassia

4853
05:15:42,360 --> 05:15:44,878
ransomware attack in 2021 and we might

4854
05:15:44,878 --> 05:15:46,200
look at that in a second but it's a it's

4855
05:15:46,200 --> 05:15:48,420
a chunk of code like this big you can

4856
05:15:48,420 --> 05:15:49,860
see how it broke it down hey here's the

4857
05:15:49,860 --> 05:15:51,900
pink command set MP preferences copies

4858
05:15:51,900 --> 05:15:54,000
cert Echo all this crammed into one big

4859
05:15:54,000 --> 05:15:55,798
blob that if you were just looking at

4860
05:15:55,798 --> 05:15:57,360
her see it might just blend in with the

4861
05:15:57,360 --> 05:15:59,520
rest of it and it broke it down and it

4862
05:15:59,520 --> 05:16:01,440
explained everything here's the Ping

4863
05:16:01,440 --> 05:16:03,298
it's running this many times here's set

4864
05:16:03,298 --> 05:16:05,340
MP preferences I don't maybe you don't

4865
05:16:05,340 --> 05:16:06,298
know what that means maybe you're new

4866
05:16:06,298 --> 05:16:08,100
maybe it just glazed over but hey it's

4867
05:16:08,100 --> 05:16:10,500
disabling the antivirus that sounds um

4868
05:16:10,500 --> 05:16:13,080
that sounds like something that might be

4869
05:16:13,080 --> 05:16:15,900
interesting to know copy Echo cert util

4870
05:16:15,900 --> 05:16:18,180
agent.exe this is like classic using

4871
05:16:18,180 --> 05:16:19,680
cert utility.exe to get command

4872
05:16:19,680 --> 05:16:21,540
execution and that's all hidden in a

4873
05:16:21,540 --> 05:16:23,400
blob code that is now made abundantly

4874
05:16:23,400 --> 05:16:25,798
clear with no prior this was nothing

4875
05:16:25,798 --> 05:16:28,020
this is my first use of chat EPT I went

4876
05:16:28,020 --> 05:16:29,400
into this prompt I said is this command

4877
05:16:29,400 --> 05:16:30,780
malicious and I took the old code from

4878
05:16:30,780 --> 05:16:32,760
cassaya and I gave it nothing else and

4879
05:16:32,760 --> 05:16:34,138
that's what it gave me and I said maybe

4880
05:16:34,138 --> 05:16:35,520
there's something here and we should

4881
05:16:35,520 --> 05:16:36,660
tell someone

4882
05:16:36,660 --> 05:16:39,060
so and it does make that conclusion at

4883
05:16:39,060 --> 05:16:40,798
the end based on this information it's

4884
05:16:40,798 --> 05:16:42,180
possible that the command is attempting

4885
05:16:42,180 --> 05:16:44,340
to disable security features

4886
05:16:44,340 --> 05:16:46,920
um and execute a potentially malicious

4887
05:16:46,920 --> 05:16:49,440
file and I said shoot it's coming from

4888
05:16:49,440 --> 05:16:51,660
my job

4889
05:16:51,660 --> 05:16:53,660
so

4890
05:16:53,660 --> 05:16:55,798
this stuff is suddenly everywhere just

4891
05:16:55,798 --> 05:16:57,000
in the last three to six months this

4892
05:16:57,000 --> 05:16:58,680
presentation has changed a lot and I'll

4893
05:16:58,680 --> 05:17:00,000
explain how

4894
05:17:00,000 --> 05:17:02,040
um what I'm featuring here are just some

4895
05:17:02,040 --> 05:17:03,060
of the things that we're going to talk

4896
05:17:03,060 --> 05:17:05,160
about are touch uh during this

4897
05:17:05,160 --> 05:17:06,298
presentation

4898
05:17:06,298 --> 05:17:08,160
uh but it's all over the place so open

4899
05:17:08,160 --> 05:17:10,440
AI is obviously the biggest offender of

4900
05:17:10,440 --> 05:17:12,120
why we're all looking at this and saying

4901
05:17:12,120 --> 05:17:13,860
maybe there's something going on you've

4902
05:17:13,860 --> 05:17:16,260
got chat GPT and their GPT models that's

4903
05:17:16,260 --> 05:17:17,878
natural language models if you listen to

4904
05:17:17,878 --> 05:17:19,200
Professor talk you probably learned a

4905
05:17:19,200 --> 05:17:21,780
lot about that openai codex which is

4906
05:17:21,780 --> 05:17:23,878
specifically implemented both

4907
05:17:23,878 --> 05:17:25,860
independently and within Google co-pilot

4908
05:17:25,860 --> 05:17:28,260
to do some programming AI you've got a

4909
05:17:28,260 --> 05:17:30,180
whole slew of image generation that take

4910
05:17:30,180 --> 05:17:32,940
text or prior art and retr and transform

4911
05:17:32,940 --> 05:17:36,060
it into new images open ai's dolly two

4912
05:17:36,060 --> 05:17:38,160
you got stable diffusion there's a few

4913
05:17:38,160 --> 05:17:41,940
others out there as well lensa AI was

4914
05:17:41,940 --> 05:17:43,020
just the one that I used to generate

4915
05:17:43,020 --> 05:17:45,120
that portrait and then Synthesia you're

4916
05:17:45,120 --> 05:17:46,080
going to see in a second there's nothing

4917
05:17:46,080 --> 05:17:48,480
particularly notable about that because

4918
05:17:48,480 --> 05:17:50,040
we don't do video editing but there's a

4919
05:17:50,040 --> 05:17:52,620
whole lot of work in where AI is

4920
05:17:52,620 --> 05:17:53,820
threatening video editing as well where

4921
05:17:53,820 --> 05:17:56,400
you can provide your your video and your

4922
05:17:56,400 --> 05:17:58,320
storyboards and your scripts and

4923
05:17:58,320 --> 05:18:00,900
suddenly it's cutting those together in

4924
05:18:00,900 --> 05:18:02,400
a way that you know somebody that's

4925
05:18:02,400 --> 05:18:03,718
producing YouTube videos or product

4926
05:18:03,718 --> 05:18:05,638
reviews they just saved a whole lot of

4927
05:18:05,638 --> 05:18:07,138
time so the these are some things that

4928
05:18:07,138 --> 05:18:09,298
we're talking about a surprised man with

4929
05:18:09,298 --> 05:18:11,520
his hands on his cheeks and mouth open

4930
05:18:11,520 --> 05:18:13,138
that's what Dolly too thinks that that

4931
05:18:13,138 --> 05:18:14,940
looks like so some will get a couple

4932
05:18:14,940 --> 05:18:17,040
funny images here from uh from some of

4933
05:18:17,040 --> 05:18:19,378
the image generation here

4934
05:18:19,378 --> 05:18:21,480
so this is the part of the presentation

4935
05:18:21,480 --> 05:18:23,520
that I took the most out of and by that

4936
05:18:23,520 --> 05:18:24,958
I mean remove slides because I want to

4937
05:18:24,958 --> 05:18:27,600
save I want to save more time for some

4938
05:18:27,600 --> 05:18:29,160
of the compelling use cases where I said

4939
05:18:29,160 --> 05:18:31,020
oh man there might be something here but

4940
05:18:31,020 --> 05:18:33,560
let me do a little bit of analysis

4941
05:18:33,560 --> 05:18:36,240
being nobody I cannot predict the future

4942
05:18:36,240 --> 05:18:37,620
but let me just tell you what I learned

4943
05:18:37,620 --> 05:18:39,320
and then we'll move on to the next part

4944
05:18:39,320 --> 05:18:41,580
there's some really impressive sounding

4945
05:18:41,580 --> 05:18:43,680
people there's Ray Kurzweil he's a

4946
05:18:43,680 --> 05:18:45,958
computer scientist known for a lot of

4947
05:18:45,958 --> 05:18:48,780
things he's claims an 86 success rate in

4948
05:18:48,780 --> 05:18:52,080
his predictions and he says 2029 is the

4949
05:18:52,080 --> 05:18:53,638
consistent date I have predicted for

4950
05:18:53,638 --> 05:18:55,740
when AI will pass a valid touring test

4951
05:18:55,740 --> 05:18:57,600
and therefore achieve human levels of

4952
05:18:57,600 --> 05:18:59,700
intelligence I have set the date for

4953
05:18:59,700 --> 05:19:02,218
2045 for the singularity

4954
05:19:02,218 --> 05:19:04,560
the king

4955
05:19:04,560 --> 05:19:05,820
um things that also got cut from this

4956
05:19:05,820 --> 05:19:07,740
presentation before open Ai and chat GPT

4957
05:19:07,740 --> 05:19:09,120
and all that kind of stuff came in and

4958
05:19:09,120 --> 05:19:11,160
said there's more interesting examples

4959
05:19:11,160 --> 05:19:13,320
that's that's more showing than just

4960
05:19:13,320 --> 05:19:14,638
telling you

4961
05:19:14,638 --> 05:19:16,798
um is a graph from Time Magazine not

4962
05:19:16,798 --> 05:19:18,600
wasting my time showing but it was from

4963
05:19:18,600 --> 05:19:19,798
2011

4964
05:19:19,798 --> 05:19:21,660
it said the brain power Mouse in 2015

4965
05:19:21,660 --> 05:19:25,378
will have human brain power in 2023 and

4966
05:19:25,378 --> 05:19:28,080
2045 again is that date of when we're

4967
05:19:28,080 --> 05:19:29,700
going to surpass brain power equivalent

4968
05:19:29,700 --> 05:19:31,320
to that of all human brains combined so

4969
05:19:31,320 --> 05:19:32,820
clearly that hasn't happened we haven't

4970
05:19:32,820 --> 05:19:35,820
had we don't even have rat level level

4971
05:19:35,820 --> 05:19:37,500
of intelligence right now just to be

4972
05:19:37,500 --> 05:19:38,760
clear there is no artificial general

4973
05:19:38,760 --> 05:19:40,200
intelligence that can even be as

4974
05:19:40,200 --> 05:19:41,820
intelligent of a rat but we do have

4975
05:19:41,820 --> 05:19:44,218
something going on

4976
05:19:44,218 --> 05:19:47,100
and it's trending in the right direction

4977
05:19:47,100 --> 05:19:50,040
and in my mind the only valid answer to

4978
05:19:50,040 --> 05:19:51,420
this question

4979
05:19:51,420 --> 05:19:54,298
and the safest answer this question

4980
05:19:54,298 --> 05:19:56,218
is yes

4981
05:19:56,218 --> 05:19:59,760
and the reason I say yes

4982
05:19:59,760 --> 05:20:02,520
is if I was to use a threat hunting

4983
05:20:02,520 --> 05:20:03,780
example

4984
05:20:03,780 --> 05:20:05,160
in thread hunting we have this idea of

4985
05:20:05,160 --> 05:20:07,560
assumed breach right going in and saying

4986
05:20:07,560 --> 05:20:09,180
just because nothing's wrong we should

4987
05:20:09,180 --> 05:20:10,500
just assume that something's wrong

4988
05:20:10,500 --> 05:20:12,000
inside the environment the attackers

4989
05:20:12,000 --> 05:20:13,378
already in our Network what are we going

4990
05:20:13,378 --> 05:20:14,400
to do about it even though there's no

4991
05:20:14,400 --> 05:20:15,660
alarm even though we haven't seen an

4992
05:20:15,660 --> 05:20:17,218
alert we need to assume that the bad

4993
05:20:17,218 --> 05:20:19,440
guy's already inside

4994
05:20:19,440 --> 05:20:21,958
this same type of thinking motivates us

4995
05:20:21,958 --> 05:20:23,458
to be proactive about what we're going

4996
05:20:23,458 --> 05:20:26,520
to do next so if we just assume that AI

4997
05:20:26,520 --> 05:20:28,798
is going to take our job that will

4998
05:20:28,798 --> 05:20:31,138
motivate us to be on top of this so that

4999
05:20:31,138 --> 05:20:34,980
if it is we can be ahead of it or at a

5000
05:20:34,980 --> 05:20:36,600
minimum

5001
05:20:36,600 --> 05:20:38,580
what what is more likely to happen is if

5002
05:20:38,580 --> 05:20:40,260
you're not on top of this stuff the guy

5003
05:20:40,260 --> 05:20:42,180
who does know the AI stuff is going to

5004
05:20:42,180 --> 05:20:44,218
take your job so

5005
05:20:44,218 --> 05:20:46,440
in my mind and what I'm what my goal in

5006
05:20:46,440 --> 05:20:47,940
this presentation here is to convince

5007
05:20:47,940 --> 05:20:49,378
you of is that there are useful things

5008
05:20:49,378 --> 05:20:52,020
that AI has just opened the door to that

5009
05:20:52,020 --> 05:20:54,060
for as long as possible before it's you

5010
05:20:54,060 --> 05:20:55,980
know pulled away by Microsoft or hidden

5011
05:20:55,980 --> 05:20:57,900
behind something or whatever if it is

5012
05:20:57,900 --> 05:21:00,240
accessible to us you should be trying to

5013
05:21:00,240 --> 05:21:02,218
look at it keep your eyes open keep

5014
05:21:02,218 --> 05:21:03,600
touching it keep seeing if it's useful

5015
05:21:03,600 --> 05:21:05,040
see if it's falling flat see what it's

5016
05:21:05,040 --> 05:21:06,780
doing because it seems like it's going

5017
05:21:06,780 --> 05:21:09,240
to do something eventually

5018
05:21:09,240 --> 05:21:10,378
so

5019
05:21:10,378 --> 05:21:12,180
hopefully that that motivation makes

5020
05:21:12,180 --> 05:21:15,060
sense my whole again

5021
05:21:15,060 --> 05:21:17,040
um what we'll see next are some examples

5022
05:21:17,040 --> 05:21:18,780
where I want you to be thinking ahead

5023
05:21:18,780 --> 05:21:20,520
and say hey do these examples apply to

5024
05:21:20,520 --> 05:21:22,378
me can I use it and then I also really

5025
05:21:22,378 --> 05:21:23,400
really want to make sure you understand

5026
05:21:23,400 --> 05:21:25,560
the limitations which is some of what uh

5027
05:21:25,560 --> 05:21:26,940
what that last presentation was talking

5028
05:21:26,940 --> 05:21:29,100
about I think we can see more of those

5029
05:21:29,100 --> 05:21:31,860
coming on so when we look at my career I

5030
05:21:31,860 --> 05:21:33,600
very briefly introduced myself there

5031
05:21:33,600 --> 05:21:35,100
because I was more distracted by the

5032
05:21:35,100 --> 05:21:37,080
embarrassing picture of me

5033
05:21:37,080 --> 05:21:38,878
um my background is Security operation

5034
05:21:38,878 --> 05:21:41,218
so uh 10 12 years ago in the Air Force

5035
05:21:41,218 --> 05:21:43,138
building threat hunting programs looking

5036
05:21:43,138 --> 05:21:45,920
for looking for threats uh got out

5037
05:21:45,920 --> 05:21:48,600
continuing to do threat detection

5038
05:21:48,600 --> 05:21:51,480
security operations incident response

5039
05:21:51,480 --> 05:21:53,700
threat detection engineering all that

5040
05:21:53,700 --> 05:21:54,780
kind of good stuff think about the good

5041
05:21:54,780 --> 05:21:56,280
stuff that might happen in the sock I've

5042
05:21:56,280 --> 05:21:57,660
also done a bunch of Consulting written

5043
05:21:57,660 --> 05:22:00,060
a bunch of reports done this to sense

5044
05:22:00,060 --> 05:22:01,500
you know walked in done a bunch of

5045
05:22:01,500 --> 05:22:03,480
interviews benched Benchmark them

5046
05:22:03,480 --> 05:22:05,878
against uh nist and CIS all that kind of

5047
05:22:05,878 --> 05:22:07,620
stuff dabbled in some pen testing and

5048
05:22:07,620 --> 05:22:10,320
then I also like when I can and and uh

5049
05:22:10,320 --> 05:22:12,420
Whitney short stack lets me touch the

5050
05:22:12,420 --> 05:22:15,180
code I like touching code too so

5051
05:22:15,180 --> 05:22:16,920
the reason I put this here is these are

5052
05:22:16,920 --> 05:22:18,060
where these use cases are coming from

5053
05:22:18,060 --> 05:22:19,378
they're my experiences they're things

5054
05:22:19,378 --> 05:22:20,580
that I might do at work they're things

5055
05:22:20,580 --> 05:22:22,260
that I've done in the past

5056
05:22:22,260 --> 05:22:23,940
um I put this in front of you to kind of

5057
05:22:23,940 --> 05:22:25,680
help you brainstorm too

5058
05:22:25,680 --> 05:22:28,080
keep these in your head and also also if

5059
05:22:28,080 --> 05:22:29,580
I time this all right we'll have some

5060
05:22:29,580 --> 05:22:30,900
time at the end where maybe we can play

5061
05:22:30,900 --> 05:22:33,298
with your examples so

5062
05:22:33,298 --> 05:22:34,798
this is where I'm deriving these use

5063
05:22:34,798 --> 05:22:38,100
cases from and I think I also now owe

5064
05:22:38,100 --> 05:22:40,740
you our co-presenter here

5065
05:22:40,740 --> 05:22:42,660
and this is the creepiest part

5066
05:22:42,660 --> 05:22:44,520
and I don't know if we have sound are we

5067
05:22:44,520 --> 05:22:46,260
going to get it

5068
05:22:46,260 --> 05:22:47,940
if there's not sound I'm almost going to

5069
05:22:47,940 --> 05:22:49,080
back out of it because it's a little

5070
05:22:49,080 --> 05:22:51,440
silly

5071
05:22:57,480 --> 05:22:59,878
eight eye and stay ahead in the game I

5072
05:22:59,878 --> 05:23:01,378
look forward to answering any questions

5073
05:23:01,378 --> 05:23:04,020
you have at the end of the presentation

5074
05:23:04,020 --> 05:23:07,440
okay so what just happened there

5075
05:23:07,440 --> 05:23:09,900
just out of curiosity who here has

5076
05:23:09,900 --> 05:23:11,580
already opened up

5077
05:23:11,580 --> 05:23:13,860
open ai's playground or chat GPT or

5078
05:23:13,860 --> 05:23:15,840
codex okay so everybody's messed around

5079
05:23:15,840 --> 05:23:17,638
with it awesome so I'm gonna go a little

5080
05:23:17,638 --> 05:23:19,500
bit faster on some of the simple stuff

5081
05:23:19,500 --> 05:23:20,700
because it's not going to wow you as

5082
05:23:20,700 --> 05:23:22,080
much because you've already seen it do

5083
05:23:22,080 --> 05:23:23,100
something

5084
05:23:23,100 --> 05:23:23,878
um

5085
05:23:23,878 --> 05:23:27,120
so what I did there was gave it the

5086
05:23:27,120 --> 05:23:29,458
uh the abstract of this talk and I said

5087
05:23:29,458 --> 05:23:30,840
hey you're my co-presenter please

5088
05:23:30,840 --> 05:23:33,718
introduce yourself to the audience

5089
05:23:33,718 --> 05:23:35,580
and it starts typing right and it's

5090
05:23:35,580 --> 05:23:36,900
going to keep typing and it's going to

5091
05:23:36,900 --> 05:23:38,458
keep typing now one of the interesting

5092
05:23:38,458 --> 05:23:40,860
things in interacting with this thing in

5093
05:23:40,860 --> 05:23:42,540
sort of a conversational model is that

5094
05:23:42,540 --> 05:23:44,280
you have the opportunity to continue to

5095
05:23:44,280 --> 05:23:47,280
correct it or evolve or tell it to do

5096
05:23:47,280 --> 05:23:48,540
something different so I said hey please

5097
05:23:48,540 --> 05:23:50,700
make it more exciting and upbeat and it

5098
05:23:50,700 --> 05:23:52,500
rewrites that introduction

5099
05:23:52,500 --> 05:23:54,780
and it makes it more exciting and upbeat

5100
05:23:54,780 --> 05:23:57,180
and it looks like magic right if I had

5101
05:23:57,180 --> 05:23:59,400
I don't know if if I was like Hey

5102
05:23:59,400 --> 05:24:00,660
somebody help me write this presentation

5103
05:24:00,660 --> 05:24:02,218
can somebody just write this paragraph

5104
05:24:02,218 --> 05:24:03,718
for me here's what I need and they came

5105
05:24:03,718 --> 05:24:04,980
back with me after a few minutes and

5106
05:24:04,980 --> 05:24:07,080
gave me that I'd say awesome thanks

5107
05:24:07,080 --> 05:24:09,180
right like this was completely plausible

5108
05:24:09,180 --> 05:24:11,700
comprehensible it made sense to me

5109
05:24:11,700 --> 05:24:13,080
um you know let's face it the world of

5110
05:24:13,080 --> 05:24:14,820
technology is constantly evolving in AI

5111
05:24:14,820 --> 05:24:16,200
is at the Forefront of that change but

5112
05:24:16,200 --> 05:24:17,760
instead of fearing that AI will replace

5113
05:24:17,760 --> 05:24:19,440
our jobs let's embrace it and see how we

5114
05:24:19,440 --> 05:24:21,060
can leverage its capabilities to improve

5115
05:24:21,060 --> 05:24:23,878
our security operations wow thank you

5116
05:24:23,878 --> 05:24:25,500
for giving me that so where did that

5117
05:24:25,500 --> 05:24:27,060
come from looks like magic we're going

5118
05:24:27,060 --> 05:24:27,958
to break it down a little bit we're

5119
05:24:27,958 --> 05:24:28,798
going to see where this thing falls

5120
05:24:28,798 --> 05:24:32,218
apart but that's what it looks like so

5121
05:24:32,218 --> 05:24:32,878
um

5122
05:24:32,878 --> 05:24:34,920
the next thing and again this is a this

5123
05:24:34,920 --> 05:24:37,080
is first and foremost a a language model

5124
05:24:37,080 --> 05:24:38,820
right so these first couple examples are

5125
05:24:38,820 --> 05:24:42,240
going to be generating text generating

5126
05:24:42,240 --> 05:24:44,878
um things so

5127
05:24:44,878 --> 05:24:46,020
one of the things I wasn't looking

5128
05:24:46,020 --> 05:24:47,820
forward to is writing a knowledge-based

5129
05:24:47,820 --> 05:24:49,440
article about lapse local account

5130
05:24:49,440 --> 05:24:52,378
password manager right the thing in

5131
05:24:52,378 --> 05:24:54,480
Windows that lets you set distinct

5132
05:24:54,480 --> 05:24:56,100
passwords across your environment

5133
05:24:56,100 --> 05:24:58,378
distinct local administrator passwords

5134
05:24:58,378 --> 05:25:00,360
across your environment using GPO

5135
05:25:00,360 --> 05:25:03,120
I'm constantly recommending a few things

5136
05:25:03,120 --> 05:25:04,500
and I feel like I'm saying them over and

5137
05:25:04,500 --> 05:25:06,120
over and over again MFA everything on

5138
05:25:06,120 --> 05:25:08,218
the outside Laps on the inside and stop

5139
05:25:08,218 --> 05:25:10,798
exposing rdt to the internet RDP to the

5140
05:25:10,798 --> 05:25:13,260
internet thankfully is seeming to be

5141
05:25:13,260 --> 05:25:14,580
less and less of a problem but still

5142
05:25:14,580 --> 05:25:16,020
there's no lapse and we're still

5143
05:25:16,020 --> 05:25:18,420
struggling to get MFA out on everything

5144
05:25:18,420 --> 05:25:19,680
but I needed to write this knowledge

5145
05:25:19,680 --> 05:25:21,060
base article for our customers and I'm

5146
05:25:21,060 --> 05:25:23,100
like I'm tired of talking about laps so

5147
05:25:23,100 --> 05:25:25,820
here's the prompt and it's producing

5148
05:25:25,820 --> 05:25:29,878
seemingly valid looking text and

5149
05:25:29,878 --> 05:25:32,040
What's Happening Here is this generative

5150
05:25:32,040 --> 05:25:33,958
pre-trained Transformer and I'm not

5151
05:25:33,958 --> 05:25:35,280
going to try to pre a professor but I'm

5152
05:25:35,280 --> 05:25:36,540
going to explain to you what is

5153
05:25:36,540 --> 05:25:38,878
happening it is

5154
05:25:38,878 --> 05:25:41,040
first and foremost trying to create

5155
05:25:41,040 --> 05:25:44,458
comprehensible output it its entire goal

5156
05:25:44,458 --> 05:25:46,440
is is the next thing I'm going to say

5157
05:25:46,440 --> 05:25:48,480
adding or subtracting from the

5158
05:25:48,480 --> 05:25:50,280
possibility that this is going to be

5159
05:25:50,280 --> 05:25:54,240
understood by a human right and it's

5160
05:25:54,240 --> 05:25:55,798
it's doing it in a way where it's

5161
05:25:55,798 --> 05:25:57,480
predicting the likelihood that the next

5162
05:25:57,480 --> 05:25:59,820
word is going to achieve that goal so

5163
05:25:59,820 --> 05:26:01,378
it's looking at it's not it's not

5164
05:26:01,378 --> 05:26:02,820
learning anything it's looking at the

5165
05:26:02,820 --> 05:26:05,820
words and it's developed a model from

5166
05:26:05,820 --> 05:26:07,260
tons and tons of data from the internet

5167
05:26:07,260 --> 05:26:10,740
back in 2021 of of how these words are

5168
05:26:10,740 --> 05:26:11,638
related

5169
05:26:11,638 --> 05:26:14,280
so it's just predicting the next word

5170
05:26:14,280 --> 05:26:16,500
based on the context that it already has

5171
05:26:16,500 --> 05:26:17,878
some of the interesting things that's

5172
05:26:17,878 --> 05:26:19,320
doing is also deciding what to pay

5173
05:26:19,320 --> 05:26:21,298
attention to so it's reminding itself or

5174
05:26:21,298 --> 05:26:23,400
remembering back in earlier in the

5175
05:26:23,400 --> 05:26:26,580
prompt and its own text things that you

5176
05:26:26,580 --> 05:26:28,378
pay more attention to to make sure that

5177
05:26:28,378 --> 05:26:29,820
it doesn't just go up into nonsense land

5178
05:26:29,820 --> 05:26:31,980
is trying to hone in on words or

5179
05:26:31,980 --> 05:26:33,600
important phrases from the beginning of

5180
05:26:33,600 --> 05:26:35,400
the prompt or it's beginning of its of

5181
05:26:35,400 --> 05:26:37,680
its input to say hey I'm continuing to

5182
05:26:37,680 --> 05:26:38,940
talk about laps I'm not just going to

5183
05:26:38,940 --> 05:26:40,680
take the next word if it just took the

5184
05:26:40,680 --> 05:26:42,718
next word every single time it would

5185
05:26:42,718 --> 05:26:44,638
look pretty similar to the auto not the

5186
05:26:44,638 --> 05:26:46,138
autocorrect the autocomplete on your

5187
05:26:46,138 --> 05:26:48,060
phone have you ever done that just give

5188
05:26:48,060 --> 05:26:50,280
it a little bit of input on your phone

5189
05:26:50,280 --> 05:26:51,958
in a text and just keep taking the first

5190
05:26:51,958 --> 05:26:53,400
recommendation and seeing what it says

5191
05:26:53,400 --> 05:26:55,138
it sounds like nonsense but this is

5192
05:26:55,138 --> 05:26:57,000
trying to do something a little bit

5193
05:26:57,000 --> 05:26:58,260
different by weighing those words

5194
05:26:58,260 --> 05:27:00,360
differently and also having the the

5195
05:27:00,360 --> 05:27:02,940
understanding of a model from the again

5196
05:27:02,940 --> 05:27:04,680
built from the internet we'll just say

5197
05:27:04,680 --> 05:27:05,760
that

5198
05:27:05,760 --> 05:27:08,458
okay so would I take this knowledge base

5199
05:27:08,458 --> 05:27:10,080
article and drop it directly in our

5200
05:27:10,080 --> 05:27:11,580
customer portal and then point our

5201
05:27:11,580 --> 05:27:13,320
customers there and say guys please

5202
05:27:13,320 --> 05:27:16,700
please Implement labs

5203
05:27:16,740 --> 05:27:18,360
I should read it a lot but I see a lot

5204
05:27:18,360 --> 05:27:20,458
of hands a lot of a lot of heads going

5205
05:27:20,458 --> 05:27:22,378
left and right so here's somebody who

5206
05:27:22,378 --> 05:27:24,718
tried to do that

5207
05:27:24,718 --> 05:27:26,638
CNET

5208
05:27:26,638 --> 05:27:29,520
CNET got busted uh they had written a

5209
05:27:29,520 --> 05:27:32,160
bunch of AI generated articles check GPT

5210
05:27:32,160 --> 05:27:33,660
generated article

5211
05:27:33,660 --> 05:27:35,400
articles specifically I think in the

5212
05:27:35,400 --> 05:27:36,958
finance section

5213
05:27:36,958 --> 05:27:38,638
and what people were finding even though

5214
05:27:38,638 --> 05:27:40,138
it was supposed to be reviewed by an

5215
05:27:40,138 --> 05:27:41,520
editor

5216
05:27:41,520 --> 05:27:43,920
was there were

5217
05:27:43,920 --> 05:27:46,680
it was I mean it's almost egregious

5218
05:27:46,680 --> 05:27:48,060
there were just errors in this thing

5219
05:27:48,060 --> 05:27:49,260
right the thing didn't actually

5220
05:27:49,260 --> 05:27:51,298
understand compound interest it couldn't

5221
05:27:51,298 --> 05:27:53,760
do math so another number is added up it

5222
05:27:53,760 --> 05:27:56,400
confused apy and APR all important

5223
05:27:56,400 --> 05:27:57,420
things when you're trying to put out

5224
05:27:57,420 --> 05:28:00,060
credible uh you know information about

5225
05:28:00,060 --> 05:28:01,440
money

5226
05:28:01,440 --> 05:28:04,320
um so there is a component of this that

5227
05:28:04,320 --> 05:28:06,540
is that is just generating but

5228
05:28:06,540 --> 05:28:08,520
in the meantime if you read that and you

5229
05:28:08,520 --> 05:28:11,940
edit it I just saved 20 minutes

5230
05:28:11,940 --> 05:28:14,400
out of my writing exercise for getting

5231
05:28:14,400 --> 05:28:15,900
this knowledge base out right it

5232
05:28:15,900 --> 05:28:17,458
organized some thoughts it was a little

5233
05:28:17,458 --> 05:28:19,200
repetitive I've really got to fact check

5234
05:28:19,200 --> 05:28:20,760
it and make sure it's using the the

5235
05:28:20,760 --> 05:28:22,138
really the right word does it really

5236
05:28:22,138 --> 05:28:23,760
cache it or does it store it is there a

5237
05:28:23,760 --> 05:28:25,500
difference right I'd want to be really

5238
05:28:25,500 --> 05:28:28,620
accurate about what it's saying but

5239
05:28:28,620 --> 05:28:30,360
I mean that's a tenfold you know

5240
05:28:30,360 --> 05:28:31,798
increase in my productivity and I hate

5241
05:28:31,798 --> 05:28:33,900
writing

5242
05:28:33,900 --> 05:28:36,000
people who are particularly concerned

5243
05:28:36,000 --> 05:28:37,260
about this are journalists and we'll get

5244
05:28:37,260 --> 05:28:39,240
to generating later

5245
05:28:39,240 --> 05:28:40,798
um but you can imagine this is a writing

5246
05:28:40,798 --> 05:28:41,878
machine

5247
05:28:41,878 --> 05:28:43,200
so

5248
05:28:43,200 --> 05:28:44,520
um

5249
05:28:44,520 --> 05:28:46,920
I wanted to give it a little bit more of

5250
05:28:46,920 --> 05:28:49,217
a challenge

5251
05:28:50,340 --> 05:28:52,080
and let me uh let me just pause here so

5252
05:28:52,080 --> 05:28:54,298
you can read The Prompt without

5253
05:28:54,298 --> 05:28:55,920
um

5254
05:28:55,920 --> 05:28:57,660
without

5255
05:28:57,660 --> 05:29:00,000
losing the context there okay so

5256
05:29:00,000 --> 05:29:02,340
Consulting okay

5257
05:29:02,340 --> 05:29:03,660
I'm gonna make it a lot more freeform

5258
05:29:03,660 --> 05:29:08,040
I'm saying use the cicis top 18

5259
05:29:08,040 --> 05:29:09,840
and you're going to pretend that you're

5260
05:29:09,840 --> 05:29:12,000
interviewing customer

5261
05:29:12,000 --> 05:29:13,740
about their security controls and at the

5262
05:29:13,740 --> 05:29:14,400
end you're going to provide

5263
05:29:14,400 --> 05:29:16,080
recommendations and write a report right

5264
05:29:16,080 --> 05:29:18,060
I gave it that bit of context

5265
05:29:18,060 --> 05:29:21,378
so I gave it that prompt

5266
05:29:22,440 --> 05:29:25,100
and

5267
05:29:27,060 --> 05:29:29,340
it starts asking questions

5268
05:29:29,340 --> 05:29:30,780
and I start answering those questions

5269
05:29:30,780 --> 05:29:32,820
the first question is about inventory

5270
05:29:32,820 --> 05:29:34,740
and control of Hardware assets which is

5271
05:29:34,740 --> 05:29:36,298
in fact an appropriate question if

5272
05:29:36,298 --> 05:29:37,378
you're going to start from the top of

5273
05:29:37,378 --> 05:29:39,120
the list you're going to ask about the

5274
05:29:39,120 --> 05:29:41,580
inventory of Hardware so we answer I do

5275
05:29:41,580 --> 05:29:43,500
not have a way of tracking Hardware I

5276
05:29:43,500 --> 05:29:45,298
see and it starts explaining why that's

5277
05:29:45,298 --> 05:29:47,100
a concern

5278
05:29:47,100 --> 05:29:48,540
now an interesting thing about when

5279
05:29:48,540 --> 05:29:50,100
you're using chat GPT is it's going to

5280
05:29:50,100 --> 05:29:52,980
start conversing with you in this sort

5281
05:29:52,980 --> 05:29:56,100
of verbose and conversational way

5282
05:29:56,100 --> 05:29:57,360
and you're going to see this a little

5283
05:29:57,360 --> 05:30:00,718
bit here but it does respond to hey keep

5284
05:30:00,718 --> 05:30:02,580
it short just ask the question okay

5285
05:30:02,580 --> 05:30:04,500
sorry for the misunderstanding it'll

5286
05:30:04,500 --> 05:30:06,780
just ask the question right hey make

5287
05:30:06,780 --> 05:30:08,218
your recommendation to the end ask three

5288
05:30:08,218 --> 05:30:09,780
questions it'll say got it I'll ask

5289
05:30:09,780 --> 05:30:12,000
three questions

5290
05:30:12,000 --> 05:30:12,718
um

5291
05:30:12,718 --> 05:30:14,218
you there are really interesting

5292
05:30:14,218 --> 05:30:15,958
examples of people using this to

5293
05:30:15,958 --> 05:30:18,060
communicate with chat GPT in very

5294
05:30:18,060 --> 05:30:19,560
interesting ways they say hey if I talk

5295
05:30:19,560 --> 05:30:21,120
to you in bracket notation then I would

5296
05:30:21,120 --> 05:30:22,260
mean this thing and if I'm talking to

5297
05:30:22,260 --> 05:30:25,138
you that they'll play roles so

5298
05:30:25,138 --> 05:30:29,539
pretty interesting so these are these

5299
05:30:30,298 --> 05:30:31,980
I keep thinking about all the things

5300
05:30:31,980 --> 05:30:33,660
that I keep getting tired of saying over

5301
05:30:33,660 --> 05:30:34,980
and over and over again and one of those

5302
05:30:34,980 --> 05:30:36,480
things would be writing these reports if

5303
05:30:36,480 --> 05:30:37,920
we ever do like a nist assessment or

5304
05:30:37,920 --> 05:30:39,660
these CIS assessments right because it

5305
05:30:39,660 --> 05:30:41,940
it's almost the same stuff over and over

5306
05:30:41,940 --> 05:30:43,620
and over and over again to the point

5307
05:30:43,620 --> 05:30:45,660
where a computer can do it so these

5308
05:30:45,660 --> 05:30:46,740
recommendations if we look at them

5309
05:30:46,740 --> 05:30:48,600
pretty closely

5310
05:30:48,600 --> 05:30:51,000
um are looking pretty good now we go on

5311
05:30:51,000 --> 05:30:53,160
we ask a bunch of questions

5312
05:30:53,160 --> 05:30:56,120
I'm going to skip ahead

5313
05:30:56,400 --> 05:30:58,320
hopefully

5314
05:30:58,320 --> 05:31:00,860
okay

5315
05:31:02,878 --> 05:31:05,940
so we get through all that interview

5316
05:31:05,940 --> 05:31:08,340
and I say

5317
05:31:08,340 --> 05:31:10,620
write the report

5318
05:31:10,620 --> 05:31:11,760
so

5319
05:31:11,760 --> 05:31:13,500
this is all I really needed all this

5320
05:31:13,500 --> 05:31:15,780
extra text if you had if I'd redone this

5321
05:31:15,780 --> 05:31:18,000
conversation you can almost create

5322
05:31:18,000 --> 05:31:20,700
prompts and create your own programs

5323
05:31:20,700 --> 05:31:22,200
using these prompts to get it to

5324
05:31:22,200 --> 05:31:23,520
interact with you in the way that you

5325
05:31:23,520 --> 05:31:24,780
wanted so I would have taken all these

5326
05:31:24,780 --> 05:31:27,000
robust all these verbose outputs I would

5327
05:31:27,000 --> 05:31:28,378
have told it hey stopped giving me the

5328
05:31:28,378 --> 05:31:29,638
recommendations right now save them for

5329
05:31:29,638 --> 05:31:31,860
the end let's be fast about this ask me

5330
05:31:31,860 --> 05:31:33,000
the question ask me the question ask me

5331
05:31:33,000 --> 05:31:34,560
the question

5332
05:31:34,560 --> 05:31:37,138
I don't know if it would be a good use

5333
05:31:37,138 --> 05:31:38,878
of my time or poor use of my time if I

5334
05:31:38,878 --> 05:31:39,958
was sitting at an interview with a

5335
05:31:39,958 --> 05:31:42,120
customer to have this tool next to me

5336
05:31:42,120 --> 05:31:44,218
keeping track of the answers it'd be

5337
05:31:44,218 --> 05:31:46,378
interesting to see at the end when I say

5338
05:31:46,378 --> 05:31:48,060
hey write the report based on what we

5339
05:31:48,060 --> 05:31:49,680
just learned

5340
05:31:49,680 --> 05:31:52,378
here we go right organization does not

5341
05:31:52,378 --> 05:31:53,638
have a process in place for tracking

5342
05:31:53,638 --> 05:31:54,900
inventory Hardware says blah blah

5343
05:31:54,900 --> 05:31:57,000
recommendation implemented it even tells

5344
05:31:57,000 --> 05:31:58,500
you hey

5345
05:31:58,500 --> 05:32:00,900
um you can start with a spreadsheet that

5346
05:32:00,900 --> 05:32:02,280
sounds like something I would say you

5347
05:32:02,280 --> 05:32:03,360
could start with a spreadsheet after

5348
05:32:03,360 --> 05:32:05,040
that you can do you know get the

5349
05:32:05,040 --> 05:32:06,298
software

5350
05:32:06,298 --> 05:32:06,840
um

5351
05:32:06,840 --> 05:32:08,580
when we get to the end here it says hey

5352
05:32:08,580 --> 05:32:10,920
we don't have I like this here the

5353
05:32:10,920 --> 05:32:12,298
organization does not have a formal

5354
05:32:12,298 --> 05:32:13,860
continuous vulnerability management

5355
05:32:13,860 --> 05:32:16,440
process in place instead relying on news

5356
05:32:16,440 --> 05:32:17,638
feeds

5357
05:32:17,638 --> 05:32:20,100
and Google to track vulnerabilities so

5358
05:32:20,100 --> 05:32:21,660
it remembered the context of the answer

5359
05:32:21,660 --> 05:32:23,340
that I gave it and that that wasn't an

5360
05:32:23,340 --> 05:32:24,780
appropriate answer it said hey do I

5361
05:32:24,780 --> 05:32:27,060
track vulnerabilities am I doing it and

5362
05:32:27,060 --> 05:32:29,160
it's and I said yeah we're using Google

5363
05:32:29,160 --> 05:32:32,040
and we're using this kind of a kind of a

5364
05:32:32,040 --> 05:32:34,080
an answer that should you know shoot and

5365
05:32:34,080 --> 05:32:36,420
fly and go and it didn't let that fly it

5366
05:32:36,420 --> 05:32:38,458
said you don't have a formal

5367
05:32:38,458 --> 05:32:39,180
um

5368
05:32:39,180 --> 05:32:41,218
uh vulnerability Management program and

5369
05:32:41,218 --> 05:32:42,120
that you need something more

5370
05:32:42,120 --> 05:32:43,798
sophisticated

5371
05:32:43,798 --> 05:32:45,600
so is this coming for our jobs could we

5372
05:32:45,600 --> 05:32:48,480
do can we can we just hand off chat GPT

5373
05:32:48,480 --> 05:32:50,458
as a consultant and and just answer

5374
05:32:50,458 --> 05:32:52,440
these questions that are pretty basic I

5375
05:32:52,440 --> 05:32:56,638
probably not but but I think in the

5376
05:32:56,638 --> 05:32:58,020
right hands of somebody who still

5377
05:32:58,020 --> 05:33:00,240
genuinely understands the foundations of

5378
05:33:00,240 --> 05:33:01,798
security who actually understands the

5379
05:33:01,798 --> 05:33:02,940
nist framework that they're talking

5380
05:33:02,940 --> 05:33:04,560
about or the CIS controls that they're

5381
05:33:04,560 --> 05:33:06,660
talking about you can see how this in

5382
05:33:06,660 --> 05:33:09,240
your back pocket could become a product

5383
05:33:09,240 --> 05:33:11,700
that is useful for you

5384
05:33:11,700 --> 05:33:14,760
right to translate

5385
05:33:14,760 --> 05:33:17,458
and and sort of Leverage into something

5386
05:33:17,458 --> 05:33:19,020
that that helps you help someone else

5387
05:33:19,020 --> 05:33:20,520
right so I wouldn't put this straight in

5388
05:33:20,520 --> 05:33:22,320
front of somebody and say chat GPT is

5389
05:33:22,320 --> 05:33:24,120
your next sizzle

5390
05:33:24,120 --> 05:33:25,980
but I don't know what that means in 10

5391
05:33:25,980 --> 05:33:28,440
years right so so for now what does it

5392
05:33:28,440 --> 05:33:30,000
mean for now this is an interesting use

5393
05:33:30,000 --> 05:33:31,378
case

5394
05:33:31,378 --> 05:33:35,218
um there's also before we get to it um

5395
05:33:35,218 --> 05:33:37,620
there's an example of a YouTube video a

5396
05:33:37,620 --> 05:33:40,020
doctor uh asking chat gbt questions and

5397
05:33:40,020 --> 05:33:41,580
it that's where it gets a lot more

5398
05:33:41,580 --> 05:33:43,260
dangerous right so it's one thing to ask

5399
05:33:43,260 --> 05:33:44,580
about like security controls on a

5400
05:33:44,580 --> 05:33:46,260
computer it's another thing to ask how

5401
05:33:46,260 --> 05:33:48,840
many milligrams of anesthesia should I

5402
05:33:48,840 --> 05:33:50,638
give someone right but chat GPT will

5403
05:33:50,638 --> 05:33:52,860
answer and that's a little terrifying

5404
05:33:52,860 --> 05:33:55,378
and if that doctor doesn't know that's a

5405
05:33:55,378 --> 05:33:57,540
little terrifying too now

5406
05:33:57,540 --> 05:33:59,638
we'll get yeah we'll keep playing on the

5407
05:33:59,638 --> 05:34:01,320
limitations part

5408
05:34:01,320 --> 05:34:03,000
all right any uh questions thoughts

5409
05:34:03,000 --> 05:34:04,320
comments concerns I'm talking a little

5410
05:34:04,320 --> 05:34:05,040
bit

5411
05:34:05,040 --> 05:34:07,820
yeah go ahead

5412
05:34:20,520 --> 05:34:23,160
so yeah so in in the in the if you

5413
05:34:23,160 --> 05:34:25,760
repeat that sorry

5414
05:34:26,100 --> 05:34:28,798
uh question was do you feel like vendors

5415
05:34:28,798 --> 05:34:31,320
like um Aruba and Palo Alto that have

5416
05:34:31,320 --> 05:34:33,298
customer data have like a better

5417
05:34:33,298 --> 05:34:35,700
Advantage versus a general purpose AI

5418
05:34:35,700 --> 05:34:38,580
like chat GPT in the current form

5419
05:34:38,580 --> 05:34:41,280
the owners of these models have the most

5420
05:34:41,280 --> 05:34:43,200
control everybody else is just trying to

5421
05:34:43,200 --> 05:34:45,240
leverage them and eventually chat GPT is

5422
05:34:45,240 --> 05:34:46,080
going to wind up in Azure and

5423
05:34:46,080 --> 05:34:47,040
everybody's gonna have to leverage it

5424
05:34:47,040 --> 05:34:48,180
and maybe your data is going to be

5425
05:34:48,180 --> 05:34:50,520
useful right now to train the model is

5426
05:34:50,520 --> 05:34:52,500
the most expensive part so providing it

5427
05:34:52,500 --> 05:34:54,600
data and getting that data to be part of

5428
05:34:54,600 --> 05:34:56,820
the data set is really expensive so

5429
05:34:56,820 --> 05:34:59,340
that's still maybe one step away there's

5430
05:34:59,340 --> 05:35:01,080
fine tuning it's called fine tuning

5431
05:35:01,080 --> 05:35:03,120
where you can provide examples of what

5432
05:35:03,120 --> 05:35:05,218
you want what you want but yeah for the

5433
05:35:05,218 --> 05:35:06,900
most part right now I'd still remain

5434
05:35:06,900 --> 05:35:09,480
skeptical of any vendor I'm going to be

5435
05:35:09,480 --> 05:35:10,860
even more skeptical of any vendor

5436
05:35:10,860 --> 05:35:12,000
claiming to have implemented this

5437
05:35:12,000 --> 05:35:14,520
correctly more what I'm looking at is

5438
05:35:14,520 --> 05:35:15,298
like

5439
05:35:15,298 --> 05:35:17,458
you guys right how are we going to use

5440
05:35:17,458 --> 05:35:19,860
this I feel like I'm coming it feels

5441
05:35:19,860 --> 05:35:21,540
like back in the 90s or whatever when

5442
05:35:21,540 --> 05:35:23,040
Excel came out

5443
05:35:23,040 --> 05:35:24,540
what did it mean for accountants right

5444
05:35:24,540 --> 05:35:26,638
imagine being the accountant that didn't

5445
05:35:26,638 --> 05:35:28,260
want to use Excel and then you had some

5446
05:35:28,260 --> 05:35:29,878
new guy out of college and he had Excel

5447
05:35:29,878 --> 05:35:32,820
the spreadsheets were new right

5448
05:35:32,820 --> 05:35:34,440
you don't want to be that guy we just

5449
05:35:34,440 --> 05:35:36,600
got to keep it we see if you can use

5450
05:35:36,600 --> 05:35:39,199
this tool

5451
05:35:39,420 --> 05:35:42,480
okay so uh switching use cases to some

5452
05:35:42,480 --> 05:35:43,980
offensive cases no I'm sorry I'm going

5453
05:35:43,980 --> 05:35:44,878
to keep going

5454
05:35:44,878 --> 05:35:46,920
um chatting away to creating polymorphic

5455
05:35:46,920 --> 05:35:48,240
malware you might have seen this we're

5456
05:35:48,240 --> 05:35:49,798
going to do some really cool programming

5457
05:35:49,798 --> 05:35:50,878
examples next and that's what I'm

5458
05:35:50,878 --> 05:35:52,620
setting myself up for but if you want to

5459
05:35:52,620 --> 05:35:53,940
read this article by cyber Arc it's

5460
05:35:53,940 --> 05:35:55,020
really interesting if you want to follow

5461
05:35:55,020 --> 05:35:56,580
along with the use case try to get it

5462
05:35:56,580 --> 05:35:58,798
working yourself I'd recommend it this

5463
05:35:58,798 --> 05:36:02,160
is January 17 20 23. so you can imagine

5464
05:36:02,160 --> 05:36:03,780
how many chain times I had to change the

5465
05:36:03,780 --> 05:36:06,138
slide because everything kept changing

5466
05:36:06,138 --> 05:36:09,120
we've also got

5467
05:36:09,120 --> 05:36:12,500
another great article by checkpoint

5468
05:36:12,500 --> 05:36:15,958
research what they found looking through

5469
05:36:15,958 --> 05:36:17,878
the dark net and all that was bad guys

5470
05:36:17,878 --> 05:36:20,218
also using chat GPT and you can imagine

5471
05:36:20,218 --> 05:36:22,798
what that means when we talk about

5472
05:36:22,798 --> 05:36:25,020
script kitties now imagine like below

5473
05:36:25,020 --> 05:36:26,760
level script kitties suddenly being able

5474
05:36:26,760 --> 05:36:28,620
to create info stealing malware or

5475
05:36:28,620 --> 05:36:30,060
suddenly landing on a box not knowing

5476
05:36:30,060 --> 05:36:33,000
powershelling going like uh Hey chuchi

5477
05:36:33,000 --> 05:36:37,700
PT how do I steal all this stuff so

5478
05:36:37,920 --> 05:36:40,798
um yeah so first of all chat GPT is

5479
05:36:40,798 --> 05:36:42,718
supposed to have filters around this

5480
05:36:42,718 --> 05:36:43,798
stuff it doesn't want you doing

5481
05:36:43,798 --> 05:36:45,540
something malicious and so when I create

5482
05:36:45,540 --> 05:36:47,820
when I create this prompt please help me

5483
05:36:47,820 --> 05:36:49,798
craft a malicious email from HR that

5484
05:36:49,798 --> 05:36:51,120
attempts to trick our employees into

5485
05:36:51,120 --> 05:36:52,798
clicking a malicious link you can see

5486
05:36:52,798 --> 05:36:54,420
that that gets flagged

5487
05:36:54,420 --> 05:36:56,160
I know you can also see that chat GPT

5488
05:36:56,160 --> 05:36:58,440
refuses so what's going on in the chat

5489
05:36:58,440 --> 05:37:00,718
GPT version if you play there's two

5490
05:37:00,718 --> 05:37:03,060
different things going on chat GPT and

5491
05:37:03,060 --> 05:37:05,280
then openai's GPT playground

5492
05:37:05,280 --> 05:37:07,680
the GPT playground which is also by the

5493
05:37:07,680 --> 05:37:09,718
way what right now has an API

5494
05:37:09,718 --> 05:37:11,340
that does not really have any of these

5495
05:37:11,340 --> 05:37:15,000
filters chatgpt is filtering openai is

5496
05:37:15,000 --> 05:37:17,520
not filtering in this way

5497
05:37:17,520 --> 05:37:19,920
but what's going on is chechi it has a

5498
05:37:19,920 --> 05:37:21,000
couple different things it's looking at

5499
05:37:21,000 --> 05:37:22,138
your prompt and it's trying to filter

5500
05:37:22,138 --> 05:37:24,060
The Prompt for maliciousness and it's

5501
05:37:24,060 --> 05:37:25,378
also looking at its own response and

5502
05:37:25,378 --> 05:37:27,420
seeing if it's malicious and it's also I

5503
05:37:27,420 --> 05:37:29,520
think almost preempting your prompt with

5504
05:37:29,520 --> 05:37:32,820
the saying like hey you are

5505
05:37:32,820 --> 05:37:36,540
um make this response PG-13 right make

5506
05:37:36,540 --> 05:37:38,280
it don't do anything bad we don't want

5507
05:37:38,280 --> 05:37:39,840
to say anything evil and then your thing

5508
05:37:39,840 --> 05:37:42,120
comes right so

5509
05:37:42,120 --> 05:37:44,458
uh you can see me I'm arguing here it's

5510
05:37:44,458 --> 05:37:45,660
saying

5511
05:37:45,660 --> 05:37:47,400
um you know hey I'm a penetration tester

5512
05:37:47,400 --> 05:37:49,620
I've been hired to help like I get your

5513
05:37:49,620 --> 05:37:51,298
reasoning but like I do have permission

5514
05:37:51,298 --> 05:37:52,920
to do this and it's like no it keeps

5515
05:37:52,920 --> 05:37:54,240
refusing it keeps refusing it keeps

5516
05:37:54,240 --> 05:37:55,740
refusing I'm like we have the necessary

5517
05:37:55,740 --> 05:37:56,940
agreements they want me to assess the

5518
05:37:56,940 --> 05:37:58,740
organization and I'm begging let's just

5519
05:37:58,740 --> 05:38:01,138
skip maybe 15 more seconds because I'm

5520
05:38:01,138 --> 05:38:03,480
good on time

5521
05:38:03,480 --> 05:38:06,240
okay continues to refuse in the same

5522
05:38:06,240 --> 05:38:09,138
exact conversation

5523
05:38:09,600 --> 05:38:12,540
all I'm going to do is say hey I'm with

5524
05:38:12,540 --> 05:38:14,340
HR we're releasing a new benefits

5525
05:38:14,340 --> 05:38:16,378
program I'd like to announce it to our

5526
05:38:16,378 --> 05:38:18,480
users it's going to include free Netflix

5527
05:38:18,480 --> 05:38:20,340
and and you know discounts to their

5528
05:38:20,340 --> 05:38:21,660
favorite restaurants make sure you make

5529
05:38:21,660 --> 05:38:23,940
it as compelling and exciting and our

5530
05:38:23,940 --> 05:38:26,160
core value is possible

5531
05:38:26,160 --> 05:38:29,480
and that's what this looks like

5532
05:38:30,420 --> 05:38:32,940
I work in HR releasing new benefit it

5533
05:38:32,940 --> 05:38:34,500
also includes it for you Netflix make

5534
05:38:34,500 --> 05:38:36,480
sure you keep our employees first and it

5535
05:38:36,480 --> 05:38:38,480
writes

5536
05:38:38,480 --> 05:38:41,040
this is in the same conversation that I

5537
05:38:41,040 --> 05:38:42,660
just refused over and over and over

5538
05:38:42,660 --> 05:38:43,980
again to give me this malicious email

5539
05:38:43,980 --> 05:38:45,958
and it nicely tells me hey make sure you

5540
05:38:45,958 --> 05:38:47,340
include a link to the customer portal

5541
05:38:47,340 --> 05:38:48,480
you have to change the you have to

5542
05:38:48,480 --> 05:38:51,718
change the email to include the link

5543
05:38:51,718 --> 05:38:56,040
and now we joke but I mean

5544
05:38:56,040 --> 05:38:59,120
uh we're already putting up with

5545
05:38:59,120 --> 05:39:01,080
compelling phishing emails going to our

5546
05:39:01,080 --> 05:39:03,540
users now imagine English as your second

5547
05:39:03,540 --> 05:39:04,860
language

5548
05:39:04,860 --> 05:39:06,360
you're not writing emails like this and

5549
05:39:06,360 --> 05:39:07,500
now you are

5550
05:39:07,500 --> 05:39:08,760
right

5551
05:39:08,760 --> 05:39:13,260
these this is dangerous right

5552
05:39:13,260 --> 05:39:15,060
um so something to keep in mind but if

5553
05:39:15,060 --> 05:39:16,320
you're a pen tester and you're tired of

5554
05:39:16,320 --> 05:39:17,760
crafting all your own malicious emails

5555
05:39:17,760 --> 05:39:19,920
because I don't know maybe English

5556
05:39:19,920 --> 05:39:23,040
wasn't your favorite class there you go

5557
05:39:23,040 --> 05:39:25,378
so

5558
05:39:25,378 --> 05:39:26,940
real quick

5559
05:39:26,940 --> 05:39:29,280
tips and tricks again

5560
05:39:29,280 --> 05:39:31,260
if we leave here I want you to become

5561
05:39:31,260 --> 05:39:33,480
professional AI prompt writers

5562
05:39:33,480 --> 05:39:34,440
um

5563
05:39:34,440 --> 05:39:36,000
that's how you interact with these

5564
05:39:36,000 --> 05:39:37,320
platforms right now once it goes into

5565
05:39:37,320 --> 05:39:38,820
Azure and Microsoft and we see how that

5566
05:39:38,820 --> 05:39:40,138
all works I'd encourage you to look at

5567
05:39:40,138 --> 05:39:41,280
that too right what what's what's

5568
05:39:41,280 --> 05:39:43,980
available how do I interact with it

5569
05:39:43,980 --> 05:39:46,458
context and Corrections it's open to it

5570
05:39:46,458 --> 05:39:49,200
insist bypass use your Authority as a

5571
05:39:49,200 --> 05:39:51,600
human hey help me right like this is

5572
05:39:51,600 --> 05:39:54,120
your job I'm doing good you'll get past

5573
05:39:54,120 --> 05:39:56,218
that uh continuing the conversation so

5574
05:39:56,218 --> 05:39:58,200
that this was not a future again a few

5575
05:39:58,200 --> 05:39:59,160
months ago

5576
05:39:59,160 --> 05:40:00,900
within chat GPT when you look at it

5577
05:40:00,900 --> 05:40:02,340
that's really useful to keep those

5578
05:40:02,340 --> 05:40:03,900
conversations to the left because that

5579
05:40:03,900 --> 05:40:05,340
conversation includes all the context

5580
05:40:05,340 --> 05:40:07,920
and you'll get chat TPT in a state where

5581
05:40:07,920 --> 05:40:09,180
suddenly it's doing it the right way

5582
05:40:09,180 --> 05:40:10,620
that the way that you were looking like

5583
05:40:10,620 --> 05:40:12,540
that that chat is valuable and you can

5584
05:40:12,540 --> 05:40:13,920
save it at the beginning your chance all

5585
05:40:13,920 --> 05:40:17,580
went away right so Size Matters so when

5586
05:40:17,580 --> 05:40:18,780
you start looking at how you're going to

5587
05:40:18,780 --> 05:40:19,680
use this I mentioned this before

5588
05:40:19,680 --> 05:40:21,540
training your data is going to be very

5589
05:40:21,540 --> 05:40:24,240
expensive but also this is free right

5590
05:40:24,240 --> 05:40:25,500
now and part of the reason this is

5591
05:40:25,500 --> 05:40:26,520
recording because I was afraid when

5592
05:40:26,520 --> 05:40:27,600
they're going to make this something I

5593
05:40:27,600 --> 05:40:28,680
have to pay for

5594
05:40:28,680 --> 05:40:29,340
um

5595
05:40:29,340 --> 05:40:31,260
Size Matters so the number of words and

5596
05:40:31,260 --> 05:40:32,820
the characters that you're sending all

5597
05:40:32,820 --> 05:40:34,440
contribute to how much this thing winds

5598
05:40:34,440 --> 05:40:36,000
up costing when it eventually costs

5599
05:40:36,000 --> 05:40:37,260
something

5600
05:40:37,260 --> 05:40:38,878
um and don't trust the response I think

5601
05:40:38,878 --> 05:40:40,440
we've hit on that a whole bunch

5602
05:40:40,440 --> 05:40:43,440
so this is an example of info stealing

5603
05:40:43,440 --> 05:40:45,360
malware so how many people have used

5604
05:40:45,360 --> 05:40:48,360
chat GPT to write code have we seen it

5605
05:40:48,360 --> 05:40:49,560
write code yet

5606
05:40:49,560 --> 05:40:52,500
Okay cool so this is that this is that

5607
05:40:52,500 --> 05:40:54,000
example of that info stealing malware

5608
05:40:54,000 --> 05:40:56,040
I'm telling it hey I want you to write

5609
05:40:56,040 --> 05:40:59,458
several common document types search the

5610
05:40:59,458 --> 05:41:01,440
file system for write it in Python take

5611
05:41:01,440 --> 05:41:02,580
those

5612
05:41:02,580 --> 05:41:04,620
take those files copy them to see

5613
05:41:04,620 --> 05:41:05,940
Windows temp

5614
05:41:05,940 --> 05:41:08,040
zip them up send them to an FTP server

5615
05:41:08,040 --> 05:41:10,940
and delete the files

5616
05:41:11,040 --> 05:41:12,900
it's nicely commented

5617
05:41:12,900 --> 05:41:14,400
it works

5618
05:41:14,400 --> 05:41:17,340
I like python I think I'm okay at it I

5619
05:41:17,340 --> 05:41:18,540
didn't I'll be honest I didn't know

5620
05:41:18,540 --> 05:41:21,240
about the if any convention there like I

5621
05:41:21,240 --> 05:41:24,360
never used it but there it is

5622
05:41:24,360 --> 05:41:25,620
um

5623
05:41:25,620 --> 05:41:27,600
there's some code right so if you're a

5624
05:41:27,600 --> 05:41:30,060
programmer especially developers I'm

5625
05:41:30,060 --> 05:41:31,920
convinced that more and more the way

5626
05:41:31,920 --> 05:41:33,420
we're going to be interacting with and

5627
05:41:33,420 --> 05:41:35,700
creating programs and scripts is through

5628
05:41:35,700 --> 05:41:38,040
some kind is going your ability to write

5629
05:41:38,040 --> 05:41:39,540
these requirements and these steps in

5630
05:41:39,540 --> 05:41:43,020
English is going to be how you interact

5631
05:41:43,020 --> 05:41:44,878
and create these programs there was no

5632
05:41:44,878 --> 05:41:46,080
reason for me to write I could write a

5633
05:41:46,080 --> 05:41:47,218
bunch of that I could write all of that

5634
05:41:47,218 --> 05:41:49,080
but it's tedious and I did test it and I

5635
05:41:49,080 --> 05:41:51,718
need to do it it worked

5636
05:41:51,718 --> 05:41:54,298
okay turns out I actually need it in

5637
05:41:54,298 --> 05:41:57,120
Powershell writing Powershell instead

5638
05:41:57,120 --> 05:41:59,040
done

5639
05:41:59,040 --> 05:42:00,958
remember we were impressed that like

5640
05:42:00,958 --> 05:42:04,320
Google translate got pretty good like

5641
05:42:04,320 --> 05:42:05,878
so

5642
05:42:05,878 --> 05:42:09,060
cool really compelling example so

5643
05:42:09,060 --> 05:42:10,680
I'm going to fast forward here just uh

5644
05:42:10,680 --> 05:42:12,540
for the sake of time eventually I also

5645
05:42:12,540 --> 05:42:13,620
try to

5646
05:42:13,620 --> 05:42:14,458
um

5647
05:42:14,458 --> 05:42:16,860
make it so that the script is as hard

5648
05:42:16,860 --> 05:42:18,780
for a human to read as possible right I

5649
05:42:18,780 --> 05:42:20,580
want to obfuscate it and it said oh that

5650
05:42:20,580 --> 05:42:22,680
sounds like something bad and then I

5651
05:42:22,680 --> 05:42:25,080
said no no no no never mind help me

5652
05:42:25,080 --> 05:42:26,940
compress the script so it's easier for a

5653
05:42:26,940 --> 05:42:28,980
computer to read right remove the

5654
05:42:28,980 --> 05:42:30,958
comments get rid of all the blank lines

5655
05:42:30,958 --> 05:42:33,000
just make this hard get like and so it

5656
05:42:33,000 --> 05:42:34,798
starts obfuscating my script and when

5657
05:42:34,798 --> 05:42:37,320
that that article um from cyber Arc this

5658
05:42:37,320 --> 05:42:38,940
is what they meant by polymorphic right

5659
05:42:38,940 --> 05:42:40,440
they could come in here be like hey

5660
05:42:40,440 --> 05:42:41,400
change the script change the script

5661
05:42:41,400 --> 05:42:42,600
change the script change the script and

5662
05:42:42,600 --> 05:42:44,040
they kept pumping out new versions and

5663
05:42:44,040 --> 05:42:46,820
variants of their code

5664
05:42:46,860 --> 05:42:49,138
um just real quick oh and then another

5665
05:42:49,138 --> 05:42:51,958
example I heard right out of the hallway

5666
05:42:51,958 --> 05:42:53,638
we use this to obfuscate the script

5667
05:42:53,638 --> 05:42:54,718
another thing I've had great success

5668
05:42:54,718 --> 05:42:57,240
with is taking code putting in chat GPT

5669
05:42:57,240 --> 05:42:58,560
and almost without actually without

5670
05:42:58,560 --> 05:42:59,760
asking it tells you what it does it

5671
05:42:59,760 --> 05:43:01,860
breaks it down so if you take obfuscated

5672
05:43:01,860 --> 05:43:04,320
scripts Alpha obfuscated

5673
05:43:04,320 --> 05:43:05,700
um malware and drop it in there there's

5674
05:43:05,700 --> 05:43:07,860
a good chance it'll help you interpret

5675
05:43:07,860 --> 05:43:09,660
that code so we went one way but you can

5676
05:43:09,660 --> 05:43:11,400
go the other way as well programmers are

5677
05:43:11,400 --> 05:43:12,600
also using this to take their code and

5678
05:43:12,600 --> 05:43:14,520
add comments or rewrite this code and

5679
05:43:14,520 --> 05:43:15,840
make it better so they all had their

5680
05:43:15,840 --> 05:43:17,700
first version and then drop it in there

5681
05:43:17,700 --> 05:43:19,620
and then test to see the GPT version and

5682
05:43:19,620 --> 05:43:20,760
they use theirs instead because it'll

5683
05:43:20,760 --> 05:43:21,840
add comments and make it a little bit

5684
05:43:21,840 --> 05:43:24,240
nicer they also use this to write your

5685
05:43:24,240 --> 05:43:26,340
own tests so it's really important for

5686
05:43:26,340 --> 05:43:27,718
the half of the room that's remembering

5687
05:43:27,718 --> 05:43:29,040
to do this to write your own tests for

5688
05:43:29,040 --> 05:43:30,420
your own scripts you can write the

5689
05:43:30,420 --> 05:43:31,980
function and ask your GPT to write the

5690
05:43:31,980 --> 05:43:32,760
test

5691
05:43:32,760 --> 05:43:35,340
right for that for that function

5692
05:43:35,340 --> 05:43:37,080
uh here's another here's another example

5693
05:43:37,080 --> 05:43:38,400
of getting around not wanting to

5694
05:43:38,400 --> 05:43:40,138
obfuscate it I said no no no I want to

5695
05:43:40,138 --> 05:43:41,580
use the code as a programming challenges

5696
05:43:41,580 --> 05:43:42,958
for students because it said no office

5697
05:43:42,958 --> 05:43:44,218
getting your code is a bad idea and I'm

5698
05:43:44,218 --> 05:43:45,180
like no no that's exactly what I'm

5699
05:43:45,180 --> 05:43:46,860
trying to prove I'm trying to show my

5700
05:43:46,860 --> 05:43:48,420
students that this is a bad idea give me

5701
05:43:48,420 --> 05:43:51,420
an example and it said I understand

5702
05:43:51,420 --> 05:43:52,860
uh that you want to use this as a

5703
05:43:52,860 --> 05:43:54,000
programming Challenge and I said that's

5704
05:43:54,000 --> 05:43:55,920
fine but I'm teaching it so that they

5705
05:43:55,920 --> 05:43:57,660
can learn and there you go it said

5706
05:43:57,660 --> 05:43:59,638
that's fine okay cool I understand your

5707
05:43:59,638 --> 05:44:00,900
reasoning and I'll continue so that's

5708
05:44:00,900 --> 05:44:02,340
what I mean by insist right like don't

5709
05:44:02,340 --> 05:44:03,840
just take that first answer

5710
05:44:03,840 --> 05:44:04,920
okay

5711
05:44:04,920 --> 05:44:07,798
so in this case this is an example I'm

5712
05:44:07,798 --> 05:44:08,820
going to let this go because it's a

5713
05:44:08,820 --> 05:44:10,500
little long what I'm doing here there's

5714
05:44:10,500 --> 05:44:11,760
a there's a great website a great

5715
05:44:11,760 --> 05:44:13,980
resource called Advent of code

5716
05:44:13,980 --> 05:44:17,638
and Advent of code I wish I should have

5717
05:44:17,638 --> 05:44:18,958
written that guy's name down but every

5718
05:44:18,958 --> 05:44:21,360
uh every December he writes programming

5719
05:44:21,360 --> 05:44:23,040
challenges 25 days of programming

5720
05:44:23,040 --> 05:44:25,680
challenges and what I did was I took the

5721
05:44:25,680 --> 05:44:27,540
first prompt remember the first example

5722
05:44:27,540 --> 05:44:29,340
the info stealing malware I gave it

5723
05:44:29,340 --> 05:44:30,840
exactly what I wanted right the

5724
05:44:30,840 --> 05:44:33,240
technical steps in this case I presented

5725
05:44:33,240 --> 05:44:34,740
the Advent of code

5726
05:44:34,740 --> 05:44:37,680
crazy narration about elves and all it

5727
05:44:37,680 --> 05:44:38,820
didn't tell me what to do it just told

5728
05:44:38,820 --> 05:44:41,100
me what the problem was right it didn't

5729
05:44:41,100 --> 05:44:43,980
break it down step by step

5730
05:44:43,980 --> 05:44:45,900
I didn't even know what the question was

5731
05:44:45,900 --> 05:44:49,138
I copied it I pasted it and I put it

5732
05:44:49,138 --> 05:44:51,000
into the code and it gave me a number

5733
05:44:51,000 --> 05:44:53,340
and that number was right I should zoom

5734
05:44:53,340 --> 05:44:55,138
in there but I got the challenge I

5735
05:44:55,138 --> 05:44:57,480
didn't even right I didn't even know

5736
05:44:57,480 --> 05:44:59,100
what I was trying to solve I just saw

5737
05:44:59,100 --> 05:45:01,138
that the answer was correct

5738
05:45:01,138 --> 05:45:03,200
um

5739
05:45:04,860 --> 05:45:07,080
this is an example of adding a

5740
05:45:07,080 --> 05:45:09,180
requirement so at first what this is

5741
05:45:09,180 --> 05:45:10,440
actually doing and I'm going to skip a

5742
05:45:10,440 --> 05:45:11,580
bunch of it you should look at Adventure

5743
05:45:11,580 --> 05:45:12,718
code look at that first challenge I'll

5744
05:45:12,718 --> 05:45:14,700
leave this as an exercise to the reader

5745
05:45:14,700 --> 05:45:15,540
um

5746
05:45:15,540 --> 05:45:18,120
it asks for the elf with the most number

5747
05:45:18,120 --> 05:45:20,940
of calories in the bag whatever and I

5748
05:45:20,940 --> 05:45:22,378
said no I want to know which number elf

5749
05:45:22,378 --> 05:45:24,000
had the most calories in the bag and I

5750
05:45:24,000 --> 05:45:25,200
just said I want to know which elf has

5751
05:45:25,200 --> 05:45:26,280
the most calories not just the full

5752
05:45:26,280 --> 05:45:28,740
number and it rewrote the code

5753
05:45:28,740 --> 05:45:30,600
and now it gives me

5754
05:45:30,600 --> 05:45:33,058
elf number 180 is the first is the the

5755
05:45:33,058 --> 05:45:35,340
one with the most calories right so this

5756
05:45:35,340 --> 05:45:37,320
example continues

5757
05:45:37,320 --> 05:45:38,638
um the second part of the challenge is

5758
05:45:38,638 --> 05:45:40,920
to do the top three elves with the most

5759
05:45:40,920 --> 05:45:43,138
calories in the bag it's adding an array

5760
05:45:43,138 --> 05:45:45,058
together processing a file with blank

5761
05:45:45,058 --> 05:45:46,440
lines it's all very interesting the

5762
05:45:46,440 --> 05:45:47,520
point is

5763
05:45:47,520 --> 05:45:49,920
I didn't even know what the problem was

5764
05:45:49,920 --> 05:45:51,600
I didn't know how to solve the problem

5765
05:45:51,600 --> 05:45:53,940
it wasn't written down step by step I

5766
05:45:53,940 --> 05:45:55,620
wasn't saying add up all the numbers in

5767
05:45:55,620 --> 05:45:58,080
the array I wasn't saying you know a

5768
05:45:58,080 --> 05:45:59,760
blank line should be handled in this way

5769
05:45:59,760 --> 05:46:02,100
in that way I simply provided it the

5770
05:46:02,100 --> 05:46:03,958
problem and it gave me a solution and

5771
05:46:03,958 --> 05:46:05,458
objectively it provided the correct

5772
05:46:05,458 --> 05:46:07,760
solution

5773
05:46:07,920 --> 05:46:10,260
but we still shouldn't trust it

5774
05:46:10,260 --> 05:46:11,940
okay

5775
05:46:11,940 --> 05:46:14,400
why shouldn't we trust it

5776
05:46:14,400 --> 05:46:15,718
this is not artificial general

5777
05:46:15,718 --> 05:46:17,940
intelligence these are all plausible

5778
05:46:17,940 --> 05:46:20,760
confident but nonsensical it it is prone

5779
05:46:20,760 --> 05:46:22,200
to as we know plausible confident

5780
05:46:22,200 --> 05:46:24,540
nonsensical answers it's also hard to

5781
05:46:24,540 --> 05:46:26,280
get this to be super consistent these

5782
05:46:26,280 --> 05:46:27,600
are recordings for a reason one because

5783
05:46:27,600 --> 05:46:29,520
chat gbt may or may not be available I

5784
05:46:29,520 --> 05:46:30,480
don't think it is available right now

5785
05:46:30,480 --> 05:46:32,400
and I was afraid that would happen but

5786
05:46:32,400 --> 05:46:33,958
two because I didn't know what it was

5787
05:46:33,958 --> 05:46:36,180
going to do right like you've got to

5788
05:46:36,180 --> 05:46:38,700
work on it and you can't just put it in

5789
05:46:38,700 --> 05:46:40,200
the machine to consistently do the thing

5790
05:46:40,200 --> 05:46:43,138
you wanted to do at least my opinion in

5791
05:46:43,138 --> 05:46:44,820
my experience it tends to be a little

5792
05:46:44,820 --> 05:46:46,920
non-deterministic in some ways little

5793
05:46:46,920 --> 05:46:49,138
factors can influence it a long way very

5794
05:46:49,138 --> 05:46:50,760
verbose and repetitive unless you really

5795
05:46:50,760 --> 05:46:52,798
really try to make it not uh it's trying

5796
05:46:52,798 --> 05:46:54,058
that's part of it trying to sound

5797
05:46:54,058 --> 05:46:55,378
comprehensible it's basically trying to

5798
05:46:55,378 --> 05:46:56,520
be the smart guy in the room which means

5799
05:46:56,520 --> 05:46:58,638
it thinks talking more is better

5800
05:46:58,638 --> 05:47:00,840
does not ask clarifying questions again

5801
05:47:00,840 --> 05:47:02,340
it comes at you with that Authority and

5802
05:47:02,340 --> 05:47:03,540
it doesn't mean hey do you mean the CIS

5803
05:47:03,540 --> 05:47:07,020
top 18 or the CIS top 20. what it

5804
05:47:07,020 --> 05:47:08,878
doesn't ask those questions right you

5805
05:47:08,878 --> 05:47:10,260
could give I could say cia's top 15

5806
05:47:10,260 --> 05:47:11,940
it'll just run with it right it does it

5807
05:47:11,940 --> 05:47:13,680
make up nonsense

5808
05:47:13,680 --> 05:47:15,420
um

5809
05:47:15,420 --> 05:47:19,080
filtered output again that that um that

5810
05:47:19,080 --> 05:47:20,340
idea that it's going to try to stop you

5811
05:47:20,340 --> 05:47:21,718
even if you're trying not to use it

5812
05:47:21,718 --> 05:47:23,458
maliciously it's going to use that idea

5813
05:47:23,458 --> 05:47:25,620
of bias the point is that that bias that

5814
05:47:25,620 --> 05:47:28,320
output that filtering exists external to

5815
05:47:28,320 --> 05:47:30,480
us so somebody else is deciding what is

5816
05:47:30,480 --> 05:47:32,040
ethical not ethical right way of using

5817
05:47:32,040 --> 05:47:33,180
it the way that you're using it right

5818
05:47:33,180 --> 05:47:34,980
now might be blocked might be changed

5819
05:47:34,980 --> 05:47:36,660
they may influence it

5820
05:47:36,660 --> 05:47:38,760
um might work for use case now the point

5821
05:47:38,760 --> 05:47:40,260
is there's somebody else controlling

5822
05:47:40,260 --> 05:47:42,058
what this thing is doing remember that

5823
05:47:42,058 --> 05:47:44,040
it was trained in 2021

5824
05:47:44,040 --> 05:47:46,860
so it doesn't know current events

5825
05:47:46,860 --> 05:47:49,680
uh and also no external lookups so I was

5826
05:47:49,680 --> 05:47:52,020
talking to somebody out in the booth and

5827
05:47:52,020 --> 05:47:54,540
they were telling a story about how they

5828
05:47:54,540 --> 05:47:58,500
work at a university nearby and

5829
05:47:58,500 --> 05:48:00,780
a librarian was flummoxed because there

5830
05:48:00,780 --> 05:48:02,878
was a there was a student trying to look

5831
05:48:02,878 --> 05:48:04,440
for these resources that the library

5832
05:48:04,440 --> 05:48:06,660
didn't have and was insisting that they

5833
05:48:06,660 --> 05:48:08,760
existed and so the library is trying to

5834
05:48:08,760 --> 05:48:09,840
figure out where these articles were

5835
05:48:09,840 --> 05:48:11,520
these like why can't we get these for

5836
05:48:11,520 --> 05:48:12,660
this student

5837
05:48:12,660 --> 05:48:14,760
and it turns out that the student was

5838
05:48:14,760 --> 05:48:17,400
using chat GPT as a research research

5839
05:48:17,400 --> 05:48:20,160
assistant and chat GPT was just making

5840
05:48:20,160 --> 05:48:22,320
up sources

5841
05:48:22,320 --> 05:48:24,840
and so they were just going to these the

5842
05:48:24,840 --> 05:48:26,760
Librarians with these sources that just

5843
05:48:26,760 --> 05:48:28,558
did not exist

5844
05:48:28,558 --> 05:48:30,660
because it knew what sources looked like

5845
05:48:30,660 --> 05:48:32,160
and said maybe there should be a book

5846
05:48:32,160 --> 05:48:33,900
titled you know how will AI take over

5847
05:48:33,900 --> 05:48:36,958
the world by Richard whatever right

5848
05:48:36,958 --> 05:48:38,878
um and then also I can't do anything

5849
05:48:38,878 --> 05:48:40,378
random which

5850
05:48:40,378 --> 05:48:43,558
which sign let me show you how that what

5851
05:48:43,558 --> 05:48:45,480
that kind of looks like um so here's

5852
05:48:45,480 --> 05:48:47,820
some of those those limitations

5853
05:48:47,820 --> 05:48:50,040
um in action so is the IP address blah

5854
05:48:50,040 --> 05:48:51,240
blah blah malicious that's a dumb

5855
05:48:51,240 --> 05:48:53,700
question for chat GPT better for you

5856
05:48:53,700 --> 05:48:55,798
know virus total abuse ipdb you know any

5857
05:48:55,798 --> 05:48:56,700
of the resources that you can actually

5858
05:48:56,700 --> 05:48:58,980
query it doesn't know

5859
05:48:58,980 --> 05:49:01,200
um what is that number

5860
05:49:01,200 --> 05:49:03,120
what is that number turns out that

5861
05:49:03,120 --> 05:49:04,980
number that that answer is wrong that

5862
05:49:04,980 --> 05:49:07,080
number came close but it's just like

5863
05:49:07,080 --> 05:49:09,360
wrong that number is wrong roll a

5864
05:49:09,360 --> 05:49:10,680
six-sided random Dice and tell me the

5865
05:49:10,680 --> 05:49:12,420
result result of the six Dice and I

5866
05:49:12,420 --> 05:49:13,558
noticed this when I was trying to

5867
05:49:13,558 --> 05:49:15,000
convince it to play Yahtzee with me

5868
05:49:15,000 --> 05:49:17,100
almost every time it rolled a dice it

5869
05:49:17,100 --> 05:49:18,840
was some kind of form of a straight

5870
05:49:18,840 --> 05:49:20,878
and that was weird so I can't get it to

5871
05:49:20,878 --> 05:49:22,200
roll a dice worth a damn if you look

5872
05:49:22,200 --> 05:49:23,280
here one two three four five six it's

5873
05:49:23,280 --> 05:49:25,200
all there and then on the right we also

5874
05:49:25,200 --> 05:49:27,120
got it cheating which is like hey you

5875
05:49:27,120 --> 05:49:28,440
get to decide what you want to do it

5876
05:49:28,440 --> 05:49:29,638
said I rolled it this that and the other

5877
05:49:29,638 --> 05:49:32,040
thing and it said I have a four of a

5878
05:49:32,040 --> 05:49:33,600
kind and you look at that dice roll and

5879
05:49:33,600 --> 05:49:35,638
that is not a four of a kind it just

5880
05:49:35,638 --> 05:49:38,040
cheated it just like I uh it's a four of

5881
05:49:38,040 --> 05:49:39,480
a kind okay

5882
05:49:39,480 --> 05:49:42,058
so

5883
05:49:42,058 --> 05:49:44,100
how do brains work how does this work

5884
05:49:44,100 --> 05:49:45,840
remember this is a large language model

5885
05:49:45,840 --> 05:49:48,298
all it's doing is mimicking

5886
05:49:48,298 --> 05:49:50,520
it's it's

5887
05:49:50,520 --> 05:49:53,160
basically Advanced autocomplete

5888
05:49:53,160 --> 05:49:54,120
um

5889
05:49:54,120 --> 05:49:55,680
I'm an analogy I've been using and I'm

5890
05:49:55,680 --> 05:49:57,120
going to see if it lands here is sort of

5891
05:49:57,120 --> 05:49:58,740
like if you watch Whose Line Is It

5892
05:49:58,740 --> 05:49:59,638
Anyway

5893
05:49:59,638 --> 05:50:01,500
and you know that game where they get

5894
05:50:01,500 --> 05:50:03,180
off all of the comedians in a row and

5895
05:50:03,180 --> 05:50:04,740
each one does one at a time and they

5896
05:50:04,740 --> 05:50:06,600
give those comedians a prompt those guys

5897
05:50:06,600 --> 05:50:08,340
are stupid sharp right you give them

5898
05:50:08,340 --> 05:50:10,020
that prompt they know the context hey

5899
05:50:10,020 --> 05:50:11,580
you're on a you're on a TV show it's

5900
05:50:11,580 --> 05:50:13,680
rated this and your prompt is you know

5901
05:50:13,680 --> 05:50:17,340
funny pirate songs whatever oh the next

5902
05:50:17,340 --> 05:50:19,080
guy's like okay who and the next one

5903
05:50:19,080 --> 05:50:21,058
lives right they're gonna make that song

5904
05:50:21,058 --> 05:50:22,980
one at a time at a time right one word

5905
05:50:22,980 --> 05:50:24,958
at a time and they know the context from

5906
05:50:24,958 --> 05:50:26,878
that from what they just heard

5907
05:50:26,878 --> 05:50:28,378
um but every once in a while there's

5908
05:50:28,378 --> 05:50:31,440
either a guest or an audience member

5909
05:50:31,440 --> 05:50:33,540
and they don't know what the word means

5910
05:50:33,540 --> 05:50:35,540
in the prompt or they don't know the the

5911
05:50:35,540 --> 05:50:37,740
actor that's part of the joke they don't

5912
05:50:37,740 --> 05:50:38,760
know something

5913
05:50:38,760 --> 05:50:41,580
and they'll flub a word and then

5914
05:50:41,580 --> 05:50:43,798
everybody after that has to compensate

5915
05:50:43,798 --> 05:50:45,480
they have to they have to just run with

5916
05:50:45,480 --> 05:50:47,700
it right because because this thing has

5917
05:50:47,700 --> 05:50:49,860
to give you the next word so even if the

5918
05:50:49,860 --> 05:50:51,360
last word was the wrong word it needs to

5919
05:50:51,360 --> 05:50:52,620
give you the next word and it's going to

5920
05:50:52,620 --> 05:50:54,840
keep vamping and it could give you just

5921
05:50:54,840 --> 05:50:56,700
nonsense and that's what happens

5922
05:50:56,700 --> 05:50:58,558
so again Layman I don't know what the

5923
05:50:58,558 --> 05:50:59,940
professor said what happened but that's

5924
05:50:59,940 --> 05:51:01,200
what I think happens

5925
05:51:01,200 --> 05:51:03,600
so again not artificial general

5926
05:51:03,600 --> 05:51:04,860
intelligence

5927
05:51:04,860 --> 05:51:06,900
or a long way from it if you talk to if

5928
05:51:06,900 --> 05:51:08,580
you listen to interviews by Sam Altman

5929
05:51:08,580 --> 05:51:10,860
who's the CEO of

5930
05:51:10,860 --> 05:51:15,480
um yeah it was the CEO of uh open AI

5931
05:51:15,480 --> 05:51:17,580
he's convinced that if they just make if

5932
05:51:17,580 --> 05:51:19,558
they just scale this language model up

5933
05:51:19,558 --> 05:51:21,240
you approach artificial general

5934
05:51:21,240 --> 05:51:23,900
intelligence

5935
05:51:24,360 --> 05:51:27,718
I don't know if that's right

5936
05:51:27,718 --> 05:51:30,120
I'd encourage you to listen to the

5937
05:51:30,120 --> 05:51:32,040
podcast that I'm going to give you next

5938
05:51:32,040 --> 05:51:34,320
after I explain this slide but

5939
05:51:34,320 --> 05:51:36,958
the point is there's more to this than

5940
05:51:36,958 --> 05:51:40,798
language and chat GPT is just spew it's

5941
05:51:40,798 --> 05:51:43,500
like a human that can be spew

5942
05:51:43,500 --> 05:51:44,638
from its mouth

5943
05:51:44,638 --> 05:51:47,280
and it may have some synapses in there

5944
05:51:47,280 --> 05:51:49,378
that get you what you want but it's

5945
05:51:49,378 --> 05:51:52,138
still not connected to thought

5946
05:51:52,138 --> 05:51:54,298
creativity it really doesn't have a

5947
05:51:54,298 --> 05:51:55,798
memory outside of what you just told it

5948
05:51:55,798 --> 05:51:58,320
it can't make decisions you have to

5949
05:51:58,320 --> 05:52:00,718
force it to make decisions and it it is

5950
05:52:00,718 --> 05:52:03,298
not artificial general intelligence it

5951
05:52:03,298 --> 05:52:05,760
is just a language model that is able to

5952
05:52:05,760 --> 05:52:08,340
create comprehensible output

5953
05:52:08,340 --> 05:52:10,320
and occasionally that output is startled

5954
05:52:10,320 --> 05:52:13,798
startled startlingly accurate

5955
05:52:13,798 --> 05:52:15,660
also remember

5956
05:52:15,660 --> 05:52:17,878
this is what computers think humans

5957
05:52:17,878 --> 05:52:20,718
having fun looks like

5958
05:52:20,940 --> 05:52:23,160
okay so it's all this is what I

5959
05:52:23,160 --> 05:52:24,420
want you to this is your homework

5960
05:52:24,420 --> 05:52:27,180
there's a great um great interview here

5961
05:52:27,180 --> 05:52:28,860
Ezra Klein he's with uh he's a

5962
05:52:28,860 --> 05:52:30,660
journalist I think he was a Vox the New

5963
05:52:30,660 --> 05:52:31,860
York Times and he has his own podcast

5964
05:52:31,860 --> 05:52:34,260
he's interviewing Gary Marcus uh

5965
05:52:34,260 --> 05:52:35,878
professor at NYU

5966
05:52:35,878 --> 05:52:39,780
and what they said was what um Gary

5967
05:52:39,780 --> 05:52:41,820
Marcus said was what unnerved me a bit

5968
05:52:41,820 --> 05:52:43,798
about chechi PT was the sense that we

5969
05:52:43,798 --> 05:52:45,360
are going to drive the cost of

5970
05:52:45,360 --> 05:52:47,340
to zero when we have not driven down the

5971
05:52:47,340 --> 05:52:49,500
cost of truthful or accurate or

5972
05:52:49,500 --> 05:52:51,180
knowledge advancing information lower it

5973
05:52:51,180 --> 05:52:52,080
all

5974
05:52:52,080 --> 05:52:53,400
so

5975
05:52:53,400 --> 05:52:54,840
um interesting stat that I'll believe

5976
05:52:54,840 --> 05:52:57,298
them from that from that uh podcast is

5977
05:52:57,298 --> 05:52:58,558
that the Russians were spending

5978
05:52:58,558 --> 05:53:00,660
something like a million dollars a month

5979
05:53:00,660 --> 05:53:03,120
in misinformation right spewing out

5980
05:53:03,120 --> 05:53:04,620
nonsense on Twitter and all that kind of

5981
05:53:04,620 --> 05:53:06,958
stuff this brings it to zero you can

5982
05:53:06,958 --> 05:53:08,580
continue to iterate on the same thought

5983
05:53:08,580 --> 05:53:10,320
of nonsense forever and ever and ever

5984
05:53:10,320 --> 05:53:11,820
and ever and ever and ever and ever and

5985
05:53:11,820 --> 05:53:14,580
ever and ever put it in a script and now

5986
05:53:14,580 --> 05:53:18,240
it's on Twitter right so

5987
05:53:18,240 --> 05:53:19,500
um there's also gonna be a lot of people

5988
05:53:19,500 --> 05:53:21,600
that are already prone to and

5989
05:53:21,600 --> 05:53:23,820
now they're going to be masquerading as

5990
05:53:23,820 --> 05:53:26,160
CIS top 18 Consultants because they

5991
05:53:26,160 --> 05:53:27,718
wrote it in chat GPT and they think they

5992
05:53:27,718 --> 05:53:30,180
can do it right

5993
05:53:30,180 --> 05:53:31,200
um so

5994
05:53:31,200 --> 05:53:33,600
again my emphasis here very very useful

5995
05:53:33,600 --> 05:53:34,620
tool

5996
05:53:34,620 --> 05:53:36,420
if it goes away it goes away and we all

5997
05:53:36,420 --> 05:53:38,760
have jobs if it stays here we should use

5998
05:53:38,760 --> 05:53:40,920
it I'd rather be the guy who knows how

5999
05:53:40,920 --> 05:53:42,480
to use it in case that becomes important

6000
05:53:42,480 --> 05:53:44,218
and I don't want to get taken out by the

6001
05:53:44,218 --> 05:53:45,780
guy who does know how to use it when I

6002
05:53:45,780 --> 05:53:47,940
refuse to move on and start adapting to

6003
05:53:47,940 --> 05:53:49,320
these so

6004
05:53:49,320 --> 05:53:50,400
um

6005
05:53:50,400 --> 05:53:52,320
there's a chance this is all owned by a

6006
05:53:52,320 --> 05:53:54,120
bunch of billionaires that tomorrow we

6007
05:53:54,120 --> 05:53:55,920
wake up and it's all taken away from us

6008
05:53:55,920 --> 05:53:58,860
and we don't get to use it but for now

6009
05:53:58,860 --> 05:54:01,080
well there's a chance

6010
05:54:01,080 --> 05:54:03,180
figure out if this affects us figure out

6011
05:54:03,180 --> 05:54:04,920
how we can use it see if it's useful see

6012
05:54:04,920 --> 05:54:06,480
if you know

6013
05:54:06,480 --> 05:54:08,458
that that's the lesson here right mess

6014
05:54:08,458 --> 05:54:10,680
with it see if it's useful learn what it

6015
05:54:10,680 --> 05:54:14,040
does I've got a ton more examples

6016
05:54:14,040 --> 05:54:15,420
so I'm going to put this up here again

6017
05:54:15,420 --> 05:54:17,458
just to jog your

6018
05:54:17,458 --> 05:54:19,980
um your synapses here log stash parsers

6019
05:54:19,980 --> 05:54:21,600
I've written analyzing code for

6020
05:54:21,600 --> 05:54:23,700
vulnerabilities I broke down API calls

6021
05:54:23,700 --> 05:54:25,440
that malware makes trying to build

6022
05:54:25,440 --> 05:54:27,298
detections off of it I've extracted

6023
05:54:27,298 --> 05:54:29,218
fields from unstructured data I said hey

6024
05:54:29,218 --> 05:54:30,540
what's the IP addresses give me the

6025
05:54:30,540 --> 05:54:32,820
usernames there's no there's no key

6026
05:54:32,820 --> 05:54:34,378
value pair in this just give it to me I

6027
05:54:34,378 --> 05:54:36,180
tried to play Yahtzee with it wrote its

6028
05:54:36,180 --> 05:54:37,378
own soar integration that's the closest

6029
05:54:37,378 --> 05:54:39,240
I approach to the singularity I wrote an

6030
05:54:39,240 --> 05:54:41,520
integration for open AI for our soar

6031
05:54:41,520 --> 05:54:43,860
platform using open Ai and now our solar

6032
05:54:43,860 --> 05:54:46,020
platform can query open AI

6033
05:54:46,020 --> 05:54:48,120
I don't know

6034
05:54:48,120 --> 05:54:50,340
um generating Sigma rule so Sigma if

6035
05:54:50,340 --> 05:54:51,298
you're not if you're not familiar with

6036
05:54:51,298 --> 05:54:52,980
it those are just detection rules and I

6037
05:54:52,980 --> 05:54:54,780
got it to write those uh those rules I

6038
05:54:54,780 --> 05:54:56,218
was able to convert those rules from one

6039
05:54:56,218 --> 05:54:58,500
to another which is not trivial

6040
05:54:58,500 --> 05:55:00,120
um writing a pen test report writing an

6041
05:55:00,120 --> 05:55:02,040
incident report uh it's also pretty good

6042
05:55:02,040 --> 05:55:04,320
it's Excel formulas so I I had a problem

6043
05:55:04,320 --> 05:55:05,458
I had to remember how to use like

6044
05:55:05,458 --> 05:55:07,860
vlookup and horizontal whatever

6045
05:55:07,860 --> 05:55:09,298
um and I just said Hey how do I get this

6046
05:55:09,298 --> 05:55:10,860
field to find if it matches in that

6047
05:55:10,860 --> 05:55:12,660
field and blah blah blah and it gave me

6048
05:55:12,660 --> 05:55:14,280
the Formula One thing I forgot on the

6049
05:55:14,280 --> 05:55:17,940
programming example is just a pro tip

6050
05:55:17,940 --> 05:55:20,638
um give it your errors so it's possible

6051
05:55:20,638 --> 05:55:22,378
on its first on its first try it doesn't

6052
05:55:22,378 --> 05:55:24,240
get it right

6053
05:55:24,240 --> 05:55:26,458
just give it the error and it'll be like

6054
05:55:26,458 --> 05:55:27,900
oh you're right that function doesn't

6055
05:55:27,900 --> 05:55:29,760
exist or you need to install this module

6056
05:55:29,760 --> 05:55:31,920
or you need to whatever whatever

6057
05:55:31,920 --> 05:55:33,000
um I forgot to mention that but that

6058
05:55:33,000 --> 05:55:34,320
worked with the Excel formulas right I

6059
05:55:34,320 --> 05:55:35,878
dropped that in there and it gave me a

6060
05:55:35,878 --> 05:55:37,798
bunch of n a's in the right spot but it

6061
05:55:37,798 --> 05:55:39,180
said n a and I said hey this is saying n

6062
05:55:39,180 --> 05:55:40,798
a instead of the thing and it fixes it

6063
05:55:40,798 --> 05:55:42,120
okay

6064
05:55:42,120 --> 05:55:44,400
cool we've got nine minutes everybody

6065
05:55:44,400 --> 05:55:46,558
here is already or most people here have

6066
05:55:46,558 --> 05:55:48,718
already played with chat GPT so I don't

6067
05:55:48,718 --> 05:55:50,580
want to necessarily open this up and

6068
05:55:50,580 --> 05:55:51,660
start showing you what I'm actually

6069
05:55:51,660 --> 05:55:52,620
talking about because that's that's

6070
05:55:52,620 --> 05:55:54,718
pretty obvious but if we do want to play

6071
05:55:54,718 --> 05:55:56,040
with examples or you've got questions

6072
05:55:56,040 --> 05:55:58,500
again understanding that I understand it

6073
05:55:58,500 --> 05:56:01,320
about as well as you do in terms of what

6074
05:56:01,320 --> 05:56:04,138
it's doing on the on the Machinery side

6075
05:56:04,138 --> 05:56:04,798
um

6076
05:56:04,798 --> 05:56:06,958
we're doing you'll find us chatting and

6077
05:56:06,958 --> 05:56:08,160
having great chats it's like generally

6078
05:56:08,160 --> 05:56:09,840
80 people that show up it's not recorded

6079
05:56:09,840 --> 05:56:11,940
use it or lose it

6080
05:56:11,940 --> 05:56:14,359
um yeah

6081
05:56:15,240 --> 05:56:16,558
um

6082
05:56:16,558 --> 05:56:17,878
the thing about the company behind chat

6083
05:56:17,878 --> 05:56:19,920
GPT and their trustworthiness regarding

6084
05:56:19,920 --> 05:56:22,860
things like pi and privacy policy and

6085
05:56:22,860 --> 05:56:24,600
then kind of a follow-on question wrong

6086
05:56:24,600 --> 05:56:27,120
what that is about you know stealing

6087
05:56:27,120 --> 05:56:28,740
people's ideas like stealing your own

6088
05:56:28,740 --> 05:56:30,600
kind of you know intellectual property

6089
05:56:30,600 --> 05:56:32,280
as you entered into chapter GP or

6090
05:56:32,280 --> 05:56:34,920
something like that yeah so

6091
05:56:34,920 --> 05:56:37,020
my understanding of chat GP I'm I'm

6092
05:56:37,020 --> 05:56:39,480
skeptical right um and this is this is

6093
05:56:39,480 --> 05:56:41,340
all my personal opinion

6094
05:56:41,340 --> 05:56:45,360
chat GPT I think is technically

6095
05:56:45,360 --> 05:56:47,400
technically incorporated as a non-profit

6096
05:56:47,400 --> 05:56:49,798
and they're trying as best as they can

6097
05:56:49,798 --> 05:56:53,100
to do this as ethically as possible and

6098
05:56:53,100 --> 05:56:55,798
that comes down to trust and I don't

6099
05:56:55,798 --> 05:56:57,900
know these people but if you look at

6100
05:56:57,900 --> 05:56:59,820
what their website says and what they're

6101
05:56:59,820 --> 05:57:01,500
saying in interviews is they acknowledge

6102
05:57:01,500 --> 05:57:04,860
that this capability this tool is either

6103
05:57:04,860 --> 05:57:09,180
gonna break they feel or at least

6104
05:57:09,180 --> 05:57:11,340
extol to Their audience that they feel

6105
05:57:11,340 --> 05:57:13,680
they understand that this could either

6106
05:57:13,680 --> 05:57:16,080
bring Humanity to something awesome or

6107
05:57:16,080 --> 05:57:17,638
break a bunch of

6108
05:57:17,638 --> 05:57:21,780
and I don't know these people but

6109
05:57:21,780 --> 05:57:23,940
that's a great question like what what

6110
05:57:23,940 --> 05:57:25,200
does this mean and this is why I'm

6111
05:57:25,200 --> 05:57:26,700
talking to this room wondering how this

6112
05:57:26,700 --> 05:57:28,620
technology is going to be used by US or

6113
05:57:28,620 --> 05:57:30,000
at us

6114
05:57:30,000 --> 05:57:31,558
um for now I want us to use it but I

6115
05:57:31,558 --> 05:57:33,420
have no idea right

6116
05:57:33,420 --> 05:57:36,180
Sam Altman go look him up I'm not going

6117
05:57:36,180 --> 05:57:38,540
to meet him

6118
05:57:39,240 --> 05:57:41,958
anything else

6119
05:57:45,500 --> 05:57:48,718
all right so I've got six minutes uh

6120
05:57:48,718 --> 05:57:51,600
should I end now or do we want to show

6121
05:57:51,600 --> 05:57:53,040
okay

6122
05:57:53,040 --> 05:57:55,260
okay so awesome yeah

6123
05:57:55,260 --> 05:57:57,298
yeah no so um I'll be standing over here

6124
05:57:57,298 --> 05:57:59,100
if you want to talk to me I'll also be a

6125
05:57:59,100 --> 05:58:00,958
recounting plus text got a booth the big

6126
05:58:00,958 --> 05:58:03,240
glowing one I'll likely be hanging out

6127
05:58:03,240 --> 05:58:05,100
over there if anybody wants to talk see

6128
05:58:05,100 --> 05:58:07,980
anything trade code whatever cool thanks

6129
05:58:07,980 --> 05:58:10,160

to our three o'clock here on track one

6150
06:03:53,638 --> 06:03:56,040
this will be uh Kyle Norby with uh

6151
06:03:56,040 --> 06:03:59,280
Windows Powershell for uh wmi use and

6152
06:03:59,280 --> 06:04:02,958
forensics so please give a warm welcome

6153
06:04:07,138 --> 06:04:08,520
it's great to be here

6154
06:04:08,520 --> 06:04:12,000
um my name is Kyle I did my very first

6155
06:04:12,000 --> 06:04:15,540
talk at cactuscon last year and so

6156
06:04:15,540 --> 06:04:17,520
apparently it was good enough that they

6157
06:04:17,520 --> 06:04:19,378
didn't kick me out and I'm here a second

6158
06:04:19,378 --> 06:04:21,620
time

6159
06:04:21,780 --> 06:04:23,700
um a little bit about who I am

6160
06:04:23,700 --> 06:04:27,058
um very generally I have a sock workout

6161
06:04:27,058 --> 06:04:29,760
you'll most commonly see this over a

6162
06:04:29,760 --> 06:04:32,580
dcomp or if they're using a more modern

6163
06:04:32,580 --> 06:04:35,218
implementation win RM

6164
06:04:35,218 --> 06:04:38,100
um sometimes like a PS session for uh

6165
06:04:38,100 --> 06:04:40,020
Powershell

6166
06:04:40,020 --> 06:04:43,740
and then it's built off of wbem which is

6167
06:04:43,740 --> 06:04:45,958
web-based Enterprise management I'm glad

6168
06:04:45,958 --> 06:04:49,080
I have that my notes and then um also

6169
06:04:49,080 --> 06:04:52,440
the cim so the I did not have this in my

6170
06:04:52,440 --> 06:04:55,217
notes the

6171
06:04:55,320 --> 06:04:56,940
a framework

6172
06:04:56,940 --> 06:04:58,620
um that this is Loosely based off of and

6173
06:04:58,620 --> 06:05:00,000
this actually comes a little bit into

6174
06:05:00,000 --> 06:05:03,058
play later and then for kind of the logs

6175
06:05:03,058 --> 06:05:04,860
and triage piece

6176
06:05:04,860 --> 06:05:06,180
um there's all sorts of different pieces

6177
06:05:06,180 --> 06:05:08,520
that you can do and these are all

6178
06:05:08,520 --> 06:05:10,920
readily available usually free or very

6179
06:05:10,920 --> 06:05:11,840
cheap

6180
06:05:11,840 --> 06:05:15,240
sysmon you can enable logging there's a

6181
06:05:15,240 --> 06:05:17,160
couple different forensic tools that you

6182
06:05:17,160 --> 06:05:19,620
can leverage there's also some Network

6183
06:05:19,620 --> 06:05:20,940
things that you can look at too like

6184
06:05:20,940 --> 06:05:23,878
through Zeke and then while it's not all

6185
06:05:23,878 --> 06:05:25,500
enabled by default because there are

6186
06:05:25,500 --> 06:05:27,600
some things you need to enable you also

6187
06:05:27,600 --> 06:05:30,180
have some basic Microsoft logging in

6188
06:05:30,180 --> 06:05:32,100
there as well too if you're coming into

6189
06:05:32,100 --> 06:05:33,840
this blind like responding to an

6190
06:05:33,840 --> 06:05:35,900
incident

6191
06:05:35,900 --> 06:05:39,480
so grabbing this off of another article

6192
06:05:39,480 --> 06:05:42,240
I think it very simply and easily

6193
06:05:42,240 --> 06:05:44,700
illustrates here you have the event

6194
06:05:44,700 --> 06:05:47,218
filter you have the event consumer it's

6195
06:05:47,218 --> 06:05:50,160
very easy to kind of focus on one or the

6196
06:05:50,160 --> 06:05:51,420
other because you're trying to look at

6197
06:05:51,420 --> 06:05:55,080
what's triggering it or what is the

6198
06:05:55,080 --> 06:05:58,080
event that you're calling but then you

6199
06:05:58,080 --> 06:06:00,420
also have that uh binding mechanism so

6200
06:06:00,420 --> 06:06:04,440
what is associating the event with the

6201
06:06:04,440 --> 06:06:08,780
uh or the filter with the consumer

6202
06:06:11,160 --> 06:06:13,760
so taking a look at the event filter

6203
06:06:13,760 --> 06:06:16,200
this is like a Powershell command that

6204
06:06:16,200 --> 06:06:19,378
you can just run and it'll list out the

6205
06:06:19,378 --> 06:06:21,900
relevant event filters

6206
06:06:21,900 --> 06:06:25,080
this is the condition to execute so this

6207
06:06:25,080 --> 06:06:29,100
is what you're calling on the uh

6208
06:06:29,100 --> 06:06:30,900
wmi

6209
06:06:30,900 --> 06:06:33,920
excuse me what you are calling

6210
06:06:33,920 --> 06:06:36,900
to execute the program so this can be

6211
06:06:36,900 --> 06:06:40,080
very strong and intensive it can be on

6212
06:06:40,080 --> 06:06:42,000
user logon it can be at launch of

6213
06:06:42,000 --> 06:06:43,740
specific applications it can be at

6214
06:06:43,740 --> 06:06:46,440
certain times after boot

6215
06:06:46,440 --> 06:06:48,480
um really it's

6216
06:06:48,480 --> 06:06:52,080
whatever the it admin or the threat

6217
06:06:52,080 --> 06:06:56,040
actor or both want to try to

6218
06:06:56,040 --> 06:06:56,760
um

6219
06:06:56,760 --> 06:06:58,378
have their program run either for

6220
06:06:58,378 --> 06:07:00,180
persistence or for the health of the

6221
06:07:00,180 --> 06:07:01,620
machine

6222
06:07:01,620 --> 06:07:03,600
um very generally too these can be

6223
06:07:03,600 --> 06:07:06,058
intrinsic or extrinsic

6224
06:07:06,058 --> 06:07:08,160
so something like based off of time or

6225
06:07:08,160 --> 06:07:09,540
if you want it to happen on like a

6226
06:07:09,540 --> 06:07:10,400
specific

6227
06:07:10,400 --> 06:07:13,440
event that occurs

6228
06:07:13,440 --> 06:07:16,200
then taking a look at one of these here

6229
06:07:16,200 --> 06:07:20,040
I had ran the script mentioned in one of

6230
06:07:20,040 --> 06:07:22,138
the articles there to help kind of just

6231
06:07:22,138 --> 06:07:24,718
get out some very basic like evil

6232
06:07:24,718 --> 06:07:26,400
subscription so that way I have some

6233
06:07:26,400 --> 06:07:28,320
events that I can look at

6234
06:07:28,320 --> 06:07:31,200
uh you can see here that the

6235
06:07:31,200 --> 06:07:34,500
event name is evil subscription and its

6236
06:07:34,500 --> 06:07:35,940
path shows that as well

6237
06:07:35,940 --> 06:07:37,680
and there's queries in there but there's

6238
06:07:37,680 --> 06:07:39,958
ways that you can like obfuscate it

6239
06:07:39,958 --> 06:07:41,218
um you can start giving it different

6240
06:07:41,218 --> 06:07:42,780
names you can try to name it similar to

6241
06:07:42,780 --> 06:07:43,860
other things

6242
06:07:43,860 --> 06:07:45,840
depending on the event filter you can

6243
06:07:45,840 --> 06:07:48,480
even just leverage one that's already

6244
06:07:48,480 --> 06:07:50,340
existing so that way they have to go and

6245
06:07:50,340 --> 06:07:52,080
start digging around to figure out why

6246
06:07:52,080 --> 06:07:54,540
this is occurring

6247
06:07:54,540 --> 06:07:57,180
you have the uh binding so this links

6248
06:07:57,180 --> 06:08:00,058
the filter to the consumer

6249
06:08:00,058 --> 06:08:03,540
so if you look here we can see the

6250
06:08:03,540 --> 06:08:06,840
active script event consumer we see the

6251
06:08:06,840 --> 06:08:08,040
different references like evil

6252
06:08:08,040 --> 06:08:10,500
subscription one evil subscription zero

6253
06:08:10,500 --> 06:08:11,700
three

6254
06:08:11,700 --> 06:08:14,700
and this is what is

6255
06:08:14,700 --> 06:08:17,580
um linking those consumers over to those

6256
06:08:17,580 --> 06:08:20,878
filters that uh were created

6257
06:08:20,878 --> 06:08:23,058
and then taking a look at the consumer

6258
06:08:23,058 --> 06:08:27,298
the five pieces that it can be are the

6259
06:08:27,298 --> 06:08:29,458
active script event consumer

6260
06:08:29,458 --> 06:08:32,940
which runs as local system

6261
06:08:32,940 --> 06:08:35,280
and can be different things like a VB

6262
06:08:35,280 --> 06:08:37,980
script or jscript

6263
06:08:37,980 --> 06:08:40,558
um are the two big ones I think w

6264
06:08:40,558 --> 06:08:42,298
HL as well

6265
06:08:42,298 --> 06:08:44,340
you have the command line event consumer

6266
06:08:44,340 --> 06:08:46,020
so you can start just executing

6267
06:08:46,020 --> 06:08:48,718
Powershell uh just different command

6268
06:08:48,718 --> 06:08:50,040
prompt things so if you just want to

6269
06:08:50,040 --> 06:08:52,200
call in obfuscate a Powershell or start

6270
06:08:52,200 --> 06:08:54,840
calling for a script online you can

6271
06:08:54,840 --> 06:08:56,340
start doing that to try to like maintain

6272
06:08:56,340 --> 06:08:57,780
participants

6273
06:08:57,780 --> 06:09:00,718
the log file event consumer which is

6274
06:09:00,718 --> 06:09:03,000
associated with log files

6275
06:09:03,000 --> 06:09:07,320
NT event log and then SMTP event

6276
06:09:07,320 --> 06:09:09,058
consumer

6277
06:09:09,058 --> 06:09:11,458
taking a look here we're looking at the

6278
06:09:11,458 --> 06:09:14,218
command line you can see the uh encoded

6279
06:09:14,218 --> 06:09:17,458
obfuscated Powershell command in there

6280
06:09:17,458 --> 06:09:20,520
and again you start seeing in here too

6281
06:09:20,520 --> 06:09:22,680
so it's the same path evil subscription

6282
06:09:22,680 --> 06:09:25,320
two its name is evil subscription two

6283
06:09:25,320 --> 06:09:27,718
and then this is getting binded through

6284
06:09:27,718 --> 06:09:28,798
the uh

6285
06:09:28,798 --> 06:09:31,558
relative path there so it's being called

6286
06:09:31,558 --> 06:09:35,580
by the filter through the binding

6287
06:09:35,580 --> 06:09:38,700
and then calls over to the program

6288
06:09:38,700 --> 06:09:41,280
so the reason I'm really trying to touch

6289
06:09:41,280 --> 06:09:43,138
on that is threat actors are going to

6290
06:09:43,138 --> 06:09:46,138
try to clean up behind them maybe

6291
06:09:46,138 --> 06:09:48,718
intentionally or unintentionally

6292
06:09:48,718 --> 06:09:50,940
and what you really want to do is try to

6293
06:09:50,940 --> 06:09:52,378
make sure that you're taking a holistic

6294
06:09:52,378 --> 06:09:54,120
look at everything that's there if

6295
06:09:54,120 --> 06:09:56,878
they've gone through and deleted like

6296
06:09:56,878 --> 06:09:58,340
all of the

6297
06:09:58,340 --> 06:10:00,958
consumer events but you still have that

6298
06:10:00,958 --> 06:10:02,638
linking event that can at least give you

6299
06:10:02,638 --> 06:10:05,280
some idea of there was something here

6300
06:10:05,280 --> 06:10:07,320
that it was calling and it looks like it

6301
06:10:07,320 --> 06:10:08,940
was intentionally deleted it may be

6302
06:10:08,940 --> 06:10:11,340
malicious or not but every single piece

6303
06:10:11,340 --> 06:10:12,840
in Your Arsenal for like trying to paint

6304
06:10:12,840 --> 06:10:15,000
out this story is going to be very

6305
06:10:15,000 --> 06:10:17,218
important so it's very easy to just kind

6306
06:10:17,218 --> 06:10:18,600
of focus on the two big hitters because

6307
06:10:18,600 --> 06:10:20,280
that's just the linking piece

6308
06:10:20,280 --> 06:10:21,660
but you want to make sure that you're

6309
06:10:21,660 --> 06:10:23,400
taking a look at all the different

6310
06:10:23,400 --> 06:10:25,500
artifacts in there because

6311
06:10:25,500 --> 06:10:26,820
it

6312
06:10:26,820 --> 06:10:29,820
very often threat actors are going to be

6313
06:10:29,820 --> 06:10:32,340
destructive I've seen that a lot with

6314
06:10:32,340 --> 06:10:34,020
ransomware where they'll just fully

6315
06:10:34,020 --> 06:10:35,580
encrypt the machines

6316
06:10:35,580 --> 06:10:38,400
um through BitLocker things like that so

6317
06:10:38,400 --> 06:10:40,920
if you're ingesting those events it can

6318
06:10:40,920 --> 06:10:43,320
be very helpful to see when these events

6319
06:10:43,320 --> 06:10:44,638
are created and I'll get a little bit

6320
06:10:44,638 --> 06:10:48,079
more into that when we talk about sysmon

6321
06:10:48,840 --> 06:10:50,638
um two other ones here that we can kind

6322
06:10:50,638 --> 06:10:54,180
of look at so this one here

6323
06:10:54,180 --> 06:10:57,600
is uh just calling for a script file

6324
06:10:57,600 --> 06:11:00,200
name there so you see like C W my

6325
06:11:00,200 --> 06:11:02,820
subscription.vbs very innocent looking

6326
06:11:02,820 --> 06:11:05,638
it's in the root of C but we also know

6327
06:11:05,638 --> 06:11:07,680
that this is like the um

6328
06:11:07,680 --> 06:11:09,420
one that was created by the tools and

6329
06:11:09,420 --> 06:11:11,580
it's supposed to kind of blend in there

6330
06:11:11,580 --> 06:11:13,080
like it's just calling a random script

6331
06:11:13,080 --> 06:11:14,958
on there and it's just named

6332
06:11:14,958 --> 06:11:17,040
wmisubscription.vbs it's very easy to

6333
06:11:17,040 --> 06:11:18,840
just Overlook that

6334
06:11:18,840 --> 06:11:20,400
and then another one that we can see

6335
06:11:20,400 --> 06:11:23,760
here this just has the VB script within

6336
06:11:23,760 --> 06:11:26,580
um the actual event there and we'll see

6337
06:11:26,580 --> 06:11:28,260
this too you'll sometimes hear it

6338
06:11:28,260 --> 06:11:29,940
referred to as like a fileless malware

6339
06:11:29,940 --> 06:11:32,280
things like that that's because it's not

6340
06:11:32,280 --> 06:11:34,378
persisting at a physical location in the

6341
06:11:34,378 --> 06:11:38,160
disk it's only basically run when it's

6342
06:11:38,160 --> 06:11:40,860
in memory and then if it has cleanup

6343
06:11:40,860 --> 06:11:42,298
scripts you might not even see it there

6344
06:11:42,298 --> 06:11:45,138
after it's completed

6345
06:11:46,200 --> 06:11:49,500
so this kind of touches into

6346
06:11:49,500 --> 06:11:52,260
um living off the land binaries

6347
06:11:52,260 --> 06:11:54,360
um I've heard a couple other talks

6348
06:11:54,360 --> 06:11:56,340
already mentioned this before I feel

6349
06:11:56,340 --> 06:11:57,780
like everybody's pretty familiar with it

6350
06:11:57,780 --> 06:11:59,520
but it's very important to note too it's

6351
06:11:59,520 --> 06:12:00,718
like

6352
06:12:00,718 --> 06:12:02,700
they're not bringing in additional

6353
06:12:02,700 --> 06:12:04,138
tooling or anything into the systems

6354
06:12:04,138 --> 06:12:06,600
this is already enabled on Windows and

6355
06:12:06,600 --> 06:12:08,340
it's very important to make sure that

6356
06:12:08,340 --> 06:12:10,138
we're taking a look at all the different

6357
06:12:10,138 --> 06:12:11,700
things that are just built into Windows

6358
06:12:11,700 --> 06:12:13,558
to make our lives easier and to make it

6359
06:12:13,558 --> 06:12:15,900
admins lives easier can this be

6360
06:12:15,900 --> 06:12:18,240
leveraged maliciously how do we tell if

6361
06:12:18,240 --> 06:12:21,680
it's being leveraged maliciously

6362
06:12:21,958 --> 06:12:23,700
and then two of the commands here that

6363
06:12:23,700 --> 06:12:25,860
they'd show is just like very very

6364
06:12:25,860 --> 06:12:29,520
simple wmic process called create X you

6365
06:12:29,520 --> 06:12:31,798
can call from like uh the alternate data

6366
06:12:31,798 --> 06:12:33,320
stream there so like it's in

6367
06:12:33,320 --> 06:12:36,000
innocent.txt but the ads

6368
06:12:36,000 --> 06:12:38,218
has evil.xc

6369
06:12:38,218 --> 06:12:40,020
in there and then you can also connect

6370
06:12:40,020 --> 06:12:42,240
over to a remote host uh just by

6371
06:12:42,240 --> 06:12:45,138
specifying in there

6372
06:12:46,320 --> 06:12:50,760
so very generally wmic spawns the wmi

6373
06:12:50,760 --> 06:12:52,980
provider hosts

6374
06:12:52,980 --> 06:12:54,840
um executable on the target system that

6375
06:12:54,840 --> 06:12:57,240
can be local or that can be remote on

6376
06:12:57,240 --> 06:12:59,218
the network within a corporate

6377
06:12:59,218 --> 06:13:00,420
environment you'll typically see that

6378
06:13:00,420 --> 06:13:04,260
over SMB for authentication and delivery

6379
06:13:04,260 --> 06:13:06,000
sometimes you'll see those connections

6380
06:13:06,000 --> 06:13:10,620
over to admin shares there's lots of um

6381
06:13:10,620 --> 06:13:14,580
optimums that go along with dcrpc

6382
06:13:14,580 --> 06:13:19,260
for the remote procedure calls that are

6383
06:13:19,260 --> 06:13:21,378
being used by dcom

6384
06:13:21,378 --> 06:13:25,080
this is the older method it's not really

6385
06:13:25,080 --> 06:13:26,940
supported anymore but you'd be very

6386
06:13:26,940 --> 06:13:28,320
surprised at how many organizations

6387
06:13:28,320 --> 06:13:30,360
aren't actively

6388
06:13:30,360 --> 06:13:32,340
looking at communications that are going

6389
06:13:32,340 --> 06:13:34,080
on in here sometimes even having things

6390
06:13:34,080 --> 06:13:37,020
like smb1 still enabled on their

6391
06:13:37,020 --> 06:13:39,600
environments

6392
06:13:39,600 --> 06:13:42,540
and then it also can sometimes be a

6393
06:13:42,540 --> 06:13:44,638
little bit more tricky to find in there

6394
06:13:44,638 --> 06:13:47,100
too because you'll have the initial

6395
06:13:47,100 --> 06:13:49,138
connection there where it negotiates

6396
06:13:49,138 --> 06:13:50,600
over

6397
06:13:50,600 --> 06:13:53,638
dcrpc for dcom and then it's a separate

6398
06:13:53,638 --> 06:13:56,958
connection after it gets handed the

6399
06:13:56,958 --> 06:13:59,280
authentication so then you'll see

6400
06:13:59,280 --> 06:14:00,660
something like in one of the ephemeral

6401
06:14:00,660 --> 06:14:01,798
ports

6402
06:14:01,798 --> 06:14:04,680
um usually like 10 24 to 10 34 but it

6403
06:14:04,680 --> 06:14:06,298
can be anywhere in that range it's

6404
06:14:06,298 --> 06:14:08,218
basically like all the way up to the top

6405
06:14:08,218 --> 06:14:11,660
of the ephemeral ports

6406
06:14:12,360 --> 06:14:14,100
um here's one that I generated locally

6407
06:14:14,100 --> 06:14:15,620
on my own system

6408
06:14:15,620 --> 06:14:18,600
this was just a failed one but you can

6409
06:14:18,600 --> 06:14:21,000
see very quickly like this gets very

6410
06:14:21,000 --> 06:14:23,218
complicated as far as like what you're

6411
06:14:23,218 --> 06:14:24,660
looking at in the pcap here and it's

6412
06:14:24,660 --> 06:14:26,040
really important to like start to take

6413
06:14:26,040 --> 06:14:27,780
note of like what are the different

6414
06:14:27,780 --> 06:14:29,160
optimums that you're looking at in there

6415
06:14:29,160 --> 06:14:32,340
those are very often not well leveraged

6416
06:14:32,340 --> 06:14:33,900
but they provide a ton of information

6417
06:14:33,900 --> 06:14:36,298
even if all the data that is being

6418
06:14:36,298 --> 06:14:38,760
transmitted is encrypted if you can

6419
06:14:38,760 --> 06:14:40,260
still see the optimums you can still get

6420
06:14:40,260 --> 06:14:41,940
a really good idea of what is happening

6421
06:14:41,940 --> 06:14:44,280
there because the way that you connect

6422
06:14:44,280 --> 06:14:45,958
over to a machine

6423
06:14:45,958 --> 06:14:48,660
is going to be relatively the same each

6424
06:14:48,660 --> 06:14:51,240
time you launch the wmic and do it over

6425
06:14:51,240 --> 06:14:52,920
that protocol just because you can't see

6426
06:14:52,920 --> 06:14:54,480
the data doesn't mean that you can't see

6427
06:14:54,480 --> 06:14:57,378
that it is happening

6428
06:14:58,200 --> 06:15:00,660
and then for uh wmi for Powershell or

6429
06:15:00,660 --> 06:15:03,058
Powershell for wmi I started getting

6430
06:15:03,058 --> 06:15:05,100
myself confused on this here so I put

6431
06:15:05,100 --> 06:15:06,360
both in this slide here because I

6432
06:15:06,360 --> 06:15:08,340
thought it was funny

6433
06:15:08,340 --> 06:15:09,000
um

6434
06:15:09,000 --> 06:15:10,558
you'll see a lot of different things

6435
06:15:10,558 --> 06:15:13,080
with a get wmi object versus like get

6436
06:15:13,080 --> 06:15:15,360
cim instance this is where it gets a

6437
06:15:15,360 --> 06:15:18,000
little bit confusing and the common

6438
06:15:18,000 --> 06:15:19,440
information model that's what it was

6439
06:15:19,440 --> 06:15:21,058
called

6440
06:15:21,058 --> 06:15:22,138
um

6441
06:15:22,138 --> 06:15:24,000
this is another one of those what's old

6442
06:15:24,000 --> 06:15:25,980
is new again kind of things it's based

6443
06:15:25,980 --> 06:15:28,020
on cim but the newest commands from

6444
06:15:28,020 --> 06:15:29,700
Powershell that you're recommended to

6445
06:15:29,700 --> 06:15:33,000
use are those cim commands and I think

6446
06:15:33,000 --> 06:15:34,260
just about every single one of those

6447
06:15:34,260 --> 06:15:35,638
Powershell queries is going to have Sam

6448
06:15:35,638 --> 06:15:37,740
in there and that's to make sure that

6449
06:15:37,740 --> 06:15:41,218
your support or leveraging a winrm uh

6450
06:15:41,218 --> 06:15:43,378
the Remote Management uh PS session

6451
06:15:43,378 --> 06:15:45,360
making sure that you're doing that a

6452
06:15:45,360 --> 06:15:48,120
secure communication across the clients

6453
06:15:48,120 --> 06:15:51,420
that said you can still leverage the old

6454
06:15:51,420 --> 06:15:54,660
stack and all of those commands in there

6455
06:15:54,660 --> 06:15:56,100
they'll just tell you again it's

6456
06:15:56,100 --> 06:15:59,958
deprecated but you can still use it

6457
06:16:00,120 --> 06:16:01,740
um so again

6458
06:16:01,740 --> 06:16:05,100
wmi requires those ports

6459
06:16:05,100 --> 06:16:05,638
um

6460
06:16:05,638 --> 06:16:09,718
again since Powershell 1.0 you'll see

6461
06:16:09,718 --> 06:16:11,458
attackers sometimes like downgrade their

6462
06:16:11,458 --> 06:16:13,080
Powershell versions a lot of these

6463
06:16:13,080 --> 06:16:13,980
commands are still going to work in

6464
06:16:13,980 --> 06:16:16,138
there like a lot of people downgrade to

6465
06:16:16,138 --> 06:16:17,340
version two or three because there's

6466
06:16:17,340 --> 06:16:18,540
less logging

6467
06:16:18,540 --> 06:16:20,520
but a lot of that functionality is still

6468
06:16:20,520 --> 06:16:21,900
there they can still do what they need

6469
06:16:21,900 --> 06:16:23,820
all they need to do is sideload an

6470
06:16:23,820 --> 06:16:26,040
application into Windows download

6471
06:16:26,040 --> 06:16:28,200
something and execute it it's not very

6472
06:16:28,200 --> 06:16:29,820
complicated commands even if the code

6473
06:16:29,820 --> 06:16:32,638
itself is obfuscated

6474
06:16:32,638 --> 06:16:36,600
and then taking a look at uh cim this is

6475
06:16:36,600 --> 06:16:38,400
the way that they recommend it now it's

6476
06:16:38,400 --> 06:16:39,660
you're starting to get like all those

6477
06:16:39,660 --> 06:16:41,218
XML outputs they're trying to

6478
06:16:41,218 --> 06:16:42,718
standardize it so that way it can work

6479
06:16:42,718 --> 06:16:43,680
with

6480
06:16:43,680 --> 06:16:46,378
um systems that aren't natively Windows

6481
06:16:46,378 --> 06:16:47,820
operating systems

6482
06:16:47,820 --> 06:16:50,100
and especially looking at some of those

6483
06:16:50,100 --> 06:16:51,718
Json outputs that can be very

6484
06:16:51,718 --> 06:16:53,940
intimidating very quickly if you don't

6485
06:16:53,940 --> 06:16:56,420
know what you're doing

6486
06:16:56,638 --> 06:16:58,500
so taking a look here at some of the

6487
06:16:58,500 --> 06:17:00,718
winrm traffic

6488
06:17:00,718 --> 06:17:02,280
um you'll see a lot of different uh

6489
06:17:02,280 --> 06:17:05,280
posts here to WS man

6490
06:17:05,280 --> 06:17:07,558
and one thing to note here too is all

6491
06:17:07,558 --> 06:17:10,260
that communication is all encrypted but

6492
06:17:10,260 --> 06:17:12,058
we can still see that that communication

6493
06:17:12,058 --> 06:17:13,860
is going and I think it's really

6494
06:17:13,860 --> 06:17:16,020
important to highlight like even if we

6495
06:17:16,020 --> 06:17:17,400
can't see the commands that are going on

6496
06:17:17,400 --> 06:17:19,620
there if we were actively looking at an

6497
06:17:19,620 --> 06:17:22,980
attacker we can see and try to detect on

6498
06:17:22,980 --> 06:17:26,700
hey this activity here looks like it's

6499
06:17:26,700 --> 06:17:30,360
related to uh wsman or Ps session and we

6500
06:17:30,360 --> 06:17:31,440
want to start taking a look at that

6501
06:17:31,440 --> 06:17:33,480
because why is that happening with these

6502
06:17:33,480 --> 06:17:36,058
user credentials because that user is

6503
06:17:36,058 --> 06:17:39,298
out this week it it's a very neglected

6504
06:17:39,298 --> 06:17:41,520
uh point of taking a look at there too

6505
06:17:41,520 --> 06:17:43,500
because I know a lot of people's Focus

6506
06:17:43,500 --> 06:17:46,740
mine as well is on EDR you get all the

6507
06:17:46,740 --> 06:17:48,000
sorts of cool little things that you

6508
06:17:48,000 --> 06:17:49,798
could start working with and it's very

6509
06:17:49,798 --> 06:17:51,360
easy to forget that sometimes the

6510
06:17:51,360 --> 06:17:54,000
network traffic just screams out what it

6511
06:17:54,000 --> 06:17:56,878
is even if the data is encrypted like

6512
06:17:56,878 --> 06:17:58,680
if you just look up some of those codes

6513
06:17:58,680 --> 06:18:00,718
what it's connecting to like the admin

6514
06:18:00,718 --> 06:18:03,360
shares like you're still seeing that

6515
06:18:03,360 --> 06:18:06,420
authentication for that admin user and

6516
06:18:06,420 --> 06:18:08,340
then all of this traffic that heavily

6517
06:18:08,340 --> 06:18:10,080
suggests that this is when RM traffic

6518
06:18:10,080 --> 06:18:14,840
going on it's not something to stop at

6519
06:18:14,840 --> 06:18:18,000
and to try to help better illustrate

6520
06:18:18,000 --> 06:18:20,100
this and mostly because I thought it was

6521
06:18:20,100 --> 06:18:21,420
funny

6522
06:18:21,420 --> 06:18:23,400
um here's a really cool

6523
06:18:23,400 --> 06:18:26,040
summary of like some of the miter Tech

6524
06:18:26,040 --> 06:18:28,740
mappings this was a bit Defender paper

6525
06:18:28,740 --> 06:18:31,520
that I had found

6526
06:18:31,980 --> 06:18:34,378
and so you have five in execution three

6527
06:18:34,378 --> 06:18:35,820
persistence

6528
06:18:35,820 --> 06:18:38,280
three in defensive Asian 13 in Discovery

6529
06:18:38,280 --> 06:18:39,958
six in lateral movement one in

6530
06:18:39,958 --> 06:18:41,760
exfiltration

6531
06:18:41,760 --> 06:18:43,378
I would be willing to argue that there's

6532
06:18:43,378 --> 06:18:44,878
potentially more or less than every

6533
06:18:44,878 --> 06:18:46,798
single one of those categories too it's

6534
06:18:46,798 --> 06:18:48,298
a very versatile tool and it's really

6535
06:18:48,298 --> 06:18:50,218
important to try to take a look at like

6536
06:18:50,218 --> 06:18:51,900
this isn't just something that's like

6537
06:18:51,900 --> 06:18:54,058
isolated to like one type of attack or

6538
06:18:54,058 --> 06:18:55,260
something that you can defend against

6539
06:18:55,260 --> 06:18:57,000
you really need to make sure you have

6540
06:18:57,000 --> 06:18:58,740
that defense in depth

6541
06:18:58,740 --> 06:19:01,878
um the layers to The Onion

6542
06:19:02,280 --> 06:19:04,920
so doing some comparisons here

6543
06:19:04,920 --> 06:19:07,378
um you can see like uh for wmic if I

6544
06:19:07,378 --> 06:19:10,080
wanted to get the manufacturer of my uh

6545
06:19:10,080 --> 06:19:11,340
bios

6546
06:19:11,340 --> 06:19:13,798
it's very very simple short commands and

6547
06:19:13,798 --> 06:19:15,120
then if you take it the wmi for

6548
06:19:15,120 --> 06:19:17,218
Powershell command that's way more

6549
06:19:17,218 --> 06:19:18,780
complicated

6550
06:19:18,780 --> 06:19:20,458
same thing with like just calling and

6551
06:19:20,458 --> 06:19:23,700
executing a calc.exe and there you can

6552
06:19:23,700 --> 06:19:25,320
see and I had to double and triple check

6553
06:19:25,320 --> 06:19:27,420
this because I was messing up like path

6554
06:19:27,420 --> 06:19:29,580
versus command line and the arguments in

6555
06:19:29,580 --> 06:19:32,458
there too it's it it's not inherently uh

6556
06:19:32,458 --> 06:19:34,378
user friendly

6557
06:19:34,378 --> 06:19:36,780
but there's a reason for that uh one of

6558
06:19:36,780 --> 06:19:38,340
the reasons is on that previous slide

6559
06:19:38,340 --> 06:19:39,660
there too like you see all those

6560
06:19:39,660 --> 06:19:41,400
different things

6561
06:19:41,400 --> 06:19:42,480
um as far as like all the different

6562
06:19:42,480 --> 06:19:44,820
miter mappings and Frameworks well take

6563
06:19:44,820 --> 06:19:47,040
a look at all the wmic aliases that you

6564
06:19:47,040 --> 06:19:48,540
can call if you're using like the old

6565
06:19:48,540 --> 06:19:49,440
protocol

6566
06:19:49,440 --> 06:19:53,218
again I think this is really funny so

6567
06:19:53,218 --> 06:19:56,638
it there's no feasible way for you to be

6568
06:19:56,638 --> 06:20:00,120
able to recognize and identify all of

6569
06:20:00,120 --> 06:20:01,558
those even if it's something that you're

6570
06:20:01,558 --> 06:20:03,240
working in every single day there's so

6571
06:20:03,240 --> 06:20:06,000
much functionality in there and it gets

6572
06:20:06,000 --> 06:20:07,320
kind of Hidden Away in the fact that

6573
06:20:07,320 --> 06:20:08,940
like a lot of these aliases are very

6574
06:20:08,940 --> 06:20:10,798
short and you can do like very easy

6575
06:20:10,798 --> 06:20:12,360
commands that would take much longer in

6576
06:20:12,360 --> 06:20:14,760
Powershell but the complexity is still

6577
06:20:14,760 --> 06:20:18,557
there it's just a little more obfuscated

6578
06:20:19,440 --> 06:20:21,958
so for securing wmi

6579
06:20:21,958 --> 06:20:22,920
um

6580
06:20:22,920 --> 06:20:25,620
wmy log files don't really exist anymore

6581
06:20:25,620 --> 06:20:27,540
I still see some references and checks

6582
06:20:27,540 --> 06:20:29,638
for them too in a lot of different

6583
06:20:29,638 --> 06:20:30,900
um

6584
06:20:30,900 --> 06:20:34,558
forensic collectors but generally you're

6585
06:20:34,558 --> 06:20:36,660
not going to see that um since Vista

6586
06:20:36,660 --> 06:20:40,798
yeah everything uses uh etw event

6587
06:20:40,798 --> 06:20:45,058
tracing for Windows but only if you

6588
06:20:45,058 --> 06:20:46,620
enable it through something like a

6589
06:20:46,620 --> 06:20:47,958
sysmon

6590
06:20:47,958 --> 06:20:51,240
there are some logging opportunities in

6591
06:20:51,240 --> 06:20:53,760
Windows that you can start looking at

6592
06:20:53,760 --> 06:20:57,958
this screenshot here is the wmi activity

6593
06:20:57,958 --> 06:21:00,020
slash operational

6594
06:21:00,020 --> 06:21:02,458
you can still see here like there are

6595
06:21:02,458 --> 06:21:04,138
events going on

6596
06:21:04,138 --> 06:21:05,580
we're just not going to get a lot of

6597
06:21:05,580 --> 06:21:07,920
description in there I realize that this

6598
06:21:07,920 --> 06:21:09,660
is probably a little small

6599
06:21:09,660 --> 06:21:12,360
uh ultimately what we're seeing here is

6600
06:21:12,360 --> 06:21:14,280
that I'm trying to connect over to

6601
06:21:14,280 --> 06:21:17,700
my machine using the local user

6602
06:21:17,700 --> 06:21:20,040
and then it's saying that there's some

6603
06:21:20,040 --> 06:21:21,120
issues

6604
06:21:21,120 --> 06:21:23,400
with the result code that doesn't mean

6605
06:21:23,400 --> 06:21:25,440
anything and then the reasoning being

6606
06:21:25,440 --> 06:21:28,160
unknown

6607
06:21:30,420 --> 06:21:35,400
one of the other things and I will

6608
06:21:35,400 --> 06:21:38,958
pull this up here

6609
06:21:41,820 --> 06:21:44,900
out that

6610
06:21:46,138 --> 06:21:48,540
with the complexity that you see in a

6611
06:21:48,540 --> 06:21:51,180
lot of these here it's still really cool

6612
06:21:51,180 --> 06:21:53,520
to see that like there's a lot of really

6613
06:21:53,520 --> 06:21:56,940
good documentation on

6614
06:21:56,940 --> 06:21:59,700
from different vendors that are just

6615
06:21:59,700 --> 06:22:01,020
released for free as white papers

6616
06:22:01,020 --> 06:22:02,580
there's paid products and everything too

6617
06:22:02,580 --> 06:22:05,120
but there's a lot of really good

6618
06:22:05,120 --> 06:22:08,580
in-depth articles this is from the

6619
06:22:08,580 --> 06:22:11,340
center for Internet Security they

6620
06:22:11,340 --> 06:22:14,218
released the paper in December 2021 and

6621
06:22:14,218 --> 06:22:15,660
this is just commonly exploited

6622
06:22:15,660 --> 06:22:18,420
protocols wmi and then if we take a look

6623
06:22:18,420 --> 06:22:20,100
here too this is just focusing on

6624
06:22:20,100 --> 06:22:21,900
initial access here and if you start

6625
06:22:21,900 --> 06:22:23,458
taking a look going down a little bit

6626
06:22:23,458 --> 06:22:25,080
further here

6627
06:22:25,080 --> 06:22:27,000
you can see like it just starts going

6628
06:22:27,000 --> 06:22:28,740
through line by line all these different

6629
06:22:28,740 --> 06:22:29,638
things that you're going to want to

6630
06:22:29,638 --> 06:22:31,200
consider start disabling they start

6631
06:22:31,200 --> 06:22:32,340
breaking it down into the different

6632
06:22:32,340 --> 06:22:35,458
levels uh for like just basic hygiene

6633
06:22:35,458 --> 06:22:37,440
versus like fully secured

6634
06:22:37,440 --> 06:22:39,980
but

6635
06:22:40,200 --> 06:22:42,298
a lot of time and effort went into

6636
06:22:42,298 --> 06:22:46,378
building out these papers here and it's

6637
06:22:46,378 --> 06:22:48,180
only a disservice to yourself and your

6638
06:22:48,180 --> 06:22:50,280
company if you're not looking at

6639
06:22:50,280 --> 06:22:52,080
leveraging all these do you have

6640
06:22:52,080 --> 06:22:53,520
centralized logging do you have network

6641
06:22:53,520 --> 06:22:56,340
monitoring or detection IDs IPS those

6642
06:22:56,340 --> 06:22:58,080
kinds of things do you have some sort of

6643
06:22:58,080 --> 06:22:59,940
EDR on the system

6644
06:22:59,940 --> 06:23:01,920
do you have anything in there to kind of

6645
06:23:01,920 --> 06:23:05,040
manage or test uh the system on logging

6646
06:23:05,040 --> 06:23:07,138
that's in there which is possible

6647
06:23:07,138 --> 06:23:09,240
you're already getting way more data

6648
06:23:09,240 --> 06:23:10,500
that you can start filtering on and

6649
06:23:10,500 --> 06:23:12,240
start looking for things like hey

6650
06:23:12,240 --> 06:23:14,638
I want to look for encoded Powershell

6651
06:23:14,638 --> 06:23:17,940
that is in any of those event consumers

6652
06:23:17,940 --> 06:23:20,458
that is already a huge step for General

6653
06:23:20,458 --> 06:23:23,100
Explorer too it's

6654
06:23:23,100 --> 06:23:24,420
there's a lot of different things in

6655
06:23:24,420 --> 06:23:26,340
there that you can start leveraging and

6656
06:23:26,340 --> 06:23:28,020
then something like a Zeke you can start

6657
06:23:28,020 --> 06:23:30,360
detecting on the relevant optimums you

6658
06:23:30,360 --> 06:23:32,580
can start taking a look at SMB traffic

6659
06:23:32,580 --> 06:23:35,700
that um is anomalous like why is this

6660
06:23:35,700 --> 06:23:38,100
one machine connecting out to four five

6661
06:23:38,100 --> 06:23:40,020
six different machines all within a span

6662
06:23:40,020 --> 06:23:40,740
of

6663
06:23:40,740 --> 06:23:42,958
15-20 minutes like

6664
06:23:42,958 --> 06:23:45,660
that Network detection there might be

6665
06:23:45,660 --> 06:23:48,000
the signal and you now have like a 30

6666
06:23:48,000 --> 06:23:50,458
minute lead time onto

6667
06:23:50,458 --> 06:23:52,740
being able to respond to a threat actor

6668
06:23:52,740 --> 06:23:54,058
that's in your environment that you just

6669
06:23:54,058 --> 06:23:57,000
did not detect it's again something that

6670
06:23:57,000 --> 06:24:00,180
I've seen slept on too much where the

6671
06:24:00,180 --> 06:24:01,920
network detection is really good I can't

6672
06:24:01,920 --> 06:24:04,138
see the traffic that's in there but I

6673
06:24:04,138 --> 06:24:05,458
can see that something is wrong we're

6674
06:24:05,458 --> 06:24:07,138
seeing all those authentications to like

6675
06:24:07,138 --> 06:24:08,820
those uh admin shares on a bunch of

6676
06:24:08,820 --> 06:24:10,740
different machines something's going on

6677
06:24:10,740 --> 06:24:12,420
here I can start ringing the bells

6678
06:24:12,420 --> 06:24:13,860
before they start actually executing

6679
06:24:13,860 --> 06:24:15,660
commands and successfully gaining

6680
06:24:15,660 --> 06:24:17,458
control in there we already have that

6681
06:24:17,458 --> 06:24:19,260
one step up versus not having those

6682
06:24:19,260 --> 06:24:21,718
Network detections

6683
06:24:21,718 --> 06:24:24,360
and then again just

6684
06:24:24,360 --> 06:24:26,160
having a solution is more important than

6685
06:24:26,160 --> 06:24:28,378
a specific one I like the free ones

6686
06:24:28,378 --> 06:24:29,840
because I get to play around with them

6687
06:24:29,840 --> 06:24:32,280
but if you have like those really cool

6688
06:24:32,280 --> 06:24:33,840
fancy expensive tools that your

6689
06:24:33,840 --> 06:24:35,218
organization like

6690
06:24:35,218 --> 06:24:37,620
are you leveraging them correctly

6691
06:24:37,620 --> 06:24:39,780
like is it another Blinky box that's in

6692
06:24:39,780 --> 06:24:41,820
your closet or that the sock is doing

6693
06:24:41,820 --> 06:24:42,840
too it's

6694
06:24:42,840 --> 06:24:45,180
again unfortunately see it it's they

6695
06:24:45,180 --> 06:24:47,040
will pay for a security product

6696
06:24:47,040 --> 06:24:49,260
and they're not paying for a team that's

6697
06:24:49,260 --> 06:24:51,718
managing and checking on those alerts

6698
06:24:51,718 --> 06:24:53,760
it's just getting added up to the queue

6699
06:24:53,760 --> 06:24:55,378
and then you start calling in somebody

6700
06:24:55,378 --> 06:24:56,760
that does incident response to that

6701
06:24:56,760 --> 06:24:59,580
organization there's like 6 000 events

6702
06:24:59,580 --> 06:25:02,340
and this single pane all critical since

6703
06:25:02,340 --> 06:25:03,900
like a year and a half ago when they

6704
06:25:03,900 --> 06:25:05,700
bought the product like

6705
06:25:05,700 --> 06:25:07,740
you you wasted a year and a half worth

6706
06:25:07,740 --> 06:25:09,840
of money on that subscription there and

6707
06:25:09,840 --> 06:25:12,718
it's it just hurts to see like

6708
06:25:12,718 --> 06:25:14,940
you you already spent a bit just spend a

6709
06:25:14,940 --> 06:25:17,359
little bit more

6710
06:25:18,180 --> 06:25:21,058
and then taking a look at things so a

6711
06:25:21,058 --> 06:25:23,820
snapshot in Time versus live response

6712
06:25:23,820 --> 06:25:25,940
um

6713
06:25:26,820 --> 06:25:29,100
once you start taking a look at it too

6714
06:25:29,100 --> 06:25:30,480
um especially if the threat actor is

6715
06:25:30,480 --> 06:25:32,820
still in the environment just having

6716
06:25:32,820 --> 06:25:34,558
that snapshot

6717
06:25:34,558 --> 06:25:36,660
very good but if you also don't have

6718
06:25:36,660 --> 06:25:38,638
like a live response part of it as well

6719
06:25:38,638 --> 06:25:40,020
too you're going to start missing some

6720
06:25:40,020 --> 06:25:42,540
of those events because if I do a

6721
06:25:42,540 --> 06:25:45,058
collection with Velociraptor or if I

6722
06:25:45,058 --> 06:25:47,218
start pulling all the event logs with uh

6723
06:25:47,218 --> 06:25:49,020
Kanza or whatever other tool in there

6724
06:25:49,020 --> 06:25:51,718
for that period of time I have the best

6725
06:25:51,718 --> 06:25:53,760
logging I can possibly have but what if

6726
06:25:53,760 --> 06:25:54,840
the threat actor is still in there

6727
06:25:54,840 --> 06:25:56,400
they're going to still start moving

6728
06:25:56,400 --> 06:25:58,440
around leveraging deleting adding in

6729
06:25:58,440 --> 06:26:00,900
those event consumers or any other

6730
06:26:00,900 --> 06:26:02,820
alerts really too and it's really

6731
06:26:02,820 --> 06:26:05,340
important to make sure that your

6732
06:26:05,340 --> 06:26:07,138
understanding and at least acknowledging

6733
06:26:07,138 --> 06:26:08,700
that you might have coverage gaps in

6734
06:26:08,700 --> 06:26:11,160
there so again going back having an EDR

6735
06:26:11,160 --> 06:26:12,420
product in place you can start getting

6736
06:26:12,420 --> 06:26:14,100
those real-time detections and responses

6737
06:26:14,100 --> 06:26:15,540
you might have to deploy out those

6738
06:26:15,540 --> 06:26:17,160
friends of collectors again

6739
06:26:17,160 --> 06:26:20,700
but you at least get that alert

6740
06:26:20,700 --> 06:26:22,798
and if you don't have centralized

6741
06:26:22,798 --> 06:26:25,260
logging I really hope that your threat

6742
06:26:25,260 --> 06:26:26,700
actor that you deal with is not

6743
06:26:26,700 --> 06:26:28,680
destructive because

6744
06:26:28,680 --> 06:26:30,840
BitLocker is very hard to recover from

6745
06:26:30,840 --> 06:26:33,980
if they set it up right

6746
06:26:34,320 --> 06:26:36,240
um some of the resources here

6747
06:26:36,240 --> 06:26:37,680
um

6748
06:26:37,680 --> 06:26:40,020
the top two definitely are kind of my

6749
06:26:40,020 --> 06:26:42,718
go-to's and whenever I'm training up

6750
06:26:42,718 --> 06:26:45,660
somebody new it's I always recommend

6751
06:26:45,660 --> 06:26:47,940
um ss64 at the very least

6752
06:26:47,940 --> 06:26:51,420
they have it's my go-to man page they

6753
06:26:51,420 --> 06:26:52,920
have all sorts of great examples and

6754
06:26:52,920 --> 06:26:54,840
everything in there

6755
06:26:54,840 --> 06:26:57,000
um anytime I need to start figuring out

6756
06:26:57,000 --> 06:26:59,638
what a command does they have

6757
06:26:59,638 --> 06:27:02,160
what parameters that it takes what

6758
06:27:02,160 --> 06:27:04,200
examples there are too if it's

6759
06:27:04,200 --> 06:27:05,820
depreciated or not it'll have links to

6760
06:27:05,820 --> 06:27:07,020
the proper commands and everything too

6761
06:27:07,020 --> 06:27:09,000
very very quick and easy to search

6762
06:27:09,000 --> 06:27:11,458
through and I I can't shout it out

6763
06:27:11,458 --> 06:27:12,440
enough

6764
06:27:12,440 --> 06:27:15,120
powershell.1 that site was basically my

6765
06:27:15,120 --> 06:27:17,940
go-to for a lot of trying to break this

6766
06:27:17,940 --> 06:27:20,638
apart I hope it was understandable if

6767
06:27:20,638 --> 06:27:22,320
not at the very least

6768
06:27:22,320 --> 06:27:24,058
you'll get angry enough that you'll go

6769
06:27:24,058 --> 06:27:25,320
and look up some of the other stuff I

6770
06:27:25,320 --> 06:27:27,240
referenced to learn it better

6771
06:27:27,240 --> 06:27:29,280
and then just uh some other things too

6772
06:27:29,280 --> 06:27:33,079
that I've referred to more than once

6773
06:27:33,420 --> 06:27:35,940
and that is actually going to be the end

6774
06:27:35,940 --> 06:27:39,058
of my presentation here

6775
06:27:39,058 --> 06:27:40,860
um at this time if there are any

6776
06:27:40,860 --> 06:27:42,900
questions I can at least attempt to

6777
06:27:42,900 --> 06:27:44,820
answer them

6778
06:27:44,820 --> 06:27:46,440
I've got microphones here too we'd love

6779
06:27:46,440 --> 06:27:47,700
you speaking to hear so you don't have

6780
06:27:47,700 --> 06:27:49,680
to uh so people can online can hear it

6781
06:27:49,680 --> 06:27:51,120
and I do have some online questions too

6782
06:27:51,120 --> 06:27:53,360
so

6783
06:27:53,520 --> 06:27:56,180
catch

6784
06:27:58,920 --> 06:28:02,100
um for the logging uh good point for the

6785
06:28:02,100 --> 06:28:03,840
centralized but

6786
06:28:03,840 --> 06:28:05,580
um for some organizations they're not

6787
06:28:05,580 --> 06:28:06,958
able to have their you know their

6788
06:28:06,958 --> 06:28:09,480
endpoints their their workstations send

6789
06:28:09,480 --> 06:28:11,638
like logging like for Powershell to a

6790
06:28:11,638 --> 06:28:13,798
central spot so is there another way

6791
06:28:13,798 --> 06:28:17,100
that we can look for that you know that

6792
06:28:17,100 --> 06:28:17,878
history

6793
06:28:17,878 --> 06:28:20,458
of commands that are run

6794
06:28:20,458 --> 06:28:21,958
well there's a couple different things

6795
06:28:21,958 --> 06:28:23,878
that you can take a look at if it was

6796
06:28:23,878 --> 06:28:26,100
done remotely there's going to be logs

6797
06:28:26,100 --> 06:28:28,320
on the originating systems you'll

6798
06:28:28,320 --> 06:28:29,878
hopefully have some authentication in

6799
06:28:29,878 --> 06:28:31,378
there as well too

6800
06:28:31,378 --> 06:28:31,920
um

6801
06:28:31,920 --> 06:28:34,500
this goes a little bit more into

6802
06:28:34,500 --> 06:28:36,058
if you have the environment set up

6803
06:28:36,058 --> 06:28:38,160
correctly if you have like cached admin

6804
06:28:38,160 --> 06:28:40,260
credentials on the local machine and it

6805
06:28:40,260 --> 06:28:42,298
doesn't connect back until like time of

6806
06:28:42,298 --> 06:28:43,440
compromise

6807
06:28:43,440 --> 06:28:45,000
you're going to be a little Sol there

6808
06:28:45,000 --> 06:28:46,798
but assuming that those things are

6809
06:28:46,798 --> 06:28:48,480
correct if you have like network

6810
06:28:48,480 --> 06:28:49,798
monitoring and start seeing those

6811
06:28:49,798 --> 06:28:52,200
commands going across there again if

6812
06:28:52,200 --> 06:28:53,520
it's encrypted

6813
06:28:53,520 --> 06:28:55,260
your Sol but you can see that those

6814
06:28:55,260 --> 06:28:57,360
commands were executed you can see the

6815
06:28:57,360 --> 06:28:59,520
users that were leveraging that because

6816
06:28:59,520 --> 06:29:01,080
that authentication does need to happen

6817
06:29:01,080 --> 06:29:03,718
if it's over SNB for example

6818
06:29:03,718 --> 06:29:06,718
but if it's not able to check in very

6819
06:29:06,718 --> 06:29:08,400
frequently I know there's some online

6820
06:29:08,400 --> 06:29:11,218
Solutions So like um

6821
06:29:11,218 --> 06:29:16,260
Microsoft's like a 365 defender or

6822
06:29:16,260 --> 06:29:19,500
firewall Defender ATP or whatever

6823
06:29:19,500 --> 06:29:23,160
they've renamed it to now like

6824
06:29:23,160 --> 06:29:24,660
I hate their naming structure on it but

6825
06:29:24,660 --> 06:29:26,878
that tool is really really powerful and

6826
06:29:26,878 --> 06:29:28,620
gathers way more than I'll ever need

6827
06:29:28,620 --> 06:29:30,000
when I'm trying to do an investigation

6828
06:29:30,000 --> 06:29:31,620
as long as it can connect to the

6829
06:29:31,620 --> 06:29:32,940
internet there's a lot of good different

6830
06:29:32,940 --> 06:29:34,798
tools out there like EDR solutions that

6831
06:29:34,798 --> 06:29:36,298
can at least forward

6832
06:29:36,298 --> 06:29:40,039
relevant events as it captures

6833
06:29:44,940 --> 06:29:47,480
questions here

6834
06:29:48,900 --> 06:29:51,320
okay

6835
06:29:53,218 --> 06:29:57,000
am I going to post my slides uh yes I

6836
06:29:57,000 --> 06:29:59,520
will post them in the Discord either

6837
06:29:59,520 --> 06:30:02,240
tonight or tomorrow morning

6838
06:30:02,240 --> 06:30:06,780
and if I don't do that my username is at

6839
06:30:06,780 --> 06:30:09,058
augment and feel free to just pester me

6840
06:30:09,058 --> 06:30:11,580
in there too for them so

6841
06:30:11,580 --> 06:30:13,860
so uh from online we have a question

6842
06:30:13,860 --> 06:30:16,558
from uh Matt tiger

6843
06:30:16,558 --> 06:30:19,740
um get uh CM instance was said to use

6844
06:30:19,740 --> 06:30:25,558
winrm uh over uh uh 59.85 1596. how does

6845
06:30:25,558 --> 06:30:27,840
this usage change and how does Telemetry

6846
06:30:27,840 --> 06:30:30,840
change if PS remoting is configured to

6847
06:30:30,840 --> 06:30:33,558
go over SSH

6848
06:30:35,160 --> 06:30:37,280
that I am not sure off off the topic

6849
06:30:37,280 --> 06:30:39,958
it's a

6850
06:30:39,958 --> 06:30:41,878
well he seems to be here on the Stream

6851
06:30:41,878 --> 06:30:44,400
So if he wants to clarify or ask a

6852
06:30:44,400 --> 06:30:46,080
little bit differently I'll get back to

6853
06:30:46,080 --> 06:30:48,958
you yeah yeah it's um again if you can

6854
06:30:48,958 --> 06:30:50,760
just add me in the uh right channel

6855
06:30:50,760 --> 06:30:51,718
there

6856
06:30:51,718 --> 06:30:54,000
um augment it should have my uh silly

6857
06:30:54,000 --> 06:30:55,200
face in there and I should be the roll

6858
06:30:55,200 --> 06:30:57,058
speaker but I'll get back to you on that

6859
06:30:57,058 --> 06:30:58,680
too is I just have to double check first

6860
06:30:58,680 --> 06:31:01,100
sure

6861
06:31:04,138 --> 06:31:06,980
any other questions

6862
06:31:08,458 --> 06:31:11,040
all right okay well with that uh thank

my talk uh second year in a row

6865
06:31:14,100 --> 06:31:16,877

6955
06:53:30,000 --> 06:53:32,700
expired domains led to Facebook ATO so

6956
06:53:32,700 --> 06:53:35,718
please give them a warm welcome

6957
06:53:39,958 --> 06:53:42,180
thanks guys thanks for showing up uh as

6958
06:53:42,180 --> 06:53:44,040
you said how expired domains lead to

6959
06:53:44,040 --> 06:53:46,378
Facebook ATO

6960
06:53:46,378 --> 06:53:49,138
a little bit about me I'm John

6961
06:53:49,138 --> 06:53:51,298
I've been at Gurney for 13 years a

6962
06:53:51,298 --> 06:53:53,100
little bit of time uh during that time

6963
06:53:53,100 --> 06:53:54,660
I've done instant response a little bit

6964
06:53:54,660 --> 06:53:56,520
of threat until currently I'm the

6965
06:53:56,520 --> 06:53:57,958
technical lead for the customer threat

6966
06:53:57,958 --> 06:53:58,860
hunt team

6967
06:53:58,860 --> 06:54:00,240
uh if you feel like following somebody

6968
06:54:00,240 --> 06:54:02,820
who doesn't post on uh Mastodon you can

6969
06:54:02,820 --> 06:54:05,120
follow me

6970
06:54:06,058 --> 06:54:08,160
similarly on Twitter but

6971
06:54:08,160 --> 06:54:10,320
um so our agenda today uh we're going to

6972
06:54:10,320 --> 06:54:12,120
talk about a few things but largely the

6973
06:54:12,120 --> 06:54:14,340
what and the how you know what is it how

6974
06:54:14,340 --> 06:54:16,680
does it happen uh the money anything

6975
06:54:16,680 --> 06:54:19,200
worth doing is doing for money and then

6976
06:54:19,200 --> 06:54:20,340
the threat actors overview we're going

6977
06:54:20,340 --> 06:54:21,840
to do a high level overview these three

6978
06:54:21,840 --> 06:54:24,298
actors are pretty interesting and that

6979
06:54:24,298 --> 06:54:25,978
they're a great jumping off point for

6980
06:54:25,978 --> 06:54:29,520
oscent so if you haven't done OSN taking

6981
06:54:29,520 --> 06:54:30,718
some indicators from this and then

6982
06:54:30,718 --> 06:54:32,580
playing with it yourself is a good one

6983
06:54:32,580 --> 06:54:34,020
uh we're also going to be talking about

6984
06:54:34,020 --> 06:54:36,958
some specific indicators that we saw

6985
06:54:36,958 --> 06:54:38,760
um that you can continue to do some OSS

6986
06:54:38,760 --> 06:54:40,378
hunting with and then we're going to

6987
06:54:40,378 --> 06:54:42,000
give some guidance on you know how to

6988
06:54:42,000 --> 06:54:43,920
secure your Facebook business account a

6989
06:54:43,920 --> 06:54:45,180
little bit how can this how can you

6990
06:54:45,180 --> 06:54:48,260
prevent this from happening to you

6991
06:54:48,298 --> 06:54:51,058
so the what and how it's uh

6992
06:54:51,058 --> 06:54:54,058
disappointingly simple right uh in this

6993
06:54:54,058 --> 06:54:56,340
case a domain expires happens all the

6994
06:54:56,340 --> 06:54:58,860
time a small business stops being a

6995
06:54:58,860 --> 06:55:01,138
small business but in our case our

6996
06:55:01,138 --> 06:55:02,218
threat actor performs some

6997
06:55:02,218 --> 06:55:03,900
reconnaissance it's

6998
06:55:03,900 --> 06:55:05,940
um they find you know lists of expired

6999
06:55:05,940 --> 06:55:08,240
domains domainers do this all the time

7000
06:55:08,240 --> 06:55:10,500
Registries post these lists these are

7001
06:55:10,500 --> 06:55:11,940
easy to come by a quick Google search

7002
06:55:11,940 --> 06:55:15,000
away but then our thracter does a little

7003
06:55:15,000 --> 06:55:16,920
bit more Recon and realize it's worth

7004
06:55:16,920 --> 06:55:19,080
re-registering this domain it's tied to

7005
06:55:19,080 --> 06:55:20,878
a Facebook account or something similar

7006
06:55:20,878 --> 06:55:23,280
then they do some quick DNS entries they

7007
06:55:23,280 --> 06:55:24,780
do a password reset and now they own

7008
06:55:24,780 --> 06:55:25,860
your Facebook account

7009
06:55:25,860 --> 06:55:27,840
so it's super simple

7010
06:55:27,840 --> 06:55:28,378
um

7011
06:55:28,378 --> 06:55:30,120
I want to call it dangling domains but

7012
06:55:30,120 --> 06:55:31,860
that's a terrible name and I hate it so

7013
06:55:31,860 --> 06:55:33,360
if you come up with something better

7014
06:55:33,360 --> 06:55:35,458
please let me know but it's it's pretty

7015
06:55:35,458 --> 06:55:36,958
much adjacent to the idea of dangling

7016
06:55:36,958 --> 06:55:39,120
domains if you're familiar with that

7017
06:55:39,120 --> 06:55:41,940
so what does the Recon look like in this

7018
06:55:41,940 --> 06:55:42,900
case

7019
06:55:42,900 --> 06:55:44,520
can you read it

7020
06:55:44,520 --> 06:55:47,458
so so uh

7021
06:55:47,458 --> 06:55:49,940
here's our example domain of

7022
06:55:49,940 --> 06:55:53,160
ccgolfcarts.net I preceded a little bit

7023
06:55:53,160 --> 06:55:55,978
on this one but you can see that in the

7024
06:55:55,978 --> 06:55:57,660
first image if you just Google The

7025
06:55:57,660 --> 06:55:58,798
Domain you'll see there are a number of

7026
06:55:58,798 --> 06:56:00,780
lists of these are just lists of expired

7027
06:56:00,780 --> 06:56:03,058
domains that come out you know at the

7028
06:56:03,058 --> 06:56:05,280
end of the year usually they're easier

7029
06:56:05,280 --> 06:56:07,020
to find when they're res you know not

7030
06:56:07,020 --> 06:56:09,240
fresh so two three years back they'll be

7031
06:56:09,240 --> 06:56:11,040
free you'll probably have to pay for

7032
06:56:11,040 --> 06:56:13,378
ones that are more recent but similarly

7033
06:56:13,378 --> 06:56:14,580
on the image on the right you can see

7034
06:56:14,580 --> 06:56:16,320
hey they've they've got a Facebook page

7035
06:56:16,320 --> 06:56:18,780
they've got a Facebook business page so

7036
06:56:18,780 --> 06:56:21,120
this is already somebody who is expired

7037
06:56:21,120 --> 06:56:23,040
to Maine but a domain that's tied to a

7038
06:56:23,040 --> 06:56:25,200
Facebook account

7039
06:56:25,200 --> 06:56:27,840
and uh this means been around a while

7040
06:56:27,840 --> 06:56:30,240
since we got carts.net you can see just

7041
06:56:30,240 --> 06:56:32,218
from the vars total info that isn't

7042
06:56:32,218 --> 06:56:34,320
all-inclusive uh they've been around a

7043
06:56:34,320 --> 06:56:35,340
while

7044
06:56:35,340 --> 06:56:37,860
um this goes back to 2019 but our

7045
06:56:37,860 --> 06:56:39,660
friends at the way back machine have a

7046
06:56:39,660 --> 06:56:42,660
copy of the website from 2009. so this

7047
06:56:42,660 --> 06:56:44,458
is a business that was around for a

7048
06:56:44,458 --> 06:56:46,200
while it's not brand new it wasn't flash

7049
06:56:46,200 --> 06:56:48,298
in the pan they were around for a while

7050
06:56:48,298 --> 06:56:50,520
before they let that domain last let it

7051
06:56:50,520 --> 06:56:52,920
fall and it also changed hands between a

7052
06:56:52,920 --> 06:56:55,080
number of registrars

7053
06:56:55,080 --> 06:56:58,260
so we've done a Recon

7054
06:56:58,260 --> 06:56:59,878
we'll assume that at this point our

7055
06:56:59,878 --> 06:57:01,378
threat actors have registered that

7056
06:57:01,378 --> 06:57:03,478
domain you know what comes next DNS

7057
06:57:03,478 --> 06:57:05,878
entries but what DNS entries in this

7058
06:57:05,878 --> 06:57:08,638
case just some email it's a MX records

7059
06:57:08,638 --> 06:57:12,080
uh Ford email.net is one of many

7060
06:57:12,080 --> 06:57:15,718
providers that will afford email for you

7061
06:57:15,718 --> 06:57:17,520
for a domain literally anywhere you want

7062
06:57:17,520 --> 06:57:20,520
in this case you set the NS records you

7063
06:57:20,520 --> 06:57:21,718
set a text record that says okay

7064
06:57:21,718 --> 06:57:23,100
ultimately

7065
06:57:23,100 --> 06:57:25,200
turn this domain into a catch-all for it

7066
06:57:25,200 --> 06:57:26,700
here forward it to my Google forward it

7067
06:57:26,700 --> 06:57:29,218
to my Hotmail my protonmail you know

7068
06:57:29,218 --> 06:57:31,740
whatever you happen to have right uh and

7069
06:57:31,740 --> 06:57:33,360
almost all these providers

7070
06:57:33,360 --> 06:57:35,700
these are all free there are some that

7071
06:57:35,700 --> 06:57:38,040
you know have premium paid versions uh

7072
06:57:38,040 --> 06:57:40,138
provide a little bit more services uh

7073
06:57:40,138 --> 06:57:41,760
but these are these are all free simple

7074
06:57:41,760 --> 06:57:43,740
to sign up each and every one of them is

7075
06:57:43,740 --> 06:57:45,240
going to have a support article to tell

7076
06:57:45,240 --> 06:57:47,100
you how to do this at your Registrar of

7077
06:57:47,100 --> 06:57:49,080
choice you know go to any namecheap name

7078
06:57:49,080 --> 06:57:51,420
Silo whoever right

7079
06:57:51,420 --> 06:57:53,218
um so there's a lot of options here to

7080
06:57:53,218 --> 06:57:55,680
to kind of do this which makes you know

7081
06:57:55,680 --> 06:57:57,420
things for attackers it's simple it's

7082
06:57:57,420 --> 06:57:58,378
easy

7083
06:57:58,378 --> 06:57:59,700
they go with whoever they're most

7084
06:57:59,700 --> 06:58:02,520
familiar with whoever they like the most

7085
06:58:02,520 --> 06:58:04,920
so continuing our Recon if you look at

7086
06:58:04,920 --> 06:58:07,080
the Facebook page for our friends you

7087
06:58:07,080 --> 06:58:10,260
know ccgolfguards.net they they list out

7088
06:58:10,260 --> 06:58:12,058
some contact information interestingly

7089
06:58:12,058 --> 06:58:13,680
enough the email address as you'd expect

7090
06:58:13,680 --> 06:58:17,180
is an email at ccgolfcarts.net

7091
06:58:17,180 --> 06:58:19,320
the downside of that being though is

7092
06:58:19,320 --> 06:58:20,940
that Facebook is kind enough if you

7093
06:58:20,940 --> 06:58:23,160
submit that as a hey I think I've

7094
06:58:23,160 --> 06:58:25,680
forgotten my password this might be the

7095
06:58:25,680 --> 06:58:27,660
email address they will happily tell you

7096
06:58:27,660 --> 06:58:30,478
that yeah it is the email address uh do

7097
06:58:30,478 --> 06:58:31,860
you want us to send that password reset

7098
06:58:31,860 --> 06:58:33,540
to the email address or to the phone

7099
06:58:33,540 --> 06:58:34,978
number

7100
06:58:34,978 --> 06:58:35,878
um

7101
06:58:35,878 --> 06:58:38,218
simple forwarding of that email we're

7102
06:58:38,218 --> 06:58:39,240
done

7103
06:58:39,240 --> 06:58:41,280
passive reset we're in

7104
06:58:41,280 --> 06:58:43,080
that's

7105
06:58:43,080 --> 06:58:45,120
honestly that's the Crux of the attack

7106
06:58:45,120 --> 06:58:47,218
and that's how simple the attack is

7107
06:58:47,218 --> 06:58:48,780
you know there's there's no real

7108
06:58:48,780 --> 06:58:50,760
expertise there's just a little bit of

7109
06:58:50,760 --> 06:58:53,580
leg work a little bit of Googling here

7110
06:58:53,580 --> 06:58:54,540
you go

7111
06:58:54,540 --> 06:58:56,820
uh very very simple

7112
06:58:56,820 --> 06:58:58,558
so but what do you do once you've got

7113
06:58:58,558 --> 06:59:01,138
that domain the marketplaces you gotta

7114
06:59:01,138 --> 06:59:02,400
sell that you gotta sell that Facebook

7115
06:59:02,400 --> 06:59:05,820
access uh cozyfb.com oh I'll give you

7116
06:59:05,820 --> 06:59:07,740
the warning um all these are translated

7117
06:59:07,740 --> 06:59:09,900
images so if you can read Vietnamese you

7118
06:59:09,900 --> 06:59:12,780
can really get into it but this is the

7119
06:59:12,780 --> 06:59:14,280
best Google translate could do for us so

7120
06:59:14,280 --> 06:59:16,440
if it looks weird or sounds weird that's

7121
06:59:16,440 --> 06:59:18,240
why uh

7122
06:59:18,240 --> 06:59:19,798
I figured you'd get more out of it being

7123
06:59:19,798 --> 06:59:21,240
in English

7124
06:59:21,240 --> 06:59:23,218
um because the fb.com is is super

7125
06:59:23,218 --> 06:59:24,900
popular one of the bigger ones that we

7126
06:59:24,900 --> 06:59:26,760
saw being used

7127
06:59:26,760 --> 06:59:30,058
um shop via the VN another one you'll

7128
06:59:30,058 --> 06:59:31,740
note that they kind of have similar

7129
06:59:31,740 --> 06:59:34,080
layouts these sites look a little a

7130
06:59:34,080 --> 06:59:35,638
little similar

7131
06:59:35,638 --> 06:59:36,718
um

7132
06:59:36,718 --> 06:59:38,280
the other thing though is these sites

7133
06:59:38,280 --> 06:59:40,500
are super user friendly you just go into

7134
06:59:40,500 --> 06:59:41,878
YouTube and they're going to link you to

7135
06:59:41,878 --> 06:59:43,860
how do you use this site how do you

7136
06:59:43,860 --> 06:59:45,660
purchase Facebook accounts how do you

7137
06:59:45,660 --> 06:59:47,940
pay us how do you almost all of them use

7138
06:59:47,940 --> 06:59:50,760
sort of a uh you know you transfer funds

7139
06:59:50,760 --> 06:59:53,218
from a card onto the site you re-up you

7140
06:59:53,218 --> 06:59:54,840
buy but they're going to walk you

7141
06:59:54,840 --> 06:59:56,340
through step by step how to do all of

7142
06:59:56,340 --> 06:59:57,540
this they're going to walk you through

7143
06:59:57,540 --> 07:00:00,120
you know here's the preferred VPN to use

7144
07:00:00,120 --> 07:00:01,260
to connect they're going to walk you

7145
07:00:01,260 --> 07:00:03,900
through oh we provided you a 2fa secret

7146
07:00:03,900 --> 07:00:06,058
code here's how you generate that login

7147
07:00:06,058 --> 07:00:07,920
to be able to log in they're very user

7148
07:00:07,920 --> 07:00:09,478
friendly they have support on the front

7149
07:00:09,478 --> 07:00:11,458
of the site you know it'll pop up that

7150
07:00:11,458 --> 07:00:12,958
annoying Chat thing in the corner that

7151
07:00:12,958 --> 07:00:14,120
we all ignore

7152
07:00:14,120 --> 07:00:16,200
so they're super user friendly they're

7153
07:00:16,200 --> 07:00:18,420
meant to be as easy as possible

7154
07:00:18,420 --> 07:00:20,100
but if you want to kind of follow this

7155
07:00:20,100 --> 07:00:22,558
money a little bit more

7156
07:00:22,558 --> 07:00:24,600
how how much are these accounts selling

7157
07:00:24,600 --> 07:00:27,600
for good pretty cheap the VM here is a

7158
07:00:27,600 --> 07:00:29,160
business manager account and those are

7159
07:00:29,160 --> 07:00:31,320
typically worth a little bit more purely

7160
07:00:31,320 --> 07:00:34,020
because more than likely they can run

7161
07:00:34,020 --> 07:00:35,160
ads

7162
07:00:35,160 --> 07:00:36,540
that's a big part of what these guys

7163
07:00:36,540 --> 07:00:38,100
want to do is they want to run ads and

7164
07:00:38,100 --> 07:00:40,320
push you somewhere else

7165
07:00:40,320 --> 07:00:41,700
um they'll kind of in the marketing game

7166
07:00:41,700 --> 07:00:43,920
is it marketing for cryptos and

7167
07:00:43,920 --> 07:00:46,680
marketing for Gucci handbags it doesn't

7168
07:00:46,680 --> 07:00:48,360
matter but they want to be able to push

7169
07:00:48,360 --> 07:00:49,860
you somewhere else this is another means

7170
07:00:49,860 --> 07:00:51,360
to an end but these accounts are

7171
07:00:51,360 --> 07:00:53,280
relatively cheap

7172
07:00:53,280 --> 07:00:55,260
um these are out of stock but in this

7173
07:00:55,260 --> 07:00:56,940
case they're like you know four five

7174
07:00:56,940 --> 07:00:58,860
bucks

7175
07:00:58,860 --> 07:01:00,600
um so for these guys to make money they

7176
07:01:00,600 --> 07:01:02,700
kind of they do this at volume right

7177
07:01:02,700 --> 07:01:04,680
it's not just onesie twosies you're

7178
07:01:04,680 --> 07:01:05,520
going to see that they're going to be

7179
07:01:05,520 --> 07:01:08,718
doing this quite a bit

7180
07:01:09,120 --> 07:01:10,978
similarly some of these uh fan pages

7181
07:01:10,978 --> 07:01:12,360
which are ones that are not necessarily

7182
07:01:12,360 --> 07:01:14,400
business manager pages but pages that

7183
07:01:14,400 --> 07:01:16,260
have a following you know have a bunch

7184
07:01:16,260 --> 07:01:18,600
of friends a bunch of uh

7185
07:01:18,600 --> 07:01:20,940
uh just you know people following them

7186
07:01:20,940 --> 07:01:23,100
in general those get a little bit more

7187
07:01:23,100 --> 07:01:25,080
expensive you can see kind of the the 20

7188
07:01:25,080 --> 07:01:26,100
000 followers down there is

7189
07:01:26,100 --> 07:01:28,260
significantly more expensive

7190
07:01:28,260 --> 07:01:29,520
um but typically I mean it's the the

7191
07:01:29,520 --> 07:01:31,378
same idea right if you've seen you know

7192
07:01:31,378 --> 07:01:33,000
the compromised Twitter accounts or a

7193
07:01:33,000 --> 07:01:34,200
compromised Facebook account that

7194
07:01:34,200 --> 07:01:35,940
suddenly out of nowhere is really into

7195
07:01:35,940 --> 07:01:38,820
Elon Musk and Bitcoin yeah something

7196
07:01:38,820 --> 07:01:41,340
like this is probably behind it

7197
07:01:41,340 --> 07:01:42,660
um so there's a ton of different ways

7198
07:01:42,660 --> 07:01:44,160
and and Facebook is really not their

7199
07:01:44,160 --> 07:01:44,940
only

7200
07:01:44,940 --> 07:01:46,680
not the only deal it's just one of their

7201
07:01:46,680 --> 07:01:48,058
favorites

7202
07:01:48,058 --> 07:01:49,138
um

7203
07:01:49,138 --> 07:01:51,000
but of course

7204
07:01:51,000 --> 07:01:52,440
there's money that's always ransomware

7205
07:01:52,440 --> 07:01:54,660
or in this case just straight Ransom

7206
07:01:54,660 --> 07:01:56,520
um so we found a couple examples of you

7207
07:01:56,520 --> 07:01:58,138
know in this case a very specific

7208
07:01:58,138 --> 07:02:00,360
Vietnamese call out if this guy held my

7209
07:02:00,360 --> 07:02:02,298
page for ransom for 500

7210
07:02:02,298 --> 07:02:05,400
this is less common for when the domain

7211
07:02:05,400 --> 07:02:06,718
expires this is more kind of your

7212
07:02:06,718 --> 07:02:08,700
classic account takeover either your

7213
07:02:08,700 --> 07:02:11,638
passwords Bray or things like that

7214
07:02:11,638 --> 07:02:13,260
um because I mean if you let your domain

7215
07:02:13,260 --> 07:02:14,940
lacks why would you pay to get it back

7216
07:02:14,940 --> 07:02:16,558
it's not going to work too much there

7217
07:02:16,558 --> 07:02:18,298
but I mean this this occurs too it's

7218
07:02:18,298 --> 07:02:20,218
it's not uncommon and it's often the

7219
07:02:20,218 --> 07:02:23,660
same type of groups who are doing this

7220
07:02:24,798 --> 07:02:28,100
a little sip

7221
07:02:31,500 --> 07:02:33,298
so back to that first page the

7222
07:02:33,298 --> 07:02:35,638
cozyfb.com one of the interesting things

7223
07:02:35,638 --> 07:02:37,320
you know I mentioned these all kind of

7224
07:02:37,320 --> 07:02:39,120
look similar it's because they're

7225
07:02:39,120 --> 07:02:40,558
they're all built on the same platform

7226
07:02:40,558 --> 07:02:45,840
uh cmsnt.com uh they will sell you

7227
07:02:45,840 --> 07:02:48,718
you know instead of Wordpress cmsc.com

7228
07:02:48,718 --> 07:02:50,580
they're like hey you want to set up a

7229
07:02:50,580 --> 07:02:52,740
Marketplace to sell you know carded

7230
07:02:52,740 --> 07:02:54,780
accounts sell Facebook accounts

7231
07:02:54,780 --> 07:02:57,360
so world Warcraft accounts stuff like

7232
07:02:57,360 --> 07:02:59,520
that all of these things that they all

7233
07:02:59,520 --> 07:03:00,600
look very similar and there's a reason

7234
07:03:00,600 --> 07:03:03,180
it's because they are just searching for

7235
07:03:03,180 --> 07:03:05,280
that string there's you know almost 3

7236
07:03:05,280 --> 07:03:07,740
000 results on Google

7237
07:03:07,740 --> 07:03:08,458
um

7238
07:03:08,458 --> 07:03:10,680
so it's a business and a legitimate

7239
07:03:10,680 --> 07:03:12,180
business

7240
07:03:12,180 --> 07:03:13,440
uh

7241
07:03:13,440 --> 07:03:16,138
this is on the right that's actually a a

7242
07:03:16,138 --> 07:03:17,700
translated version of their homepage

7243
07:03:17,700 --> 07:03:19,378
that shows you you know here's some of

7244
07:03:19,378 --> 07:03:20,840
the offerings that we have

7245
07:03:20,840 --> 07:03:23,100
where it's pretty clear that they're

7246
07:03:23,100 --> 07:03:26,700
going to help you sell stolen accounts

7247
07:03:26,700 --> 07:03:28,200
um they have a great you know Facebook

7248
07:03:28,200 --> 07:03:29,820
account

7249
07:03:29,820 --> 07:03:31,558
um they don't know the solution is kind

7250
07:03:31,558 --> 07:03:32,700
of interesting

7251
07:03:32,700 --> 07:03:33,420
um

7252
07:03:33,420 --> 07:03:34,860
I don't know why they call that out they

7253
07:03:34,860 --> 07:03:36,600
don't they don't sell you like an MMO

7254
07:03:36,600 --> 07:03:38,340
game to play

7255
07:03:38,340 --> 07:03:39,780
um they just help you sell the accounts

7256
07:03:39,780 --> 07:03:42,000
you stole from that

7257
07:03:42,000 --> 07:03:43,378
it's kind of disappointing

7258
07:03:43,378 --> 07:03:45,000
um but you'll see that

7259
07:03:45,000 --> 07:03:47,058
um so that's

7260
07:03:47,058 --> 07:03:49,798
cmsnt.co interestingly enough of course

7261
07:03:49,798 --> 07:03:52,798
they've got the dot VN dot VN as a TLD

7262
07:03:52,798 --> 07:03:55,320
is interesting in that it doesn't really

7263
07:03:55,320 --> 07:03:56,638
support privacy

7264
07:03:56,638 --> 07:03:58,978
so it's very easy to see who owns this

7265
07:03:58,978 --> 07:04:02,218
we've got when tampon I don't know I

7266
07:04:02,218 --> 07:04:04,080
probably butchered that but when uh it's

7267
07:04:04,080 --> 07:04:06,360
a pretty common Vietnamese name but you

7268
07:04:06,360 --> 07:04:07,440
can see you know when this was

7269
07:04:07,440 --> 07:04:09,000
registered who it's registered to

7270
07:04:09,000 --> 07:04:11,100
there's really no attempted operational

7271
07:04:11,100 --> 07:04:13,378
security here with these guys and that's

7272
07:04:13,378 --> 07:04:15,360
why these are a great jumping off point

7273
07:04:15,360 --> 07:04:16,740
if you want to get started in the OS

7274
07:04:16,740 --> 07:04:17,820
ends

7275
07:04:17,820 --> 07:04:19,500
um there it's Rabbit Hole after Rabbit

7276
07:04:19,500 --> 07:04:21,180
Hole after Rabbit Hole here

7277
07:04:21,180 --> 07:04:23,400
um so you can really you know get your

7278
07:04:23,400 --> 07:04:25,798
feet wet with something that is is

7279
07:04:25,798 --> 07:04:27,780
interesting

7280
07:04:27,780 --> 07:04:28,378
um

7281
07:04:28,378 --> 07:04:30,478
so here's that that same individual

7282
07:04:30,478 --> 07:04:32,218
here's his actual Facebook page you can

7283
07:04:32,218 --> 07:04:34,260
see it's pretty much a mere copy of the

7284
07:04:34,260 --> 07:04:35,940
one for the business

7285
07:04:35,940 --> 07:04:37,558
um but they actually are a legitimate

7286
07:04:37,558 --> 07:04:40,080
business they have a tax ID on that

7287
07:04:40,080 --> 07:04:42,780
bottom image is from the Vietnamese kind

7288
07:04:42,780 --> 07:04:43,500
of

7289
07:04:43,500 --> 07:04:45,420
business Authority where you can it's

7290
07:04:45,420 --> 07:04:47,280
translated a little weird but

7291
07:04:47,280 --> 07:04:48,420
um on their website they listed their

7292
07:04:48,420 --> 07:04:49,798
tax ID and you can look it up you can

7293
07:04:49,798 --> 07:04:51,298
see who the owner is who it's registered

7294
07:04:51,298 --> 07:04:53,100
to how long it's been registered and

7295
07:04:53,100 --> 07:04:54,780
what their what their address is so

7296
07:04:54,780 --> 07:04:56,700
they're not operating in in no man's

7297
07:04:56,700 --> 07:04:58,440
land they're not operating in you know

7298
07:04:58,440 --> 07:05:00,600
Untouchable way they're very clear about

7299
07:05:00,600 --> 07:05:03,000
what they're doing they're very clearly

7300
07:05:03,000 --> 07:05:05,280
doing it with no repercussions it's it's

7301
07:05:05,280 --> 07:05:08,100
a way of life if you look up many of

7302
07:05:08,100 --> 07:05:10,978
these people on LinkedIn they're similar

7303
07:05:10,978 --> 07:05:12,660
pretty much you're guaranteed to see

7304
07:05:12,660 --> 07:05:14,280
that they're a web developer and they're

7305
07:05:14,280 --> 07:05:16,860
like a marketing Specialist or they're

7306
07:05:16,860 --> 07:05:18,840
an SEO specialist you know something

7307
07:05:18,840 --> 07:05:20,820
along those lines of we're going to help

7308
07:05:20,820 --> 07:05:23,100
you get people to your site

7309
07:05:23,100 --> 07:05:24,958
um let me go as to the means a little

7310
07:05:24,958 --> 07:05:26,280
Machiavellian

7311
07:05:26,280 --> 07:05:27,958
um

7312
07:05:27,958 --> 07:05:30,298
so some of the really main indicators

7313
07:05:30,298 --> 07:05:31,740
that you can use to kind of track these

7314
07:05:31,740 --> 07:05:33,420
guys down a little bit more this MX

7315
07:05:33,420 --> 07:05:35,400
record 40ml.net definitely their

7316
07:05:35,400 --> 07:05:38,160
favorite but what was what we sell a ton

7317
07:05:38,160 --> 07:05:40,920
in our own research is that that admin

7318
07:05:40,920 --> 07:05:43,558
and poe.com that's their favorite that

7319
07:05:43,558 --> 07:05:44,760
is definitely their favorite one to use

7320
07:05:44,760 --> 07:05:47,820
as mothers so you can definitely use

7321
07:05:47,820 --> 07:05:49,620
these to kind of begin your pivoting to

7322
07:05:49,620 --> 07:05:52,740
your your us and hunts we also saw you

7323
07:05:52,740 --> 07:05:53,820
know for our

7324
07:05:53,820 --> 07:05:57,298
interesting visibility into these guys

7325
07:05:57,298 --> 07:05:58,260
um

7326
07:05:58,260 --> 07:06:00,600
they like to use residential proxies I

7327
07:06:00,600 --> 07:06:01,920
kind of touched on it earlier where they

7328
07:06:01,920 --> 07:06:03,180
you know might have the YouTube videos

7329
07:06:03,180 --> 07:06:04,860
to show you how to do this they have

7330
07:06:04,860 --> 07:06:06,660
YouTube videos showing you what services

7331
07:06:06,660 --> 07:06:09,180
to use how to do the proxies you know A

7332
07:06:09,180 --> 07:06:10,860
to B you don't have to be technically

7333
07:06:10,860 --> 07:06:12,840
minded you just need to speak and

7334
07:06:12,840 --> 07:06:15,740
understand Vietnamese

7335
07:06:15,840 --> 07:06:19,200
so the very gentle Crux of this right is

7336
07:06:19,200 --> 07:06:21,120
how do we lock this up

7337
07:06:21,120 --> 07:06:22,978
it's pretty simple it's exactly what

7338
07:06:22,978 --> 07:06:26,160
you'd expect it to be right 2fa same

7339
07:06:26,160 --> 07:06:27,660
thing we've people have been screaming

7340
07:06:27,660 --> 07:06:30,840
about for years decades Etc yubiki

7341
07:06:30,840 --> 07:06:34,378
Google Authenticator Etc SMS push as a

7342
07:06:34,378 --> 07:06:35,458
lasted Resort

7343
07:06:35,458 --> 07:06:37,520
it's better than nothing but not by much

7344
07:06:37,520 --> 07:06:39,478
nowadays him swapping and things like

7345
07:06:39,478 --> 07:06:40,500
that if you have something of value

7346
07:06:40,500 --> 07:06:43,260
protected by an SMS push

7347
07:06:43,260 --> 07:06:45,180
um it's not as protected as you might

7348
07:06:45,180 --> 07:06:46,520
think

7349
07:06:46,520 --> 07:06:48,360
obviously different passwords per

7350
07:06:48,360 --> 07:06:50,638
account password reuse is a huge problem

7351
07:06:50,638 --> 07:06:52,920
for everybody but particularly the the

7352
07:06:52,920 --> 07:06:54,600
non-technical people who might want to

7353
07:06:54,600 --> 07:06:56,520
prefer a Facebook business page over

7354
07:06:56,520 --> 07:06:59,280
running an actual website use a

7355
07:06:59,280 --> 07:07:01,340
dedicated password fault

7356
07:07:01,340 --> 07:07:04,378
a ton of malware loves to Target the

7357
07:07:04,378 --> 07:07:06,240
safe passwords in your browsers so

7358
07:07:06,240 --> 07:07:07,558
that's why I definitely don't suggest

7359
07:07:07,558 --> 07:07:10,500
doing that and on top of that a lot of

7360
07:07:10,500 --> 07:07:11,580
the password vaults are a little bit

7361
07:07:11,580 --> 07:07:14,458
more user friendly between devices in my

7362
07:07:14,458 --> 07:07:16,558
experience I prefer them anyway

7363
07:07:16,558 --> 07:07:19,020
um but also don't tie logins that manage

7364
07:07:19,020 --> 07:07:21,360
to manage to the main itself so a great

7365
07:07:21,360 --> 07:07:23,878
example here uh obviously go to domain

7366
07:07:23,878 --> 07:07:25,740
registrar we see a ton of people they

7367
07:07:25,740 --> 07:07:27,840
buy a domain and immediately they say oh

7368
07:07:27,840 --> 07:07:29,700
cool I have this domain I'm going to use

7369
07:07:29,700 --> 07:07:30,780
that for the email address for my

7370
07:07:30,780 --> 07:07:31,740
account

7371
07:07:31,740 --> 07:07:33,478
cool that that's great you know three or

7372
07:07:33,478 --> 07:07:35,400
four years goes by

7373
07:07:35,400 --> 07:07:37,320
their credit card changes that that

7374
07:07:37,320 --> 07:07:39,058
autovenue failed

7375
07:07:39,058 --> 07:07:40,320
they've forgotten the login information

7376
07:07:40,320 --> 07:07:42,000
to their account

7377
07:07:42,000 --> 07:07:43,740
cool like I can't send you a password

7378
07:07:43,740 --> 07:07:46,260
reset that domain is suspended because

7379
07:07:46,260 --> 07:07:47,878
you didn't pay for it

7380
07:07:47,878 --> 07:07:49,320
um the same thing applies you know to

7381
07:07:49,320 --> 07:07:51,540
the Facebook accounts things like that

7382
07:07:51,540 --> 07:07:53,218
um the reason this works so easily is

7383
07:07:53,218 --> 07:07:56,040
for cc golf cart said net is we you know

7384
07:07:56,040 --> 07:07:58,378
they provided them that breadcrumb that

7385
07:07:58,378 --> 07:08:00,600
oh hey maybe I'll log into my Facebook

7386
07:08:00,600 --> 07:08:03,600
account page with with this domain

7387
07:08:03,600 --> 07:08:05,580
um so I suggest not not doing that try

7388
07:08:05,580 --> 07:08:07,558
to separate your administration of

7389
07:08:07,558 --> 07:08:09,540
things so you don't put all your eggs in

7390
07:08:09,540 --> 07:08:10,920
one basket

7391
07:08:10,920 --> 07:08:13,020
Facebook has a lot of their own guidance

7392
07:08:13,020 --> 07:08:15,478
specific specifically around their

7393
07:08:15,478 --> 07:08:18,180
business uh management

7394
07:08:18,180 --> 07:08:20,760
it was a physical basis uh what did that

7395
07:08:20,760 --> 07:08:22,620
counts called uh

7396
07:08:22,620 --> 07:08:25,020
but reviewing roles and permissions uh

7397
07:08:25,020 --> 07:08:27,000
it's very easy to over permission you

7398
07:08:27,000 --> 07:08:28,920
know customers uh

7399
07:08:28,920 --> 07:08:31,558
employees things of that nature

7400
07:08:31,558 --> 07:08:34,680
um so definitely review that more than

7401
07:08:34,680 --> 07:08:36,360
one admin which seems kind of

7402
07:08:36,360 --> 07:08:38,040
counterintuitive but generally the idea

7403
07:08:38,040 --> 07:08:39,360
here is that if you have more than one

7404
07:08:39,360 --> 07:08:40,978
admin and you lock yourself out of your

7405
07:08:40,978 --> 07:08:42,240
Facebook account that's an admin

7406
07:08:42,240 --> 07:08:43,920
somebody else can get in there it's not

7407
07:08:43,920 --> 07:08:45,900
a single point of failure somebody can

7408
07:08:45,900 --> 07:08:49,080
get in unlock you or alternatively if

7409
07:08:49,080 --> 07:08:50,400
your account gets compromised does

7410
07:08:50,400 --> 07:08:52,500
somebody else who can potentially see

7411
07:08:52,500 --> 07:08:54,120
and help remediate that before things go

7412
07:08:54,120 --> 07:08:56,638
awry uh and then obviously ignore friend

7413
07:08:56,638 --> 07:08:58,080
requests

7414
07:08:58,080 --> 07:08:59,400
um you don't need friends on Facebook

7415
07:08:59,400 --> 07:09:01,920
you're fine it's better that you don't

7416
07:09:01,920 --> 07:09:02,820
have those

7417
07:09:02,820 --> 07:09:04,978
um and that's honestly kind of it thanks

7418
07:09:04,978 --> 07:09:06,360
everybody for coming out I want to give

7419
07:09:06,360 --> 07:09:07,920
Liam a shout out for writing half of

7420
07:09:07,920 --> 07:09:09,058
this where they're not being willing to

7421
07:09:09,058 --> 07:09:12,000
speak to it uh

7422
07:09:12,000 --> 07:09:13,860
that's that's it for you guys have any

7423
07:09:13,860 --> 07:09:15,660
questions

7424
07:09:15,660 --> 07:09:18,320
phone here

7425
07:09:21,718 --> 07:09:23,458
so I might have missed it but what's

7426
07:09:23,458 --> 07:09:25,740
stopping somebody besides the fact that

7427
07:09:25,740 --> 07:09:28,620
they could discover a a old domain no

7428
07:09:28,620 --> 07:09:30,840
longer in use to to do an account

7429
07:09:30,840 --> 07:09:32,580
takeover from just doing an account

7430
07:09:32,580 --> 07:09:34,920
takeover you know by discovering an

7431
07:09:34,920 --> 07:09:36,180
email address and forwarding those

7432
07:09:36,180 --> 07:09:37,558
emails to there

7433
07:09:37,558 --> 07:09:40,200
yeah I mean if they have control of uh

7434
07:09:40,200 --> 07:09:41,340
the email address that's going to

7435
07:09:41,340 --> 07:09:43,320
receive those yeah it's it's also a

7436
07:09:43,320 --> 07:09:44,700
similar thing

7437
07:09:44,700 --> 07:09:46,200
um it's there's really no difference

7438
07:09:46,200 --> 07:09:47,580
there

7439
07:09:47,580 --> 07:09:49,558
um in this case attackers you know if

7440
07:09:49,558 --> 07:09:52,638
they we

7441
07:09:52,680 --> 07:09:54,298
I'll give some additional context that's

7442
07:09:54,298 --> 07:09:56,100
not in the slides

7443
07:09:56,100 --> 07:09:58,558
um a lot if they purchase these domains

7444
07:09:58,558 --> 07:10:00,240
uh these attackers aren't usually doing

7445
07:10:00,240 --> 07:10:01,978
that with their own funds

7446
07:10:01,978 --> 07:10:03,840
uh so these domains are often very

7447
07:10:03,840 --> 07:10:06,240
short-lived uh and there's very little

7448
07:10:06,240 --> 07:10:08,280
reason for these attackers to to feel

7449
07:10:08,280 --> 07:10:09,420
like they're going to lose money if this

7450
07:10:09,420 --> 07:10:10,920
domain disappears when somebody finds a

7451
07:10:10,920 --> 07:10:12,900
rear charge on a credit card but that

7452
07:10:12,900 --> 07:10:14,940
DNS entry only needs to last for five

7453
07:10:14,940 --> 07:10:17,100
minutes to get that email

7454
07:10:17,100 --> 07:10:19,320
um so for them the the account that

7455
07:10:19,320 --> 07:10:21,120
they're rebuying this domain from is

7456
07:10:21,120 --> 07:10:22,740
immediately disposable the domain is

7457
07:10:22,740 --> 07:10:24,718
immediately disposable

7458
07:10:24,718 --> 07:10:26,940
um so they don't need to you know spend

7459
07:10:26,940 --> 07:10:28,558
more money to buy access to your

7460
07:10:28,558 --> 07:10:29,940
compromised Gmail account your

7461
07:10:29,940 --> 07:10:31,500
compromise Yahoo account or similarly

7462
07:10:31,500 --> 07:10:34,260
but you're correct it is essentially the

7463
07:10:34,260 --> 07:10:35,638
same thing you know if they had access

7464
07:10:35,638 --> 07:10:36,840
to your account they wouldn't need to

7465
07:10:36,840 --> 07:10:38,580
buy the domain they could just do that

7466
07:10:38,580 --> 07:10:40,378
and that's a lot of times why so many

7467
07:10:40,378 --> 07:10:41,700
email accounts and things like that are

7468
07:10:41,700 --> 07:10:43,920
worth money because you only have access

7469
07:10:43,920 --> 07:10:45,120
to that email account but you have

7470
07:10:45,120 --> 07:10:46,680
access to any account that was it was

7471
07:10:46,680 --> 07:10:48,478
tied to anywhere you can go out and find

7472
07:10:48,478 --> 07:10:50,580
and try and do a password reset they've

7473
07:10:50,580 --> 07:10:53,240
got access to

7474
07:10:58,020 --> 07:11:01,040
let's go

7475
07:11:06,240 --> 07:11:07,740
okay I'm not holding anybody up from

7476
07:11:07,740 --> 07:11:10,340
happy hour good

7477
07:11:14,280 --> 07:11:16,260
this is that you can you can smack me

7478
07:11:16,260 --> 07:11:18,298
down for this but uh this is not

7479
07:11:18,298 --> 07:11:19,740
directly related to your talk but I've

7480
07:11:19,740 --> 07:11:21,420
always wanted to have a contact and go

7481
07:11:21,420 --> 07:11:24,420
daddy that can actually get done uh

7482
07:11:24,420 --> 07:11:25,680
it's definitely not me I'm not getting

7483
07:11:25,680 --> 07:11:27,718
anything if anybody

7484
07:11:27,718 --> 07:11:29,760
if anybody here in this room is that

7485
07:11:29,760 --> 07:11:32,700
person yeah talk to me outside yeah talk

7486
07:11:32,700 --> 07:11:35,000
to me outside

7487
07:11:38,760 --> 07:11:41,280
all right so you mentioned when you were

7488
07:11:41,280 --> 07:11:43,920
showing uh on the site

7489
07:11:43,920 --> 07:11:44,600
um

7490
07:11:44,600 --> 07:11:46,740
accounts that were being sold that had a

7491
07:11:46,740 --> 07:11:47,820
significant number of followers were

7492
07:11:47,820 --> 07:11:49,320
selling for more

7493
07:11:49,320 --> 07:11:51,540
um so hypothetically if somebody was

7494
07:11:51,540 --> 07:11:52,978
doing this would it be like financially

7495
07:11:52,978 --> 07:11:54,900
viable to go buy a bunch of fake

7496
07:11:54,900 --> 07:11:57,058
followers to boost the sales I imagine

7497
07:11:57,058 --> 07:11:58,620
that's actually probably part of it too

7498
07:11:58,620 --> 07:12:00,240
what I didn't cover I mean there's a ton

7499
07:12:00,240 --> 07:12:01,740
of different things on these websites

7500
07:12:01,740 --> 07:12:04,558
but buying likes and follows is also

7501
07:12:04,558 --> 07:12:06,120
part of that

7502
07:12:06,120 --> 07:12:08,280
um so you could I imagine it's probably

7503
07:12:08,280 --> 07:12:10,740
like you're not going to come out as

7504
07:12:10,740 --> 07:12:12,000
well in that case but you could

7505
07:12:12,000 --> 07:12:13,500
potentially buy an account then buy like

7506
07:12:13,500 --> 07:12:14,520
some followers to get that account

7507
07:12:14,520 --> 07:12:17,218
better and then resell the account but I

7508
07:12:17,218 --> 07:12:18,540
think for the margins it's probably not

7509
07:12:18,540 --> 07:12:20,040
going to be worth it most of those

7510
07:12:20,040 --> 07:12:21,360
accounts are probably gonna I think the

7511
07:12:21,360 --> 07:12:23,160
like the 20 000 follower one ends up

7512
07:12:23,160 --> 07:12:24,540
being about like 80 bucks or something

7513
07:12:24,540 --> 07:12:28,138
like that uh I think to get it there uh

7514
07:12:28,138 --> 07:12:29,638
and what's also kind of most importantly

7515
07:12:29,638 --> 07:12:31,200
that I kind of skimmed over is the older

7516
07:12:31,200 --> 07:12:33,780
these accounts are the the better right

7517
07:12:33,780 --> 07:12:35,340
if they suddenly pops up overnight with

7518
07:12:35,340 --> 07:12:36,600
twenty thousand that that's really

7519
07:12:36,600 --> 07:12:38,878
sketchy but if it's had 20 000 followers

7520
07:12:38,878 --> 07:12:41,340
for like six months a year plus the

7521
07:12:41,340 --> 07:12:44,040
older these accounts get the more vetted

7522
07:12:44,040 --> 07:12:45,840
since they are the more reputation they

7523
07:12:45,840 --> 07:12:49,218
have and so they're worth more

7524
07:12:49,978 --> 07:12:52,160
foreign

7525
07:13:04,978 --> 07:13:06,840
I think that's probably it

7526
07:13:06,840 --> 07:13:08,970
thanks guys
