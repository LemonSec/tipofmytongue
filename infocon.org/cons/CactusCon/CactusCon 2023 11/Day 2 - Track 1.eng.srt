1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,820
image so you can see that there is a

2
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:05,040
unique identifier for the file itself

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,420
that's referred to as a Content

4
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:09,900
identifier or SID but what that actually

5
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:11,700
is it uses the Merkel dag I won't get

6
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:13,620
into specific details on that the docs

7
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:15,839
are all available online if you want to

8
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:17,460
have a really boring afternoon and read

9
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:19,740
about it but at the end of the day it's

10
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:22,080
basically an array of blocks right it

11
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,119
takes that file breaks it up into blocks

12
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:25,920
and then creates an array with the

13
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,599
content identifiers of those specific

14
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:29,939
blocks so when you go to make a request

15
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:33,000
for in this case the Ubuntu install ISO

16
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,460
you make a request for that main content

17
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:38,160
identifier and ipfs takes care of the

18
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,960
rest of finding all of the different

19
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:42,120
blocks associated with it by crawling

20
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:44,340
that array retrieving them from whatever

21
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:46,920
systems within ipfs are actively hosting

22
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,140
Those portions of the file

23
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:50,100
reconstructing it and then delivering

24
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:53,640
that to whoever requested the file

25
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,739
so how do you access content within the

26
00:00:55,739 --> 00:00:57,719
ipfs network so there's two basic

27
00:00:57,719 --> 00:00:59,579
methods for this right one of them in

28
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:02,039
involves installing that ipfs client

29
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:05,159
application that allows you to store and

30
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:06,840
retrieve content from within the ipfs

31
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,880
network alternatively you can use what

32
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,760
are called ipfs gateways and they

33
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,920
actually have a a list of currently

34
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,140
maintained ipfs gateways that you can go

35
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:18,420
pull the links on the slide but these

36
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:20,340
effectively sit between the regular

37
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:22,259
internet and the ipfs network and

38
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:24,540
provide that translation service if

39
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:27,180
you're familiar with i2p.re or toward a

40
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:28,860
web gateways this functions very very

41
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:31,500
similarly to that completely transparent

42
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,240
to whoever's requesting the data from

43
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,759
within the ipfs network it will go it

44
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:36,840
will retrieve it and then it will

45
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:39,540
deliver it as if it's a normal web

46
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:41,159
request and so this is what that kind of

47
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:42,659
looks like right so you've got a victim

48
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:46,079
on the internet who's directed to make

49
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:48,860
an HTTP request for an ipfs Gateway

50
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:51,720
including the the Sid of the actual

51
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,579
content within ipfs that is being

52
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:55,259
requested

53
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:57,479
the ipfs Gateway will then locate the

54
00:01:57,479 --> 00:01:59,460
resource it will reconstruct the file

55
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:01,020
and then it will deliver that back to

56
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:03,000
the victim seamlessly as if it was

57
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,119
normal HTTP response data right so very

58
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:08,699
similar to your tour to web gateways in

59
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:10,318
in that regard

60
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:12,000
um usually the the way that these are

61
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,640
set up is you'll have either a subdomain

62
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,640
of the ipfs Gateway that specifies the

63
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,860
content identifier of the file that's

64
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:22,560
being they're being directed to or

65
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,500
they'll use it as a part of the the URL

66
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:26,760
path there's a few different ways that

67
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:27,900
you can configure it there's also some

68
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:30,180
DNS record configuration that you can do

69
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:32,340
that enables an ipfs gateway to process

70
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:33,900
the requests and actually know what

71
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:35,940
content to grab but the most common are

72
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:40,980
using a subdomain or a a URL path

73
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:42,599
so let's talk about what this actually

74
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:44,400
looks like in real life and I'm going to

75
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,560
start with with fishing phishing is uh

76
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,900
is is using this quite a bit uh it's one

77
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:50,940
of the most common um abuses that that

78
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:53,760
I've seen over the past six to 12 months

79
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,019
or so

80
00:02:55,019 --> 00:02:58,019
so typical of fishing right these start

81
00:02:58,019 --> 00:03:00,959
with email attachments so you you uh you

82
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:02,340
receive an email that says hey you've

83
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:04,019
got an invoice or a bill or you need to

84
00:03:04,019 --> 00:03:06,780
pay us money here's an attached PDF uh

85
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:08,400
you open the PDF in this case it was

86
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,800
made to look as if it was uh generated

87
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,080
by the DocuSign document signing service

88
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,720
right that everyone uses for important

89
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,940
stuff like signing mortgage documents

90
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:20,879
and and loan docs and stuff like that so

91
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:22,379
these typically include a review

92
00:03:22,379 --> 00:03:23,819
document link when you click on that

93
00:03:23,819 --> 00:03:25,860
link you're directed to what appears to

94
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:28,500
be a Microsoft sign-on page but in this

95
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,000
case it's actually being hosted within

96
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,280
the ipfs network and the link is

97
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,260
pointing to an ipfs Gateway so in this

98
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:36,420
case it's ipfs.io and then you can see

99
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:38,340
that content identifier as part of the

100
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:41,159
URL path so when the ipfs Gateway gets

101
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:44,099
this it knows okay well I'm configured

102
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:46,319
to know where the Sid is in the URL so I

103
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:47,940
know how to process the requests and

104
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:50,519
then deliver the content ipfs isn't just

105
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:52,799
for storing documents or files though

106
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:54,959
you can actually completely deploy

107
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:57,420
websites within the ipfs network those

108
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:59,159
are often referred to as things like

109
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:01,560
distributed applications or d-apps this

110
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,239
is one example of that where a lot of

111
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:04,739
people are putting phishing kits within

112
00:04:04,739 --> 00:04:06,480
ipfs right they don't have to pay for

113
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,860
Content hosting they don't have to stand

114
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:09,720
up web server infrastructure they don't

115
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,400
have to worry about content moderation

116
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,379
they don't have to worry about a web

117
00:04:13,379 --> 00:04:14,819
host taking down their their

118
00:04:14,819 --> 00:04:17,399
infrastructure because of abuse activity

119
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:19,798
it's within ipfs it's resilient to

120
00:04:19,798 --> 00:04:22,019
content moderation and it's the perfect

121
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:24,720
solution for deploying things like fish

122
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,940
kits and ensuring that they have a

123
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:29,340
relatively long lifespan

124
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:31,440
so in this case their their theme to uh

125
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,240
to make it appear as if it's a uh like a

126
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,639
Microsoft uh login page when you enter

127
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:37,979
your credentials and click the uh the

128
00:04:37,979 --> 00:04:40,139
the form button what actually happens is

129
00:04:40,139 --> 00:04:42,360
the browser makes a HTTP post request

130
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,340
and sends the entered credentials to an

131
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:45,720
attacker-controlled server on the

132
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,880
regular internet one thing to note about

133
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:51,259
ipfs right is there is no data privacy

134
00:04:51,259 --> 00:04:54,240
so anything that's stored within ipfs is

135
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,820
accessible by anyone that accesses the

136
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:59,520
ipfs network so what we've seen is a lot

137
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,900
of threat actors will stand up their

138
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:03,300
fishing kits and they'll uh stand up

139
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:05,220
their distribution mechanism within ipfs

140
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:07,199
but then they'll send their credentials

141
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,880
to an attacker-controlled server so that

142
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,560
they have them and no one else can can

143
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,840
get access to them so this is fairly

144
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,880
typical behavior from phishing activity

145
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,639
that's that's abusing ipfs we've seen a

146
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:19,500
pretty significant increase in this

147
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,479
activity as more adversaries recognize

148
00:05:21,479 --> 00:05:24,960
that this is a cost-effective way to

149
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,320
establish uh what is like next-gen

150
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,880
bulletproof hosting right you don't have

151
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,680
to use a fast flux botnet for hosting

152
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,840
you don't have to rotate through

153
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,100
significant amounts of infrastructure

154
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:36,539
you can just throw stuff into this

155
00:05:36,539 --> 00:05:39,120
resilient decentralized Network and no

156
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,380
one can really do anything about it

157
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:42,000
because it's being mirrored across

158
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,759
multiple systems and there's no single

159
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:50,419
authority to take action on that content

160
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,460
so I have seen situations where ipfs

161
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:56,460
gateways do make some attempt to content

162
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:59,639
moderate so they'll basically track SIDS

163
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:01,800
of known bad things and they will block

164
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,440
access to it but really it's it's it's

165
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,900
like whack-a-mole because all you have

166
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,940
to do is change a single byte in the

167
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:11,220
file throw it back into ipfs you get a

168
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:12,900
new content identifier and you're good

169
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:14,940
to go likewise there are a ton of

170
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:17,160
different ipfs gateways and while this

171
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:20,759
specific ipfs Gateway blocked access not

172
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:22,740
all of the ipfs gateways are

173
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:24,660
communicating and standardizing block

174
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:26,819
lists or anything like that so it's it's

175
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:28,259
really just whack-a-mole at that point

176
00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:30,660
change your your content identifier or

177
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:33,180
just link to a new ipfs Gateway and your

178
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:37,259
campaigns can can still perform

179
00:06:37,259 --> 00:06:40,020
so that's fishing that's pretty much

180
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:41,880
what all of the fishing activity using

181
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:44,400
ipfs looks like right now there's slight

182
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,680
variation sometimes instead of including

183
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:49,080
a link to ipfs gateways that will

184
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:53,100
include Google translate uh redirects so

185
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:54,900
they'll they'll basically put the URL

186
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,699
into Google translate and then send the

187
00:06:56,699 --> 00:06:58,979
Google translate Link versus just

188
00:06:58,979 --> 00:07:01,380
linking directly to the ipfs Gateway

189
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:03,600
itself but other than those types of

190
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,340
minor variations this is pretty much

191
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:07,440
what 99 of the fishing activity looks

192
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:11,400
like so let's talk about malware

193
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:14,300
so I started monitoring for ipfs abuse

194
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:17,220
in early 2022.

195
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:19,740
um I read about filecoin and ipfs and

196
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:21,360
some of these new web 3 Technologies and

197
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,520
my first thought was wow this would be

198
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,460
really useful for adversaries and so I

199
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:27,780
kind of just started putting detection

200
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:30,780
content together in rules and things

201
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:32,460
like that to monitor things like public

202
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:35,099
sample repositories for samples that

203
00:07:35,099 --> 00:07:37,440
exhibit Behavior Uh communicating to

204
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:41,520
ipfs Gateway domains and I started

205
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,220
seeing results so mid 2022 is when we

206
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:45,840
started to see kind of a ramp up of

207
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,460
activity both fishing and malware

208
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:49,800
distribution and I actually uh published

209
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,780
some some research related to this in

210
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:54,240
November and then as I was getting ready

211
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,800
to travel out here I went and pulled

212
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,979
numbers from November to uh I think

213
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:01,979
January 25th and it's continuing to

214
00:08:01,979 --> 00:08:03,599
increase so this is likely a problem

215
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:05,340
that is going to continue to expand

216
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:08,460
you're going to see higher volumes as

217
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:10,259
more and more threat actors recognize

218
00:08:10,259 --> 00:08:12,900
this is a viable hosting solution for

219
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:17,120
resilient malware distribution campaigns

220
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,440
so let's talk about some case studies I

221
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,819
want to start out by talking about an

222
00:08:20,819 --> 00:08:22,680
agent Tesla campaign that's that's been

223
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:25,259
ongoing for the past you know six seven

224
00:08:25,259 --> 00:08:26,759
months or so

225
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:27,900
um if you're not familiar with agent

226
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:30,240
Tesla it's an information stealer it's

227
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,259
uh

228
00:08:31,259 --> 00:08:33,679
readily available it's commodity

229
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:37,559
it's typically in one of the top 10 most

230
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:39,360
distributed malware families that you

231
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,679
see at any given point in time right

232
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:42,958
it's everywhere there's a multiplicity

233
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:44,459
of threat actors that are leveraging

234
00:08:44,459 --> 00:08:46,500
agent tests ipfs Gateway and it would

235
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:49,140
pull down the next stage payload you can

236
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:51,600
see the request on the left hand side to

237
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,180
the specific ipfs Gateway and this is an

238
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:55,680
example where that subdomain that I

239
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,180
mentioned earlier was being used versus

240
00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:00,720
the the actual URL path to specify the

241
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,180
content identifier for the next stage of

242
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:04,560
the infection process and then you can

243
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,720
see the response content looks just like

244
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,380
a blob of data so there's a static key

245
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:12,420
that's defined within the downloader

246
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:14,399
that is responsible for taking that blob

247
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:16,800
of data running each byte against that

248
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,140
static key and then regenerating the

249
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:21,480
next stage uh malware payload you can

250
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:24,779
see the the list on the slide there you

251
00:09:24,779 --> 00:09:26,700
can see the first couple bytes the 4D 5A

252
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:30,000
that's your MZ header for a pe32 file so

253
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,279
that pe32 file is the and reflectively

254
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:34,920
injected into memory and then executed

255
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,660
thus infecting the system with agent

256
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:39,360
Tesla and starting out the the

257
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,300
information stealing process

258
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:44,399
so I want to talk about another loader

259
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:45,959
that I discovered when I was looking at

260
00:09:45,959 --> 00:09:47,339
different threats that are leveraging

261
00:09:47,339 --> 00:09:51,000
ipfs for various operations within the

262
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,399
infection process so in this particular

263
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:56,459
case I discovered a loader and three

264
00:09:56,459 --> 00:09:58,500
separate clusters of malware samples

265
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,240
that were all responsible for performing

266
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,519
different things on infected systems

267
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:05,339
so the initial loader was very similar

268
00:10:05,339 --> 00:10:07,920
in all three of these clusters of final

269
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:11,519
payloads and based on code similarity

270
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:14,279
across all of the Clusters we assessed

271
00:10:14,279 --> 00:10:15,779
with high confidence that the threat

272
00:10:15,779 --> 00:10:18,360
actor is the same in all three of the

273
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,459
cases so this was an ongoing campaign

274
00:10:20,459 --> 00:10:22,320
that that spanned a period of several

275
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,680
months where it appeared that the threat

276
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,300
actor was actively developing and

277
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:30,439
updating their payloads

278
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:32,580
so the first thing that this malware

279
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:34,440
would do the loader stage of the

280
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,120
infection process was it would create

281
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,860
its working directory right you can see

282
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:39,860
the path uh within the app data

283
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:42,120
directory within windows that it would

284
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,220
that it would write to interestingly

285
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:47,839
they would actually pull down a python

286
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:50,700
installation onto the system and store

287
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,680
it within that working directory what's

288
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:53,820
interesting is they were actually

289
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,100
leveraging the curl utility which was a

290
00:10:56,100 --> 00:11:00,180
strange design choice because curl as a

291
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:03,480
native uh command that's invocable from

292
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,040
within the Windows command processor

293
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,440
itself was only introduced to the

294
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,000
Windows operating system with I think

295
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,220
Windows 11. um previously you had to use

296
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:13,380
Powershell to invoke kind of the

297
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:15,360
equivalent of curl but they weren't

298
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,880
using Powershell in this case so it's it

299
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:21,120
limits the uh the potential targets that

300
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,700
this would actually work on

301
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:25,140
next thing that they would do is they

302
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:27,540
would just unzip the python installation

303
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:28,860
within that directory so that it was

304
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:31,500
usable in in future stages of the

305
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,839
infection process

306
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:35,579
so here's an example of the final

307
00:11:35,579 --> 00:11:37,500
payload retrieval so once they had

308
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,420
staged the python environment on the

309
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:41,279
system they would reach out to an ipfs

310
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:42,899
Gateway and they would pull down the

311
00:11:42,899 --> 00:11:44,579
next stage of the

312
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:46,079
um infection process in this case you

313
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:48,060
can see the python import statements

314
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:50,160
that are being returned by the ipfs

315
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,140
Gateway from the python script that's

316
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:54,180
functioning as the next stage payload

317
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:56,579
it's kind of interesting because I think

318
00:11:56,579 --> 00:11:58,019
most of the time when when I'm looking

319
00:11:58,019 --> 00:12:00,300
at python-based malware threat actors

320
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:03,300
will use something like nuitka or Pi

321
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:05,459
installer or pi to exe to take their

322
00:12:05,459 --> 00:12:07,079
python malware once they've written it

323
00:12:07,079 --> 00:12:09,660
and compile it into a Windows executable

324
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:11,519
that ships with all of the Python

325
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:13,500
dependencies so when you execute the the

326
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,480
malware it drops what it needs to and

327
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,579
then it executes natively uh this was

328
00:12:17,579 --> 00:12:19,820
kind of a again a strange design Choice

329
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:23,100
including the raw Python and requiring

330
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:25,680
the systems who actually download python

331
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,480
itself in order to support continued

332
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,920
operations and further infection

333
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,959
activities

334
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:33,120
so as far as hiding artifacts and

335
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,279
achieving persistence the loader would

336
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:37,740
basically just use a trib within Windows

337
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:39,779
to set the file attributes for the

338
00:12:39,779 --> 00:12:41,459
working directory and all of the

339
00:12:41,459 --> 00:12:43,079
malicious components associated with the

340
00:12:43,079 --> 00:12:45,839
malware to Hidden in system likewise for

341
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:47,459
persistence they would use your standard

342
00:12:47,459 --> 00:12:50,700
registry run keys to ensure that the

343
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:53,339
malware would execute across system

344
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:55,260
reboots right so you infect the system

345
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:56,760
and next time it reboots the malware

346
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,800
kicks back off

347
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,540
so let's talk about the final payloads

348
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:02,100
so I'll start out with cluster one which

349
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:04,440
was basically a python reverse shell it

350
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,300
looked like it was generated using msf

351
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:08,399
Venom if you're not familiar with msf

352
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:10,680
Venom it's the the payload generation

353
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:13,200
utility that ships with Metasploit in

354
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,060
this case it was uh obfuscated right

355
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:18,360
they base64 encoded the the python and

356
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,760
then just included the minimal amount of

357
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:24,060
python code required to basically decode

358
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:26,579
the the base64 encoding and so this was

359
00:13:26,579 --> 00:13:28,800
a multi-layer encoding you had to work

360
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:32,639
through a handful of different layers of

361
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:35,459
base64 encoding but finally you you

362
00:13:35,459 --> 00:13:37,680
would see the the actual python code

363
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,480
responsible for establishing a reverse

364
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,339
shell back to the attacker's command and

365
00:13:41,339 --> 00:13:43,560
control server in this case they were

366
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:47,940
using Port 44 44 which is kind of the

367
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:50,040
default that you see everywhere when

368
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,360
you're reading like how to use

369
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,339
Metasploit docs everyone wants to to

370
00:13:53,339 --> 00:13:55,880
default to 4444

371
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:58,440
unfortunately when I was analyzing this

372
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,240
particular sample of the C2 was no

373
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,940
longer listening on that Port but this

374
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:05,160
is your standard python implementation

375
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:07,620
of a reverse shell that you get with

376
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:09,420
with Metasploit

377
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:12,420
so cluster two was uh wipers destructive

378
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:13,920
malware written for the Windows

379
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,380
operating system in this case again they

380
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:18,180
didn't actually compile it into an

381
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:20,399
executable they just dropped a batch

382
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:22,440
file that was responsible for deleting

383
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:25,139
Shadow copies on the system deleting all

384
00:14:25,139 --> 00:14:27,600
of the subdirectories within the user's

385
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,000
tree within Windows which is typically

386
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,220
where your user profile data is stored

387
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:34,200
and then they would iterate through any

388
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,940
mounted file systems present on the

389
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:37,800
system and destroy the content on those

390
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,420
systems as well so think removable

391
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:40,820
storage devices

392
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:43,380
you know map network drives things like

393
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:44,760
that

394
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:47,639
so cluster 3 was a full-featured

395
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:50,040
information stealer that was implemented

396
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:52,139
within uh python

397
00:14:52,139 --> 00:14:55,440
so it was designed very similar to a lot

398
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,000
of the other Steelers that you see out

399
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,980
there your red lines and and things like

400
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:01,860
that where it had a laundry list of

401
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:03,600
different applications that it supported

402
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,120
retrieving sensitive data for you can

403
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,279
see a list of some of the applications

404
00:15:08,279 --> 00:15:12,060
that it supports on the screenshot there

405
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:15,060
it also supported stealing browser data

406
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:17,339
from chrome and Firefox here's an

407
00:15:17,339 --> 00:15:20,100
example of the code responsible for

408
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:22,079
stealing login data and then here's the

409
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:23,880
the code responsible for stealing

410
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,279
cookies

411
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:28,199
very typical of of information Steelers

412
00:15:28,199 --> 00:15:29,880
that you see not a whole lot of Steelers

413
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,740
are being delivered as raw Python

414
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:34,320
scripts so kind of kind of an

415
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,779
interesting implementation

416
00:15:36,779 --> 00:15:38,459
uh one of the the interesting things

417
00:15:38,459 --> 00:15:40,620
that was built into this Steeler was a

418
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:43,560
Discord token protector bypassing so

419
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:46,620
discord's become very popular I've done

420
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:48,300
um some talks on how Discord is being

421
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:50,399
abused in the wild

422
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:52,740
um one of the things that that has kind

423
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:54,180
of happened is is kind of an arms race

424
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:56,639
between Discord users and adversaries

425
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:58,800
that are attempting to steal uh

426
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,680
authentication tokens and data so that

427
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:04,199
they can masquerade as those users to

428
00:16:04,199 --> 00:16:06,899
further communicate with the users

429
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:08,519
friends groups interact with servers

430
00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:10,500
that user is a part of so what happened

431
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,720
was all of these threat actors started

432
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,579
stealing Discord tokens and then these

433
00:16:14,579 --> 00:16:16,199
developers started creating Discord

434
00:16:16,199 --> 00:16:20,040
token protectors which basically prevent

435
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:22,500
access to Discord tokens so once these

436
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,839
token protectors became popular people

437
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:26,519
started writing token protector

438
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:29,040
bypassers so it's it's like a whole

439
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,300
thing with Discord if you're not

440
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:31,740
familiar with some of this activity it's

441
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:33,300
kind of it's kind of interesting to see

442
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:36,480
the uh the evolution in adversaries that

443
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,100
are targeting Discord and then

444
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,360
developers that are trying to protect

445
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,100
Discord data and then adversaries kind

446
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:43,440
of trying to bypass that seems like a

447
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,940
lot of work but

448
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:46,680
um it's it's lucrative so that's why

449
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:49,139
threat actors are continuing to do it

450
00:16:49,139 --> 00:16:51,240
and then in this particular case command

451
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,740
and control was being performed over

452
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:54,540
Discord web hooks

453
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:57,600
um so Discord has an API mechanism

454
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,759
that's called a web hook that allows you

455
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:03,060
to uh script interactions with Discord

456
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:05,280
servers and it started being abused

457
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:08,160
across various malware over the past few

458
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,679
years really ramped up during the

459
00:17:10,679 --> 00:17:11,939
pandemic when everyone kind of started

460
00:17:11,939 --> 00:17:13,799
moving to Discord for things like

461
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:16,199
conferences and and professional events

462
00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:17,819
and things like that so this is just an

463
00:17:17,819 --> 00:17:21,000
example of the malware taking advantage

464
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,919
of that that web hook API and you can

465
00:17:22,919 --> 00:17:24,480
kind of see the information that's being

466
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,339
transmitted to the adversary over

467
00:17:26,339 --> 00:17:28,819
Discord

468
00:17:28,919 --> 00:17:31,260
so let's talk about dark utilities dark

469
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:33,720
utilities is a fairly new command and

470
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:36,360
control as a service platform that has

471
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:38,940
been made available and is seeing

472
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:40,919
widespread adoption across the threat

473
00:17:40,919 --> 00:17:42,059
landscape

474
00:17:42,059 --> 00:17:43,740
so if you're not familiar with the

475
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:45,660
command and control as a service they've

476
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:47,580
effectively created a platform where you

477
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:48,660
can pay

478
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:50,100
um it was at the time I did this

479
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:52,799
research it was I think nine euros and

480
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:55,260
you can gain access to a web portal

481
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:57,360
where you could administer Bots that

482
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,400
you've infected with the payload that's

483
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,140
being provided by the dark utilities

484
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:05,400
platform itself it's marketed as a

485
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:08,640
server management and administration

486
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:12,059
platform but I mean they support things

487
00:18:12,059 --> 00:18:14,640
like process injection persistence

488
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,559
mechanisms and they even advertise

489
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:19,860
crypto mining so it's it's a it's a

490
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:21,299
pretty shady platform so this is what

491
00:18:21,299 --> 00:18:23,220
the admin panel looks like uh when you

492
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:25,080
log into it you can see the different

493
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:27,480
nodes that are uh acting as command and

494
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:29,280
control servers for dark utilities

495
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,500
customers and you can see uh at the time

496
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,539
I took this screenshot there was about 3

497
00:18:33,539 --> 00:18:36,059
000 users of this platform

498
00:18:36,059 --> 00:18:39,120
um so you do the math right nine euros

499
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,640
times three thousand users over a period

500
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,679
of just a few months is what the threat

501
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:45,179
actors behind this platform have been

502
00:18:45,179 --> 00:18:48,480
able to to make off of selling access to

503
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,280
the payloads in the associated C2

504
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,660
infrastructure

505
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:53,340
so the way these payloads work is they

506
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:55,500
are cross-platform they support a

507
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,059
variety of different operating systems

508
00:18:57,059 --> 00:18:59,160
and when you select what operating

509
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:01,620
system to expand support while I was

510
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:02,700
doing the research they actually

511
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:04,380
expanded support for for even more

512
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:06,660
operating systems so here's an example

513
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:07,799
where they

514
00:19:07,799 --> 00:19:09,720
um while I was doing the the research on

515
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:12,120
the the original payloads and tracking

516
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,620
the the use of them across the internet

517
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:15,720
they actually expanded and began to

518
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,940
support um the the arm architecture as

519
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:19,740
well so they're actively evolving

520
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:21,600
expanding support for various operating

521
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,179
systems and they even describe like what

522
00:19:24,179 --> 00:19:25,799
you would typically use these payloads

523
00:19:25,799 --> 00:19:28,860
for phones CCTV routers Wi-Fi repeaters

524
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:31,679
iot devices so

525
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:33,720
this is what uh the nodes look like so

526
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,520
if you've infected some systems with

527
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,140
dark utilities this is where you go to

528
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:40,020
administer them see uh resource usage

529
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:42,960
statistics and things of that nature

530
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,700
so in addition to crypto mining they

531
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:47,100
also support layer 4 and layer 7 denial

532
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:49,020
of service payloads

533
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:50,760
um so you can see an example of of where

534
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,320
you go to configure those those dos

535
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:55,080
payloads within the the dark utilities

536
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:57,360
platform that then gets executed by all

537
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,820
of the nodes under your control

538
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:01,799
so I mentioned earlier they they support

539
00:20:01,799 --> 00:20:05,940
XMR mining capabilities using a specific

540
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:09,000
mining pool it functions very similar to

541
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,580
every other XM rig variant malware that

542
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:13,380
you've ever seen in the wild as far as

543
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:15,720
like how it works on the system they're

544
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:18,660
actually just using a a modified version

545
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:20,940
of XM rig but this is where you would go

546
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:22,500
to configure it you put your Monero

547
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:25,580
wallet in and it takes care of

548
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:27,780
commanding all of the systems to begin

549
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:29,360
the mining process

550
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,740
and transmitting the the generated

551
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:34,140
Monero to your to your wallet they also

552
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:36,120
support distributed command execution so

553
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:38,160
let's say you have a hundred uh Bots

554
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,080
that you've infected you can actually

555
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,059
execute commands across all those

556
00:20:42,059 --> 00:20:43,799
systems simultaneously assuming that

557
00:20:43,799 --> 00:20:46,140
they're running the the same operating

558
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:48,840
system obviously right and they also

559
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:51,179
support uh distributed Discord token

560
00:20:51,179 --> 00:20:53,580
grabbing again discord's like it's a big

561
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:55,919
thing nowadays as far as like stealing

562
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:58,020
Discord tokens and impersonating users

563
00:20:58,020 --> 00:20:59,400
and then using that for further

564
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,799
distribute campaigns and social

565
00:21:01,799 --> 00:21:04,140
engineering and things of that nature

566
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:06,240
they're even nice enough to include an

567
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,039
interactive Powershell prompt within the

568
00:21:08,039 --> 00:21:11,120
platform so that you can directly

569
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:14,400
administer your servers

570
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,260
and they include a built-in python

571
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:18,600
interpreter as well if Powershell is not

572
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:21,000
your thing so they have a variety of

573
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,860
different support for various

574
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:24,720
functionality that doesn't require the

575
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:27,059
threat actors using this platform

576
00:21:27,059 --> 00:21:30,120
to know how to even code at all it's

577
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:32,520
it's all out of the box working

578
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:35,220
um you know you can just log in and use

579
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:36,960
it so it's really

580
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:37,679
um

581
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:40,020
minimizing the barrier to entry for for

582
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:42,659
adversaries in addition to like the web

583
00:21:42,659 --> 00:21:44,400
portal and administering your nodes and

584
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,260
configuring your dos payloads they also

585
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:48,120
support a rest API that you can use to

586
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:49,799
automate sending commands for things

587
00:21:49,799 --> 00:21:52,380
like denial of service attacks to your

588
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:55,500
uh to your nodes and they even include

589
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:59,100
um Wiki pages with uh sample payloads

590
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:01,559
that that you can use to direct your

591
00:22:01,559 --> 00:22:03,720
nodes to conduct these sorts of denial

592
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,700
of service attacks against you know

593
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:07,200
various targets gaming servers and

594
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,419
things like that

595
00:22:09,419 --> 00:22:11,580
so their terms of service

596
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,620
so they uh they have uh they have a term

597
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:14,760
as a service

598
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:16,799
um and they say that uh if you execute a

599
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:18,480
payload on a computer that's not yours

600
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,880
it's illicit but it's between you and

601
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,140
your government and they don't save any

602
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:24,179
information about you but then right

603
00:22:24,179 --> 00:22:26,340
below that they have a how-to guide on

604
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:28,440
building a botnet

605
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:30,419
and it it's it's

606
00:22:30,419 --> 00:22:32,340
pretty verbose like this is just step

607
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:34,440
one exploiting vulnerabilities manually

608
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:36,539
and it just goes through step by step

609
00:22:36,539 --> 00:22:38,400
how you go from finding vulnerable

610
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,620
systems on the internet infecting them

611
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:42,299
and then administering the the nodes

612
00:22:42,299 --> 00:22:44,179
once they're part of your botnet

613
00:22:44,179 --> 00:22:46,620
so let's talk about who is behind dark

614
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:48,419
utilities

615
00:22:48,419 --> 00:22:50,460
so there's a threat actor that uses the

616
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:53,340
handle implex sys he's the main admin

617
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:55,200
and owner of dark utilities he's located

618
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,640
in France

619
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,140
um he's got a relatively Short history

620
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:00,900
of activity posting activity on various

621
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:04,080
forums and and chat uh communication

622
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:07,020
channels doesn't go back very far but he

623
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:08,340
does have a collaborative relationship

624
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:10,320
with a small group of developers that

625
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:13,260
assist with the various projects that

626
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:15,419
um are being attributed to him that he's

627
00:23:15,419 --> 00:23:18,299
advertising in in various marketplaces

628
00:23:18,299 --> 00:23:19,679
so here's just a couple of the other

629
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:22,320
projects that uh that implex this also

630
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,600
runs so on the left you've got a Discord

631
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,940
raid tool so if you're not familiar with

632
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:29,340
this couple days until the reputation

633
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:31,919
gets uh gets too bad

634
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:33,539
and so with that I will open it up if

635
00:23:33,539 --> 00:23:36,500
anyone has any questions

636
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:45,360
uh have you have you ever heard of the

637
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,799
um data shards that I think that was

638
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:48,960
supposed to be like a Libre competitor

639
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,600
to ipfs

640
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:54,179
okay you say what did you call it data

641
00:23:54,179 --> 00:23:56,340
shards data shards no I'm not familiar

642
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:57,840
with that oh okay

643
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:00,360
but if it's a competitor to ipfs I will

644
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:03,799
probably look that up yeah

645
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,500
I have a question from the Discord

646
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:10,740
channel uh does uh ipfs system track the

647
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:14,780
source IP when someone uploads content

648
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:21,439
it's it's not easy to get at that data

649
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:24,960
I mean theoretically it's it's somewhere

650
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,880
but uh it's not not super easy to get at

651
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,100
and then once the the data is you know

652
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:30,780
within ipfs

653
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:32,580
um all bets are kind of off

654
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:34,679
um as as is the case with with most

655
00:24:34,679 --> 00:24:36,360
malware distribution right they're not

656
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:39,179
just gonna um typically log in from home

657
00:24:39,179 --> 00:24:41,400
in and upload content into ipfs they'll

658
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,919
be using a VPS on on some other uh sort

659
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:46,080
of bulletproof hosting provider to uh to

660
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,640
install the ipfs client and then

661
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,320
facilitate the retrieval

662
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:51,179
um so it might not be super helpful even

663
00:24:51,179 --> 00:24:54,559
if you were able to get at that data

664
00:24:57,659 --> 00:24:59,039
thank you

hi everybody I'm Yael and I work at

728
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:13,260
Consumer Reports

729
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:15,240
but I actually got my writing career

730
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:17,820
started as a middle school student I had

731
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:19,680
a little diary that I thought was secret

732
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:21,900
until my brother threatened to read it

733
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:24,240
and of course none of us want our older

734
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:26,640
brothers to read our bad poetry or learn

735
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:29,400
about our Middle School crushes

736
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:30,960
um but these days you don't actually

737
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:33,119
need to write your private thoughts down

738
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:36,540
for them to be overheard by strangers

739
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:38,820
so here's the question for you have you

740
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:41,160
ever walked down the street thinking

741
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:42,359
that you were alone having a really

742
00:40:42,359 --> 00:40:44,460
private conversation

743
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:46,800
maybe you took a call outside or you

744
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,240
went on a walk with a friend to talk

745
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:50,160
about a health condition or your

746
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:51,420
roommate that you didn't want to

747
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:53,640
overhear the call or maybe you were

748
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:55,200
talking about your breakup or even a

749
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,760
problem at work

750
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:58,380
what you might not have realized at the

751
00:40:58,380 --> 00:41:00,540
time is that it is very likely that the

752
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:02,400
conversation that you took outside for

753
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:05,700
privacy was actually being recorded

754
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:07,560
um it was within earshot of a video

755
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:10,380
doorbell that nearly five people sorry

756
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:12,359
nearly one in five people in the US have

757
00:41:12,359 --> 00:41:14,760
and if you have a doorbell camera you

758
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:15,900
might be recording audio from

759
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:18,420
unsuspecting passersby as well

760
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:20,400
that audio could even be sitting on a

761
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:23,180
company servers

762
00:41:23,339 --> 00:41:25,079
I started thinking about this when

763
00:41:25,079 --> 00:41:27,359
Matthew corglia from eff approached us

764
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:29,579
he's a policy analyst and he asked

765
00:41:29,579 --> 00:41:31,380
Consumer Reports to start investigating

766
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:33,960
it because he became concerned with ring

767
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:35,220
because it seemed like when he was

768
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:37,320
taking a walk

769
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:38,940
um overnight he would walk to the coffee

770
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:41,820
shop and he noticed that there was 12 or

771
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:44,339
13 ring cameras that he saw along the

772
00:41:44,339 --> 00:41:46,560
way to his walk

773
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:48,060
um and he started thinking about how an

774
00:41:48,060 --> 00:41:49,800
aggregate because these are kind of

775
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:52,079
centralized cameras and microphones they

776
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:53,880
could be used to track a person as they

777
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:56,160
move from place to place going about

778
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:57,660
their day

779
00:41:57,660 --> 00:41:59,760
and he realized it went beyond just the

780
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:01,440
visuals captured on it because you could

781
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:04,680
hear voices and it got eff

782
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:05,820
um really concerned about the audio

783
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:08,599
capabilities

784
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:12,720
um so eff reached out to us to see if we

785
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:14,280
could set up some kind of test in our

786
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:16,680
lab to see what kind of audio collection

787
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:19,079
these devices were capable of

788
00:42:19,079 --> 00:42:21,000
and our testing team went to the lab and

789
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,500
I'll let you listen to the results for

790
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:24,740
yourself

791
00:42:26,099 --> 00:42:29,220
sitting three feet away from

792
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:33,000
the ring doorbell I am now sitting six

793
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,339
feet away from The Ring doorbell I'm now

794
00:42:35,339 --> 00:42:38,160
sitting night viewing your doorbell

795
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:40,859
I'm now sitting both

796
00:42:40,859 --> 00:42:44,119
and this is 15 feet

797
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:49,500
so as you just heard you can hear audio

798
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:52,680
from three feet away from

799
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:54,960
the I clicked on the wrong thing as you

800
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:57,440
can just see twice you can uh

801
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:00,420
hear audio from 18 feet away which was

802
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:03,420
the furthest that we had tested

803
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:06,359
um and uh that was as big as the room

804
00:43:06,359 --> 00:43:08,040
was it was as far back as they could go

805
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:09,780
but I wanted to kind of simulate this

806
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:11,819
not just in the lab but in what it might

807
00:43:11,819 --> 00:43:14,160
look like in a real world example

808
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:16,020
um so we had our home writer Dan uh

809
00:43:16,020 --> 00:43:18,720
rocklowski mount a doorbell camera

810
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:20,520
um and another camera we were looking at

811
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:22,500
on his porch

812
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:23,819
um and this was somewhat intelligible

813
00:43:23,819 --> 00:43:25,680
from about 20 feet away

814
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:27,900
and he was playing BBC audio to ensure

815
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:29,460
there was the same level of audio in

816
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:31,140
each test and I'll let you listen to

817
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:33,440
that

818
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:44,880
to get every group included although as

819
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:46,859
is shown quite clearly in the figure I

820
00:43:46,859 --> 00:43:49,260
put an 80 are accounted for

821
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:51,060
nothing else may be said in this place

822
00:43:51,060 --> 00:43:54,140
10 feet the difference

823
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:04,640
15 feet

824
00:44:06,850 --> 00:44:09,960
[Music]

825
00:44:16,319 --> 00:44:19,339
20 feet

826
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:35,000
25 feet

827
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:50,180
30 feet

828
00:45:02,220 --> 00:45:03,540
the Packers

829
00:45:03,540 --> 00:45:05,540
record

830
00:45:06,540 --> 00:45:09,020
s

831
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:12,480
so I will disclose that I did increase

832
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:14,640
the volume up to 15 decibels afterwards

833
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:16,140
and I put that really big in the bottom

834
00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:17,460
because I didn't want anyone to say like

835
00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:19,500
oh this was edited but as you know if

836
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:22,380
you've studied audio if you can't hear

837
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:24,359
something then no amount of turning the

838
00:45:24,359 --> 00:45:26,579
volume up will make it audible

839
00:45:26,579 --> 00:45:28,200
um and I thought this was kind of

840
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:30,300
alarming that it was you could hear a

841
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:32,460
really clearly pretty far away and

842
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:35,520
Senator Markey actually asked Amazon how

843
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:37,200
far away it thought the devices could

844
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:40,619
record from and they declined to answer

845
00:45:40,619 --> 00:45:42,359
um

846
00:45:42,359 --> 00:45:44,700
and if I reached back out to Matthew to

847
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:46,560
get his thoughts on why this is so

848
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:49,319
alarming and he told me that people say

849
00:45:49,319 --> 00:45:51,119
there's no expectation of privacy in

850
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:53,099
public but a hush conversation on a

851
00:45:53,099 --> 00:45:55,680
sidewalk at night or in a car with a

852
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:57,839
window cracked open or even the idea

853
00:45:57,839 --> 00:45:59,460
that your neighbor's doorbell can't hear

854
00:45:59,460 --> 00:46:02,160
your conversation through an open window

855
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:04,980
um in many in many and not if not all of

856
00:46:04,980 --> 00:46:06,960
these situations people do expect there

857
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:09,180
to be some level of privacy and that's

858
00:46:09,180 --> 00:46:11,339
why we have wiretapping laws and consent

859
00:46:11,339 --> 00:46:13,680
laws about being recorded because we

860
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:15,420
know a hidden microphone left with the

861
00:46:15,420 --> 00:46:16,859
intention of recording your neighbor's

862
00:46:16,859 --> 00:46:19,099
conversation is an invasion of privacy

863
00:46:19,099 --> 00:46:21,900
it's why the Supreme Court's 2019

864
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:24,300
Carpenter decision said that walking

865
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:26,579
past one doorbell camera in public might

866
00:46:26,579 --> 00:46:28,260
not always constitute an invasion of

867
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:30,599
privacy but if you had a way to collect

868
00:46:30,599 --> 00:46:32,339
all of the data from all of the doorbell

869
00:46:32,339 --> 00:46:34,800
cameras you walk past in a day in

870
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:37,319
aggregate that certainly is legally as

871
00:46:37,319 --> 00:46:39,720
well as ethically a profound invasion of

872
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:42,200
privacy

873
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:46,800
um this is a map of ring cameras that

874
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:48,800
posted ring footage to the neighbors app

875
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:50,940
which becomes mappable with your

876
00:46:50,940 --> 00:46:54,060
location tags and Gizmodo uses data to

877
00:46:54,060 --> 00:46:56,280
kind of get a rough estimate of where

878
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:58,859
ring cameras are and even with this

879
00:46:58,859 --> 00:47:00,359
limited set you can see there's full

880
00:47:00,359 --> 00:47:02,280
neighborhoods in DC where it would be

881
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:04,260
impossible to walk around without being

882
00:47:04,260 --> 00:47:06,599
recorded

883
00:47:06,599 --> 00:47:08,520
and you can imagine all the things you

884
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:10,440
wouldn't want heard even if you are in a

885
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:11,520
neighbor's house with your window open

886
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:13,260
you might think you think you were in

887
00:47:13,260 --> 00:47:15,180
the privacy of your own home and not

888
00:47:15,180 --> 00:47:16,260
know that these very personal

889
00:47:16,260 --> 00:47:18,660
conversations are recorded and they can

890
00:47:18,660 --> 00:47:20,339
be heard from your neighbor's camera or

891
00:47:20,339 --> 00:47:21,900
even your own camera in your own house

892
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:23,880
and I'm sure it's not hard to think

893
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:25,920
about things that you could be talking

894
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:27,300
about in your home that you wouldn't

895
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:29,460
want people to hear so I made a joke

896
00:47:29,460 --> 00:47:31,560
about my diary earlier but I want to

897
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:33,359
point out that there are some serious

898
00:47:33,359 --> 00:47:35,760
potential harms here

899
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:38,579
um and as with any kind of surveillance

900
00:47:38,579 --> 00:47:40,140
we know that this is more likely to

901
00:47:40,140 --> 00:47:41,700
affect marginalized people which could

902
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:44,579
be low-income folks women or people of

903
00:47:44,579 --> 00:47:46,319
color and it's really hard to write

904
00:47:46,319 --> 00:47:47,640
about this when I was doing journalism

905
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:49,079
for Consumer Reports because people

906
00:47:49,079 --> 00:47:51,599
don't tend to want to talk about to the

907
00:47:51,599 --> 00:47:53,520
media about or the public about ways

908
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:55,260
they were extorted or discriminated

909
00:47:55,260 --> 00:47:57,060
against or embarrassed and how their

910
00:47:57,060 --> 00:47:58,500
lives were destroyed when their most

911
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:01,140
private information was made public but

912
00:48:01,140 --> 00:48:03,540
it's not difficult to imagine what that

913
00:48:03,540 --> 00:48:05,099
might look like

914
00:48:05,099 --> 00:48:07,319
I did find this Reddit post about a

915
00:48:07,319 --> 00:48:09,060
queer 16 year old whose neighbor was

916
00:48:09,060 --> 00:48:10,619
sending photos of her with her

917
00:48:10,619 --> 00:48:13,560
girlfriend to her parents and like

918
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:15,960
implied she's still a bike and so forth

919
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:17,760
um and so I'm sure you can think of some

920
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:19,619
examples of things you'd be talking

921
00:48:19,619 --> 00:48:20,579
about

922
00:48:20,579 --> 00:48:21,720
um

923
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:24,060
and

924
00:48:24,060 --> 00:48:25,020
um you know you're in your apartment

925
00:48:25,020 --> 00:48:26,579
picking up your mail you're on a phone

926
00:48:26,579 --> 00:48:28,200
call walking around the block or even

927
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:29,520
inside your own home with your screen

928
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:30,780
door open

929
00:48:30,780 --> 00:48:32,280
and then there's the issue of People

930
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:34,500
sharing it they could post it on the

931
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:36,359
neighbors app or online we know the

932
00:48:36,359 --> 00:48:38,040
footage from video doorbell cameras goes

933
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:39,960
viral all the time

934
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:41,640
um there's even a TV show and I haven't

935
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:43,319
been able to watch it yet but I thought

936
00:48:43,319 --> 00:48:45,300
it was really bizarre like there's this

937
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:47,160
sort of dystopian show called ring

938
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:48,599
Nation

939
00:48:48,599 --> 00:48:51,240
um and it's sort of like a cross between

940
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:54,780
America's Home Videos and like um I

941
00:48:54,780 --> 00:48:57,720
don't know Black Mirror

942
00:48:57,720 --> 00:49:00,839
um and and normally like the clear foot

943
00:49:00,839 --> 00:49:02,280
they're like oh yeah we followed all the

944
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:03,839
legal rules to clear it they're clearing

945
00:49:03,839 --> 00:49:05,160
they're getting permission from the

946
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:07,380
people who own the cameras not the

947
00:49:07,380 --> 00:49:09,720
people who are you know being portrayed

948
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:10,920
in these

949
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:12,180
um I think that might be different for

950
00:49:12,180 --> 00:49:13,380
television I think it depends on if

951
00:49:13,380 --> 00:49:14,819
there's sound on and all sorts of other

952
00:49:14,819 --> 00:49:16,920
things because there are some uh legal

953
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:18,960
nuances there but in general it's like

954
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:20,880
if somebody takes my picture that

955
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:22,560
affects me not the person who took the

956
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:24,960
picture in my opinion so

957
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:26,520
and then there's a law enforcement

958
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:29,040
implications here because the audio

959
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:31,680
could even be shared with police and you

960
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:32,940
might not want to share the footage with

961
00:49:32,940 --> 00:49:34,740
police but the companies might even be

962
00:49:34,740 --> 00:49:36,119
sharing it without your knowledge or

963
00:49:36,119 --> 00:49:38,220
consent in some cases without even a

964
00:49:38,220 --> 00:49:40,020
warrant

965
00:49:40,020 --> 00:49:42,119
um obviously if and encryption is off

966
00:49:42,119 --> 00:49:43,980
then the police can request that from

967
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:45,359
the company they don't it doesn't even

968
00:49:45,359 --> 00:49:46,680
go through you you might not even know

969
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:47,700
about it

970
00:49:47,700 --> 00:49:49,440
and rink has been called to task for

971
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:50,579
this because they had this really weird

972
00:49:50,579 --> 00:49:52,680
emergency provision where they can

973
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:54,599
decide in which situations police are

974
00:49:54,599 --> 00:49:57,000
allowed to circumvent the few legal

975
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,220
restrictions that are in place

976
00:49:59,220 --> 00:50:00,660
um to access the data so like Amazon

977
00:50:00,660 --> 00:50:02,460
somebody at Amazon gets to decide what's

978
00:50:02,460 --> 00:50:04,200
an emergency and when people are at risk

979
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:07,859
which I think is kind of bizarre

980
00:50:07,859 --> 00:50:09,420
um and I don't want to only call out

981
00:50:09,420 --> 00:50:11,040
ring here we that we have found that

982
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:12,900
other companies do this as well again

983
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:14,880
this is an article

984
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:18,060
um by my colleague Dan raklowski and he

985
00:50:18,060 --> 00:50:19,980
found that um

986
00:50:19,980 --> 00:50:22,380
there are other security cameras that do

987
00:50:22,380 --> 00:50:24,000
this Google Simply Safe and others could

988
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,680
share video footage with police without

989
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:27,780
user consent

990
00:50:27,780 --> 00:50:30,480
um and I there's problems with that we

991
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:31,920
know there's circumstances where police

992
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:34,500
have lied to get a warrant we saw that

993
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:37,079
um uh this happened with Verona Taylor

994
00:50:37,079 --> 00:50:40,140
case last summer and as flat as the

995
00:50:40,140 --> 00:50:41,700
process might be there there's a few

996
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:43,079
situations in which there are

997
00:50:43,079 --> 00:50:44,640
occasionally repercussions for

998
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:46,920
falsifying information for getting a

999
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:48,839
warrant for data but I'm guessing that

1000
00:50:48,839 --> 00:50:50,760
Amazon does not have a fraud division

1001
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:53,040
for investigating emergency requests to

1002
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:55,200
see if police are telling the truth on

1003
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:57,480
these forms

1004
00:50:57,480 --> 00:50:59,280
um and there's also the possibility that

1005
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:01,380
people can trick the police

1006
00:51:01,380 --> 00:51:02,940
um people say this is far-fetched but

1007
00:51:02,940 --> 00:51:05,040
weird stuff happens all the time like

1008
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:07,380
for example just this past December two

1009
00:51:07,380 --> 00:51:09,660
men were charged with swatting

1010
00:51:09,660 --> 00:51:11,220
um and they actually gained access to

1011
00:51:11,220 --> 00:51:13,319
other people's ring cameras made Focus

1012
00:51:13,319 --> 00:51:15,119
phone calls that triggered an armed

1013
00:51:15,119 --> 00:51:17,220
police response and then live streamed

1014
00:51:17,220 --> 00:51:19,440
all of it and in some instances they use

1015
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:21,660
the ring access to taunt police officers

1016
00:51:21,660 --> 00:51:22,920
and victims

1017
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:25,800
is this common no does it happen yeah

1018
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:28,020
sometimes and the way they did this was

1019
00:51:28,020 --> 00:51:29,520
by getting names and passwords of

1020
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:31,740
compromised Yahoo accounts and then they

1021
00:51:31,740 --> 00:51:33,359
look for ring accounts associated with

1022
00:51:33,359 --> 00:51:35,579
those email addresses and passwords so

1023
00:51:35,579 --> 00:51:37,380
this was just basic credential stuffing

1024
00:51:37,380 --> 00:51:39,720
it didn't take like some Elite hacker

1025
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:42,300
like um to do this

1026
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:44,040
um so here so what can you do about it

1027
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:46,619
you can not have a camera people existed

1028
00:51:46,619 --> 00:51:48,059
for millions of years without doorbell

1029
00:51:48,059 --> 00:51:50,940
cameras I don't have a doorbell camera

1030
00:51:50,940 --> 00:51:52,680
um if you do feel like you want to get a

1031
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:54,059
camera you can get one that has

1032
00:51:54,059 --> 00:51:55,980
end-to-end encryption or local recording

1033
00:51:55,980 --> 00:51:58,079
so either it's encrypted or it's not

1034
00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:00,780
even on the company servers at all you

1035
00:52:00,780 --> 00:52:02,760
can angle your camera so it's only on

1036
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:04,440
your front porch or turn off motion

1037
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:06,960
activation so it does not record on the

1038
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:09,119
screen in front of your home and you can

1039
00:52:09,119 --> 00:52:12,000
turn on off audio collection during

1040
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,940
motion detection altogether

1041
00:52:14,940 --> 00:52:16,619
and if you do want to end an encryption

1042
00:52:16,619 --> 00:52:18,000
or local recording there are some

1043
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,700
options even ring has ended encryption

1044
00:52:20,700 --> 00:52:23,520
for some models but it's off by default

1045
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:25,319
and it's not available for all their

1046
00:52:25,319 --> 00:52:27,319
products and you do lose some features

1047
00:52:27,319 --> 00:52:29,760
which isn't really necessary we know

1048
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:31,140
that there's other cameras that have

1049
00:52:31,140 --> 00:52:32,700
ended encryption where you do not lose

1050
00:52:32,700 --> 00:52:35,220
features but if you do have a ring

1051
00:52:35,220 --> 00:52:36,540
already and you want you're worried

1052
00:52:36,540 --> 00:52:38,880
about this there are ways to take care

1053
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:41,339
of that and and set that up

1054
00:52:41,339 --> 00:52:43,140
uh and that way the police will either

1055
00:52:43,140 --> 00:52:44,940
need to come to you because the company

1056
00:52:44,940 --> 00:52:46,380
doesn't have the data or because they

1057
00:52:46,380 --> 00:52:48,599
don't have the encryption keys

1058
00:52:48,599 --> 00:52:50,280
and uh

1059
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:52,079
we used to have yuffie on this list

1060
00:52:52,079 --> 00:52:55,079
because they said that they uh they uh

1061
00:52:55,079 --> 00:52:56,760
only use local storage but apparently

1062
00:52:56,760 --> 00:52:58,200
they were not telling the truth when

1063
00:52:58,200 --> 00:53:00,300
they only use local storage at least

1064
00:53:00,300 --> 00:53:02,880
according to this Verge piece so yuffie

1065
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:05,640
is no longer on this list it's uh natapo

1066
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:07,980
TP link and pretty much any camera and

1067
00:53:07,980 --> 00:53:09,780
doorbell that supports Apple homekit

1068
00:53:09,780 --> 00:53:11,760
secure video including Logitech Circle

1069
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:13,920
View and remote

1070
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:14,579
um

1071
00:53:14,579 --> 00:53:16,740
but obviously buying a camera that

1072
00:53:16,740 --> 00:53:18,300
doesn't spy on your neighbors is only

1073
00:53:18,300 --> 00:53:20,160
half the battle because it does not stop

1074
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:22,380
your neighbors or the police from spying

1075
00:53:22,380 --> 00:53:23,700
on you

1076
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:25,260
um so we know that one in five of

1077
00:53:25,260 --> 00:53:27,540
Americans has these devices they blanket

1078
00:53:27,540 --> 00:53:29,760
entire neighborhoods they're it's read

1079
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:31,140
to people of color and marginalized

1080
00:53:31,140 --> 00:53:32,880
groups so what are we going to do about

1081
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:35,160
it in terms of what the government's

1082
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:37,020
doing about this the answer is really

1083
00:53:37,020 --> 00:53:40,319
not a whole lot we've had a few Senators

1084
00:53:40,319 --> 00:53:42,839
voice their concerns Elizabeth Warren

1085
00:53:42,839 --> 00:53:44,220
and Ed Markey have written letters to

1086
00:53:44,220 --> 00:53:46,559
ring asking probing questions but we

1087
00:53:46,559 --> 00:53:49,380
haven't seen any kind of regulation on

1088
00:53:49,380 --> 00:53:51,180
them yet and we only have a few legal

1089
00:53:51,180 --> 00:53:52,740
precedents that might give us a little

1090
00:53:52,740 --> 00:53:55,740
bit of alleged to stand on in England a

1091
00:53:55,740 --> 00:53:57,300
judge ruled a person who recorded a

1092
00:53:57,300 --> 00:53:59,640
neighbor's gate garden and car parking

1093
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:01,920
space with a ring doorbell Cam and Miss

1094
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:03,359
letter about how it worked was

1095
00:54:03,359 --> 00:54:05,819
unreasonably invading her privacy it's

1096
00:54:05,819 --> 00:54:07,200
just kind of funny that this happened in

1097
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:08,579
England considering like how many

1098
00:54:08,579 --> 00:54:12,180
cameras exist there but it didn't

1099
00:54:12,180 --> 00:54:13,740
um the other thing we have in the US is

1100
00:54:13,740 --> 00:54:15,599
um like I mentioned earlier wire typing

1101
00:54:15,599 --> 00:54:17,940
laws and there's actually two U.S cases

1102
00:54:17,940 --> 00:54:20,400
about shot spotter which is an acoustic

1103
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:22,680
gunshot detection system

1104
00:54:22,680 --> 00:54:24,900
um that uh it captured human voices and

1105
00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:27,599
proximity to loud noises and those loud

1106
00:54:27,599 --> 00:54:29,940
noises may or may not be gunshots and

1107
00:54:29,940 --> 00:54:31,619
prosecutors tried to introduce the audio

1108
00:54:31,619 --> 00:54:34,680
of the voices as evidence in those into

1109
00:54:34,680 --> 00:54:36,359
trials and one of them was considered

1110
00:54:36,359 --> 00:54:38,640
admissible and the other was not because

1111
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:41,460
the audio was prohibited interception

1112
00:54:41,460 --> 00:54:44,640
under a Massachusetts wiretap act but

1113
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:46,020
other than that the people we've really

1114
00:54:46,020 --> 00:54:48,240
had to rely on for regulation are

1115
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:50,220
nonprofits investigative journalists

1116
00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:52,020
civil liberties groups civil rights

1117
00:54:52,020 --> 00:54:54,180
groups and what we really need is not

1118
00:54:54,180 --> 00:54:56,940
just privacy reform but to take a look

1119
00:54:56,940 --> 00:54:58,740
at the relationships between ring and

1120
00:54:58,740 --> 00:55:01,260
law enforcement as well

1121
00:55:01,260 --> 00:55:03,180
um there is a really long history of a

1122
00:55:03,180 --> 00:55:04,980
very close relationship between the two

1123
00:55:04,980 --> 00:55:06,660
which includes trading free cameras

1124
00:55:06,660 --> 00:55:08,760
building free tools

1125
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:09,839
um I like the one about emergency

1126
00:55:09,839 --> 00:55:12,480
circumstances and other inner

1127
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:14,460
interfaces we've seen over the years but

1128
00:55:14,460 --> 00:55:16,680
this huge investigation by the LA Times

1129
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:18,480
revealed emails in which ring was

1130
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:20,760
offering discount codes to police

1131
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:24,059
and the more civilians uh like they were

1132
00:55:24,059 --> 00:55:25,740
encouraging civilians many of whom were

1133
00:55:25,740 --> 00:55:28,079
victims of crime to use them and that's

1134
00:55:28,079 --> 00:55:29,520
kind of gross when you think about it

1135
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:30,900
like you could call the police because

1136
00:55:30,900 --> 00:55:32,460
you're a victim of a crime and they have

1137
00:55:32,460 --> 00:55:35,460
an affiliate linked to the ring doorbell

1138
00:55:35,460 --> 00:55:37,460
um

1139
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:41,040
uh and so we can see that the meteoric

1140
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:42,359
rise of ring may have had something to

1141
00:55:42,359 --> 00:55:43,800
do with police promoting it maybe

1142
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:45,420
because they were getting free cameras

1143
00:55:45,420 --> 00:55:46,980
and how to close your relationship with

1144
00:55:46,980 --> 00:55:48,059
them

1145
00:55:48,059 --> 00:55:49,980
if we had a wish list of reforms we

1146
00:55:49,980 --> 00:55:51,599
could get companies to agree with this

1147
00:55:51,599 --> 00:55:53,220
is what we would ask and again I did

1148
00:55:53,220 --> 00:55:54,839
this in collaboration with Matthew

1149
00:55:54,839 --> 00:55:57,660
gorglia eff we want them to turn into an

1150
00:55:57,660 --> 00:55:59,640
encryption on by default or introduce

1151
00:55:59,640 --> 00:56:01,859
local storage actual local storage not

1152
00:56:01,859 --> 00:56:03,540
just pretending it's local storage until

1153
00:56:03,540 --> 00:56:06,000
hackers find out that it isn't

1154
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,800
um no default audio collection for

1155
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:10,859
motion activated incidents and be user

1156
00:56:10,859 --> 00:56:12,540
focused stop creating and offering

1157
00:56:12,540 --> 00:56:14,160
features specifically for law

1158
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:16,440
enforcement they are not your customers

1159
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:18,540
and accountability and transparency

1160
00:56:18,540 --> 00:56:20,400
about their historical relationship with

1161
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:22,140
law enforcement which bring has kind of

1162
00:56:22,140 --> 00:56:24,720
and others actually ring has put out

1163
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:26,280
reports but they haven't answered all

1164
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:29,339
the questions that people have had

1165
00:56:29,339 --> 00:56:30,540
um and there's a bunch of other reading

1166
00:56:30,540 --> 00:56:32,700
I will tweet out the slides I will also

1167
00:56:32,700 --> 00:56:34,740
put them on Mastodon

1168
00:56:34,740 --> 00:56:36,720
um but we have reading from Consumer

1169
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:39,599
Reports on this and from eff and I will

1170
00:56:39,599 --> 00:56:42,140
take question

1171
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:46,079
um so you focus a lot on ring obviously

1172
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:47,460
well there's been a lot of news there's

1173
00:56:47,460 --> 00:56:49,500
a lot of headlines with ring I know I

1174
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:51,480
saw like Nest I think spring of last

1175
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:53,520
year said oh yeah by the way we also did

1176
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:56,760
the not no warrant stuff with police

1177
00:56:56,760 --> 00:56:59,520
um but I guess question is

1178
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:01,640
um

1179
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:03,359
kind of kind of like you had some

1180
00:57:03,359 --> 00:57:05,220
recommendations there but like I guess

1181
00:57:05,220 --> 00:57:07,020
what are the ethics around this because

1182
00:57:07,020 --> 00:57:09,599
like you know generally one of the legal

1183
00:57:09,599 --> 00:57:11,520
complications is generally people in the

1184
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:14,099
public areas have no right to privacy

1185
00:57:14,099 --> 00:57:15,720
you know that's kind of been the

1186
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:17,760
understood so like I think that's like

1187
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:19,920
the big hurdle I guess in a lot of the

1188
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:22,140
ethics and and and the uh legal

1189
00:57:22,140 --> 00:57:23,280
complications

1190
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:25,020
um is there any analysis or thoughts

1191
00:57:25,020 --> 00:57:27,359
that the eff has had about getting over

1192
00:57:27,359 --> 00:57:29,579
that kind of like rebuttal that will be

1193
00:57:29,579 --> 00:57:33,300
given in courts um to these types of

1194
00:57:33,300 --> 00:57:35,400
to these types of laws or to these types

1195
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:38,400
of measures to try and stop more

1196
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:40,319
recording of people in public yeah

1197
00:57:40,319 --> 00:57:41,579
that's a really good question I think

1198
00:57:41,579 --> 00:57:44,339
there's kind of two questions in there

1199
00:57:44,339 --> 00:57:45,599
in there the clearly I think it's

1200
00:57:45,599 --> 00:57:47,400
unethical that you cannot go anywhere

1201
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:49,619
and have a private conversation

1202
00:57:49,619 --> 00:57:51,599
um legally it's uh it's a little more

1203
00:57:51,599 --> 00:57:52,980
complicated

1204
00:57:52,980 --> 00:57:55,859
um and I don't like uh and what what is

1205
00:57:55,859 --> 00:57:57,420
considered public

1206
00:57:57,420 --> 00:58:00,180
um and and yeah there hasn't been a lot

1207
00:58:00,180 --> 00:58:01,680
on it I think it might be kind of an

1208
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:04,020
uphill battle honestly but like uh but

1209
00:58:04,020 --> 00:58:06,119
there are wiretapping laws and there is

1210
00:58:06,119 --> 00:58:08,040
you know stuff like that but I guess I

1211
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:10,800
just the aggregate collection I think is

1212
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:13,020
where got you like if I record my one

1213
00:58:13,020 --> 00:58:14,700
neighbor walking down the street maybe

1214
00:58:14,700 --> 00:58:16,319
that's legal but if they are being

1215
00:58:16,319 --> 00:58:18,720
recorded from Street to Street like

1216
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:23,540
that's that gets a little more uh spotty

1217
00:58:23,700 --> 00:58:25,700
um

1218
00:58:29,460 --> 00:58:31,460
um so you said that aggregate collection

1219
00:58:31,460 --> 00:58:36,000
is kind of where it's the law has been

1220
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,619
um or the line has been drawn there do

1221
00:58:37,619 --> 00:58:38,700
we know

1222
00:58:38,700 --> 00:58:41,339
what data Amazon actually stores and

1223
00:58:41,339 --> 00:58:42,839
collects and

1224
00:58:42,839 --> 00:58:45,180
with the way they collect it start to

1225
00:58:45,180 --> 00:58:46,920
bleed into what's considered aggregate

1226
00:58:46,920 --> 00:58:49,020
data versus just like individual

1227
00:58:49,020 --> 00:58:52,559
instances of stored data that's a really

1228
00:58:52,559 --> 00:58:53,579
good question

1229
00:58:53,579 --> 00:58:55,140
um we don't know it there's they're not

1230
00:58:55,140 --> 00:58:57,180
very forthcoming about what they collect

1231
00:58:57,180 --> 00:59:00,059
the hell on my story and also legally I

1232
00:59:00,059 --> 00:59:02,160
don't know that just because like we

1233
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:04,020
think this is a red line and want to

1234
00:59:04,020 --> 00:59:06,119
make the case for it legally like the um

1235
00:59:06,119 --> 00:59:08,520
Community like the laws on this are like

1236
00:59:08,520 --> 00:59:10,260
very outdated like they were created

1237
00:59:10,260 --> 00:59:11,460
before there were these kinds of

1238
00:59:11,460 --> 00:59:13,260
doorbells like it's just like any other

1239
00:59:13,260 --> 00:59:16,559
kind of uh um Tech Law

1240
00:59:16,559 --> 00:59:18,359
um but yeah I don't know I don't we

1241
00:59:18,359 --> 00:59:19,920
don't know for sure

1242
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:21,299
um

1243
00:59:21,299 --> 00:59:23,280
I know that like one of the things they

1244
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:25,619
pushed for is just to let people know

1245
00:59:25,619 --> 00:59:28,559
and not have it on by default like um

1246
00:59:28,559 --> 00:59:30,599
but yeah those are kind of tricky uh

1247
00:59:30,599 --> 00:59:32,460
legal questions I don't know if I can

1248
00:59:32,460 --> 00:59:35,900
answer give you a sufficient answer

1249
00:59:36,540 --> 00:59:39,740
um oh we have someone in the back

1250
00:59:44,760 --> 00:59:46,140
this is what I get for sitting in the

1251
00:59:46,140 --> 00:59:49,200
back uh in your experience and you have

1252
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:50,400
more experience looking at you know

1253
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:51,599
these different products have you seen

1254
00:59:51,599 --> 00:59:53,520
anything to kind of counteract this I

1255
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:55,079
don't know if there's like a

1256
00:59:55,079 --> 00:59:56,880
technical space for that but I know

1257
00:59:56,880 --> 00:59:58,680
there's like white noise blocking

1258
00:59:58,680 --> 01:00:00,119
machines is there any way that maybe we

1259
01:00:00,119 --> 01:00:02,940
could sort of mitigate this with

1260
01:00:02,940 --> 01:00:04,740
I don't know an app or something or is

1261
01:00:04,740 --> 01:00:07,740
that not been explored I was curious

1262
01:00:07,740 --> 01:00:09,240
about that I wanted to test that I

1263
01:00:09,240 --> 01:00:10,559
thought that would be really fun to test

1264
01:00:10,559 --> 01:00:12,559
uh but I didn't get approval for that

1265
01:00:12,559 --> 01:00:14,700
it's like what

1266
01:00:14,700 --> 01:00:15,720
I would have been asked because I knew I

1267
01:00:15,720 --> 01:00:18,119
wouldn't yeah it's a big thing to test I

1268
01:00:18,119 --> 01:00:19,440
thought it would be really fun to just

1269
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:21,780
walk around with a doorbell a different

1270
01:00:21,780 --> 01:00:23,880
vlogging devices and see what worked and

1271
01:00:23,880 --> 01:00:25,200
what did it

1272
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:27,059
um I don't know I guess the other thing

1273
01:00:27,059 --> 01:00:29,339
though about this is that um if you look

1274
01:00:29,339 --> 01:00:30,780
at like low income communities that are

1275
01:00:30,780 --> 01:00:32,339
like just widely surveilled more than

1276
01:00:32,339 --> 01:00:34,859
anybody like in public housing they have

1277
01:00:34,859 --> 01:00:37,619
these cameras and and lots of other the

1278
01:00:37,619 --> 01:00:39,119
creepy things that they have to contend

1279
01:00:39,119 --> 01:00:41,940
with I do feel like the the people at

1280
01:00:41,940 --> 01:00:43,680
this conference or people who like are

1281
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:46,079
gonna know didn't even test white noise

1282
01:00:46,079 --> 01:00:47,640
machines like it might make a difference

1283
01:00:47,640 --> 01:00:49,980
in their lives but it's not kind of

1284
01:00:49,980 --> 01:00:51,960
hitting the systemic issue yeah

1285
01:00:51,960 --> 01:00:54,059
unfortunately but yeah I would love to

1286
01:00:54,059 --> 01:00:57,540
test that out sometime like just uh I

1287
01:00:57,540 --> 01:00:59,099
don't know I I think it's disturbing

1288
01:00:59,099 --> 01:01:00,480
because I'm like where would I go if I

1289
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:01,859
want to have a private conversation I

1290
01:01:01,859 --> 01:01:03,960
used to go on a walk like do you have to

1291
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:05,819
go to the woods are there cameras in the

1292
01:01:05,819 --> 01:01:07,619
woods like what's the there's hunting

1293
01:01:07,619 --> 01:01:10,079
cameras in the woods

1294
01:01:10,079 --> 01:01:12,540
yeah I don't know it's like uh but I

1295
01:01:12,540 --> 01:01:14,819
don't those machines do work well in in

1296
01:01:14,819 --> 01:01:18,420
closed spaces yeah I was just curious no

1297
01:01:18,420 --> 01:01:20,400
I'd be interested if anybody here wants

1298
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:22,200
to do an experiment I'm all for it

1299
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:26,480
future Cactus can't talk yeah exactly

1300
01:01:33,180 --> 01:01:35,520
okay so um sorry one more thing I just

1301
01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:39,299
actually I I have a nest doorbell uh and

1302
01:01:39,299 --> 01:01:40,980
one of the things I did is I zone out

1303
01:01:40,980 --> 01:01:43,680
exactly where I want so I'm like I I was

1304
01:01:43,680 --> 01:01:45,359
like getting alerted of people walking

1305
01:01:45,359 --> 01:01:46,920
by I'm like I don't want to try I don't

1306
01:01:46,920 --> 01:01:48,960
want to record them and it has a three

1307
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:50,760
hour recording

1308
01:01:50,760 --> 01:01:52,440
there's also a way to save it up in the

1309
01:01:52,440 --> 01:01:54,000
cloud but like are you aware of like

1310
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:57,119
Nest slash Google do they store locally

1311
01:01:57,119 --> 01:01:59,940
on your device only or are they up in

1312
01:01:59,940 --> 01:02:03,180
the cloud like collecting all this and

1313
01:02:03,180 --> 01:02:05,400
storing it I know ring was kind of the

1314
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:08,819
the main the main uh thrust here but I

1315
01:02:08,819 --> 01:02:09,839
didn't know if you had any information

1316
01:02:09,839 --> 01:02:12,720
about nest some of the collection they

1317
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:14,520
do even though you may say just three

1318
01:02:14,520 --> 01:02:16,380
hour recording

1319
01:02:16,380 --> 01:02:18,780
I think they were one of let me see if

1320
01:02:18,780 --> 01:02:20,339
they are on this list

1321
01:02:20,339 --> 01:02:22,260
we didn't look at every we looked at

1322
01:02:22,260 --> 01:02:24,059
Arlo And we looked at

1323
01:02:24,059 --> 01:02:25,260
um

1324
01:02:25,260 --> 01:02:29,040
but I don't think that we looked at uh

1325
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:30,900
because they give the option of like a

1326
01:02:30,900 --> 01:02:32,640
60-day storage I'm like I'm not doing 60

1327
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:35,460
day in the cloud yeah I don't need that

1328
01:02:35,460 --> 01:02:37,740
I just need three hours and it's like is

1329
01:02:37,740 --> 01:02:40,260
it on the cloud is it encrypted yeah no

1330
01:02:40,260 --> 01:02:40,980
um

1331
01:02:40,980 --> 01:02:43,799
yeah I don't I will have to get back to

1332
01:02:43,799 --> 01:02:45,660
you on that because I don't know off the

1333
01:02:45,660 --> 01:02:47,940
top of my head no worries

1334
01:02:47,940 --> 01:02:49,680
um but I do know that they're one of the

1335
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:51,180
ones that said that they would share

1336
01:02:51,180 --> 01:02:53,339
footage with police without consent yeah

1337
01:02:53,339 --> 01:02:54,960
so now I'm wondering like wait if I only

1338
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:57,000
said three hour history how in the world

1339
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,040
would you have video two days ago of

1340
01:02:59,040 --> 01:03:00,980
something to be able to give police

1341
01:03:00,980 --> 01:03:04,380
yeah yeah so maybe that's yeah that's

1342
01:03:04,380 --> 01:03:06,370
tricky that's interesting

1343
01:03:06,370 --> 01:03:07,079
[Music]

1344
01:03:07,079 --> 01:03:07,619
um

1345
01:03:07,619 --> 01:03:10,680
the other thing that uh like um we I had

1346
01:03:10,680 --> 01:03:12,119
a nest person who's like I really need

1347
01:03:12,119 --> 01:03:13,559
this for security

1348
01:03:13,559 --> 01:03:14,880
um

1349
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:16,980
like and so that's why we we didn't want

1350
01:03:16,980 --> 01:03:18,240
to just say like nobody should have any

1351
01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:19,619
cameras ever because I do think there

1352
01:03:19,619 --> 01:03:21,059
are instances where people do want

1353
01:03:21,059 --> 01:03:22,500
cameras like

1354
01:03:22,500 --> 01:03:24,720
um for their own protection and they

1355
01:03:24,720 --> 01:03:26,880
might even want it on the cloud

1356
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:28,440
um but like

1357
01:03:28,440 --> 01:03:30,240
why can't you end an encryption I don't

1358
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:31,980
know I just don't believe people when

1359
01:03:31,980 --> 01:03:33,240
they say it's too hard to end in

1360
01:03:33,240 --> 01:03:34,740
encryptus and have it be on the cloud

1361
01:03:34,740 --> 01:03:36,839
because I'm like that's what Zoom said

1362
01:03:36,839 --> 01:03:39,540
and now they do it like they um you know

1363
01:03:39,540 --> 01:03:41,339
it's like we have signal you can I can

1364
01:03:41,339 --> 01:03:43,799
send people videos on Signal and like I

1365
01:03:43,799 --> 01:03:45,599
kind of don't know if I believe ring

1366
01:03:45,599 --> 01:03:48,180
when they say like oh like the only way

1367
01:03:48,180 --> 01:03:50,040
we can do this is by defecating features

1368
01:03:50,040 --> 01:03:51,960
because other places don't deprecate

1369
01:03:51,960 --> 01:03:53,460
features

1370
01:03:53,460 --> 01:03:55,140
um so yeah I don't know if that's like

1371
01:03:55,140 --> 01:03:57,780
People's Choice for why they will choose

1372
01:03:57,780 --> 01:03:59,880
it do you have a setting to not store it

1373
01:03:59,880 --> 01:04:01,980
or yes

1374
01:04:01,980 --> 01:04:04,260
words it's like nope you have to oh hold

1375
01:04:04,260 --> 01:04:06,540
the camera when it sees an event

1376
01:04:06,540 --> 01:04:09,140
okay

1377
01:04:12,839 --> 01:04:14,960
okay

1378
01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:20,579
so you have a three hour event window

1379
01:04:20,579 --> 01:04:22,619
and you're thinking that

1380
01:04:22,619 --> 01:04:26,180
maybe they have at least

1381
01:04:31,619 --> 01:04:33,900
yeah yeah it's always weird when they

1382
01:04:33,900 --> 01:04:35,460
say they're not storing it any you're

1383
01:04:35,460 --> 01:04:37,140
still able to access it which shows that

1384
01:04:37,140 --> 01:04:40,400
they are scoring yeah

1385
01:04:45,359 --> 01:04:47,400
yeah I don't know I wish I had answers

1386
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:48,960
so all of your really amazing questions

1387
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:50,579
I think that kind of demonstrates how

1388
01:04:50,579 --> 01:04:53,040
little we do actually know about this so

1389
01:04:53,040 --> 01:04:54,900
okay we have 30 seconds left I have one

1390
01:04:54,900 --> 01:04:57,020
more

1391
01:05:00,839 --> 01:05:02,640
yeah that's why I use the words end in

1392
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:04,440
encryption instead of encryption and I

1393
01:05:04,440 --> 01:05:05,760
know that there's companies now who

1394
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:07,380
think it's cool to pretend that and an

1395
01:05:07,380 --> 01:05:09,180
encryption means that encryption when

1396
01:05:09,180 --> 01:05:10,859
they have the keys and that zero trust

1397
01:05:10,859 --> 01:05:12,839
means in that encryption but if you look

1398
01:05:12,839 --> 01:05:14,700
at the FTC settlement after the

1399
01:05:14,700 --> 01:05:16,260
reporting that Michael Lee and I did on

1400
01:05:16,260 --> 01:05:17,640
Zoom like they don't View and then

1401
01:05:17,640 --> 01:05:20,160
encryption that way like they think that

1402
01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:22,140
Indian encryption means that it's

1403
01:05:22,140 --> 01:05:23,940
encrypted so even the company cannot

1404
01:05:23,940 --> 01:05:25,980
access it so all right thank you

1405
01:05:25,980 --> 01:05:27,760
everybody that's my turn

1406
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:30,859

Bishop Fox

1437
01:11:18,179 --> 01:11:21,120
I love Bishop Fox a lot after this talk

1438
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:22,920
if you want to ask me questions or you

1439
01:11:22,920 --> 01:11:24,600
want to get free stickers you can meet

1440
01:11:24,600 --> 01:11:26,880
me at the bishop box table

1441
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:29,640
I'm also the CEO of circle city con my

1442
01:11:29,640 --> 01:11:32,120
CEO is actually here too he's real fun

1443
01:11:32,120 --> 01:11:34,380
if you haven't been to Circle city con

1444
01:11:34,380 --> 01:11:36,780
it's like Cactus con but in Indianapolis

1445
01:11:36,780 --> 01:11:40,739
and a little bit smaller we have corn

1446
01:11:40,739 --> 01:11:43,620
so um

1447
01:11:43,620 --> 01:11:45,840
yeah I know

1448
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:48,120
yeah so uh that that's what sets us

1449
01:11:48,120 --> 01:11:49,080
apart

1450
01:11:49,080 --> 01:11:50,880
um I'm a hacker I'm a war driver I do

1451
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:53,100
lots of things maybe you follow me

1452
01:11:53,100 --> 01:11:55,260
online maybe you don't the thing I'm

1453
01:11:55,260 --> 01:11:57,540
most proud of is my dog

1454
01:11:57,540 --> 01:12:00,179
oh right

1455
01:12:00,179 --> 01:12:03,060
speaking of babies why are smartphones

1456
01:12:03,060 --> 01:12:05,460
so personal to us I was talking to my

1457
01:12:05,460 --> 01:12:07,800
friend Brock and he had a really good

1458
01:12:07,800 --> 01:12:10,320
analogy that smartphones are like our

1459
01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:11,219
babies

1460
01:12:11,219 --> 01:12:14,100
they cry we pay attention to them we

1461
01:12:14,100 --> 01:12:16,440
have to feed them regularly if we lose

1462
01:12:16,440 --> 01:12:19,580
them we're [ __ ]

1463
01:12:19,980 --> 01:12:23,159
right so we carry them around everywhere

1464
01:12:23,159 --> 01:12:25,679
we give them all our personal thoughts

1465
01:12:25,679 --> 01:12:27,840
we Google everything we're thinking

1466
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:29,760
about so

1467
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:31,140
um it's probably one of the more

1468
01:12:31,140 --> 01:12:32,820
intimate pieces of Our Lives that we

1469
01:12:32,820 --> 01:12:34,980
carry around with us and we give it

1470
01:12:34,980 --> 01:12:36,480
everything

1471
01:12:36,480 --> 01:12:39,719
before I go further in the talk I really

1472
01:12:39,719 --> 01:12:42,060
don't want to fear Monger I don't want

1473
01:12:42,060 --> 01:12:43,320
to say like hey get rid of your

1474
01:12:43,320 --> 01:12:44,880
smartphone that's the only chance you

1475
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:46,320
have

1476
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:48,300
um you're likely not a target of what

1477
01:12:48,300 --> 01:12:50,340
I'm talking about today if you're in

1478
01:12:50,340 --> 01:12:51,840
this room you're probably a little bit

1479
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:54,659
aware and have some cyber hygiene so

1480
01:12:54,659 --> 01:12:57,659
you're probably okay not every app you

1481
01:12:57,659 --> 01:13:00,300
have is infiltrated with Pegasus

1482
01:13:00,300 --> 01:13:01,100
um

1483
01:13:01,100 --> 01:13:03,659
if you if you heard that audio clip or

1484
01:13:03,659 --> 01:13:05,420
know what I'm talking about I'm sorry

1485
01:13:05,420 --> 01:13:08,219
but I took a little screenshot of that

1486
01:13:08,219 --> 01:13:09,960
misstep there

1487
01:13:09,960 --> 01:13:12,239
but you could be that interesting

1488
01:13:12,239 --> 01:13:14,460
um and here's why your identity has

1489
01:13:14,460 --> 01:13:17,760
value last time I checked a U.S citizen

1490
01:13:17,760 --> 01:13:20,699
full confirmed social security number

1491
01:13:20,699 --> 01:13:24,300
birth date email address address was

1492
01:13:24,300 --> 01:13:26,640
worth like seven dollars one one

1493
01:13:26,640 --> 01:13:28,860
identity they're usually sold in bulk so

1494
01:13:28,860 --> 01:13:31,440
they're you know worth more but your

1495
01:13:31,440 --> 01:13:33,300
identity has value and if it doesn't

1496
01:13:33,300 --> 01:13:35,400
have value now it'll have value in the

1497
01:13:35,400 --> 01:13:37,620
future it could have value later and

1498
01:13:37,620 --> 01:13:39,420
there's other reasons to gather this

1499
01:13:39,420 --> 01:13:40,760
information

1500
01:13:40,760 --> 01:13:44,480
legitimate tracking customer experience

1501
01:13:44,480 --> 01:13:47,580
your phone takes a lot of information to

1502
01:13:47,580 --> 01:13:51,420
improve your usage and also the the apps

1503
01:13:51,420 --> 01:13:53,580
that you have honestly you could be

1504
01:13:53,580 --> 01:13:56,219
surveilled for no good reason

1505
01:13:56,219 --> 01:13:59,219
um I have a friend she's 74. her name is

1506
01:13:59,219 --> 01:14:01,340
Jackie and Jackie has a smartphone

1507
01:14:01,340 --> 01:14:04,440
Jackie should not

1508
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:06,600
I but I love texting her so I can't help

1509
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:07,440
it

1510
01:14:07,440 --> 01:14:09,380
um but she gets these these like

1511
01:14:09,380 --> 01:14:12,780
solitaire games right and they have ads

1512
01:14:12,780 --> 01:14:14,219
in them and we'll talk about that in a

1513
01:14:14,219 --> 01:14:16,260
second but she's downloading app after

1514
01:14:16,260 --> 01:14:18,420
app after app and it's all just spyware

1515
01:14:18,420 --> 01:14:20,820
but Jackie's 74 year old identity

1516
01:14:20,820 --> 01:14:23,159
probably isn't worth that much

1517
01:14:23,159 --> 01:14:25,020
what does surveillance look like on your

1518
01:14:25,020 --> 01:14:26,820
phone these are the things that are

1519
01:14:26,820 --> 01:14:29,100
being taken right

1520
01:14:29,100 --> 01:14:30,540
um the ones that are the most sensitive

1521
01:14:30,540 --> 01:14:33,600
are probably your location your browsing

1522
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:36,719
history and accessibility features

1523
01:14:36,719 --> 01:14:37,860
um accessibility features are really

1524
01:14:37,860 --> 01:14:40,560
powerful they can draw over apps they

1525
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:42,659
can input text they can see everything

1526
01:14:42,659 --> 01:14:44,280
that you're doing

1527
01:14:44,280 --> 01:14:46,260
um your your password manager likely has

1528
01:14:46,260 --> 01:14:47,880
you turn accessibility features on so

1529
01:14:47,880 --> 01:14:50,699
that it can work right but we can see

1530
01:14:50,699 --> 01:14:53,820
everything your screen your texts

1531
01:14:53,820 --> 01:14:56,520
and your keystrokes if if that is of

1532
01:14:56,520 --> 01:14:58,260
Interest

1533
01:14:58,260 --> 01:15:00,179
we have a lot of things to talk about

1534
01:15:00,179 --> 01:15:02,340
and I don't have time to talk about them

1535
01:15:02,340 --> 01:15:05,159
this is a 20 minute 25 minute talk right

1536
01:15:05,159 --> 01:15:06,239
um so here's what's out of scope for

1537
01:15:06,239 --> 01:15:08,100
today but I would be remiss to not talk

1538
01:15:08,100 --> 01:15:10,320
about them at all so the first one are

1539
01:15:10,320 --> 01:15:12,659
stingrays if you've ever been to Defcon

1540
01:15:12,659 --> 01:15:14,820
you're like why is my service so slow

1541
01:15:14,820 --> 01:15:17,460
it's because there's 34 new stingrays in

1542
01:15:17,460 --> 01:15:19,020
your area

1543
01:15:19,020 --> 01:15:20,280
um these this is a man in the middle

1544
01:15:20,280 --> 01:15:23,219
style attack between your phone and its

1545
01:15:23,219 --> 01:15:25,679
actual Cellular Connection

1546
01:15:25,679 --> 01:15:27,900
um and the easiest way to detect it

1547
01:15:27,900 --> 01:15:30,900
is not that easy on Android there is a

1548
01:15:30,900 --> 01:15:32,699
solution but it requires you rooting

1549
01:15:32,699 --> 01:15:35,040
your phone and I don't really recommend

1550
01:15:35,040 --> 01:15:37,679
that that's an Alyssa opinion right you

1551
01:15:37,679 --> 01:15:39,300
can ask me all about my opinions later

1552
01:15:39,300 --> 01:15:41,880
my other hot opinion is telling people

1553
01:15:41,880 --> 01:15:44,580
to use signal use Tor is overrated now

1554
01:15:44,580 --> 01:15:47,100
my mom uses signal okay everyone should

1555
01:15:47,100 --> 01:15:49,440
I'm really really passionate about that

1556
01:15:49,440 --> 01:15:51,060
one but using Tor for your everyday

1557
01:15:51,060 --> 01:15:52,739
browsing

1558
01:15:52,739 --> 01:15:55,980
like who watches Netflix over tour

1559
01:15:55,980 --> 01:15:58,320
right no one so it's not really

1560
01:15:58,320 --> 01:16:00,360
practical

1561
01:16:00,360 --> 01:16:01,620
um so there's a couple other options

1562
01:16:01,620 --> 01:16:03,540
that I'll go over later

1563
01:16:03,540 --> 01:16:06,179
we have Wi-Fi Bluetooth and airdrop

1564
01:16:06,179 --> 01:16:08,760
um a Norton researcher said yeah you can

1565
01:16:08,760 --> 01:16:10,920
get malware over airdrop this talk is

1566
01:16:10,920 --> 01:16:13,199
focusing on Android so I'm not going to

1567
01:16:13,199 --> 01:16:15,600
go into airdrop but my favorite would be

1568
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:17,580
Wi-Fi honeypots and Rogue access points

1569
01:16:17,580 --> 01:16:19,620
again this is an Amanda middle style

1570
01:16:19,620 --> 01:16:22,260
attack my easiest recommendation is

1571
01:16:22,260 --> 01:16:24,360
using a VPN and I'm not talking about

1572
01:16:24,360 --> 01:16:26,460
your YouTuber approved four dollar a

1573
01:16:26,460 --> 01:16:28,040
month VPN

1574
01:16:28,040 --> 01:16:30,480
you're being tracked there too so it's

1575
01:16:30,480 --> 01:16:32,820
not really worth it take the time look

1576
01:16:32,820 --> 01:16:35,040
into your VPN provider you want a zero

1577
01:16:35,040 --> 01:16:38,159
knowledge no logging provider right

1578
01:16:38,159 --> 01:16:39,860
um there's that and for Bluetooth

1579
01:16:39,860 --> 01:16:43,380
Bluetooth tracking it is possible

1580
01:16:43,380 --> 01:16:45,480
um if you've ever been on Wiggles map

1581
01:16:45,480 --> 01:16:49,080
you can see a MAC address over time how

1582
01:16:49,080 --> 01:16:50,880
do you solve that randomizing your Mac

1583
01:16:50,880 --> 01:16:53,520
address your device might not do that

1584
01:16:53,520 --> 01:16:57,239
automatically many do but might not

1585
01:16:57,239 --> 01:16:58,620
um so you really want to be aware of

1586
01:16:58,620 --> 01:16:59,760
that

1587
01:16:59,760 --> 01:17:01,440
and then the last one the one that's

1588
01:17:01,440 --> 01:17:05,040
scariest to me is your Tower dumps or

1589
01:17:05,040 --> 01:17:06,719
information directly from your mobile

1590
01:17:06,719 --> 01:17:10,580
provider if you're using Verizon

1591
01:17:10,580 --> 01:17:13,140
I was

1592
01:17:13,140 --> 01:17:14,940
um there is an experience that you have

1593
01:17:14,940 --> 01:17:17,820
to opt out of it is not opt-in and it

1594
01:17:17,820 --> 01:17:19,320
gathers your browsing history and

1595
01:17:19,320 --> 01:17:21,960
location for 90 days for experience

1596
01:17:21,960 --> 01:17:23,360
purposes

1597
01:17:23,360 --> 01:17:25,679
everything that you that you Google

1598
01:17:25,679 --> 01:17:28,860
everything that you visit the in-app

1599
01:17:28,860 --> 01:17:31,199
browsers of apps right they're all going

1600
01:17:31,199 --> 01:17:33,780
to Verizon so please be careful of that

1601
01:17:33,780 --> 01:17:35,820
Tower dumps are accessible without a

1602
01:17:35,820 --> 01:17:37,920
warrant typically they are accessed with

1603
01:17:37,920 --> 01:17:40,260
a court order which has a lower level of

1604
01:17:40,260 --> 01:17:42,960
Entry right lower lower necessity so

1605
01:17:42,960 --> 01:17:45,120
they are easy to get and your mobile

1606
01:17:45,120 --> 01:17:46,980
provider may have a third-party

1607
01:17:46,980 --> 01:17:49,020
relationship with another organization

1608
01:17:49,020 --> 01:17:51,239
to provide these dumps

1609
01:17:51,239 --> 01:17:53,640
so what are we going to talk about I

1610
01:17:53,640 --> 01:17:54,900
know I just spent like five minutes

1611
01:17:54,900 --> 01:17:56,820
talking about all that when I said I'm

1612
01:17:56,820 --> 01:17:58,380
not going to talk about it

1613
01:17:58,380 --> 01:18:00,719
but we're focusing on mobile apps and

1614
01:18:00,719 --> 01:18:02,820
here's why because they're the most

1615
01:18:02,820 --> 01:18:04,140
likely

1616
01:18:04,140 --> 01:18:07,020
source of how you'd be spied on

1617
01:18:07,020 --> 01:18:08,699
um I don't think stingrays are very

1618
01:18:08,699 --> 01:18:11,040
likely again maybe if you're at Defcon

1619
01:18:11,040 --> 01:18:13,739
ask me about your opinions on Defcon

1620
01:18:13,739 --> 01:18:15,659
later come to the booth

1621
01:18:15,659 --> 01:18:18,659
um but here's an example of two box at

1622
01:18:18,659 --> 01:18:20,280
the time it was taken down it had two

1623
01:18:20,280 --> 01:18:22,440
million downloads

1624
01:18:22,440 --> 01:18:24,420
um and it was just supposed to it was a

1625
01:18:24,420 --> 01:18:26,820
legitimate app on the app store which

1626
01:18:26,820 --> 01:18:28,320
contained malware

1627
01:18:28,320 --> 01:18:30,600
here's another example think about it

1628
01:18:30,600 --> 01:18:32,100
like Bluetooth sucks right like it's

1629
01:18:32,100 --> 01:18:34,560
really difficult sometimes well we might

1630
01:18:34,560 --> 01:18:36,060
go into the Google Play Store and say

1631
01:18:36,060 --> 01:18:38,400
like hey Bluetooth connect right and

1632
01:18:38,400 --> 01:18:40,140
this app would pop up

1633
01:18:40,140 --> 01:18:43,739
it's popular and on its first release it

1634
01:18:43,739 --> 01:18:45,719
was squeaky clean you know like a

1635
01:18:45,719 --> 01:18:49,080
regular app but here is as updates go on

1636
01:18:49,080 --> 01:18:51,480
there's actually a Trojan type of hidden

1637
01:18:51,480 --> 01:18:55,140
ad malware that is present on the app

1638
01:18:55,140 --> 01:18:56,580
um at the time it was taken down the

1639
01:18:56,580 --> 01:18:59,940
last time I recorded it was in October

1640
01:18:59,940 --> 01:19:02,100
um and it did still have malware on it

1641
01:19:02,100 --> 01:19:03,540
it's been taken down and off the Google

1642
01:19:03,540 --> 01:19:05,400
Play store so you won't find it now but

1643
01:19:05,400 --> 01:19:07,199
you can still find other bloggers who

1644
01:19:07,199 --> 01:19:08,580
have talked about this and have taken

1645
01:19:08,580 --> 01:19:10,440
screenshots

1646
01:19:10,440 --> 01:19:12,960
so yeah malware Google Play Store very

1647
01:19:12,960 --> 01:19:15,420
cool I'm going to recap super quick

1648
01:19:15,420 --> 01:19:16,860
these are the things that they're

1649
01:19:16,860 --> 01:19:18,540
looking for here on the left this is

1650
01:19:18,540 --> 01:19:20,040
what surveillance information is being

1651
01:19:20,040 --> 01:19:21,960
taken from your phone

1652
01:19:21,960 --> 01:19:23,699
and here's how they get it

1653
01:19:23,699 --> 01:19:25,440
now

1654
01:19:25,440 --> 01:19:27,120
um I really think the best way to think

1655
01:19:27,120 --> 01:19:28,620
of something defensively is to take it

1656
01:19:28,620 --> 01:19:31,320
offensively first right offensive

1657
01:19:31,320 --> 01:19:34,380
security can help us so instead of

1658
01:19:34,380 --> 01:19:36,000
talking about what to look for in your

1659
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:39,120
applications let's build one let's be

1660
01:19:39,120 --> 01:19:41,280
the ones revealing other people

1661
01:19:41,280 --> 01:19:43,080
so we're going to make an app it's

1662
01:19:43,080 --> 01:19:45,420
called gilby's Health app and it's going

1663
01:19:45,420 --> 01:19:47,580
to look exactly like Google Fit okay

1664
01:19:47,580 --> 01:19:49,320
it's a health app so it's going to track

1665
01:19:49,320 --> 01:19:52,920
your runs your calories whatever I

1666
01:19:52,920 --> 01:19:54,540
picked this because it requires a lot of

1667
01:19:54,540 --> 01:19:56,640
permissions right

1668
01:19:56,640 --> 01:19:58,199
we're going to make these permissions

1669
01:19:58,199 --> 01:20:00,120
make sense

1670
01:20:00,120 --> 01:20:02,880
they'll have to in order to bypass our

1671
01:20:02,880 --> 01:20:05,040
Google Play protect and get onto our app

1672
01:20:05,040 --> 01:20:07,020
store and we needed to go to the App

1673
01:20:07,020 --> 01:20:08,880
Store because anyone who's Savvy enough

1674
01:20:08,880 --> 01:20:12,480
to sideload apks and like do all of that

1675
01:20:12,480 --> 01:20:14,460
probably isn't going to fall for your

1676
01:20:14,460 --> 01:20:16,440
spyware however those are infected with

1677
01:20:16,440 --> 01:20:18,000
adware so

1678
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:19,320
be careful

1679
01:20:19,320 --> 01:20:20,580
okay

1680
01:20:20,580 --> 01:20:24,179
so if you trust me there's a QR code if

1681
01:20:24,179 --> 01:20:25,980
you trust me less

1682
01:20:25,980 --> 01:20:28,440
if you trust me less there is

1683
01:20:28,440 --> 01:20:29,820
um these

1684
01:20:29,820 --> 01:20:32,460
right there is the the tiny URL up there

1685
01:20:32,460 --> 01:20:35,400
and if you don't trust that Google it

1686
01:20:35,400 --> 01:20:36,960
there are two types of permissions that

1687
01:20:36,960 --> 01:20:39,120
we I want to talk about one is install

1688
01:20:39,120 --> 01:20:42,659
time permissions which is the graphic in

1689
01:20:42,659 --> 01:20:43,500
the middle

1690
01:20:43,500 --> 01:20:45,060
so when you download an app for the

1691
01:20:45,060 --> 01:20:47,520
Google Play Store

1692
01:20:47,520 --> 01:20:49,140
that these are the ones that you agreed

1693
01:20:49,140 --> 01:20:50,880
to and we'll talk about those

1694
01:20:50,880 --> 01:20:52,800
the ones that have pop-ups the ones

1695
01:20:52,800 --> 01:20:54,540
you're familiar with when they ask you

1696
01:20:54,540 --> 01:20:56,340
hey can I use your camera those are

1697
01:20:56,340 --> 01:20:58,500
called runtime permissions they're also

1698
01:20:58,500 --> 01:21:01,199
known as dangerous permissions and

1699
01:21:01,199 --> 01:21:03,199
there's a good reason why

1700
01:21:03,199 --> 01:21:05,400
real quick

1701
01:21:05,400 --> 01:21:07,860
um for the the middle one

1702
01:21:07,860 --> 01:21:09,540
um we need to be really sensitive about

1703
01:21:09,540 --> 01:21:11,580
these permissions because requesting

1704
01:21:11,580 --> 01:21:13,500
them is really suspicious so we'll get

1705
01:21:13,500 --> 01:21:15,600
to that and you might be wondering hey

1706
01:21:15,600 --> 01:21:18,300
why Android if you're at my thoughtcon

1707
01:21:18,300 --> 01:21:20,940
talk I picked on iOS so I've been there

1708
01:21:20,940 --> 01:21:22,920
and I'm sure next mobile talk I'll pick

1709
01:21:22,920 --> 01:21:26,159
on iOS again you are not immune at all

1710
01:21:26,159 --> 01:21:28,080
these things apply to you in a different

1711
01:21:28,080 --> 01:21:31,020
way especially the types of attacks that

1712
01:21:31,020 --> 01:21:32,460
I mentioned earlier that were out of

1713
01:21:32,460 --> 01:21:34,800
scope so like you're still being

1714
01:21:34,800 --> 01:21:37,699
surveilled I'm sorry

1715
01:21:38,100 --> 01:21:40,620
okay so those install time permissions

1716
01:21:40,620 --> 01:21:43,440
here's what you should not gather okay

1717
01:21:43,440 --> 01:21:45,840
if you gather this information at this

1718
01:21:45,840 --> 01:21:48,360
time Google will flag it as suspicious

1719
01:21:48,360 --> 01:21:49,739
enough spyware

1720
01:21:49,739 --> 01:21:51,420
so we're going to be really picky with

1721
01:21:51,420 --> 01:21:53,820
our install time permissions

1722
01:21:53,820 --> 01:21:55,560
um your spyware is going to check some

1723
01:21:55,560 --> 01:21:57,000
of these boxes

1724
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,219
but not all of them

1725
01:21:59,219 --> 01:22:01,679
on the right is a picture and I know you

1726
01:22:01,679 --> 01:22:03,480
might not be able to see it

1727
01:22:03,480 --> 01:22:05,880
is a screenshot of what Google is going

1728
01:22:05,880 --> 01:22:07,620
to consider spyware if you have it in

1729
01:22:07,620 --> 01:22:08,820
your app when you upload it to Google

1730
01:22:08,820 --> 01:22:09,900
Play

1731
01:22:09,900 --> 01:22:12,239
on the left we have Google fits

1732
01:22:12,239 --> 01:22:14,718
permissions

1733
01:22:14,940 --> 01:22:17,699
contact list is suspicious it might be

1734
01:22:17,699 --> 01:22:20,159
considered spyware but Google Fit uses

1735
01:22:20,159 --> 01:22:21,960
that permission it's because the

1736
01:22:21,960 --> 01:22:25,199
permission makes sense in Google Fit you

1737
01:22:25,199 --> 01:22:27,239
can connect with others I think you can

1738
01:22:27,239 --> 01:22:29,520
refer people to the app it's a way to

1739
01:22:29,520 --> 01:22:31,260
connect over text right

1740
01:22:31,260 --> 01:22:33,960
so because Google Fit has legitimate use

1741
01:22:33,960 --> 01:22:35,659
even though it was considered spyware

1742
01:22:35,659 --> 01:22:38,340
it's okay to have in the app so that's

1743
01:22:38,340 --> 01:22:39,780
what we're going to do when we build our

1744
01:22:39,780 --> 01:22:40,500
app

1745
01:22:40,500 --> 01:22:42,600
so we're going to go back gilby's Health

1746
01:22:42,600 --> 01:22:45,120
app okay on the left is what we're going

1747
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:46,980
to gather and on the right is the

1748
01:22:46,980 --> 01:22:48,420
information that we're going to get from

1749
01:22:48,420 --> 01:22:50,940
Gathering that permission so sure

1750
01:22:50,940 --> 01:22:53,460
calories and exercise are nice that's

1751
01:22:53,460 --> 01:22:54,719
what we'll need to make the app look

1752
01:22:54,719 --> 01:22:56,580
legitimate

1753
01:22:56,580 --> 01:23:00,600
um but we need like our exercise info so

1754
01:23:00,600 --> 01:23:03,719
GPS data to count our steps and our

1755
01:23:03,719 --> 01:23:07,620
logar runs I used to have an app that

1756
01:23:07,620 --> 01:23:10,800
could um track my longboarding exercises

1757
01:23:10,800 --> 01:23:12,780
and it would like be able to go down to

1758
01:23:12,780 --> 01:23:17,699
like 100 feet right on Snapchat 10 feet

1759
01:23:17,699 --> 01:23:20,460
um if you're on Snap Maps don't be

1760
01:23:20,460 --> 01:23:21,420
um

1761
01:23:21,420 --> 01:23:23,340
it'll tell you like your fine location

1762
01:23:23,340 --> 01:23:25,739
in a building which I thought was really

1763
01:23:25,739 --> 01:23:28,199
fascinating like the room that you're in

1764
01:23:28,199 --> 01:23:30,000
or will show up with fine location data

1765
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:31,800
so we want to be really careful about

1766
01:23:31,800 --> 01:23:34,320
that we'll need to scan barcodes which

1767
01:23:34,320 --> 01:23:36,840
gives us access to the phone now in

1768
01:23:36,840 --> 01:23:40,020
Android that camera access is not

1769
01:23:40,020 --> 01:23:41,280
um

1770
01:23:41,280 --> 01:23:43,140
like the whole time I'm looking for the

1771
01:23:43,140 --> 01:23:44,699
word persistent

1772
01:23:44,699 --> 01:23:47,100
that's not persistent so when the app is

1773
01:23:47,100 --> 01:23:48,300
closed we're not going to have that

1774
01:23:48,300 --> 01:23:50,460
camera access but we can have it while

1775
01:23:50,460 --> 01:23:52,260
the app is open

1776
01:23:52,260 --> 01:23:54,480
crash reporting and referral links are

1777
01:23:54,480 --> 01:23:56,100
also used

1778
01:23:56,100 --> 01:23:57,960
crash reporting can give us a lot about

1779
01:23:57,960 --> 01:24:01,140
the app the phone itself what other apps

1780
01:24:01,140 --> 01:24:02,699
were open at the time

1781
01:24:02,699 --> 01:24:05,480
different stuff

1782
01:24:06,360 --> 01:24:09,120
here are do Nots if we want our spyware

1783
01:24:09,120 --> 01:24:11,340
to get onto the Google Play Store and

1784
01:24:11,340 --> 01:24:13,679
make it work we have to avoid these

1785
01:24:13,679 --> 01:24:16,980
things so if you're brave enough to spy

1786
01:24:16,980 --> 01:24:19,440
on someone and make money off of

1787
01:24:19,440 --> 01:24:22,800
advertising good for you but it's not

1788
01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:25,260
going to work here the apps go under

1789
01:24:25,260 --> 01:24:28,520
much more scrutiny when there is

1790
01:24:28,520 --> 01:24:31,560
Apple ads or a way to make money or

1791
01:24:31,560 --> 01:24:33,120
in-app purchases

1792
01:24:33,120 --> 01:24:35,219
we can gather text information but this

1793
01:24:35,219 --> 01:24:38,699
one's kind of tricky right the SMS log

1794
01:24:38,699 --> 01:24:40,679
is not the same as giving an SMS

1795
01:24:40,679 --> 01:24:43,440
permission that can um

1796
01:24:43,440 --> 01:24:46,500
that can actually take the the content

1797
01:24:46,500 --> 01:24:48,480
of a text when you share information

1798
01:24:48,480 --> 01:24:51,300
over SMS it's typically like a copy to

1799
01:24:51,300 --> 01:24:53,940
the clipboard and an insert into app but

1800
01:24:53,940 --> 01:24:56,219
we can also get access to the SMS log

1801
01:24:56,219 --> 01:24:59,159
which will give us our texts so you want

1802
01:24:59,159 --> 01:25:01,800
to be really really careful with that

1803
01:25:01,800 --> 01:25:03,300
um I don't think it's worth it in making

1804
01:25:03,300 --> 01:25:05,040
our spyware app but we can still have it

1805
01:25:05,040 --> 01:25:06,060
present

1806
01:25:06,060 --> 01:25:09,540
no back doors no remote code execution I

1807
01:25:09,540 --> 01:25:11,100
know that's really fun and it seems like

1808
01:25:11,100 --> 01:25:12,420
a good thing to do in your spyware app

1809
01:25:12,420 --> 01:25:13,739
but it's not going to make it on the

1810
01:25:13,739 --> 01:25:15,480
Google Play Store

1811
01:25:15,480 --> 01:25:16,920
so we need to use some social

1812
01:25:16,920 --> 01:25:18,179
engineering to get people to download

1813
01:25:18,179 --> 01:25:20,460
our app right now this is how it affects

1814
01:25:20,460 --> 01:25:21,960
you think about this this is how

1815
01:25:21,960 --> 01:25:23,640
someone's going to get the app on your

1816
01:25:23,640 --> 01:25:25,500
phone right

1817
01:25:25,500 --> 01:25:27,719
um malvertising is how Jackie got all of

1818
01:25:27,719 --> 01:25:31,560
her apps right she had an ad for a

1819
01:25:31,560 --> 01:25:33,600
cleaner she's like oh I want my battery

1820
01:25:33,600 --> 01:25:36,120
to run I have too much storage space I

1821
01:25:36,120 --> 01:25:37,080
need to

1822
01:25:37,080 --> 01:25:40,260
fill it up with useless apps

1823
01:25:40,260 --> 01:25:42,540
so these apps are supposed to help the

1824
01:25:42,540 --> 01:25:44,340
phone experience but are actually

1825
01:25:44,340 --> 01:25:47,460
spyware and adware and don't and they're

1826
01:25:47,460 --> 01:25:49,679
not easy to uninstall either so those

1827
01:25:49,679 --> 01:25:52,260
came from malvertising right

1828
01:25:52,260 --> 01:25:53,940
it's a good way to get it

1829
01:25:53,940 --> 01:25:55,739
I would just use social engineering or

1830
01:25:55,739 --> 01:25:57,179
spear phishing to get it on someone's

1831
01:25:57,179 --> 01:25:59,280
app I'd be like hey you'll get ten

1832
01:25:59,280 --> 01:26:00,840
dollars we'll both get ten dollars if

1833
01:26:00,840 --> 01:26:03,300
you install the app right

1834
01:26:03,300 --> 01:26:05,340
that one works

1835
01:26:05,340 --> 01:26:07,620
and to get the app we need to legitimize

1836
01:26:07,620 --> 01:26:09,900
those permissions we need to make sure

1837
01:26:09,900 --> 01:26:12,719
that the behaviors do have a related

1838
01:26:12,719 --> 01:26:13,860
function

1839
01:26:13,860 --> 01:26:16,500
and it's really suspicious if an app has

1840
01:26:16,500 --> 01:26:18,719
very few downloads so we're going to go

1841
01:26:18,719 --> 01:26:21,179
ahead and make it beta so that excuse

1842
01:26:21,179 --> 01:26:23,840
makes sense

1843
01:26:24,060 --> 01:26:26,219
and yeah so we're going to use that

1844
01:26:26,219 --> 01:26:28,980
spyware type app it is the easiest we

1845
01:26:28,980 --> 01:26:30,780
don't have time to talk about Pegasus or

1846
01:26:30,780 --> 01:26:33,420
government surveillance however these

1847
01:26:33,420 --> 01:26:35,760
tactics are used

1848
01:26:35,760 --> 01:26:39,120
um I again would be careful about what

1849
01:26:39,120 --> 01:26:40,739
um what networks you're connecting to

1850
01:26:40,739 --> 01:26:43,620
here's my tips for helping with that be

1851
01:26:43,620 --> 01:26:45,840
careful of what you download

1852
01:26:45,840 --> 01:26:47,880
use a VPN to make sure it's a good one

1853
01:26:47,880 --> 01:26:50,520
right I will say right now all these

1854
01:26:50,520 --> 01:26:53,100
recommendations I have up on the slide I

1855
01:26:53,100 --> 01:26:54,960
may or may not be doing

1856
01:26:54,960 --> 01:26:57,960
right and the reason why I'm not and and

1857
01:26:57,960 --> 01:26:59,400
something I really wanted to kind of

1858
01:26:59,400 --> 01:27:00,239
point out when I was talking about

1859
01:27:00,239 --> 01:27:02,520
fear-mongering earlier your threat

1860
01:27:02,520 --> 01:27:05,280
Matrix varies right

1861
01:27:05,280 --> 01:27:07,980
um I'm I know Verizon has all my data

1862
01:27:07,980 --> 01:27:09,659
already I'm

1863
01:27:09,659 --> 01:27:11,340
you're lost if you if you're a Verizon

1864
01:27:11,340 --> 01:27:13,560
customer in the in the crowd you're lost

1865
01:27:13,560 --> 01:27:14,760
already okay

1866
01:27:14,760 --> 01:27:17,760
but um my threat Matrix says like yeah I

1867
01:27:17,760 --> 01:27:20,280
know I might be surveilled by a certain

1868
01:27:20,280 --> 01:27:22,860
party and I've accepted it so I don't

1869
01:27:22,860 --> 01:27:24,900
have a VPN on all the time I use

1870
01:27:24,900 --> 01:27:26,460
Snapchat

1871
01:27:26,460 --> 01:27:28,800
um don't be like me don't know better

1872
01:27:28,800 --> 01:27:31,620
and do it anyway be better than that

1873
01:27:31,620 --> 01:27:33,480
take my recommendations be skeptical of

1874
01:27:33,480 --> 01:27:35,400
what you download randomize your Mac

1875
01:27:35,400 --> 01:27:37,679
address be careful if you have a Tracker

1876
01:27:37,679 --> 01:27:40,080
like an air tag or a tile that doesn't

1877
01:27:40,080 --> 01:27:42,480
rotate its Mac address right if you're

1878
01:27:42,480 --> 01:27:44,400
curious if that proof of concept works

1879
01:27:44,400 --> 01:27:46,739
or not ask me for my wiggle screenshots

1880
01:27:46,739 --> 01:27:50,400
okay use signal maybe use Tor I think

1881
01:27:50,400 --> 01:27:52,980
they use tour is overrated so protect

1882
01:27:52,980 --> 01:27:54,120
your texts

1883
01:27:54,120 --> 01:27:56,820
and just overall be suspicious don't

1884
01:27:56,820 --> 01:27:58,679
take your real phone to Defcon or do I

1885
01:27:58,679 --> 01:28:00,300
don't care I do it

1886
01:28:00,300 --> 01:28:02,400
so

1887
01:28:02,400 --> 01:28:04,260
so that's how it is

1888
01:28:04,260 --> 01:28:06,239
um I have I'm sure there are some

1889
01:28:06,239 --> 01:28:07,980
questions like I said I'll be at the

1890
01:28:07,980 --> 01:28:09,360
bishop box Booth if you want to talk

1891
01:28:09,360 --> 01:28:10,800
about it

1892
01:28:10,800 --> 01:28:12,120
um and if you want to see my next talk

1893
01:28:12,120 --> 01:28:15,540
I'll be at Falcon later this year so

1894
01:28:15,540 --> 01:28:17,600
thanks

1895
01:28:24,360 --> 01:28:26,159
you have time for questions right now

1896
01:28:26,159 --> 01:28:27,600
last week

1897
01:28:27,600 --> 01:28:30,560
let's go get some water

1898
01:28:33,480 --> 01:28:37,280
I should have made this a 15 minute talk

1899
01:28:37,800 --> 01:28:40,199
um so you mentioned uh the uh Verizon

1900
01:28:40,199 --> 01:28:42,480
doing the tracking thing uh

1901
01:28:42,480 --> 01:28:45,120
yeah asking for a friend how do you uh

1902
01:28:45,120 --> 01:28:46,980
disable that

1903
01:28:46,980 --> 01:28:48,840
yeah yeah sure it's actually they don't

1904
01:28:48,840 --> 01:28:51,179
make it that difficult go into your

1905
01:28:51,179 --> 01:28:53,159
account in Verizon and then there's

1906
01:28:53,159 --> 01:28:55,199
settings and there's manage customer

1907
01:28:55,199 --> 01:28:57,900
experience and it's like under that area

1908
01:28:57,900 --> 01:29:00,960
okay yeah if you need help because I did

1909
01:29:00,960 --> 01:29:03,000
when I did it they have a little chat

1910
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:05,460
box just put in like opt out of customer

1911
01:29:05,460 --> 01:29:09,540
customer experience and uh you'll get it

1912
01:29:09,540 --> 01:29:13,280
out all right sweet thank you yeah

1913
01:29:14,219 --> 01:29:17,340
foreign nice

1914
01:29:17,340 --> 01:29:21,239
how's it going so you said Verizon does

1915
01:29:21,239 --> 01:29:24,060
the Data Tracking how are you sure that

1916
01:29:24,060 --> 01:29:26,520
others other telecoms don't do the same

1917
01:29:26,520 --> 01:29:29,120
thing oh I'm

1918
01:29:30,980 --> 01:29:34,089
[Music]

1919
01:29:36,060 --> 01:29:38,040
T-Mobile

1920
01:29:38,040 --> 01:29:39,659
um

1921
01:29:39,659 --> 01:29:41,880
vision

1922
01:29:41,880 --> 01:29:45,239
oh visible to Spectrum visible yeah they

1923
01:29:45,239 --> 01:29:48,300
use they use Verizon so they those are

1924
01:29:48,300 --> 01:29:51,000
just as susceptible and then a t

1925
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:52,980
I I looked into Verizon because I was

1926
01:29:52,980 --> 01:29:54,719
the one affected by that but I think at

1927
01:29:54,719 --> 01:29:57,600
T similarly is a problem so so in a way

1928
01:29:57,600 --> 01:29:59,520
it's just unavoidable yeah look at the

1929
01:29:59,520 --> 01:30:00,960
terms of service and that's really

1930
01:30:00,960 --> 01:30:03,179
difficult when I say like look into your

1931
01:30:03,179 --> 01:30:05,699
mobile phone carrier that's really

1932
01:30:05,699 --> 01:30:07,139
difficult there are some websites

1933
01:30:07,139 --> 01:30:08,580
that'll distill down that information

1934
01:30:08,580 --> 01:30:10,320
for you

1935
01:30:10,320 --> 01:30:13,080
um but it again yes look into them just

1936
01:30:13,080 --> 01:30:15,000
accept that it might be buried under

1937
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:16,860
terms of service lots of paper and not

1938
01:30:16,860 --> 01:30:18,120
easy to find

1939
01:30:18,120 --> 01:30:20,659
so

1940
01:30:23,159 --> 01:30:26,159
oh

1941
01:30:28,739 --> 01:30:31,500
oh no worries that was a great shot any

1942
01:30:31,500 --> 01:30:33,300
any suggestions on navigating the

1943
01:30:33,300 --> 01:30:35,159
internet with your VPN on number year

1944
01:30:35,159 --> 01:30:37,080
and a half ago I could basically do that

1945
01:30:37,080 --> 01:30:38,639
nobody noticed I'm finding more and more

1946
01:30:38,639 --> 01:30:40,500
no matter who I use they're detecting

1947
01:30:40,500 --> 01:30:42,840
I'm on a VPN and I can't get anywhere

1948
01:30:42,840 --> 01:30:44,280
when you say you can't get anywhere what

1949
01:30:44,280 --> 01:30:47,400
do you like right away say oops this

1950
01:30:47,400 --> 01:30:49,679
you're not allowed or we know you're on

1951
01:30:49,679 --> 01:30:53,100
a VPN turn that off right right

1952
01:30:53,100 --> 01:30:55,560
um that's why it's kind of like I don't

1953
01:30:55,560 --> 01:30:58,080
on a daily basis again put that in your

1954
01:30:58,080 --> 01:30:59,699
thought Matrix is it worth giving up

1955
01:30:59,699 --> 01:31:02,699
that service to have your VPN on

1956
01:31:02,699 --> 01:31:04,560
um there's not a really good way Mobley

1957
01:31:04,560 --> 01:31:06,239
to have a VPN that isn't going to be

1958
01:31:06,239 --> 01:31:07,620
detected in that way

1959
01:31:07,620 --> 01:31:09,900
when you have like an actual desktop or

1960
01:31:09,900 --> 01:31:10,920
something like that there are other

1961
01:31:10,920 --> 01:31:13,219
Alternatives but on your mobile phone

1962
01:31:13,219 --> 01:31:16,739
not likely so determine what's important

1963
01:31:16,739 --> 01:31:18,420
I'll come find you at the booths on

1964
01:31:18,420 --> 01:31:21,560
those Alternatives yeah

1965
01:31:24,600 --> 01:31:26,460
don't have a question was just going to

1966
01:31:26,460 --> 01:31:28,139
make a comment and went to the Verizon

1967
01:31:28,139 --> 01:31:30,420
app try to do the customer experience

1968
01:31:30,420 --> 01:31:32,460
yeah and it was funny because it asked

1969
01:31:32,460 --> 01:31:36,080
me for permissions to my microphone

1970
01:31:37,800 --> 01:31:40,800
why

1971
01:31:41,219 --> 01:31:42,600
I'm not sure that's not a legit

1972
01:31:42,600 --> 01:31:44,960
permission

1973
01:31:46,080 --> 01:31:48,300
speaking of that um I do this at gercon

1974
01:31:48,300 --> 01:31:50,100
all the time but does anyone have their

1975
01:31:50,100 --> 01:31:54,000
Bluetooth on still at a hackercon

1976
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:55,560
yep did you say yeah I'm trying to see

1977
01:31:55,560 --> 01:31:58,639
if anyone's names come up

1978
01:31:59,460 --> 01:32:02,760
okay yeah we you guys do have a good

1979
01:32:02,760 --> 01:32:04,980
luck on some of you most oh and I oh

1980
01:32:04,980 --> 01:32:06,480
okay you have a smart watch that makes

1981
01:32:06,480 --> 01:32:09,300
sense I guess whoever is Galaxy S4 is

1982
01:32:09,300 --> 01:32:12,179
broadcasting good for you

1983
01:32:12,179 --> 01:32:16,320
so um so uh so so a couple questions uh

1984
01:32:16,320 --> 01:32:18,420
one which is yeah

1985
01:32:18,420 --> 01:32:21,300
um so I've noticed on certain dating app

1986
01:32:21,300 --> 01:32:23,639
uh that sometimes there will be ads

1987
01:32:23,639 --> 01:32:25,380
because it's free and so they have ads

1988
01:32:25,380 --> 01:32:27,600
and so you're trying to click out of the

1989
01:32:27,600 --> 01:32:30,239
ad that has this game or some silly app

1990
01:32:30,239 --> 01:32:31,199
that they're trying to get you to

1991
01:32:31,199 --> 01:32:32,940
download and then oh no you didn't click

1992
01:32:32,940 --> 01:32:34,500
on the X completely and then it

1993
01:32:34,500 --> 01:32:36,480
instantly starts downloading Oh Yeah

1994
01:32:36,480 --> 01:32:38,460
from something and sometimes that

1995
01:32:38,460 --> 01:32:39,840
happens and sometimes it doesn't

1996
01:32:39,840 --> 01:32:41,460
sometimes it takes you to the Google

1997
01:32:41,460 --> 01:32:43,739
Play and I'm wondering if you're that

1998
01:32:43,739 --> 01:32:46,199
malicious person or not but like is

1999
01:32:46,199 --> 01:32:48,000
there are malicious actors actually

2000
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,699
putting fake reviews on their Google

2001
01:32:50,699 --> 01:32:52,260
Play stores so that you can't really

2002
01:32:52,260 --> 01:32:54,199
tell if this is a reputable app anyway

2003
01:32:54,199 --> 01:32:56,400
absolutely and there are Bots that

2004
01:32:56,400 --> 01:32:58,679
download the app so that that for that

2005
01:32:58,679 --> 01:33:00,900
download come up and what you described

2006
01:33:00,900 --> 01:33:02,040
with that downloading feature that's

2007
01:33:02,040 --> 01:33:04,980
known as a hostile download again we're

2008
01:33:04,980 --> 01:33:06,360
going to avoid it because we want our

2009
01:33:06,360 --> 01:33:07,679
spyware to get on the Google Play Store

2010
01:33:07,679 --> 01:33:09,600
but it's one of those other factors that

2011
01:33:09,600 --> 01:33:12,420
makes the app incredibly suspicious so

2012
01:33:12,420 --> 01:33:15,179
yeah that does happen and then uh when

2013
01:33:15,179 --> 01:33:18,239
is the DNS princess line of uh crop tops

2014
01:33:18,239 --> 01:33:21,559
coming out because I need some merch

2015
01:33:21,900 --> 01:33:24,300
uh keep keep track of me on Mastodon

2016
01:33:24,300 --> 01:33:25,560
Twitter or on my blog yeah I'm on

2017
01:33:25,560 --> 01:33:27,239
Mastodon infosec exchange it's better

2018
01:33:27,239 --> 01:33:30,379
than Twitter and I'm not sorry

2019
01:33:33,120 --> 01:33:35,100
any other uh

2020
01:33:35,100 --> 01:33:37,920
questions stuff like that there's a lot

2021
01:33:37,920 --> 01:33:40,340
okay yeah

2022
01:33:40,560 --> 01:33:42,980
hi first time meeting you Alyssa

2023
01:33:42,980 --> 01:33:45,179
uh I have a question what are your

2024
01:33:45,179 --> 01:33:48,000
thoughts on uh like the latest versions

2025
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:52,739
of Android uh OS that review permissions

2026
01:33:52,739 --> 01:33:55,080
of unused apps and remove those

2027
01:33:55,080 --> 01:33:57,960
permissions so in this example of you

2028
01:33:57,960 --> 01:33:59,400
know the app that we're creating a

2029
01:33:59,400 --> 01:34:02,219
spyware app is there a way like can we

2030
01:34:02,219 --> 01:34:04,800
make the app open every day and fake

2031
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:06,480
some user data so that Google doesn't

2032
01:34:06,480 --> 01:34:09,000
remove those permissions or can we do

2033
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:10,800
you think that we can trust Google to

2034
01:34:10,800 --> 01:34:14,219
accurately know more or less

2035
01:34:14,219 --> 01:34:16,679
um okay so one if it's going to have any

2036
01:34:16,679 --> 01:34:18,300
user access in the background right that

2037
01:34:18,300 --> 01:34:20,340
it's going to have uh app background

2038
01:34:20,340 --> 01:34:21,900
access right

2039
01:34:21,900 --> 01:34:23,460
um that it's different than foreground

2040
01:34:23,460 --> 01:34:25,440
access the apps know if you're viewing

2041
01:34:25,440 --> 01:34:27,780
them or not right and when Google has

2042
01:34:27,780 --> 01:34:29,520
that setting to remove those permissions

2043
01:34:29,520 --> 01:34:31,320
of apps you haven't used those are

2044
01:34:31,320 --> 01:34:33,060
foreground apps

2045
01:34:33,060 --> 01:34:35,280
so I don't know of what you mentioned

2046
01:34:35,280 --> 01:34:37,320
having it like populate user data every

2047
01:34:37,320 --> 01:34:39,179
day would work

2048
01:34:39,179 --> 01:34:41,040
um but if you could like get the user to

2049
01:34:41,040 --> 01:34:43,080
incentivize to open it or accidentally

2050
01:34:43,080 --> 01:34:45,300
click on it then that would work

2051
01:34:45,300 --> 01:34:47,699
so um yeah did I answer your question

2052
01:34:47,699 --> 01:34:49,080
cool

2053
01:34:49,080 --> 01:34:51,540
and uh I have one time for one more

2054
01:34:51,540 --> 01:34:54,260
question that's it

2055
01:34:55,739 --> 01:34:58,199
no okay well we have really cool

2056
01:34:58,199 --> 01:34:59,760
stickers and like I said before I really

2057

01:41:19,560 --> 01:41:22,080
all right so first let me explain this

2087
01:41:22,080 --> 01:41:24,600
uh intro slide

2088
01:41:24,600 --> 01:41:27,780
um did anybody go to Andrew's uh AI talk

2089
01:41:27,780 --> 01:41:29,100
yesterday

2090
01:41:29,100 --> 01:41:32,300
all right I asked him to have chat GPT

2091
01:41:32,300 --> 01:41:35,159
generate a slide based on my personality

2092
01:41:35,159 --> 01:41:37,679
this is what it came up with

2093
01:41:37,679 --> 01:41:39,300
I'm kidding actually I did this myself

2094
01:41:39,300 --> 01:41:41,340
so that's what you're dealing with for

2095

the next hour all right this kind of

2096

the right room just in case we're

2100
01:41:53,159 --> 01:41:54,659
talking about live memory analysis and

2101
01:41:54,659 --> 01:41:56,400
we're trying to to basically make a case

2102
01:41:56,400 --> 01:41:59,280
for killing dead member analysis a

2103
01:41:59,280 --> 01:42:01,139

do incident response and those kinds of

2128
01:42:56,639 --> 01:42:59,760
things uh I got my start as a software

2129
01:42:59,760 --> 01:43:02,520
developer originally for a enormous

2130
01:43:02,520 --> 01:43:05,219
grocery company in Texas called HEB then

2131
01:43:05,219 --> 01:43:07,380
I joined the Air Force and was enlisted

2132
01:43:07,380 --> 01:43:09,179
for a little bit then I commissioned to

2133
01:43:09,179 --> 01:43:11,340
the Coast Guard which most people don't

2134
01:43:11,340 --> 01:43:12,960
even know as a military service I didn't

2135
01:43:12,960 --> 01:43:15,420
know that until I actually joined the

2136
01:43:15,420 --> 01:43:17,699
Coast Guard or right before that it was

2137
01:43:17,699 --> 01:43:19,080
in military service

2138
01:43:19,080 --> 01:43:22,800
and uh and so anyways I I've uh when I

2139
01:43:22,800 --> 01:43:23,880
you know spent some time in the military

2140
01:43:23,880 --> 01:43:25,260
especially when I went to the Coast

2141
01:43:25,260 --> 01:43:27,480
Guard I was in Washington DC I spent

2142
01:43:27,480 --> 01:43:30,239
time working with the NSA and US cyber

2143
01:43:30,239 --> 01:43:32,520
command other military services and then

2144
01:43:32,520 --> 01:43:34,739
I I actually ended my career with the

2145
01:43:34,739 --> 01:43:36,719
Department of Homeland Security I was

2146
01:43:36,719 --> 01:43:38,400
embedded still with the Coast Guard but

2147
01:43:38,400 --> 01:43:43,020
embedded in DHS in what is now sizza but

2148
01:43:43,020 --> 01:43:44,280
at the time it wasn't so it used to be

2149
01:43:44,280 --> 01:43:46,560
us cert a long time ago

2150
01:43:46,560 --> 01:43:48,360
um then it was when I was there I was

2151
01:43:48,360 --> 01:43:50,040
part of the hurt team the hunt an

2152
01:43:50,040 --> 01:43:52,199
incident response team and all we did

2153
01:43:52,199 --> 01:43:55,260
for about two years was travel around

2154
01:43:55,260 --> 01:43:56,940
the country doing threat hunting and

2155
01:43:56,940 --> 01:43:58,260
incident response on critical

2156
01:43:58,260 --> 01:44:00,719
infrastructure went to nuclear power

2157
01:44:00,719 --> 01:44:03,659
plant and Manufacturing facilities and

2158
01:44:03,659 --> 01:44:05,340
you know you water utilities and all

2159
01:44:05,340 --> 01:44:07,500
kinds of things like that so

2160
01:44:07,500 --> 01:44:09,179
I spent a lot of time doing that and

2161
01:44:09,179 --> 01:44:11,400
then I came over to Recon infosec and uh

2162
01:44:11,400 --> 01:44:13,380
just been having fun and and you know

2163
01:44:13,380 --> 01:44:15,119
teaching Sands and doing a lot of cool

2164
01:44:15,119 --> 01:44:17,159
stuff including

2165
01:44:17,159 --> 01:44:18,540
um having kids and buying donkeys and

2166
01:44:18,540 --> 01:44:21,179
stuff like that so I'm also a lover of

2167
01:44:21,179 --> 01:44:22,980
dad jokes this is uh one of the jobs

2168
01:44:22,980 --> 01:44:24,960
that I have at Recon that I'm very proud

2169
01:44:24,960 --> 01:44:27,000
of uh you know and I'll give you a good

2170
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:29,699
example uh so my donkey

2171
01:44:29,699 --> 01:44:32,880
we named him uh his first name is dumb

2172
01:44:32,880 --> 01:44:34,440
his last name can you guess what it is

2173
01:44:34,440 --> 01:44:36,540
it starts with an A

2174
01:44:36,540 --> 01:44:38,820
it's answer

2175
01:44:38,820 --> 01:44:40,739
oh you were thinking something else huh

2176
01:44:40,739 --> 01:44:43,679
there you go that's the dad jokes I'll

2177
01:44:43,679 --> 01:44:45,060
try to I'll try to put some in here

2178
01:44:45,060 --> 01:44:46,199
every once in a while they're they're

2179
01:44:46,199 --> 01:44:48,119
dry they tend to be so I always give the

2180
01:44:48,119 --> 01:44:50,520
disclaimer that if you think you heard

2181
01:44:50,520 --> 01:44:52,980
something that sounded like a joke but I

2182
01:44:52,980 --> 01:44:54,900
you're not sure because I just ran over

2183
01:44:54,900 --> 01:44:56,460
it and I'm kind of serious it's probably

2184
01:44:56,460 --> 01:44:57,780
a joke most of the time so you're you're

2185
01:44:57,780 --> 01:44:59,760
allowed to laugh okay I know that I know

2186
01:44:59,760 --> 01:45:01,260
the tensions are a little bit weird in

2187
01:45:01,260 --> 01:45:03,060
these kinds of things but uh I'll try to

2188
01:45:03,060 --> 01:45:05,280
make this as enjoyable as it is

2189
01:45:05,280 --> 01:45:08,880
informative okay so uh let me first

2190
01:45:08,880 --> 01:45:10,860
start off by talking about why memory

2191
01:45:10,860 --> 01:45:13,920
analysis is actually amazing okay so for

2192
01:45:13,920 --> 01:45:15,540
anybody who came in here you know

2193
01:45:15,540 --> 01:45:16,860
thinking that I was gonna just trash

2194
01:45:16,860 --> 01:45:18,719
memory analysis that's not at all what

2195
01:45:18,719 --> 01:45:19,800
I'm doing

2196
01:45:19,800 --> 01:45:22,020
um I'll explain but first memory

2197
01:45:22,020 --> 01:45:24,060
analysis uh when I teach Sans with the

2198
01:45:24,060 --> 01:45:26,040
508 class I teach it's actually one of

2199
01:45:26,040 --> 01:45:27,659
my favorite days when we hit memory

2200
01:45:27,659 --> 01:45:29,100
analysis we have spent basically an

2201
01:45:29,100 --> 01:45:31,020
entire day on it it's one of my favorite

2202
01:45:31,020 --> 01:45:34,440
days because memory analysis is one of

2203
01:45:34,440 --> 01:45:36,179
those areas where when you start doing

2204
01:45:36,179 --> 01:45:37,920
it it's kind of Niche there's not a lot

2205
01:45:37,920 --> 01:45:40,260
of people really that uh even an instant

2206
01:45:40,260 --> 01:45:42,440
response really know how to do it well

2207
01:45:42,440 --> 01:45:45,300
uh but once you get into it you start to

2208
01:45:45,300 --> 01:45:47,219
get answers for things that generally

2209
01:45:47,219 --> 01:45:48,840
you don't get out of all the other

2210
01:45:48,840 --> 01:45:50,639
security tools and and maybe even

2211
01:45:50,639 --> 01:45:52,800
sometimes logs and stuff like that so

2212
01:45:52,800 --> 01:45:54,119
you start to get the memory analysis and

2213
01:45:54,119 --> 01:45:55,380
you feel like first of all you feel like

2214
01:45:55,380 --> 01:45:56,820
a little bit like a ninja

2215
01:45:56,820 --> 01:45:59,219
but secondly you're getting answers for

2216
01:45:59,219 --> 01:46:00,719
things that you just generally can't get

2217
01:46:00,719 --> 01:46:03,600
anywhere else used to be the case that

2218
01:46:03,600 --> 01:46:05,820
uh uh you know most of the things that

2219
01:46:05,820 --> 01:46:08,400
attackers did happen on disk well tools

2220
01:46:08,400 --> 01:46:10,619
got very good at finding those things

2221
01:46:10,619 --> 01:46:12,360
you know in an automated fashion which

2222
01:46:12,360 --> 01:46:14,760
forced attackers to move into memory

2223
01:46:14,760 --> 01:46:16,320
only attacks this is where you get

2224
01:46:16,320 --> 01:46:18,239
things like fileless malware and you

2225
01:46:18,239 --> 01:46:19,500
know code injection and things like that

2226
01:46:19,500 --> 01:46:22,920
so obviously when you dump memory and

2227
01:46:22,920 --> 01:46:24,540
you start using a tool like volatility

2228
01:46:24,540 --> 01:46:26,940
or something like that you it's very

2229
01:46:26,940 --> 01:46:28,560
easy to find these things if you know

2230
01:46:28,560 --> 01:46:30,540
how to look for them so that's one of

2231
01:46:30,540 --> 01:46:32,639
the reasons why memory analysis is in

2232
01:46:32,639 --> 01:46:34,679
dead member analysis you know is is

2233
01:46:34,679 --> 01:46:38,100
fantastic so I have no no gripes at all

2234
01:46:38,100 --> 01:46:40,440
with all the great and wonderful things

2235
01:46:40,440 --> 01:46:42,900
that you can do in memory analysis in

2236
01:46:42,900 --> 01:46:46,199
fact let me show you an example

2237
01:46:46,199 --> 01:46:48,360
um uh this is something that that I did

2238
01:46:48,360 --> 01:46:50,580
uh just for this talk

2239
01:46:50,580 --> 01:46:56,520
so I actually uh used win pmem to dump

2240
01:46:56,520 --> 01:46:58,679
some memory after I had typed some

2241
01:46:58,679 --> 01:47:01,619
things into uh just basically into I

2242
01:47:01,619 --> 01:47:03,780
think it was Powershell

2243
01:47:03,780 --> 01:47:05,040
most of the time you come into an

2244
01:47:05,040 --> 01:47:06,719
instant response case you don't have

2245
01:47:06,719 --> 01:47:08,940
command line auditing for organizations

2246
01:47:08,940 --> 01:47:10,440
that just didn't think about that

2247
01:47:10,440 --> 01:47:12,060
beforehand right so they call you up

2248
01:47:12,060 --> 01:47:15,540
they they got smashed a lot of times you

2249
01:47:15,540 --> 01:47:17,040
just you're lacking a lot of logs one of

2250
01:47:17,040 --> 01:47:18,239
the things that you're all you're

2251
01:47:18,239 --> 01:47:20,880
lacking very often is command line stuff

2252
01:47:20,880 --> 01:47:22,320
right what did the attacker do what did

2253
01:47:22,320 --> 01:47:24,420
they type in well one of the cool things

2254
01:47:24,420 --> 01:47:26,400
that you might be able to do even in an

2255
01:47:26,400 --> 01:47:27,600
environment where they didn't have

2256
01:47:27,600 --> 01:47:29,880
command line auditing is if you have the

2257
01:47:29,880 --> 01:47:31,560
compromise system that the one that the

2258
01:47:31,560 --> 01:47:33,960
attacker was using you can dump out con

2259
01:47:33,960 --> 01:47:36,300
host uh the memory sections of the con

2260
01:47:36,300 --> 01:47:38,760
host process or processes like you said

2261
01:47:38,760 --> 01:47:41,460
you see I did at the uh the top there

2262
01:47:41,460 --> 01:47:44,580
then effectively you can use strings you

2263
01:47:44,580 --> 01:47:46,739
can extract all the strings out of there

2264
01:47:46,739 --> 01:47:49,020
uh the condos process is basically

2265
01:47:49,020 --> 01:47:51,600
holding uh you know that in there you

2266
01:47:51,600 --> 01:47:53,820
might actually be able to stumble upon

2267
01:47:53,820 --> 01:47:56,460
very interesting things sometimes you

2268
01:47:56,460 --> 01:47:58,980
know passwords or you know commands you

2269
01:47:58,980 --> 01:48:00,540
might be able to figure out excuse me

2270
01:48:00,540 --> 01:48:02,580
what the attacker did what you're seeing

2271
01:48:02,580 --> 01:48:03,420
here

2272
01:48:03,420 --> 01:48:06,179
is a download cradle you see that uh IEX

2273
01:48:06,179 --> 01:48:08,639
download string and then you see uh you

2274
01:48:08,639 --> 01:48:10,860
know cyberdonkey.net

2275
01:48:10,860 --> 01:48:12,960
um so first of all that's an interesting

2276
01:48:12,960 --> 01:48:15,179
uh it's an interesting URL but if you're

2277
01:48:15,179 --> 01:48:16,980
not sure what that is a a download

2278
01:48:16,980 --> 01:48:18,960
cradle is a Powershell download critical

2279
01:48:18,960 --> 01:48:20,340
is effectively something that's going to

2280
01:48:20,340 --> 01:48:21,659
it's going to pull it down from the

2281
01:48:21,659 --> 01:48:23,100
Internet it's going to execute it

2282
01:48:23,100 --> 01:48:24,600
immediately in memory it's never going

2283
01:48:24,600 --> 01:48:26,340
to touch disk it's a favorite of

2284
01:48:26,340 --> 01:48:27,540
attackers this is one of those things

2285
01:48:27,540 --> 01:48:29,040
that you're only going to see if you're

2286
01:48:29,040 --> 01:48:31,980
doing you're looking at memory or if you

2287
01:48:31,980 --> 01:48:34,080
have command line auditing but this is

2288
01:48:34,080 --> 01:48:35,880
just a great example of how you might

2289
01:48:35,880 --> 01:48:37,739
use dead memory forensics to do

2290
01:48:37,739 --> 01:48:39,719
something kind of magical in an

2291
01:48:39,719 --> 01:48:40,800
organization where they didn't have

2292
01:48:40,800 --> 01:48:42,300
command line auditing when you came in

2293
01:48:42,300 --> 01:48:43,380
right

2294
01:48:43,380 --> 01:48:45,540
unfortunately dead member analysis has

2295
01:48:45,540 --> 01:48:48,420
to die okay now let me explain right

2296
01:48:48,420 --> 01:48:50,159
there's a little bit of hostility here

2297
01:48:50,159 --> 01:48:52,260
and the donkey's calling that out but

2298
01:48:52,260 --> 01:48:53,280
I'm going to answer that donkey's

2299
01:48:53,280 --> 01:48:56,340
question and tell you why uh it's not

2300
01:48:56,340 --> 01:48:57,960
true hostility okay I'm just being

2301
01:48:57,960 --> 01:49:00,540
Sensational because the reason why dead

2302
01:49:00,540 --> 01:49:04,860
memory analysis uh is uh just really not

2303
01:49:04,860 --> 01:49:07,560
the thing that we should be pushing hard

2304
01:49:07,560 --> 01:49:09,239
anymore

2305
01:49:09,239 --> 01:49:12,300
for a couple of uh different cases is

2306
01:49:12,300 --> 01:49:14,340
because traditionally you have a

2307
01:49:14,340 --> 01:49:15,659
situation where you're coming upon an

2308
01:49:15,659 --> 01:49:17,820
incident you have a single system right

2309
01:49:17,820 --> 01:49:19,320
if I know I have a compromised system

2310
01:49:19,320 --> 01:49:20,699
and I'm looking at that system okay

2311
01:49:20,699 --> 01:49:22,560
great I can I can take a snapshot of the

2312
01:49:22,560 --> 01:49:24,239
memory I can dump that out I can then

2313
01:49:24,239 --> 01:49:26,159
use volatility to do some very cool and

2314
01:49:26,159 --> 01:49:28,560
interesting things

2315
01:49:28,560 --> 01:49:30,719
if you're not uh familiar with this I

2316
01:49:30,719 --> 01:49:33,840
man I I actually added this because uh

2317
01:49:33,840 --> 01:49:35,340
yesterday there was a bunch of students

2318
01:49:35,340 --> 01:49:36,719
high school students and college

2319
01:49:36,719 --> 01:49:37,860
students it's not going to land anymore

2320
01:49:37,860 --> 01:49:39,960
I was going to tell them that uh this

2321
01:49:39,960 --> 01:49:42,000
was a memory snapshot back in the day

2322
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:43,860
you know so like

2323
01:49:43,860 --> 01:49:46,020
it doesn't work anymore but uh because I

2324
01:49:46,020 --> 01:49:47,340
can see most of you guys know obviously

2325
01:49:47,340 --> 01:49:49,440
actually so um I actually I know I look

2326
01:49:49,440 --> 01:49:51,840
like I'm uh you know maybe in my early

2327
01:49:51,840 --> 01:49:54,179
20s or maybe 18.

2328
01:49:54,179 --> 01:49:55,739
um so six kids proves that I'm a little

2329
01:49:55,739 --> 01:49:57,719
bit older than that but I'm also over

2330
01:49:57,719 --> 01:50:00,659
400 months old okay well over 400 months

2331
01:50:00,659 --> 01:50:03,659
old so I know what that is uh I used to

2332
01:50:03,659 --> 01:50:06,420
use them anyway so again traditionally

2333
01:50:06,420 --> 01:50:07,800
you know you're using volatility you're

2334
01:50:07,800 --> 01:50:09,540
dumping uh yeah excuse me you're uh

2335
01:50:09,540 --> 01:50:11,159
you're you're traversing through memory

2336
01:50:11,159 --> 01:50:13,320
you're interrogating processes uh maybe

2337
01:50:13,320 --> 01:50:14,880
looking at memory sections looking for

2338
01:50:14,880 --> 01:50:16,440
things like you know dlls that are

2339
01:50:16,440 --> 01:50:18,000
loaded and maybe mutants and stuff like

2340
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:19,199
that

2341
01:50:19,199 --> 01:50:21,119
um you can even use that to to actually

2342
01:50:21,119 --> 01:50:22,739
recover stuff you can you can pull

2343
01:50:22,739 --> 01:50:26,580
potentially pull out a file or

2344
01:50:26,580 --> 01:50:27,239
um

2345
01:50:27,239 --> 01:50:30,300
you know a suspicious process uh and

2346
01:50:30,300 --> 01:50:32,219
it's it's fantastic okay it's magical

2347
01:50:32,219 --> 01:50:34,199
the problem though is that when you come

2348
01:50:34,199 --> 01:50:36,420
into an environment with a bunch of

2349
01:50:36,420 --> 01:50:38,040
different systems and you don't know

2350
01:50:38,040 --> 01:50:40,020
which one of those is compromised right

2351
01:50:40,020 --> 01:50:42,239
this is this is where dead memory

2352
01:50:42,239 --> 01:50:44,460
forensics starts to really struggle I

2353
01:50:44,460 --> 01:50:46,260
don't know which one to start with and

2354
01:50:46,260 --> 01:50:48,239
you know here I might have a 8 10 11

2355
01:50:48,239 --> 01:50:50,040
systems

2356
01:50:50,040 --> 01:50:52,080
that's already a little bit too much for

2357
01:50:52,080 --> 01:50:54,480
me to just go and grab a memory snapshot

2358
01:50:54,480 --> 01:50:56,040
of each of those and just kind of try

2359
01:50:56,040 --> 01:50:57,719
and figure out what's going on

2360
01:50:57,719 --> 01:50:59,880
and even worse reality is that we're not

2361
01:50:59,880 --> 01:51:02,040
usually coming into an environment with

2362
01:51:02,040 --> 01:51:03,900
10 to 12 systems we're coming into an

2363
01:51:03,900 --> 01:51:05,460
environment with hundreds of systems and

2364
01:51:05,460 --> 01:51:07,500
sometimes thousands of systems and if I

2365
01:51:07,500 --> 01:51:08,639
don't know

2366
01:51:08,639 --> 01:51:10,260
I might have one system that's

2367
01:51:10,260 --> 01:51:11,520
compromised potentially but if I don't

2368
01:51:11,520 --> 01:51:13,920
know what all systems are compromised as

2369
01:51:13,920 --> 01:51:15,659
an incident responder I'm not doing my

2370
01:51:15,659 --> 01:51:17,520
job by running around and trying to take

2371
01:51:17,520 --> 01:51:18,659
snapshots of a bunch of different

2372
01:51:18,659 --> 01:51:20,880
systems to then go and perform memory

2373
01:51:20,880 --> 01:51:21,900
analysis

2374
01:51:21,900 --> 01:51:24,600
okay so memory dead memory analysis

2375
01:51:24,600 --> 01:51:27,659
doesn't scale all right it doesn't scale

2376
01:51:27,659 --> 01:51:29,820
it's very time consuming it's going to

2377
01:51:29,820 --> 01:51:32,219
take time to take a snapshot it's going

2378
01:51:32,219 --> 01:51:34,860
to take time to try and pull that

2379
01:51:34,860 --> 01:51:37,980
snapshot that raw uh image especially if

2380
01:51:37,980 --> 01:51:39,600
you're doing that remotely it's going to

2381
01:51:39,600 --> 01:51:41,340
take time

2382
01:51:41,340 --> 01:51:43,560
here's the biggest reason why I think

2383
01:51:43,560 --> 01:51:46,560
that we need to uh you know kind of

2384
01:51:46,560 --> 01:51:49,020
effectively kill the mentality that dead

2385
01:51:49,020 --> 01:51:51,659
memory analysis is is a go-to in instant

2386
01:51:51,659 --> 01:51:54,119
response in in many cases uh because as

2387
01:51:54,119 --> 01:51:57,060
a as a person who we run MDR right so so

2388
01:51:57,060 --> 01:51:58,980
security operations

2389
01:51:58,980 --> 01:52:01,320
when you're doing dead memory analysis

2390
01:52:01,320 --> 01:52:03,960
virtually every time that means you've

2391
01:52:03,960 --> 01:52:05,940
already lost okay this means that you've

2392
01:52:05,940 --> 01:52:07,980
already been smashed you're already in a

2393
01:52:07,980 --> 01:52:10,020
position where you're doing you're doing

2394
01:52:10,020 --> 01:52:13,020
an autopsy okay I don't want to be doing

2395
01:52:13,020 --> 01:52:15,420
an autopsy I want to be catching things

2396
01:52:15,420 --> 01:52:17,400
as they're happening before they're

2397
01:52:17,400 --> 01:52:18,719
happening I want to give myself an

2398
01:52:18,719 --> 01:52:20,820
opportunity to stop the bleeding so that

2399
01:52:20,820 --> 01:52:22,500
I'm not having to do an autopsy later

2400
01:52:22,500 --> 01:52:24,900
right that's one of the biggest reasons

2401
01:52:24,900 --> 01:52:27,719
why I I'm sort of given this talk here

2402
01:52:27,719 --> 01:52:29,580
because I see a lot of people in fact I

2403
01:52:29,580 --> 01:52:31,020
get a lot of people who come to our

2404
01:52:31,020 --> 01:52:32,820
class like the Sans class

2405
01:52:32,820 --> 01:52:34,739
and they there's uh there's kind of an

2406
01:52:34,739 --> 01:52:36,000
old school mentality that you know you

2407
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:37,380
have the guys who do like the the

2408
01:52:37,380 --> 01:52:39,000
regular disc analysis and stuff over

2409
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:40,440
here then there's the memory forensic

2410
01:52:40,440 --> 01:52:42,000
Skies or whatever

2411
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:43,500
um and they don't really cross and so

2412
01:52:43,500 --> 01:52:45,540
what I'm I'm trying to get at here is

2413
01:52:45,540 --> 01:52:48,239
that uh you know this emphasis on dead

2414
01:52:48,239 --> 01:52:50,760
memory analysis is keeping us in this

2415
01:52:50,760 --> 01:52:53,159
kind of stuck state of not pulling the

2416
01:52:53,159 --> 01:52:54,780
things that we can learn from dead

2417
01:52:54,780 --> 01:52:56,940
member analysis into Live member

2418
01:52:56,940 --> 01:52:58,500
analysis but I'm going to show you there

2419
01:52:58,500 --> 01:53:00,300
is a better way there's a way to do all

2420
01:53:00,300 --> 01:53:01,860
the great wonderful things that you do

2421
01:53:01,860 --> 01:53:04,020
in volatility and dead member analysis

2422
01:53:04,020 --> 01:53:07,380
with live memory okay so just really

2423
01:53:07,380 --> 01:53:09,420
quickly uh to hit these from uh from a

2424
01:53:09,420 --> 01:53:10,920
point by point perspective here's the

2425
01:53:10,920 --> 01:53:12,840
issues that we have with dead member

2426
01:53:12,840 --> 01:53:14,940
analysis I can't start analysis until I

2427
01:53:14,940 --> 01:53:17,580
have that image in my hand right I can't

2428
01:53:17,580 --> 01:53:19,320
can't really do anything until I take

2429
01:53:19,320 --> 01:53:21,119
the snapshot

2430
01:53:21,119 --> 01:53:22,619
um and I don't even know which ones I'm

2431
01:53:22,619 --> 01:53:24,480
gonna start with I don't know I mean am

2432
01:53:24,480 --> 01:53:27,000
I being random am I maybe I have a sense

2433
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:29,159
of one copper my system but if I'm in an

2434
01:53:29,159 --> 01:53:30,659
environment with thousands I don't know

2435
01:53:30,659 --> 01:53:33,239
what I'm which ones I'm capturing and

2436
01:53:33,239 --> 01:53:36,420
then a bigger thing is that as you know

2437
01:53:36,420 --> 01:53:38,699
Ram capacity can is growing and growing

2438
01:53:38,699 --> 01:53:41,100
and growing now it's it's only uh

2439
01:53:41,100 --> 01:53:42,659
exacerbating the problem

2440
01:53:42,659 --> 01:53:44,040
a little bit of an embarrassing story

2441
01:53:44,040 --> 01:53:47,580
some years ago uh I had an IR and it was

2442
01:53:47,580 --> 01:53:49,739
a remote ir and you know there's a lot

2443
01:53:49,739 --> 01:53:51,000
of things going on

2444
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:54,540
and uh I we knew that at least there was

2445
01:53:54,540 --> 01:53:56,699
a one or two compromise systems there

2446
01:53:56,699 --> 01:53:58,380
were servers in fact because they were

2447
01:53:58,380 --> 01:53:59,760
you know crazy things were happening so

2448
01:53:59,760 --> 01:54:00,780
we were like okay it's probably

2449
01:54:00,780 --> 01:54:02,280
conference let's take a snapshot of

2450
01:54:02,280 --> 01:54:04,139
those just in case right because we may

2451
01:54:04,139 --> 01:54:05,820
not start doing that we're not going to

2452
01:54:05,820 --> 01:54:07,260
start doing memory forensics and stuff

2453
01:54:07,260 --> 01:54:08,940
like that right away but let's take a

2454
01:54:08,940 --> 01:54:10,560
snapshot of it

2455
01:54:10,560 --> 01:54:12,119
um and then I you know go ahead and

2456
01:54:12,119 --> 01:54:13,980
upload it here

2457
01:54:13,980 --> 01:54:16,199
hours go by and hours go by and I'm you

2458
01:54:16,199 --> 01:54:18,239
know I call and I ask like how are

2459
01:54:18,239 --> 01:54:19,440
things going with that and uh and

2460
01:54:19,440 --> 01:54:20,820
they're like oh man it's like it's gonna

2461
01:54:20,820 --> 01:54:22,139
it says it's gonna take forever I don't

2462
01:54:22,139 --> 01:54:23,219
know like multiple days or something

2463
01:54:23,219 --> 01:54:24,480
like what in the world were you talking

2464
01:54:24,480 --> 01:54:27,540
about it was like 250 gigs the ram so I

2465
01:54:27,540 --> 01:54:29,820
was like oh I should have asked you

2466
01:54:29,820 --> 01:54:32,159
beforehand so it was a it was a little

2467
01:54:32,159 --> 01:54:34,080
bit of a wake-up call for me that there

2468
01:54:34,080 --> 01:54:36,300
was multiple systems they all they had

2469
01:54:36,300 --> 01:54:39,060
like 250 gigs and and more of RAM on

2470
01:54:39,060 --> 01:54:40,980
these servers and I thought that's going

2471
01:54:40,980 --> 01:54:42,239
to take forever not just to take the

2472
01:54:42,239 --> 01:54:44,699
snapshot but to upload it and then for

2473
01:54:44,699 --> 01:54:46,380
me to download it and I thought forget

2474
01:54:46,380 --> 01:54:49,020
it right like it abandoned all that like

2475
01:54:49,020 --> 01:54:50,760
um let's just triage it and we'll we'll

2476
01:54:50,760 --> 01:54:52,320
if we need to get to that point you can

2477
01:54:52,320 --> 01:54:54,119
still take the snapshot if we maybe we

2478
01:54:54,119 --> 01:54:55,440
need to get to that eventually whatever

2479
01:54:55,440 --> 01:54:57,840
but I'm not even gonna try to have you

2480
01:54:57,840 --> 01:55:00,960
upload it I would be probably faster for

2481
01:55:00,960 --> 01:55:02,580
me to just buy a plane ticket I'll fly

2482
01:55:02,580 --> 01:55:04,320
over there and then I'll you know I'll

2483
01:55:04,320 --> 01:55:05,760
do analysis there I'll grab it or

2484
01:55:05,760 --> 01:55:06,719
whatever

2485
01:55:06,719 --> 01:55:09,000
uh so again remote systems can be

2486
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:11,040
problematic especially if you have uh

2487
01:55:11,040 --> 01:55:12,719
you know large Ram capacity and then

2488
01:55:12,719 --> 01:55:14,460
storage issues right like that's the

2489
01:55:14,460 --> 01:55:16,380
other thing are you going to really grab

2490
01:55:16,380 --> 01:55:18,060
tons of snapshots and put them into this

2491
01:55:18,060 --> 01:55:19,619
you know like

2492
01:55:19,619 --> 01:55:21,300
how much storage did you do you need and

2493
01:55:21,300 --> 01:55:23,400
are you really going to do all that

2494
01:55:23,400 --> 01:55:25,619
um it's just it's just not feasible okay

2495
01:55:25,619 --> 01:55:29,940
so one other thing that uh is not often

2496
01:55:29,940 --> 01:55:32,580
talked about is uh is evidence smear

2497
01:55:32,580 --> 01:55:34,260
you think about the fact that especially

2498
01:55:34,260 --> 01:55:36,060
as you have these systems that have an

2499
01:55:36,060 --> 01:55:38,639
enormous Ram capacity as you start

2500
01:55:38,639 --> 01:55:40,320
taking the snapshot especially if it's a

2501
01:55:40,320 --> 01:55:42,000
server in a production environment for

2502
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:43,619
some you know corporate system that's

2503
01:55:43,619 --> 01:55:45,360
being you know used if they can't turn

2504
01:55:45,360 --> 01:55:46,739
that thing off

2505
01:55:46,739 --> 01:55:48,960
it's doing things as you're trying to

2506
01:55:48,960 --> 01:55:52,139
take the snapshot okay so as you're

2507
01:55:52,139 --> 01:55:53,820
trying to take the snapshot you're using

2508
01:55:53,820 --> 01:55:55,800
the system you're using resources in the

2509
01:55:55,800 --> 01:55:57,179
system in fact you're using memory

2510
01:55:57,179 --> 01:55:58,440
resources in the system

2511
01:55:58,440 --> 01:56:00,480
to take a snapshot as you're taking a

2512
01:56:00,480 --> 01:56:02,520
snapshot things are changing you know

2513
01:56:02,520 --> 01:56:03,840
they're changing

2514
01:56:03,840 --> 01:56:06,360
constantly potentially so much to the

2515
01:56:06,360 --> 01:56:07,800
point that you might actually start off

2516
01:56:07,800 --> 01:56:09,960
with thinking that okay I need to get

2517
01:56:09,960 --> 01:56:11,699
this you know these artifacts these

2518
01:56:11,699 --> 01:56:13,440
artifacts may not even be there by the

2519
01:56:13,440 --> 01:56:16,340
time that you're done taking uh the uh

2520
01:56:16,340 --> 01:56:18,719
the snapshot so

2521
01:56:18,719 --> 01:56:22,739
there's reasons why uh not just you know

2522
01:56:22,739 --> 01:56:24,840
um feasibility reasons there's technical

2523
01:56:24,840 --> 01:56:26,760
reasons why this may not be a good idea

2524
01:56:26,760 --> 01:56:29,340
okay at least to go to as your as your

2525
01:56:29,340 --> 01:56:31,560
you know as your go-to right

2526
01:56:31,560 --> 01:56:33,119
what about threat hunting what about if

2527
01:56:33,119 --> 01:56:35,400
I don't have uh an incident response

2528
01:56:35,400 --> 01:56:37,500
that you know tells me here's a system

2529
01:56:37,500 --> 01:56:39,119
that we know for sure is compromise and

2530
01:56:39,119 --> 01:56:40,679
we can go from there throat hunting

2531
01:56:40,679 --> 01:56:42,179
right that's the new thing we got to get

2532
01:56:42,179 --> 01:56:44,699
into the a process where we might we

2533
01:56:44,699 --> 01:56:46,080
might be compromised we have to assume

2534
01:56:46,080 --> 01:56:47,100
that there's a good chance we're

2535
01:56:47,100 --> 01:56:48,480
compromising we start looking for

2536
01:56:48,480 --> 01:56:51,060
evidence of compromise without a single

2537
01:56:51,060 --> 01:56:52,739
system to kind of you know get us

2538
01:56:52,739 --> 01:56:54,719
started

2539
01:56:54,719 --> 01:56:56,460
um and again as I mentioned that when

2540
01:56:56,460 --> 01:56:57,780
when we're at this point usually the

2541
01:56:57,780 --> 01:56:59,100
damage is already done and that's just

2542
01:56:59,100 --> 01:57:01,199
that's not good for

2543
01:57:01,199 --> 01:57:02,880
um anybody except for the guys who just

2544
01:57:02,880 --> 01:57:04,800
love doing dead memory analysis

2545
01:57:04,800 --> 01:57:06,600
okay so

2546
01:57:06,600 --> 01:57:08,880
um a quick uh evolution of kind of uh

2547
01:57:08,880 --> 01:57:09,960
how all these things are coming together

2548
01:57:09,960 --> 01:57:11,159
especially if you're in a security

2549
01:57:11,159 --> 01:57:13,320
operations environment

2550
01:57:13,320 --> 01:57:15,360
um the old school uh when I was with

2551
01:57:15,360 --> 01:57:17,639
this is even that long ago but still

2552
01:57:17,639 --> 01:57:19,920
people are you know doing old school

2553
01:57:19,920 --> 01:57:22,560
methods of uh you know we in DHS we used

2554
01:57:22,560 --> 01:57:23,400
to come

2555
01:57:23,400 --> 01:57:25,800
into an instant response and often we

2556
01:57:25,800 --> 01:57:27,239
would uh we would immediately start

2557
01:57:27,239 --> 01:57:29,880
doing uh you know forensic disc images

2558
01:57:29,880 --> 01:57:32,639
of the systems so we would you would do

2559
01:57:32,639 --> 01:57:33,900
that it would take a while we would

2560
01:57:33,900 --> 01:57:35,460
check on the progress we'd come back and

2561
01:57:35,460 --> 01:57:36,659
then we'd take those things and we start

2562
01:57:36,659 --> 01:57:38,400
kind of pouring through things

2563
01:57:38,400 --> 01:57:40,320
um the reality is that that's old school

2564
01:57:40,320 --> 01:57:41,400
and that's been pushed away and that's

2565
01:57:41,400 --> 01:57:42,540
one of the things that we teach is fast

2566
01:57:42,540 --> 01:57:44,639
forensics triage right like I I know

2567
01:57:44,639 --> 01:57:45,719
there's things that I'm going to need I

2568
01:57:45,719 --> 01:57:47,699
know that uh you know prefetch and shim

2569
01:57:47,699 --> 01:57:49,739
cash and all the kind of best hits in

2570
01:57:49,739 --> 01:57:51,659
forensics I can go grab those things I

2571
01:57:51,659 --> 01:57:53,820
can use a tool like cape or something I

2572
01:57:53,820 --> 01:57:55,679
can just grab all of those things and I

2573
01:57:55,679 --> 01:57:58,080
can start doing immediate analysis uh I

2574
01:57:58,080 --> 01:57:59,699
don't need to wait for a forensic disc

2575
01:57:59,699 --> 01:58:01,260
image especially of a two terabyte

2576
01:58:01,260 --> 01:58:02,400
system

2577
01:58:02,400 --> 01:58:04,199
um then threat hunting and memory

2578
01:58:04,199 --> 01:58:06,480
analysis all of those things in fact can

2579
01:58:06,480 --> 01:58:09,060
can I kind of you know converge into a

2580
01:58:09,060 --> 01:58:10,500
fast forensics and instant response

2581
01:58:10,500 --> 01:58:13,020
process that pulls all of those things

2582
01:58:13,020 --> 01:58:14,340
I'm going to show you how to do that

2583
01:58:14,340 --> 01:58:17,040
with something called Velociraptor this

2584
01:58:17,040 --> 01:58:19,619
phenomenal and beautiful tool that

2585
01:58:19,619 --> 01:58:22,739
magically allows us to do all the things

2586
01:58:22,739 --> 01:58:24,119
that I you know we're talking about with

2587
01:58:24,119 --> 01:58:25,980
you know the the triage of disc

2588
01:58:25,980 --> 01:58:28,800
artifacts and and um and memory analysis

2589
01:58:28,800 --> 01:58:31,560
from live systems across your entire

2590
01:58:31,560 --> 01:58:32,699
environment doesn't matter if you have

2591
01:58:32,699 --> 01:58:36,119
10 systems 500 or 5000 systems in fact

2592
01:58:36,119 --> 01:58:38,280
we do this very successfully with

2593
01:58:38,280 --> 01:58:40,380
thousands upon thousands of systems all

2594
01:58:40,380 --> 01:58:41,219
the time

2595
01:58:41,219 --> 01:58:43,440
so uh how many of you have heard of

2596
01:58:43,440 --> 01:58:45,000
velociraptor

2597
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:46,980
okay how many of you not heard of

2598
01:58:46,980 --> 01:58:50,040
velociraptor okay and how many of you

2599
01:58:50,040 --> 01:58:52,619
hate voting and refuse to vote

2600
01:58:52,619 --> 01:58:55,139
okay yeah usually the last one gets the

2601
01:58:55,139 --> 01:58:57,000
rest of the group so

2602
01:58:57,000 --> 01:58:59,760
um there's a talk coming up at two uh

2603
01:58:59,760 --> 01:59:01,260
from some of my colleagues uh Whitney

2604
01:59:01,260 --> 01:59:03,060
champion and Eric uh capuano they're

2605
01:59:03,060 --> 01:59:04,679
going to talk extensively about

2606
01:59:04,679 --> 01:59:06,420
Velociraptor okay this is not a talk

2607
01:59:06,420 --> 01:59:08,520
about Velociraptor I'm going to use

2608
01:59:08,520 --> 01:59:10,800
Velociraptor to tell you how you can do

2609
01:59:10,800 --> 01:59:13,980
live memory analysis and do many of the

2610
01:59:13,980 --> 01:59:15,179
same things that you would do with dead

2611
01:59:15,179 --> 01:59:16,619
memory analysis including things like

2612
01:59:16,619 --> 01:59:18,840
you can see on the screen the PS list I

2613
01:59:18,840 --> 01:59:21,000
can I can list out my processes and

2614
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:23,520
interrogate those processes uh here's

2615
01:59:23,520 --> 01:59:25,020
Here's the the big difference though I'm

2616
01:59:25,020 --> 01:59:26,820
doing this again across many systems I'm

2617
01:59:26,820 --> 01:59:29,099
not just doing this with a single system

2618
01:59:29,099 --> 01:59:31,619
um uh many of the other things that uh

2619
01:59:31,619 --> 01:59:32,940
you know like malified and stuff we'll

2620
01:59:32,940 --> 01:59:34,440
walk through that uh but let me just

2621
01:59:34,440 --> 01:59:36,599
give you an example of uh again this is

2622
01:59:36,599 --> 01:59:38,219
what it would look like

2623
01:59:38,219 --> 01:59:39,900
you go through a process I'm loading

2624
01:59:39,900 --> 01:59:41,760
something like when pmam I'm taking the

2625
01:59:41,760 --> 01:59:44,040
memory dump I'm then bringing that over

2626
01:59:44,040 --> 01:59:46,040
to my analysis system or what have you

2627
01:59:46,040 --> 01:59:48,300
then uh you know I'm loading up

2628
01:59:48,300 --> 01:59:49,920
volatility which again is a fantastic

2629
01:59:49,920 --> 01:59:53,280
Tool uh and I'm I'm listed out the

2630
01:59:53,280 --> 01:59:54,900
processes and it's it's fantastic right

2631
01:59:54,900 --> 01:59:57,060
that's great problem is that again I

2632
01:59:57,060 --> 01:59:59,340
have to do this on every system I want

2633
01:59:59,340 --> 02:00:01,920
to look at the processes I first of all

2634
02:00:01,920 --> 02:00:03,840
I have to go in and do the process of

2635
02:00:03,840 --> 02:00:05,340
dumping memory and all that taking the

2636
02:00:05,340 --> 02:00:07,139
memory snapshot

2637
02:00:07,139 --> 02:00:09,840
and then I have a snapshot in time here

2638
02:00:09,840 --> 02:00:11,760
okay what if I want to see what

2639
02:00:11,760 --> 02:00:13,920
processes run like five seconds after I

2640
02:00:13,920 --> 02:00:15,300
take the snapshot I need to go back and

2641
02:00:15,300 --> 02:00:17,040
take another snapshot it's unreasonable

2642
02:00:17,040 --> 02:00:21,119
right so Velociraptor I can run that

2643
02:00:21,119 --> 02:00:24,060
instantly okay instantly I can go get a

2644
02:00:24,060 --> 02:00:25,739
list of processors from a single system

2645
02:00:25,739 --> 02:00:29,040
or from many systems uh so I actually

2646
02:00:29,040 --> 02:00:31,980
set up uh on my uh my own you know I

2647
02:00:31,980 --> 02:00:34,560
bought a domain cyberdonkey.net I set up

2648
02:00:34,560 --> 02:00:36,900
a velociraptor uh you like that one

2649
02:00:36,900 --> 02:00:38,760
Winnie so okay so I set up a

2650
02:00:38,760 --> 02:00:41,340
velociraptor uh instance and uh and then

2651
02:00:41,340 --> 02:00:43,860
just a couple of test systems and uh so

2652
02:00:43,860 --> 02:00:46,619
you can see that I have here

2653
02:00:46,619 --> 02:00:49,199
four systems that I ran it against just

2654
02:00:49,199 --> 02:00:51,119
to show that I could get it from a

2655
02:00:51,119 --> 02:00:52,380
number of systems at once again this

2656
02:00:52,380 --> 02:00:54,659
could be thousands of systems but

2657
02:00:54,659 --> 02:00:57,540
effectively I can run a PS list I can

2658
02:00:57,540 --> 02:00:59,159
run PS3 this is the kind of all the

2659
02:00:59,159 --> 02:01:01,560
favorites of processed interrogation and

2660
02:01:01,560 --> 02:01:03,480
figure out what's going on not just on a

2661
02:01:03,480 --> 02:01:06,239
single system but across many systems

2662
02:01:06,239 --> 02:01:08,040
here's one of the reasons why this is so

2663
02:01:08,040 --> 02:01:10,440
uh phenomenal and game changing for for

2664
02:01:10,440 --> 02:01:11,880
some people who are just you know kind

2665
02:01:11,880 --> 02:01:14,460
of barely understanding that there's

2666
02:01:14,460 --> 02:01:16,860
this wave of fast forensics and IR type

2667
02:01:16,860 --> 02:01:20,719
stuff is when you are interrogating

2668
02:01:20,719 --> 02:01:23,400
processes uh you know there's a couple

2669
02:01:23,400 --> 02:01:24,960
of different things that you can use to

2670
02:01:24,960 --> 02:01:27,800
figure out maybe some signs of Suspicion

2671
02:01:27,800 --> 02:01:30,540
from from just looking at processes

2672
02:01:30,540 --> 02:01:33,540
right a process lists uh for example

2673
02:01:33,540 --> 02:01:35,460
uh one thing that you can see here is

2674
02:01:35,460 --> 02:01:37,380
that uh I have Explorer launching

2675
02:01:37,380 --> 02:01:38,760
Powershell then I have Powershell lunch

2676
02:01:38,760 --> 02:01:40,500
and Powershell so on the right you see

2677
02:01:40,500 --> 02:01:42,119
the call chain that's the this is the

2678
02:01:42,119 --> 02:01:43,500
tree this is the the parent-child

2679
02:01:43,500 --> 02:01:45,900
relationships that tell us uh you know

2680
02:01:45,900 --> 02:01:47,760
whether something makes sense or doesn't

2681
02:01:47,760 --> 02:01:50,159
right like should notepad.exe be

2682
02:01:50,159 --> 02:01:53,820
launching chrome.exe probably not

2683
02:01:53,820 --> 02:01:55,440
um so one of the other things that you

2684
02:01:55,440 --> 02:01:57,719
might look at is uh is the command line

2685
02:01:57,719 --> 02:01:59,400
where it's being run from so you have

2686
02:01:59,400 --> 02:02:01,199
Powershell being run from CIS while 64

2687
02:02:01,199 --> 02:02:03,800
does anybody know what that means that's

2688
02:02:03,800 --> 02:02:06,360
32-bit version of Powershell right

2689
02:02:06,360 --> 02:02:07,920
that's something that might be

2690
02:02:07,920 --> 02:02:09,480
suspicious maybe your admins are running

2691
02:02:09,480 --> 02:02:12,900
32-bit uh for some reason uh Powershell

2692
02:02:12,900 --> 02:02:14,880
but in many cases attackers are doing

2693
02:02:14,880 --> 02:02:16,440
this because they want their their stuff

2694
02:02:16,440 --> 02:02:18,599
to run across uh you know not only

2695
02:02:18,599 --> 02:02:20,580
64-bit systems but be compatible with

2696
02:02:20,580 --> 02:02:22,320
all the 32-bit systems out there and

2697
02:02:22,320 --> 02:02:23,639
whatnot right

2698
02:02:23,639 --> 02:02:25,380
um Okay so

2699
02:02:25,380 --> 02:02:28,679
um what we do one of the things that uh

2700
02:02:28,679 --> 02:02:30,060
when we're teaching this kind of like

2701
02:02:30,060 --> 02:02:32,940
Enterprise threat hunting and an IR type

2702
02:02:32,940 --> 02:02:34,080
stuff is

2703
02:02:34,080 --> 02:02:36,239
uh stacking right like I don't I don't

2704
02:02:36,239 --> 02:02:38,159
want to know just I can't just look at a

2705
02:02:38,159 --> 02:02:39,659
single system in many cases and make

2706
02:02:39,659 --> 02:02:41,099
these kind of determinations what I need

2707
02:02:41,099 --> 02:02:42,780
to know is what does it look like across

2708
02:02:42,780 --> 02:02:45,360
the entire environment because if in the

2709
02:02:45,360 --> 02:02:47,340
entire environment you know this really

2710
02:02:47,340 --> 02:02:48,960
weird looking process is running and

2711
02:02:48,960 --> 02:02:51,239
it's run on every single system

2712
02:02:51,239 --> 02:02:52,920
it's probably unlikely that that thing

2713
02:02:52,920 --> 02:02:55,560
is malicious right because malware by

2714
02:02:55,560 --> 02:02:58,199
definition is kind of um you know it's

2715
02:02:58,199 --> 02:03:00,119
it's infrequent it tries to kind of

2716
02:03:00,119 --> 02:03:01,560
remain hidden it doesn't want to set off

2717
02:03:01,560 --> 02:03:03,599
Flags so it's not going to be everywhere

2718
02:03:03,599 --> 02:03:05,460
for the most part

2719
02:03:05,460 --> 02:03:07,260
um so if I see you know I got 500

2720
02:03:07,260 --> 02:03:09,060
systems and I see a single system

2721
02:03:09,060 --> 02:03:11,580
running a process and it's the only one

2722
02:03:11,580 --> 02:03:14,099
doing it right it's worth my time to

2723
02:03:14,099 --> 02:03:15,179
look into that a little bit further

2724
02:03:15,179 --> 02:03:19,139
especially if it has a weird parent or a

2725
02:03:19,139 --> 02:03:21,119
weird child and so all of those things

2726
02:03:21,119 --> 02:03:23,460
help me to figure out what's going on

2727
02:03:23,460 --> 02:03:25,679
again this is not looking at a snapshot

2728
02:03:25,679 --> 02:03:28,320
and I'm looking at memory okay I'm

2729
02:03:28,320 --> 02:03:29,639
looking at memory I'm just not looking

2730
02:03:29,639 --> 02:03:32,040
at a snapshot of dead memory I'm looking

2731
02:03:32,040 --> 02:03:34,020
at systems that are running as they're

2732
02:03:34,020 --> 02:03:36,239
running across the entire environment

2733
02:03:36,239 --> 02:03:37,860
one of the things that one of the cool

2734
02:03:37,860 --> 02:03:40,139
resources that uh if you're

2735
02:03:40,139 --> 02:03:41,280
um if you're not haven't heard of it

2736
02:03:41,280 --> 02:03:43,080
before that will help you to kind of

2737
02:03:43,080 --> 02:03:44,400
figure out you know what's normal and

2738
02:03:44,400 --> 02:03:46,199
what's not normal about uh you know

2739
02:03:46,199 --> 02:03:48,719
Windows binaries is ecotrail Echo Trail

2740
02:03:48,719 --> 02:03:50,280
is cool because you can you can throw in

2741
02:03:50,280 --> 02:03:52,380
there you come across something you're

2742
02:03:52,380 --> 02:03:53,699
like I'm not sure what this is and

2743
02:03:53,699 --> 02:03:55,860
normally people Google it and then you

2744
02:03:55,860 --> 02:03:57,360
come across these really crazy threads

2745
02:03:57,360 --> 02:03:58,800
and people give you terrible advice and

2746
02:03:58,800 --> 02:04:01,020
none of it makes any sense uh you know

2747
02:04:01,020 --> 02:04:03,239
this is a great ground truth of what

2748
02:04:03,239 --> 02:04:06,000
something is and the stats behind like

2749
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:06,840
uh

2750
02:04:06,840 --> 02:04:10,440
uh it hashes that are normal for this

2751
02:04:10,440 --> 02:04:12,719
binary where it's normally run from so

2752
02:04:12,719 --> 02:04:14,780
you can see like this one for example

2753
02:04:14,780 --> 02:04:18,480
sbchaus.exe is you know obviously most

2754
02:04:18,480 --> 02:04:21,780
often run from C Windows system 32. it

2755
02:04:21,780 --> 02:04:24,659
can be run from CIS wow 64. if it's run

2756
02:04:24,659 --> 02:04:27,900
from anything else it is highly

2757
02:04:27,900 --> 02:04:29,580
suspicious and you should look into it

2758
02:04:29,580 --> 02:04:31,619
so this is just knowing what resources

2759
02:04:31,619 --> 02:04:33,480
are out there but being able to then

2760
02:04:33,480 --> 02:04:36,540
quickly move back and forth between you

2761
02:04:36,540 --> 02:04:37,800
know running this on a live Enterprise

2762
02:04:37,800 --> 02:04:40,199
environment and then you know using

2763
02:04:40,199 --> 02:04:43,260
resources to kind of quickly decide is

2764
02:04:43,260 --> 02:04:45,599
this worth my time or not is something

2765
02:04:45,599 --> 02:04:47,760
that you have to be able to do to be

2766
02:04:47,760 --> 02:04:49,199
able to be effective in an Enterprise

2767
02:04:49,199 --> 02:04:51,060
environment especially when you're doing

2768
02:04:51,060 --> 02:04:52,560
things like threat hunting kind of on

2769
02:04:52,560 --> 02:04:55,139
the normal another great uh and you know

2770
02:04:55,139 --> 02:04:58,619
famous and old uh tried and true uh

2771
02:04:58,619 --> 02:05:01,260
resource is the Sans un evil poster this

2772
02:05:01,260 --> 02:05:02,699
is one that shows you kind of some of

2773
02:05:02,699 --> 02:05:05,060
the you know the core Windows uh

2774
02:05:05,060 --> 02:05:07,380
processes that are going to run they're

2775
02:05:07,380 --> 02:05:09,480
they're sort of expected parents should

2776
02:05:09,480 --> 02:05:11,580
they be running once or you know will

2777
02:05:11,580 --> 02:05:13,380
they have many instances SVC host will

2778
02:05:13,380 --> 02:05:15,420
have many instances lsas will only have

2779
02:05:15,420 --> 02:05:18,239
one all of those things can be used to

2780
02:05:18,239 --> 02:05:19,980
make those determinations when you're

2781
02:05:19,980 --> 02:05:21,659
running sort of scans across the entire

2782
02:05:21,659 --> 02:05:22,860
environment and figuring out what you

2783
02:05:22,860 --> 02:05:24,780
have out there

2784
02:05:24,780 --> 02:05:26,639
uh one of the other things that you can

2785
02:05:26,639 --> 02:05:28,739
do in in uh you know Velociraptors you

2786
02:05:28,739 --> 02:05:31,440
can look for across 5000 systems a very

2787
02:05:31,440 --> 02:05:33,599
just look for a particular process right

2788
02:05:33,599 --> 02:05:35,880
I want to see if uh I want to look for

2789
02:05:35,880 --> 02:05:39,119
SVC host.exe what I didn't do in here

2790
02:05:39,119 --> 02:05:41,280
um I could have was show me anything

2791
02:05:41,280 --> 02:05:42,420
that's running

2792
02:05:42,420 --> 02:05:44,940
um you know out of syswell 64. so I can

2793
02:05:44,940 --> 02:05:47,580
look for I can I can essentially grep or

2794
02:05:47,580 --> 02:05:49,020
or you know put a regular expression and

2795
02:05:49,020 --> 02:05:51,060
say show me any Powershell that's

2796
02:05:51,060 --> 02:05:55,080
running out of the syswell 64 folder in

2797
02:05:55,080 --> 02:05:57,239
my entire environment and what I just

2798
02:05:57,239 --> 02:05:59,760
did you know across 5000 systems was

2799
02:05:59,760 --> 02:06:02,580
find again maybe one maybe a handful of

2800
02:06:02,580 --> 02:06:04,800
systems that I now have to go look at to

2801
02:06:04,800 --> 02:06:06,659
figure out why is it running 32-bit

2802
02:06:06,659 --> 02:06:08,760
version of whatever right again

2803
02:06:08,760 --> 02:06:10,380
something that you cannot do in Dead

2804
02:06:10,380 --> 02:06:12,420
memory analysis something you can

2805
02:06:12,420 --> 02:06:14,040
absolutely do when you're doing live

2806
02:06:14,040 --> 02:06:16,820
memory analysis

2807
02:06:17,460 --> 02:06:20,699
um so uh this is uh showing again just

2808
02:06:20,699 --> 02:06:22,860
across multiple systems uh as an example

2809
02:06:22,860 --> 02:06:24,540
so you can see that uh there's a couple

2810
02:06:24,540 --> 02:06:27,000
of systems that I named uh donkey one

2811
02:06:27,000 --> 02:06:29,940
donkey 2 and then I have a laptop uh so

2812
02:06:29,940 --> 02:06:30,719
again

2813
02:06:30,719 --> 02:06:33,420
um what I'm looking at here is uh where

2814
02:06:33,420 --> 02:06:35,219
this where it's running from so I I only

2815
02:06:35,219 --> 02:06:37,040
looked for just just show me SBC

2816
02:06:37,040 --> 02:06:39,900
host.exe so I'm doing stacking because

2817
02:06:39,900 --> 02:06:44,460
I'm curious uh if system 32 SBC host is

2818
02:06:44,460 --> 02:06:45,780
running across my entire environment or

2819
02:06:45,780 --> 02:06:46,860
do I have anything that you know might

2820
02:06:46,860 --> 02:06:50,040
be CIS well 64. uh luckily I didn't you

2821
02:06:50,040 --> 02:06:51,360
know I'm very luckily because I set

2822
02:06:51,360 --> 02:06:53,219
these up and you know not a whole lot

2823
02:06:53,219 --> 02:06:54,960
was running in them uh but the other

2824
02:06:54,960 --> 02:06:56,460
cool thing that you can see is the

2825
02:06:56,460 --> 02:06:57,900
command line that they were executed

2826
02:06:57,900 --> 02:06:59,520
with because another thing that helps

2827
02:06:59,520 --> 02:07:01,800
you determine sort of the the legitimacy

2828
02:07:01,800 --> 02:07:04,020
of a process is how did that thing start

2829
02:07:04,020 --> 02:07:06,599
up right like it is it is it expected

2830
02:07:06,599 --> 02:07:08,699
Behavior SBC health.exe is always going

2831
02:07:08,699 --> 02:07:10,260
to have this you know Dash K argument

2832
02:07:10,260 --> 02:07:13,260
with whatever uh it's effectively uh

2833
02:07:13,260 --> 02:07:14,340
loaded up

2834
02:07:14,340 --> 02:07:17,159
and uh if I saw something Anonymous that

2835
02:07:17,159 --> 02:07:19,260
might be my clue to go looking at that

2836
02:07:19,260 --> 02:07:20,699
system this is the again the kind of

2837
02:07:20,699 --> 02:07:22,320
things that uh throat hunting is going

2838
02:07:22,320 --> 02:07:23,880
to point you towards

2839
02:07:23,880 --> 02:07:25,860
um that is very difficult to do when

2840
02:07:25,860 --> 02:07:27,719
you're sort of stuck in in the mode of

2841
02:07:27,719 --> 02:07:29,880
of dead memory analysis

2842
02:07:29,880 --> 02:07:31,619
another really cool thing that you can

2843
02:07:31,619 --> 02:07:35,699
do in uh Velociraptor that uh is again

2844
02:07:35,699 --> 02:07:37,199
it's another favorite it's a very kind

2845
02:07:37,199 --> 02:07:40,619
of ninja thing that is often uh only in

2846
02:07:40,619 --> 02:07:42,000
dead memory analysis is looking for

2847
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:43,320
mutants

2848
02:07:43,320 --> 02:07:46,380
so mutants are uh

2849
02:07:46,380 --> 02:07:48,540
when a virus doesn't want to it has

2850
02:07:48,540 --> 02:07:51,659
already infected a system and it doesn't

2851
02:07:51,659 --> 02:07:53,099
want to try and reinfect a system

2852
02:07:53,099 --> 02:07:54,780
because again malware is always going to

2853
02:07:54,780 --> 02:07:58,080
be uh it's it's it's frustrating the

2854
02:07:58,080 --> 02:07:59,099
system it's right it's doing things it's

2855
02:07:59,099 --> 02:08:00,239
not supposed to do it's trying things

2856
02:08:00,239 --> 02:08:01,739
it's not supposed to so things can get

2857
02:08:01,739 --> 02:08:03,239
things can crash

2858
02:08:03,239 --> 02:08:04,980
um as maybe it throws a flag and an

2859
02:08:04,980 --> 02:08:07,619
alert so on and so forth so if I'm

2860
02:08:07,619 --> 02:08:09,119
putting malware in a system I don't want

2861
02:08:09,119 --> 02:08:10,739
to continue to try to reinfect that

2862
02:08:10,739 --> 02:08:12,360
system over and over and over so what

2863
02:08:12,360 --> 02:08:13,619
I'm going to do is essentially tattoo

2864
02:08:13,619 --> 02:08:16,040
that system and say hey I'm here already

2865
02:08:16,040 --> 02:08:19,139
so if you know that same malware comes

2866
02:08:19,139 --> 02:08:20,460
to the system and checks and says oh

2867
02:08:20,460 --> 02:08:21,840
look I've already been here I'm already

2868
02:08:21,840 --> 02:08:24,179
here then I'm not going to try and you

2869
02:08:24,179 --> 02:08:25,679
know reinfect the system

2870
02:08:25,679 --> 02:08:28,619
I'm gonna go on my way well uh this is a

2871
02:08:28,619 --> 02:08:29,880
great this is a great way to search for

2872
02:08:29,880 --> 02:08:32,280
iocs for known mutants out there now

2873
02:08:32,280 --> 02:08:34,619
this one is uh is a very um you know

2874
02:08:34,619 --> 02:08:36,719
particularly evil one it's uh the Cyber

2875
02:08:36,719 --> 02:08:38,159
donkey mutex

2876
02:08:38,159 --> 02:08:39,960
kid in it's not so don't don't go in

2877
02:08:39,960 --> 02:08:41,580
your environment and look for that

2878
02:08:41,580 --> 02:08:44,099
that's that's just my ioc uh but I

2879
02:08:44,099 --> 02:08:46,260
actually I actually um I went into a

2880
02:08:46,260 --> 02:08:48,480
system and I loaded my own mutant so

2881
02:08:48,480 --> 02:08:49,860
that I could come back and demonstrate

2882
02:08:49,860 --> 02:08:52,380
uh that uh you know I could actually

2883
02:08:52,380 --> 02:08:54,179
effectively search for I hunted across

2884
02:08:54,179 --> 02:08:55,440
all the systems and of course I only had

2885
02:08:55,440 --> 02:08:56,580
it on one

2886
02:08:56,580 --> 02:08:58,440
uh but if you hunted across you know for

2887
02:08:58,440 --> 02:09:00,000
your 5000 systems looking for these

2888
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:01,980
well-known mutants and you come up with

2889
02:09:01,980 --> 02:09:03,780
one of them then oh my gosh right like

2890
02:09:03,780 --> 02:09:05,880
you gotta go look at that system

2891
02:09:05,880 --> 02:09:08,159
uh how am I doing on time 128 okay I'm

2892
02:09:08,159 --> 02:09:11,219
good uh so reflective dll injection this

2893
02:09:11,219 --> 02:09:14,159
is a this is a very old technique it's

2894
02:09:14,159 --> 02:09:15,540
one that's still around it's the one

2895
02:09:15,540 --> 02:09:18,420
that's still you know occurs

2896
02:09:18,420 --> 02:09:19,920
um and by the way

2897
02:09:19,920 --> 02:09:22,440
um some of these things are that I uh I

2898
02:09:22,440 --> 02:09:24,840
I did all of these for the talk so these

2899
02:09:24,840 --> 02:09:26,219
are all kind of uh all of these

2900
02:09:26,219 --> 02:09:27,480
snapshots are actually things that I did

2901
02:09:27,480 --> 02:09:28,739
specifically

2902
02:09:28,739 --> 02:09:30,599
um for this talk then I actually have

2903
02:09:30,599 --> 02:09:32,460
some some links that at the end of the

2904
02:09:32,460 --> 02:09:34,920
talk I'm going to um I'm gonna post the

2905
02:09:34,920 --> 02:09:37,020
slides for everybody I have links and

2906
02:09:37,020 --> 02:09:39,119
many of these the images or things like

2907
02:09:39,119 --> 02:09:41,099
where it says video walkthrough for

2908
02:09:41,099 --> 02:09:43,380
anybody I purposefully did this in in a

2909
02:09:43,380 --> 02:09:45,900
small lab environment I just on VMware

2910
02:09:45,900 --> 02:09:49,080
on my own laptop uh for anybody who is a

2911
02:09:49,080 --> 02:09:50,699
Defender that's looking to kind of do

2912
02:09:50,699 --> 02:09:52,080
their own experimentation to get a

2913
02:09:52,080 --> 02:09:53,820
little bit of of experience with you can

2914
02:09:53,820 --> 02:09:55,199
set up your own Velociraptor did I

2915
02:09:55,199 --> 02:09:56,520
mention it's open source and free I

2916
02:09:56,520 --> 02:09:57,960
don't think I did

2917
02:09:57,960 --> 02:10:00,420
um you can go download it anybody can uh

2918
02:10:00,420 --> 02:10:02,699
but uh so this is me using uh this you

2919
02:10:02,699 --> 02:10:04,679
know the old tried and true Metasploit

2920
02:10:04,679 --> 02:10:08,099
interpreter too so I get an interpreter

2921
02:10:08,099 --> 02:10:10,980
session and then I use the very old I

2922
02:10:10,980 --> 02:10:13,080
think it's like almost a decade old at

2923
02:10:13,080 --> 02:10:15,560
this point Steven fewer original

2924
02:10:15,560 --> 02:10:18,599
reflective dll injection which again all

2925
02:10:18,599 --> 02:10:19,920
the links are in there in an entire

2926
02:10:19,920 --> 02:10:21,420
video walkthrough that will help you do

2927
02:10:21,420 --> 02:10:24,360
it yourself so I performed dll injection

2928
02:10:24,360 --> 02:10:27,000
to uh you know show that we could come

2929
02:10:27,000 --> 02:10:28,679
back and again with dead member analysis

2930
02:10:28,679 --> 02:10:30,540
this is a very well known that's very

2931
02:10:30,540 --> 02:10:33,300
easy to come in detect these things

2932
02:10:33,300 --> 02:10:35,219
um but

2933
02:10:35,219 --> 02:10:36,599
what if you want to do it across many

2934
02:10:36,599 --> 02:10:38,219
systems like what if I don't know if I

2935
02:10:38,219 --> 02:10:40,860
have a dll injection I can't I can't

2936
02:10:40,860 --> 02:10:42,480
walk through manually every single one

2937
02:10:42,480 --> 02:10:45,000
of these systems but I can use things

2938
02:10:45,000 --> 02:10:47,280
that look at a live system and give me

2939
02:10:47,280 --> 02:10:48,719
Immediate you know feedback as to

2940
02:10:48,719 --> 02:10:51,119
whether or not I'm dealing with that

2941
02:10:51,119 --> 02:10:53,340
again this is actually uh this is is not

2942
02:10:53,340 --> 02:10:55,860
new stuff uh 2017 2018 something like

2943
02:10:55,860 --> 02:10:58,320
that uh Jared Atkinson and uh Joe

2944
02:10:58,320 --> 02:11:02,219
DeSimone at a Sans uh Summit

2945
02:11:02,219 --> 02:11:04,560
uh it came up with uh first of all It

2946
02:11:04,560 --> 02:11:06,000
came it was a great talk talking about

2947
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:08,340
reflective dll injection how to catch it

2948
02:11:08,340 --> 02:11:09,840
and all that stuff looking for a more

2949
02:11:09,840 --> 02:11:11,639
scalable way to do that

2950
02:11:11,639 --> 02:11:13,440
they'd produce this Powershell script

2951
02:11:13,440 --> 02:11:15,239
called get injected thread

2952
02:11:15,239 --> 02:11:17,460
it's phenomenal okay you can run this on

2953
02:11:17,460 --> 02:11:19,080
a system and it'll immediately tell you

2954
02:11:19,080 --> 02:11:21,599
it looks for the markers of uh of

2955
02:11:21,599 --> 02:11:23,639
injected threads so uh because

2956
02:11:23,639 --> 02:11:25,500
effectively what that's happening is uh

2957
02:11:25,500 --> 02:11:26,940
in um

2958
02:11:26,940 --> 02:11:28,800
when a reflective dll injection is

2959
02:11:28,800 --> 02:11:31,500
occurring you know a process cat grabs a

2960
02:11:31,500 --> 02:11:34,320
victim process uses a couple of apis to

2961
02:11:34,320 --> 02:11:36,960
say hey I need you to you know allocate

2962
02:11:36,960 --> 02:11:38,639
some memory create a remote thread and

2963
02:11:38,639 --> 02:11:41,040
execute this and you know now I have my

2964
02:11:41,040 --> 02:11:41,880
own

2965
02:11:41,880 --> 02:11:44,400
bad code executed in you know some

2966
02:11:44,400 --> 02:11:46,320
victim process somewhere or whatever and

2967
02:11:46,320 --> 02:11:47,820
so effectively all they did was say hey

2968
02:11:47,820 --> 02:11:50,159
we can what we're doing with dead member

2969
02:11:50,159 --> 02:11:51,840
analysis looking at these memory

2970
02:11:51,840 --> 02:11:53,760
sections and looking for evidence or

2971
02:11:53,760 --> 02:11:56,460
markers of uh you know Shell Code in

2972
02:11:56,460 --> 02:11:59,219
there why can't we just make a a you

2973
02:11:59,219 --> 02:12:01,440
know Powershell script to do that on the

2974
02:12:01,440 --> 02:12:03,000
system live like you know why wait for

2975
02:12:03,000 --> 02:12:04,619
dead man everyone else's so this is a

2976
02:12:04,619 --> 02:12:07,199
phenomenal tool for you to if you can

2977
02:12:07,199 --> 02:12:09,000
test you want to test it out you know go

2978
02:12:09,000 --> 02:12:12,260
use uh your own uh you know VM instance

2979
02:12:12,260 --> 02:12:15,179
Metasploit or whatever you want to do

2980
02:12:15,179 --> 02:12:16,440
um again I gave you the walkthrough to

2981
02:12:16,440 --> 02:12:18,060
do that then go and use the script and

2982
02:12:18,060 --> 02:12:19,739
just see how easy it is

2983
02:12:19,739 --> 02:12:23,099
uh a really cool plug for uh it's Eric

2984
02:12:23,099 --> 02:12:25,320
capuano he's uh he's our CTO at Recon

2985
02:12:25,320 --> 02:12:27,480
infosec he's a guy that has been a very

2986
02:12:27,480 --> 02:12:29,159
good close friend of mine for over a

2987
02:12:29,159 --> 02:12:31,020
decade in fact him and I both met in the

2988
02:12:31,020 --> 02:12:32,219
Air Force we both came into the same

2989
02:12:32,219 --> 02:12:34,139
cyber unit and kind of got our starts at

2990
02:12:34,139 --> 02:12:36,480
the same time uh has a phenomenal video

2991
02:12:36,480 --> 02:12:39,900
on our on our Recon YouTube uh page

2992
02:12:39,900 --> 02:12:43,980
about how uh at a military exercise he

2993
02:12:43,980 --> 02:12:47,580
leveraged Velociraptor to leverage get

2994
02:12:47,580 --> 02:12:49,920
injected thread to run it acrossing all

2995
02:12:49,920 --> 02:12:52,560
the systems and find the red teamers uh

2996
02:12:52,560 --> 02:12:55,380
who had their you know processes uh or

2997
02:12:55,380 --> 02:12:57,119
had their code rather running in you

2998
02:12:57,119 --> 02:12:58,920
know various different processes

2999
02:12:58,920 --> 02:13:02,219
not only found them but then uh was able

3000
02:13:02,219 --> 02:13:04,679
to kill just the threads that were

3001
02:13:04,679 --> 02:13:07,560
running in that process right so because

3002
02:13:07,560 --> 02:13:09,060
sometimes you know those things are are

3003
02:13:09,060 --> 02:13:11,099
injected into a process that you can't

3004
02:13:11,099 --> 02:13:12,300
kill or you don't want to kill as you

3005
02:13:12,300 --> 02:13:13,860
crash the system and or whatever it is

3006
02:13:13,860 --> 02:13:16,079
right uh so if you watch the uh the

3007
02:13:16,079 --> 02:13:18,480
video he'll actually walk you through

3008
02:13:18,480 --> 02:13:21,840
um very very cool uh mind-blowing

3009
02:13:21,840 --> 02:13:23,280
technique you know the the red team

3010
02:13:23,280 --> 02:13:24,719
couldn't believe what the heck was

3011
02:13:24,719 --> 02:13:27,179
happening uh where all your I mean it's

3012
02:13:27,179 --> 02:13:29,040
very simple from you know once you know

3013
02:13:29,040 --> 02:13:30,540
how to do this and you have the right

3014
02:13:30,540 --> 02:13:32,880
tools uh you know you find which ones

3015
02:13:32,880 --> 02:13:35,420
are are effectively injected with code

3016
02:13:35,420 --> 02:13:38,460
then grab the particular thread and just

3017
02:13:38,460 --> 02:13:40,199
basically kill that one so it's like

3018
02:13:40,199 --> 02:13:42,480
sniping you know just the the bad guys

3019
02:13:42,480 --> 02:13:45,599
uh threat and then the you know process

3020
02:13:45,599 --> 02:13:48,659
continues to run uh without any issue so

3021
02:13:48,659 --> 02:13:51,119
another again links on there it's a

3022
02:13:51,119 --> 02:13:53,460
great video uh walkthrough

3023
02:13:53,460 --> 02:13:55,500
um to kind of see how that works

3024
02:13:55,500 --> 02:13:57,300
but again there's there's there's so

3025
02:13:57,300 --> 02:13:58,679
many different ways to kind of approach

3026
02:13:58,679 --> 02:14:01,619
this uh malfinder malfind is a very

3027
02:14:01,619 --> 02:14:04,679
popular volatility plug-in that also

3028
02:14:04,679 --> 02:14:06,360
happens to be something that we can run

3029
02:14:06,360 --> 02:14:09,239
it's already built into a velociraptor

3030
02:14:09,239 --> 02:14:11,520
uh one of the things that uh I'd love to

3031
02:14:11,520 --> 02:14:12,840
give some credit here is a guy named

3032
02:14:12,840 --> 02:14:15,000
Matt Greene uh so there's there's

3033
02:14:15,000 --> 02:14:16,440
Velociraptor artifacts and then there's

3034
02:14:16,440 --> 02:14:18,540
some kind of uh Community exchange

3035
02:14:18,540 --> 02:14:20,420
artifacts and stuff and uh so this guy

3036
02:14:20,420 --> 02:14:24,060
works now rapid7 Velociraptor he believe

3037
02:14:24,060 --> 02:14:25,920
he works for Rapid seven

3038
02:14:25,920 --> 02:14:27,599
um but uh him and I were talking last

3039
02:14:27,599 --> 02:14:29,880
week uh and you know he's he's produced

3040
02:14:29,880 --> 02:14:31,619
a lot of really really good artifacts

3041
02:14:31,619 --> 02:14:33,540
that that just make this all magic and

3042
02:14:33,540 --> 02:14:35,159
so um anyway so I wanted to give the guy

3043
02:14:35,159 --> 02:14:38,219
some credit uh on that so malfein is one

3044
02:14:38,219 --> 02:14:39,840
of the ones that he brought in like

3045
02:14:39,840 --> 02:14:41,760
again this is a this is a this is a

3046
02:14:41,760 --> 02:14:42,840
great it's the greatest hit in

3047
02:14:42,840 --> 02:14:44,579
volatility why not make this a thing

3048
02:14:44,579 --> 02:14:47,219
that we can do with live systems so so I

3049
02:14:47,219 --> 02:14:49,619
did that uh after I you know ran my own

3050
02:14:49,619 --> 02:14:51,840
reflective code injection I actually ran

3051
02:14:51,840 --> 02:14:53,880
malfun against my whatever five systems

3052
02:14:53,880 --> 02:14:55,920
I had at the point at the time and and

3053
02:14:55,920 --> 02:14:57,840
immediately what you see is

3054
02:14:57,840 --> 02:15:00,480
is just this magical exactly what you'd

3055
02:15:00,480 --> 02:15:02,340
expect from volatility except now it's

3056
02:15:02,340 --> 02:15:04,020
going across multiple systems and it's

3057
02:15:04,020 --> 02:15:06,420
showing me hey guess what I found uh you

3058
02:15:06,420 --> 02:15:08,460
know this explore.exe that has uh you

3059
02:15:08,460 --> 02:15:11,040
know read write execute permissions and

3060
02:15:11,040 --> 02:15:14,520
then when you if you look at the uh the

3061
02:15:14,520 --> 02:15:16,139
column right under started you can see

3062
02:15:16,139 --> 02:15:17,940
kind of where it says MZ so a

3063
02:15:17,940 --> 02:15:19,260
velociraptor will allow you to click

3064
02:15:19,260 --> 02:15:21,420
that and actually look at the data that

3065
02:15:21,420 --> 02:15:24,119
it's looking at and effectively saying

3066
02:15:24,119 --> 02:15:25,920
hey I think there's something here and

3067
02:15:25,920 --> 02:15:27,960
immediately you see the MZ which is the

3068
02:15:27,960 --> 02:15:30,300
uh is a portable header uh execute or

3069
02:15:30,300 --> 02:15:33,719
portable executable header right so the

3070
02:15:33,719 --> 02:15:35,820
uh we

3071
02:15:35,820 --> 02:15:38,040
just effectively looked across multiple

3072
02:15:38,040 --> 02:15:40,619
systems ran a famous volatility plug-in

3073
02:15:40,619 --> 02:15:43,860
thank you oh great I gotta I gotta go a

3074
02:15:43,860 --> 02:15:46,020
little faster than no more jokes uh

3075
02:15:46,020 --> 02:15:49,199
except for that one okay so uh so I I

3076
02:15:49,199 --> 02:15:50,940
think we ran this across many systems

3077
02:15:50,940 --> 02:15:53,579
immediately uh found memory sections

3078
02:15:53,579 --> 02:15:55,860
that had you know uh potential shell

3079
02:15:55,860 --> 02:15:57,840
code according to the tool was able to

3080
02:15:57,840 --> 02:16:00,000
go look at that and confirm yes they do

3081
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:02,940
magic right magic this is live systems

3082
02:16:02,940 --> 02:16:04,860
okay if somebody injects something five

3083
02:16:04,860 --> 02:16:06,239
seconds later and I run it again I'm

3084
02:16:06,239 --> 02:16:07,860
Gonna Catch It you know if I snapshot

3085
02:16:07,860 --> 02:16:09,659
that and then I go look at it and I'm

3086
02:16:09,659 --> 02:16:10,860
like nope this one's cleaned and then

3087
02:16:10,860 --> 02:16:11,940
they run it five seconds after I

3088
02:16:11,940 --> 02:16:13,800
snapshot it guess what I'll never know

3089
02:16:13,800 --> 02:16:15,599
right well you know what I mean

3090
02:16:15,599 --> 02:16:16,860
um okay so let me let me show you a

3091
02:16:16,860 --> 02:16:18,300
couple of things though to kind of get

3092
02:16:18,300 --> 02:16:20,400
us a little bit more up to Modern Times

3093
02:16:20,400 --> 02:16:22,440
and this is stuff that's not all that

3094
02:16:22,440 --> 02:16:24,239
old by the way some of this is fairly

3095
02:16:24,239 --> 02:16:25,800
cut an edge

3096
02:16:25,800 --> 02:16:28,199
um so uh the guy named Adam Chester a

3097
02:16:28,199 --> 02:16:30,840
fantastic blog a few years ago saying oh

3098
02:16:30,840 --> 02:16:32,280
hey get injected thread is pretty cool

3099
02:16:32,280 --> 02:16:34,799
but uh yeah there's probably a way to

3100
02:16:34,799 --> 02:16:36,780
defeat that this blog goes through his

3101
02:16:36,780 --> 02:16:38,099
kind of you know

3102
02:16:38,099 --> 02:16:40,740
um thinking and then eventually

3103
02:16:40,740 --> 02:16:42,660
um some pocs for you know yeah actually

3104
02:16:42,660 --> 02:16:43,978
I could

3105
02:16:43,978 --> 02:16:46,439
um I could inject into processes and

3106
02:16:46,439 --> 02:16:48,898
avoid being caught by get injected

3107
02:16:48,898 --> 02:16:51,120
thread super cool a couple of different

3108
02:16:51,120 --> 02:16:52,978
methods most of them are actually pretty

3109
02:16:52,978 --> 02:16:54,599
easy and get caught by security tools

3110
02:16:54,599 --> 02:16:57,898
one of the ones that I uh here uh that's

3111
02:16:57,898 --> 02:16:59,340
kind of um

3112
02:16:59,340 --> 02:17:02,040
it is tough to to detect and it's going

3113
02:17:02,040 --> 02:17:03,780
to get past get injected threads into

3114
02:17:03,780 --> 02:17:05,820
actually you know pretty pretty ninja is

3115
02:17:05,820 --> 02:17:08,160
uh is what we call a trampoline so

3116
02:17:08,160 --> 02:17:09,599
what we're doing we're looking at these

3117
02:17:09,599 --> 02:17:11,160
these memory sections is we're we're

3118
02:17:11,160 --> 02:17:13,260
saying hey um you know in these memory

3119
02:17:13,260 --> 02:17:16,260
sections that uh belong to a process is

3120
02:17:16,260 --> 02:17:17,519
there any evidence of Shell Code in

3121
02:17:17,519 --> 02:17:19,019
there well obviously that's you're going

3122
02:17:19,019 --> 02:17:21,000
to see things like um you know the MZ

3123
02:17:21,000 --> 02:17:22,200
header or you're going to see things

3124
02:17:22,200 --> 02:17:24,898
like if you're looking at uh uh the um

3125
02:17:24,898 --> 02:17:27,599
uh the code itself you might see like uh

3126
02:17:27,599 --> 02:17:29,340
the the function prologue of assembly

3127
02:17:29,340 --> 02:17:30,978
and that will tell you like hey

3128
02:17:30,978 --> 02:17:33,240
basically a function's coming right so

3129
02:17:33,240 --> 02:17:35,340
start allocating memory and and you know

3130
02:17:35,340 --> 02:17:37,500
get ready for it well what this is doing

3131
02:17:37,500 --> 02:17:39,299
is saying hey in those in those first

3132
02:17:39,299 --> 02:17:40,859
memory sections as soon at the start

3133
02:17:40,859 --> 02:17:42,780
address I need you to basically jump out

3134
02:17:42,780 --> 02:17:44,700
of there you know get out of there and

3135
02:17:44,700 --> 02:17:46,500
go to a point where they're not going to

3136
02:17:46,500 --> 02:17:47,879
see it because all we're looking at is I

3137
02:17:47,879 --> 02:17:49,138
think the first 64 bytes or something

3138
02:17:49,138 --> 02:17:51,000
like that right so basically get out of

3139
02:17:51,000 --> 02:17:51,959
there

3140
02:17:51,959 --> 02:17:53,939
um that's that's uh that's one method

3141
02:17:53,939 --> 02:17:55,978
another one is is using another API

3142
02:17:55,978 --> 02:17:57,799
called set thread context which is hey

3143
02:17:57,799 --> 02:18:00,599
uh I want you to basically change the

3144
02:18:00,599 --> 02:18:02,160
address to

3145
02:18:02,160 --> 02:18:05,879
uh an area where the the uh code is

3146
02:18:05,879 --> 02:18:07,679
actually mapped because another thing

3147
02:18:07,679 --> 02:18:09,599
that we're looking for is is what we uh

3148
02:18:09,599 --> 02:18:13,439
call a unmapped uh uh code so reflective

3149
02:18:13,439 --> 02:18:15,478
code injection is running code not from

3150
02:18:15,478 --> 02:18:17,760
disk but from memory right so that means

3151
02:18:17,760 --> 02:18:19,080
it's not Matt to disk but it's not

3152
02:18:19,080 --> 02:18:20,700
supposed to be like that Windows is not

3153
02:18:20,700 --> 02:18:22,799
really supposed to allow that

3154
02:18:22,799 --> 02:18:24,959
um so what we're looking at is if a a

3155
02:18:24,959 --> 02:18:26,638
particular section says you know hey

3156
02:18:26,638 --> 02:18:28,859
there's nothing here then that's highly

3157
02:18:28,859 --> 02:18:30,420
suspicious so all this is doing is

3158
02:18:30,420 --> 02:18:31,320
saying

3159
02:18:31,320 --> 02:18:34,019
um I want you to change that to point to

3160
02:18:34,019 --> 02:18:35,700
a location where there is something so

3161
02:18:35,700 --> 02:18:38,398
that when the guy the good guys whatever

3162
02:18:38,398 --> 02:18:40,260
the blue team are doing their checks

3163
02:18:40,260 --> 02:18:42,179
well they're going to see that yes there

3164
02:18:42,179 --> 02:18:43,740
is something there and then they're you

3165
02:18:43,740 --> 02:18:44,700
know they're going to go on with their

3166
02:18:44,700 --> 02:18:47,040
day okay so

3167
02:18:47,040 --> 02:18:49,439
um luckily this is we look at the date

3168
02:18:49,439 --> 02:18:51,599
this is just in November okay this is

3169
02:18:51,599 --> 02:18:54,120
just fairly recent a guy named John

3170
02:18:54,120 --> 02:18:56,580
Olman wrote a uh an article called uh

3171
02:18:56,580 --> 02:18:59,280
hey get injected thread X like this is

3172
02:18:59,280 --> 02:19:01,379
the this is the next step of being able

3173
02:19:01,379 --> 02:19:02,280
to

3174
02:19:02,280 --> 02:19:04,920
find things like trampolines and and

3175
02:19:04,920 --> 02:19:06,599
whatnot that are getting around get

3176
02:19:06,599 --> 02:19:09,240
injected thread uh there is a so there's

3177
02:19:09,240 --> 02:19:10,558
already a tool out there again this is

3178
02:19:10,558 --> 02:19:12,540
something again you can take

3179
02:19:12,540 --> 02:19:14,160
um and you can run through Velociraptor

3180
02:19:14,160 --> 02:19:16,740
sort of manually you know the guy Matt

3181
02:19:16,740 --> 02:19:18,240
Green I was talking about earlier we

3182
02:19:18,240 --> 02:19:20,580
were just talking last week he is uh

3183
02:19:20,580 --> 02:19:22,439
they're working on basically adding

3184
02:19:22,439 --> 02:19:24,840
another artifact for this specific tool

3185
02:19:24,840 --> 02:19:27,420
to make that a part of velociraptor as

3186
02:19:27,420 --> 02:19:29,519
well so that you know um that's

3187
02:19:29,519 --> 02:19:32,099
something that uh you know we now have

3188
02:19:32,099 --> 02:19:34,558
the way to catch people getting around

3189
02:19:34,558 --> 02:19:37,620
the original get injected thread uh tool

3190
02:19:37,620 --> 02:19:38,420
okay

3191
02:19:38,420 --> 02:19:42,179
now that's not enough though okay so one

3192
02:19:42,179 --> 02:19:43,859
of the things that that is absolutely

3193
02:19:43,859 --> 02:19:47,700
necessary is uh to recognize that even

3194
02:19:47,700 --> 02:19:49,800
using Velociraptor we're still looking

3195
02:19:49,800 --> 02:19:51,479
at sort of snapshots in time even if we

3196
02:19:51,479 --> 02:19:52,979
keep running it right like we're looking

3197
02:19:52,979 --> 02:19:54,420
at it live but we're still kind of

3198
02:19:54,420 --> 02:19:56,399
looking at snapshots in time and if we

3199
02:19:56,399 --> 02:19:57,540
don't catch something that's run into

3200
02:19:57,540 --> 02:19:59,040
memory at the time that's run in memory

3201
02:19:59,040 --> 02:20:00,960
well we're gonna have a hard time right

3202
02:20:00,960 --> 02:20:04,800
so uh part of the the other reason why I

3203
02:20:04,800 --> 02:20:06,899
I think we need to is this isn't just a

3204
02:20:06,899 --> 02:20:08,340
dead memory analysis problem but this is

3205
02:20:08,340 --> 02:20:10,979
a problem of thinking that

3206
02:20:10,979 --> 02:20:13,920
um you know with without putting the

3207
02:20:13,920 --> 02:20:16,380
right time and resources into Telemetry

3208
02:20:16,380 --> 02:20:18,780
like all of this stuff many of these

3209
02:20:18,780 --> 02:20:20,280
things are going to be in you know

3210
02:20:20,280 --> 02:20:22,380
system on sysmon is a fantastic tool if

3211
02:20:22,380 --> 02:20:24,500
you haven't uh it's it's a Microsoft uh

3212
02:20:24,500 --> 02:20:27,840
tool that gives us amazing Telemetry

3213
02:20:27,840 --> 02:20:29,580
about you know when files are created

3214
02:20:29,580 --> 02:20:31,020
and network connections and so on and so

3215
02:20:31,020 --> 02:20:32,939
forth and one of the great uh events

3216
02:20:32,939 --> 02:20:34,800
that it has is tracking create remote

3217
02:20:34,800 --> 02:20:36,660
threads it's looking for these things

3218
02:20:36,660 --> 02:20:39,600
that uh when all this is happening it's

3219
02:20:39,600 --> 02:20:42,780
basically tracking the the uh one of the

3220
02:20:42,780 --> 02:20:44,939
API calls that is needed for all this

3221
02:20:44,939 --> 02:20:48,359
and so if you didn't happen to catch a

3222
02:20:48,359 --> 02:20:50,819
snapshot a you know a memory dump or if

3223
02:20:50,819 --> 02:20:52,260
you didn't happen to run a velociraptor

3224
02:20:52,260 --> 02:20:54,479
hunt at that proper time

3225
02:20:54,479 --> 02:20:56,580
well guess what you might have sysmon

3226
02:20:56,580 --> 02:20:58,620
logs that show you that this was

3227
02:20:58,620 --> 02:21:00,240
happening at some point

3228
02:21:00,240 --> 02:21:01,859
um you can even use Velociraptor by the

3229
02:21:01,859 --> 02:21:03,899
way to hunt through sysmon logs across

3230
02:21:03,899 --> 02:21:06,420
every you know uh system and look for

3231
02:21:06,420 --> 02:21:09,000
you know just create remote thread um so

3232
02:21:09,000 --> 02:21:11,580
it's a it's a it's a beautiful thing

3233
02:21:11,580 --> 02:21:15,120
um Olaf Hartong uh is a guy that uh we

3234
02:21:15,120 --> 02:21:17,340
know well he he joins us usually every

3235
02:21:17,340 --> 02:21:19,140
Thursday on the webcast that we do but

3236
02:21:19,140 --> 02:21:21,899
he's got an awesome awesome config for

3237
02:21:21,899 --> 02:21:24,420
sysmon uh when I put this up uh you'll

3238
02:21:24,420 --> 02:21:26,220
be able to click on that link this is

3239
02:21:26,220 --> 02:21:28,020
actually pretty new I I stumbled upon it

3240
02:21:28,020 --> 02:21:30,060
like it's just a couple of weeks old he

3241
02:21:30,060 --> 02:21:31,939
put out a new video that walks through

3242
02:21:31,939 --> 02:21:34,680
sysmon like I mean this guy's brilliant

3243
02:21:34,680 --> 02:21:36,180
when it comes to system on he's the man

3244
02:21:36,180 --> 02:21:38,540
so he uh his video walks through sysmon

3245
02:21:38,540 --> 02:21:42,000
uh you know the the the config but like

3246
02:21:42,000 --> 02:21:43,260
you know how it works and things that

3247
02:21:43,260 --> 02:21:45,240
you can produce and and even you know

3248
02:21:45,240 --> 02:21:46,740
talking about tuning efforts and stuff

3249
02:21:46,740 --> 02:21:48,180
like that so if you're if you're curious

3250
02:21:48,180 --> 02:21:49,439
about that that's something I would

3251
02:21:49,439 --> 02:21:51,060
really consider getting into your

3252
02:21:51,060 --> 02:21:52,380
environment and use this as a resource

3253
02:21:52,380 --> 02:21:54,899
to maybe get you started

3254
02:21:54,899 --> 02:21:58,080
um okay so this is an example of of uh I

3255
02:21:58,080 --> 02:21:59,460
remember when I ran that tool and I did

3256
02:21:59,460 --> 02:22:01,439
the dll injection I went back and I you

3257
02:22:01,439 --> 02:22:03,479
know was able to see look at that I have

3258
02:22:03,479 --> 02:22:06,000
uh CIS monologues of uh of that thing

3259
02:22:06,000 --> 02:22:07,500
happening at some point

3260
02:22:07,500 --> 02:22:09,359
uh and then I have uh network

3261
02:22:09,359 --> 02:22:11,580
connections uh of course

3262
02:22:11,580 --> 02:22:14,280
um you know that will also show me

3263
02:22:14,280 --> 02:22:15,600
um you know what's going on from a from

3264
02:22:15,600 --> 02:22:17,640
a network standpoint uh when I'm doing

3265
02:22:17,640 --> 02:22:20,760
all this uh uh with uh you know these

3266
02:22:20,760 --> 02:22:22,979
malicious tools

3267
02:22:22,979 --> 02:22:25,080
okay

3268
02:22:25,080 --> 02:22:28,039
how much time I I

3269
02:22:28,319 --> 02:22:30,060
seven minutes okay

3270
02:22:30,060 --> 02:22:33,180
I can do it man all right great okay so

3271
02:22:33,180 --> 02:22:35,160
here's the here's the uh the next thing

3272
02:22:35,160 --> 02:22:36,840
that's kind of uh necessary to

3273
02:22:36,840 --> 02:22:39,120
understand uh you know from a defender's

3274
02:22:39,120 --> 02:22:40,260
standpoint

3275
02:22:40,260 --> 02:22:43,800
red teamers attackers okay they also

3276
02:22:43,800 --> 02:22:46,380
know that it's not feasible to do things

3277
02:22:46,380 --> 02:22:48,720
manually to do things you know in the

3278
02:22:48,720 --> 02:22:50,580
you know kind of the same steps over and

3279
02:22:50,580 --> 02:22:51,780
over and over and over so what do they

3280
02:22:51,780 --> 02:22:54,420
do well they're scaling their side of of

3281
02:22:54,420 --> 02:22:56,399
the of the thing too right their side of

3282
02:22:56,399 --> 02:22:58,760
the of the whatever you call it the game

3283
02:22:58,760 --> 02:23:02,160
so things like Cobalt strike uh I think

3284
02:23:02,160 --> 02:23:04,200
I I can't remember I wish I'd remember

3285
02:23:04,200 --> 02:23:06,780
the resource but um whatever resource

3286
02:23:06,780 --> 02:23:08,160
I'll find it and then I'll maybe I'll

3287
02:23:08,160 --> 02:23:09,899
include it in the slides or whatever uh

3288
02:23:09,899 --> 02:23:11,640
was showing that uh in the past couple

3289
02:23:11,640 --> 02:23:15,720
of years uh I think ransomware there's a

3290
02:23:15,720 --> 02:23:18,000
so ransomware attacks 66 of rents were

3291
02:23:18,000 --> 02:23:20,340
attacked uh they're using Cobalt strike

3292
02:23:20,340 --> 02:23:21,380
okay

3293
02:23:21,380 --> 02:23:23,700
they're recognizing that they need to

3294
02:23:23,700 --> 02:23:25,740
scale so that gives us a beautiful

3295
02:23:25,740 --> 02:23:29,100
opportunity to find uh you know things

3296
02:23:29,100 --> 02:23:31,080
like evidence of cobalt strike for

3297
02:23:31,080 --> 02:23:32,640
example doing all of these things

3298
02:23:32,640 --> 02:23:34,140
because Cobalt strike is going to do all

3299
02:23:34,140 --> 02:23:36,840
the the magic you know for the attackers

3300
02:23:36,840 --> 02:23:38,340
in in many you know ways where it's

3301
02:23:38,340 --> 02:23:40,080
gonna it's gonna try and hide you know

3302
02:23:40,080 --> 02:23:41,280
from The Defenders it's going to try and

3303
02:23:41,280 --> 02:23:42,660
hide itself in memory it's going to do

3304
02:23:42,660 --> 02:23:44,399
the things like you know stomping the

3305
02:23:44,399 --> 02:23:47,100
the portable executable header and you

3306
02:23:47,100 --> 02:23:48,600
know moving that outside of that 64

3307
02:23:48,600 --> 02:23:50,819
bytes and all of those other things

3308
02:23:50,819 --> 02:23:52,439
um which makes it kind of hard for us to

3309
02:23:52,439 --> 02:23:53,399
do all the things that we were just

3310
02:23:53,399 --> 02:23:55,319
talking about except now all we have to

3311
02:23:55,319 --> 02:23:57,359
do is look for uh the indications of

3312
02:23:57,359 --> 02:23:59,880
cobalt strike right so yeah maybe you

3313
02:23:59,880 --> 02:24:01,800
defeated the the live memory analysis of

3314
02:24:01,800 --> 02:24:03,479
all of that stuff but now you're leaving

3315
02:24:03,479 --> 02:24:05,220
abandon all these Footprints of cobalt

3316
02:24:05,220 --> 02:24:06,600
strike which allow allows us to kind of

3317
02:24:06,600 --> 02:24:08,100
you know um

3318
02:24:08,100 --> 02:24:10,979
again have an edge so I'm gonna let me

3319
02:24:10,979 --> 02:24:13,200
just hit all of these things uh like

3320
02:24:13,200 --> 02:24:15,720
that so that uh you know you can use it

3321
02:24:15,720 --> 02:24:18,000
as a resource later but basically uh you

3322
02:24:18,000 --> 02:24:19,920
know cobal strike has these has these uh

3323
02:24:19,920 --> 02:24:22,439
markers of uh you know processed trees

3324
02:24:22,439 --> 02:24:24,600
or powershells that spawn itself I'm

3325
02:24:24,600 --> 02:24:27,780
looking for Powershell run spawning a

3326
02:24:27,780 --> 02:24:29,880
bunch of run dll 32s then you look at

3327
02:24:29,880 --> 02:24:31,319
those run D level 32s and the command

3328
02:24:31,319 --> 02:24:33,240
line arguments have nothing you know so

3329
02:24:33,240 --> 02:24:34,920
kind of doesn't make sense they're used

3330
02:24:34,920 --> 02:24:36,420
as what they call a sacrificial

3331
02:24:36,420 --> 02:24:40,740
processes uh then you have uh uh you

3332
02:24:40,740 --> 02:24:43,500
know potential code injection and named

3333
02:24:43,500 --> 02:24:45,120
pipes there's a bunch of them that

3334
02:24:45,120 --> 02:24:48,300
you're going to see there that uh

3335
02:24:48,300 --> 02:24:51,720
uh cadeso guy there's an article so that

3336
02:24:51,720 --> 02:24:53,520
link or that image rather is a link to

3337
02:24:53,520 --> 02:24:55,859
an article that beautifully lays out all

3338
02:24:55,859 --> 02:24:57,600
of that stuff and shows you like hey you

3339
02:24:57,600 --> 02:24:59,700
know this is what you go look for

3340
02:24:59,700 --> 02:25:00,899
um and so there's a resource for you

3341
02:25:00,899 --> 02:25:04,500
another fantastic resource is um uh Chad

3342
02:25:04,500 --> 02:25:06,000
Tilbury one of my colleagues at Sans

3343
02:25:06,000 --> 02:25:07,979
guy's a brilliant dude and and he's

3344
02:25:07,979 --> 02:25:09,359
actually the guy that brought me into

3345
02:25:09,359 --> 02:25:12,180
sand and and you know uh vouch for me to

3346
02:25:12,180 --> 02:25:14,040
start teaching so I got a you know

3347
02:25:14,040 --> 02:25:17,040
special uh uh love for that guy anyway

3348
02:25:17,040 --> 02:25:20,700
he has an entire you know hour-long uh

3349
02:25:20,700 --> 02:25:23,280
talk about just basically hunting out

3350
02:25:23,280 --> 02:25:25,439
Cobalt strike and it's it's magical he

3351
02:25:25,439 --> 02:25:28,380
also has a workshop in that talk that

3352
02:25:28,380 --> 02:25:30,060
would that will help you to you know

3353
02:25:30,060 --> 02:25:31,680
give you an opportunity to kind of walk

3354
02:25:31,680 --> 02:25:33,540
through all that kind of stuff

3355
02:25:33,540 --> 02:25:35,819
um and uh and have some fun with it I'm

3356
02:25:35,819 --> 02:25:37,740
excited to also talk about something I

3357
02:25:37,740 --> 02:25:39,359
stumbled upon just like two weeks ago so

3358
02:25:39,359 --> 02:25:41,040
this is really really fresh

3359
02:25:41,040 --> 02:25:44,040
um and I'm even more excited because uh

3360
02:25:44,040 --> 02:25:45,540
I was like I

3361
02:25:45,540 --> 02:25:48,420
I would love to to do some you know

3362
02:25:48,420 --> 02:25:50,100
Cobalt striking in here and stuff like

3363
02:25:50,100 --> 02:25:51,359
that I just don't have thousands of

3364
02:25:51,359 --> 02:25:52,200
dollars

3365
02:25:52,200 --> 02:25:54,300
just to set up Cobalt strike so that I

3366
02:25:54,300 --> 02:25:56,220
can you know have some cool snapshots so

3367
02:25:56,220 --> 02:25:58,200
that I can you know appease you guys in

3368
02:25:58,200 --> 02:26:00,840
a talk so I was just Googling randomly

3369
02:26:00,840 --> 02:26:02,280
like hey is there any open source

3370
02:26:02,280 --> 02:26:03,960
alternatives to Cobalt strike and

3371
02:26:03,960 --> 02:26:06,300
magically I find sliver I'm excited

3372
02:26:06,300 --> 02:26:09,120
though because uh Bishop Fox is actually

3373
02:26:09,120 --> 02:26:10,979
I didn't know this right but uh one of

3374
02:26:10,979 --> 02:26:12,540
the guys here sitting in the audience uh

3375
02:26:12,540 --> 02:26:14,040
is that one of the developers of sliver

3376
02:26:14,040 --> 02:26:16,140
and so him and I had a fantastic

3377
02:26:16,140 --> 02:26:17,580
conversation yesterday talking about it

3378
02:26:17,580 --> 02:26:19,680
and I'm like oh man this is so cool so

3379
02:26:19,680 --> 02:26:21,000
sliver is an open source so this is

3380
02:26:21,000 --> 02:26:23,520
anybody can now go buy this open source

3381
02:26:23,520 --> 02:26:25,500
alternative

3382
02:26:25,500 --> 02:26:27,540
um yeah two Cobalt strike to make this

3383
02:26:27,540 --> 02:26:29,819
stuff all magical and easy I took it

3384
02:26:29,819 --> 02:26:32,640
started playing with it uh and and

3385
02:26:32,640 --> 02:26:34,200
effectively was able to do some cool

3386
02:26:34,200 --> 02:26:35,399
stuff so I was able to you know create

3387
02:26:35,399 --> 02:26:37,380
my own Beacon and then go back and see

3388
02:26:37,380 --> 02:26:39,540
what I'm what I'm uh you know what kind

3389
02:26:39,540 --> 02:26:41,040
of things I'm leaving behind and whatnot

3390
02:26:41,040 --> 02:26:43,560
so obviously I can see that uh you know

3391
02:26:43,560 --> 02:26:45,780
I it staturates the process the the

3392
02:26:45,780 --> 02:26:48,000
implant that I created and I see that in

3393
02:26:48,000 --> 02:26:50,399
uh Velociraptor I also see that in my

3394
02:26:50,399 --> 02:26:53,340
system uh logs and uh and then of course

3395
02:26:53,340 --> 02:26:54,420
I see

3396
02:26:54,420 --> 02:26:57,720
um things like uh my my uh network

3397
02:26:57,720 --> 02:26:59,340
connections and stuff like that you know

3398
02:26:59,340 --> 02:27:00,840
coming out and I know what I'm looking

3399
02:27:00,840 --> 02:27:02,580
at I know what to expect

3400
02:27:02,580 --> 02:27:04,020
um anyways but I just thought this was

3401
02:27:04,020 --> 02:27:05,220
the coolest thing one of the cool things

3402
02:27:05,220 --> 02:27:07,200
that I I stumbled upon I this is again

3403
02:27:07,200 --> 02:27:09,300
Super Fresh So I'm not sure exactly how

3404
02:27:09,300 --> 02:27:11,280
I did it and I can't I didn't spend

3405
02:27:11,280 --> 02:27:13,319
enough time trying to reproduce it uh

3406
02:27:13,319 --> 02:27:14,700
but one of the cool things I stumbled

3407
02:27:14,700 --> 02:27:17,580
upon was uh you can see here on the

3408
02:27:17,580 --> 02:27:18,600
bottom

3409
02:27:18,600 --> 02:27:22,080
uh it's a it's a sysmon log of

3410
02:27:22,080 --> 02:27:25,200
uh prefetch file being deleted prefetch

3411
02:27:25,200 --> 02:27:25,979
file if you're not sure what that is

3412
02:27:25,979 --> 02:27:27,899
it's evidence of execution so it's it's

3413
02:27:27,899 --> 02:27:31,319
the uh the the implant was called causal

3414
02:27:31,319 --> 02:27:33,359
couch I thought it was casual couch and

3415
02:27:33,359 --> 02:27:34,620
I kept trying to look for stuff and I'm

3416
02:27:34,620 --> 02:27:36,180
like I can't find anything like this is

3417
02:27:36,180 --> 02:27:38,580
crazy like is it is it that cool that

3418
02:27:38,580 --> 02:27:39,780
it's like going in and like you know

3419
02:27:39,780 --> 02:27:41,460
it's even like disrupting system on

3420
02:27:41,460 --> 02:27:42,840
stuff no I was just spilling it wrong

3421
02:27:42,840 --> 02:27:45,960
it's it's causal couch not casual couch

3422
02:27:45,960 --> 02:27:48,180
anyway so I found I found it I found

3423
02:27:48,180 --> 02:27:50,220
found where it was it was it deleted a

3424
02:27:50,220 --> 02:27:53,640
prefetch file uh but then the prefetch

3425
02:27:53,640 --> 02:27:55,979
file and like it then it ran again and

3426
02:27:55,979 --> 02:27:57,899
it was still there so I'm not sure how

3427
02:27:57,899 --> 02:27:59,760
it did it and why

3428
02:27:59,760 --> 02:28:01,380
um and I I was like Hey did I find a bug

3429
02:28:01,380 --> 02:28:03,780
because if I did you know

3430
02:28:03,780 --> 02:28:05,280
you're welcome

3431
02:28:05,280 --> 02:28:07,859
um but I also have to put in the talk so

3432
02:28:07,859 --> 02:28:10,500
sorry but anyway uh it's a phenomenal

3433
02:28:10,500 --> 02:28:12,840
tool um again all of the same stuff all

3434
02:28:12,840 --> 02:28:14,399
the the same ways that we're hunting and

3435
02:28:14,399 --> 02:28:16,500
all that um like we got to know that

3436
02:28:16,500 --> 02:28:17,880
there's always going to be the sort of

3437
02:28:17,880 --> 02:28:19,560
the next thing uh and if you start

3438
02:28:19,560 --> 02:28:21,120
looking out there again all Super Fresh

3439
02:28:21,120 --> 02:28:23,399
there's uh there's now threat actors

3440
02:28:23,399 --> 02:28:24,899
that are starting to leverage sliver

3441
02:28:24,899 --> 02:28:26,819
okay this is going to be the new hotness

3442
02:28:26,819 --> 02:28:29,819
in fact apt-29 is already starting to be

3443
02:28:29,819 --> 02:28:32,100
found using sliver and probably

3444
02:28:32,100 --> 02:28:33,359
abandoning Cobalt strike because they're

3445
02:28:33,359 --> 02:28:34,680
like well great I don't have to buy that

3446
02:28:34,680 --> 02:28:36,720
anymore number one but two everybody's

3447
02:28:36,720 --> 02:28:38,700
now looking for Cobalt strike okay and

3448
02:28:38,700 --> 02:28:40,620
so now this is this is another way to

3449
02:28:40,620 --> 02:28:42,899
kind of help them remain uh hidden

3450
02:28:42,899 --> 02:28:45,000
here's my last thing to run by you

3451
02:28:45,000 --> 02:28:47,340
really quick that is uh just a magical

3452
02:28:47,340 --> 02:28:49,200
thing that can be done in Velociraptor

3453
02:28:49,200 --> 02:28:51,960
uh it's the ability to search through

3454
02:28:51,960 --> 02:28:53,399
physical memory because you know I get

3455
02:28:53,399 --> 02:28:54,720
it like some people might say yeah but

3456
02:28:54,720 --> 02:28:56,160
you know what if you're looking at PS

3457
02:28:56,160 --> 02:28:57,780
list then you're probably looking at you

3458
02:28:57,780 --> 02:29:00,359
know only plug-in uh only processes uh

3459
02:29:00,359 --> 02:29:02,700
that are part of the you know PEB and

3460
02:29:02,700 --> 02:29:04,560
any unlinked processes from something

3461
02:29:04,560 --> 02:29:05,819
like a root kit you know you're never

3462
02:29:05,819 --> 02:29:07,859
going to even know about that and all

3463
02:29:07,859 --> 02:29:10,020
that stuff is true okay

3464
02:29:10,020 --> 02:29:13,140
but one of the the Fantastic things that

3465
02:29:13,140 --> 02:29:15,120
uh that Velociraptor can do is

3466
02:29:15,120 --> 02:29:17,819
effectively load win pmem again this can

3467
02:29:17,819 --> 02:29:20,280
be done at scale can load wind PM okay

3468
02:29:20,280 --> 02:29:22,560
to go and look at Raw that physical

3469
02:29:22,560 --> 02:29:25,319
memory and run Yara scans against that

3470
02:29:25,319 --> 02:29:27,479
so I can you know run your scans for

3471
02:29:27,479 --> 02:29:29,399
whatever Cobalt strike so on and so

3472
02:29:29,399 --> 02:29:31,680
forth and in fact

3473
02:29:31,680 --> 02:29:34,620
um I got one minute left of content is

3474
02:29:34,620 --> 02:29:36,600
that okay because I got one minute left

3475
02:29:36,600 --> 02:29:39,120
I'm just kidding yeah no okay cool thank

3476
02:29:39,120 --> 02:29:39,780
you

3477
02:29:39,780 --> 02:29:41,399
um so

3478
02:29:41,399 --> 02:29:43,500
uh one of the one of the Fantastic

3479
02:29:43,500 --> 02:29:46,200
things that uh is again fairly recent

3480
02:29:46,200 --> 02:29:48,960
and fresh is um Google yeah releasing

3481
02:29:48,960 --> 02:29:51,359
this enormous set of Yara rules to be

3482
02:29:51,359 --> 02:29:53,939
able to to catch uh uh Cobalt strike

3483
02:29:53,939 --> 02:29:58,319
right so I actually found uh you know um

3484
02:29:58,319 --> 02:30:02,220
not only uh Cobalt strike Yara but a

3485
02:30:02,220 --> 02:30:04,439
couple of sliver ones so I don't know if

3486
02:30:04,439 --> 02:30:05,700
you guys are already familiar with that

3487
02:30:05,700 --> 02:30:07,140
it's pretty cool

3488
02:30:07,140 --> 02:30:09,120
um anyway so so this is this is a fact

3489
02:30:09,120 --> 02:30:11,520
you can use Velociraptor to to load your

3490
02:30:11,520 --> 02:30:13,200
you can run yard scans across you know

3491
02:30:13,200 --> 02:30:15,300
everything with loss Raptor but you can

3492
02:30:15,300 --> 02:30:17,340
use Velociraptor to load winp-mem to get

3493
02:30:17,340 --> 02:30:19,140
it you know the physical memory and run

3494
02:30:19,140 --> 02:30:21,420
your scans against that and again that's

3495
02:30:21,420 --> 02:30:24,960
just super magical so I did this

3496
02:30:24,960 --> 02:30:28,020
um I didn't have Cobalt strike I did not

3497
02:30:28,020 --> 02:30:31,260
successfully find any sliver with it but

3498
02:30:31,260 --> 02:30:33,060
I also didn't do a whole lot with it

3499
02:30:33,060 --> 02:30:34,560
because it was it was brand new and I

3500
02:30:34,560 --> 02:30:36,300
was just kind of learning to play with

3501
02:30:36,300 --> 02:30:39,720
it but what I did do was I used this

3502
02:30:39,720 --> 02:30:42,180
Velociraptor artifact with um I think I

3503
02:30:42,180 --> 02:30:43,500
just opened notepad or something like

3504
02:30:43,500 --> 02:30:44,280
that

3505
02:30:44,280 --> 02:30:46,979
um open notepad and I wrote something in

3506
02:30:46,979 --> 02:30:48,540
there and I didn't save it so it's

3507
02:30:48,540 --> 02:30:50,640
nowhere on disk it's just in memory then

3508
02:30:50,640 --> 02:30:52,319
I ran this with the ER scan and I

3509
02:30:52,319 --> 02:30:54,359
basically you know find my donkey I

3510
02:30:54,359 --> 02:30:56,939
found it uh and that's the thing okay

3511
02:30:56,939 --> 02:30:58,500
I've lost my donkey a couple of times

3512
02:30:58,500 --> 02:31:00,359
and I one time I had to call the police

3513
02:31:00,359 --> 02:31:02,280
to you know say like I lost my dunk I

3514
02:31:02,280 --> 02:31:04,140
don't know what to do like well I've

3515
02:31:04,140 --> 02:31:05,340
never been in this situation before

3516
02:31:05,340 --> 02:31:07,020
luckily he was just in the woods and I

3517
02:31:07,020 --> 02:31:09,680
found him uh but that's the thing okay

3518
02:31:09,680 --> 02:31:13,979
uh so anyway uh just again this is

3519
02:31:13,979 --> 02:31:16,560
magical doing this across many systems

3520
02:31:16,560 --> 02:31:18,180
in an Enterprise environment this makes

3521
02:31:18,180 --> 02:31:20,040
it this makes it so much easier and so

3522
02:31:20,040 --> 02:31:22,920
much more effective uh all of this is

3523
02:31:22,920 --> 02:31:25,020
can can be a little clunky and a little

3524
02:31:25,020 --> 02:31:27,300
manual and whatever some parts of it on

3525
02:31:27,300 --> 02:31:28,979
purpose I'm showing you like the hard

3526
02:31:28,979 --> 02:31:31,020
difficult you know open source and free

3527
02:31:31,020 --> 02:31:32,280
way to do it anybody can set up their

3528
02:31:32,280 --> 02:31:33,840
own lab and do all this stuff but you

3529
02:31:33,840 --> 02:31:35,100
also have to realize that a lot of these

3530
02:31:35,100 --> 02:31:36,600
things are also caught in a really good

3531
02:31:36,600 --> 02:31:38,640
EDR tool so what you got to figure out

3532
02:31:38,640 --> 02:31:41,880
is how to how to pair a really good EDR

3533
02:31:41,880 --> 02:31:44,040
tool with the the methods and all the

3534
02:31:44,040 --> 02:31:45,300
cool things that you're learning and

3535
02:31:45,300 --> 02:31:47,280
figuring out how to do

3536
02:31:47,280 --> 02:31:49,200
um and uh and you know once you do that

3537
02:31:49,200 --> 02:31:50,580
that's kind of where you start to fill

3538
02:31:50,580 --> 02:31:52,200
out figure out how do I fill in the gaps

3539
02:31:52,200 --> 02:31:53,700
how do I then take all of things that

3540
02:31:53,700 --> 02:31:55,140
I'm learning and doing through throat

3541
02:31:55,140 --> 02:31:56,819
hunting and whatnot and then feeding it

3542
02:31:56,819 --> 02:31:59,220
back into tuning my tools that you know

3543
02:31:59,220 --> 02:32:01,020
help to kind of do this in a little bit

3544
02:32:01,020 --> 02:32:02,939
more of an automated fashion

3545
02:32:02,939 --> 02:32:05,220
okay so that's it

3546
02:32:05,220 --> 02:32:07,380
um I uh obviously you can catch me on

3547
02:32:07,380 --> 02:32:08,460
Twitter one of the things I want to plug

3548
02:32:08,460 --> 02:32:10,800
really quick is every Thursday we do a

3549
02:32:10,800 --> 02:32:12,120
webcast at Recon called Thursday

3550
02:32:12,120 --> 02:32:14,280
defensive and all we're doing is uh

3551
02:32:14,280 --> 02:32:15,479
sitting around hanging out talking

3552
02:32:15,479 --> 02:32:17,880
security with uh some of the Giants in

3553
02:32:17,880 --> 02:32:19,439
the industry uh some of the guys we've

3554
02:32:19,439 --> 02:32:21,300
talked about Olaf Hartong

3555
02:32:21,300 --> 02:32:24,120
um and others you know uh Mike Cohen who

3556
02:32:24,120 --> 02:32:25,680
you know creative Velociraptor has been

3557
02:32:25,680 --> 02:32:27,899
on it and so if you're interested in

3558
02:32:27,899 --> 02:32:30,000
that kind of thing it's free we sit

3559
02:32:30,000 --> 02:32:33,120
around every uh 12 30 Central every

3560
02:32:33,120 --> 02:32:35,760
Thursday so go to our website again it's

thank you for the talk uh I really

3567
02:32:54,420 --> 02:32:56,040
enjoyed following the cat and mouse and

3568
02:32:56,040 --> 02:32:58,680
I loved your slides template as well oh

3569
02:32:58,680 --> 02:33:00,420
yeah the 90s thing I forgot to make a

3570
02:33:00,420 --> 02:33:03,359
note of that but yeah um it's it's a 90s

3571
02:33:03,359 --> 02:33:05,819
theme so Saved by the Bell type whatever

3572
02:33:05,819 --> 02:33:06,960
yeah

3573
02:33:06,960 --> 02:33:08,280
I liked it

3574
02:33:08,280 --> 02:33:10,080
um you mentioned that one really high

3575
02:33:10,080 --> 02:33:12,060
signal way to identify you know some

3576
02:33:12,060 --> 02:33:14,760
kind of malicious process is a process

3577
02:33:14,760 --> 02:33:16,380
that isn't loaded off disk but it's just

3578
02:33:16,380 --> 02:33:18,660
you know spawned purely from memory

3579
02:33:18,660 --> 02:33:21,479
although I assume and maybe you know

3580
02:33:21,479 --> 02:33:23,700
this is my question I assume that there

3581
02:33:23,700 --> 02:33:25,080
are legitimate reasons for that one that

3582
02:33:25,080 --> 02:33:26,760
comes to mind is like jit threads in a

3583
02:33:26,760 --> 02:33:28,319
browser is that something you have to

3584
02:33:28,319 --> 02:33:30,240
filter out or is it you know yeah I know

3585
02:33:30,240 --> 02:33:32,700
that's a great question so um yeah the

3586
02:33:32,700 --> 02:33:35,580
um so the the ability to effectively

3587
02:33:35,580 --> 02:33:37,979
like side load code and like throw

3588
02:33:37,979 --> 02:33:40,979
things into a running process is a is a

3589
02:33:40,979 --> 02:33:42,240
built-in Windows feature that's

3590
02:33:42,240 --> 02:33:45,000
necessary right like so a lot a long

3591
02:33:45,000 --> 02:33:46,140
time ago

3592
02:33:46,140 --> 02:33:47,040
um

3593
02:33:47,040 --> 02:33:49,140
and you know like

3594
02:33:49,140 --> 02:33:51,420
I still remember this um but anytime

3595
02:33:51,420 --> 02:33:52,979
that you you did something on your

3596
02:33:52,979 --> 02:33:54,120
Windows system like if you change your

3597
02:33:54,120 --> 02:33:56,100
IP address or you installed new software

3598
02:33:56,100 --> 02:33:58,080
or whatever it would require you to

3599
02:33:58,080 --> 02:34:00,120
restart because effectively it's like

3600
02:34:00,120 --> 02:34:02,220
okay we gotta whatever change we made or

3601
02:34:02,220 --> 02:34:03,780
whatever you got to shut down the system

3602
02:34:03,780 --> 02:34:05,340
and it's got to now start up with all of

3603
02:34:05,340 --> 02:34:07,080
that stuff in it

3604
02:34:07,080 --> 02:34:08,880
um because you just you can't like

3605
02:34:08,880 --> 02:34:11,280
change code on the fly but Windows

3606
02:34:11,280 --> 02:34:13,680
change that they fixed that made that a

3607
02:34:13,680 --> 02:34:15,840
feature and so now you can you can

3608
02:34:15,840 --> 02:34:17,460
change code on the Fly you could do sort

3609
02:34:17,460 --> 02:34:19,920
of whatever you want by injecting into

3610
02:34:19,920 --> 02:34:21,540
the process as it's running so it's a

3611
02:34:21,540 --> 02:34:22,800
it's a Windows feature it's not like

3612
02:34:22,800 --> 02:34:24,359
this isn't a hack

3613
02:34:24,359 --> 02:34:27,000
put in Bad Code malicious code in there

3614
02:34:27,000 --> 02:34:30,420
is is itself the hack so so yes

3615
02:34:30,420 --> 02:34:32,520
um simply like you can't just you're not

3616
02:34:32,520 --> 02:34:33,240
gonna

3617
02:34:33,240 --> 02:34:35,340
um you can't write a signature for every

3618
02:34:35,340 --> 02:34:37,740
create remote thread that occurs because

3619
02:34:37,740 --> 02:34:39,120
um because it happens legitimately all

3620
02:34:39,120 --> 02:34:41,220
the time right uh so what you're looking

3621
02:34:41,220 --> 02:34:42,780
for is

3622
02:34:42,780 --> 02:34:45,660
um you you can you can sort of Leverage

3623
02:34:45,660 --> 02:34:47,520
things that are like maybe I'm going to

3624
02:34:47,520 --> 02:34:49,260
look more closely at things like lsas

3625
02:34:49,260 --> 02:34:51,479
for example right uh I'm gonna look at

3626
02:34:51,479 --> 02:34:53,640
things that I would be more suspicious

3627
02:34:53,640 --> 02:34:55,800
of for one that you know like I really

3628
02:34:55,800 --> 02:34:57,720
don't want things trying to you know

3629
02:34:57,720 --> 02:35:01,200
inject code in my lsas and dump out my

3630
02:35:01,200 --> 02:35:04,020
um creds and whatnot so yeah so there is

3631
02:35:04,020 --> 02:35:05,220
a little bit of

3632
02:35:05,220 --> 02:35:07,200
tuning and stuff that you gotta you

3633
02:35:07,200 --> 02:35:09,300
gotta do there because uh because it's a

3634
02:35:09,300 --> 02:35:11,640
legitimate thing that Windows does

3635
02:35:11,640 --> 02:35:13,439
sorry what is else

3636
02:35:13,439 --> 02:35:16,680
uh lsas is uh is the windows process

3637
02:35:16,680 --> 02:35:18,300
that effectively handles the

3638
02:35:18,300 --> 02:35:20,640
credentialing okay thank you my other

3639
02:35:20,640 --> 02:35:22,500
question was I'm curious how you're

3640
02:35:22,500 --> 02:35:24,240
doing physical memory dumps it sounds as

3641
02:35:24,240 --> 02:35:25,740
though it might be an affordance that

3642
02:35:25,740 --> 02:35:28,380
Windows itself offers

3643
02:35:28,380 --> 02:35:30,840
um a physical memory dump can be done in

3644
02:35:30,840 --> 02:35:32,280
the this is actually kind of a

3645
02:35:32,280 --> 02:35:34,560
complicated topic that generally people

3646
02:35:34,560 --> 02:35:37,439
just use a tool like win pmem or ftk

3647
02:35:37,439 --> 02:35:39,180
Imager

3648
02:35:39,180 --> 02:35:41,880
um so a couple of slides back

3649
02:35:41,880 --> 02:35:43,979
I think it actually shows here so like

3650
02:35:43,979 --> 02:35:46,920
uh Velociraptor here is using winp-mem

3651
02:35:46,920 --> 02:35:50,100
to create a memory dump like or well uh

3652
02:35:50,100 --> 02:35:52,200
it's it's using windpm to access raw

3653
02:35:52,200 --> 02:35:54,720
memory but when pmem is a tool that you

3654
02:35:54,720 --> 02:35:56,220
can download it's it's free tool you can

3655
02:35:56,220 --> 02:35:58,560
download it and effectively just say you

3656
02:35:58,560 --> 02:36:01,500
know hey run this and dump the memory

3657
02:36:01,500 --> 02:36:03,660
snapshot to a file then you have a raw

3658
02:36:03,660 --> 02:36:05,580
file and then you can kind of go and and

3659
02:36:05,580 --> 02:36:07,439
you know do things with it but there's a

3660
02:36:07,439 --> 02:36:09,780
lot of ways to do that this is like

3661
02:36:09,780 --> 02:36:11,399
this is just that kind of the common way

3662
02:36:11,399 --> 02:36:13,620
to do it in fact I actually have a

3663
02:36:13,620 --> 02:36:15,660
hidden slide in here let me give me a

3664
02:36:15,660 --> 02:36:18,000
second I can show you

3665
02:36:18,000 --> 02:36:21,479
um I think I left it in there in case

3666
02:36:21,479 --> 02:36:23,760
yeah so so here's a hidden slide that

3667
02:36:23,760 --> 02:36:25,740
oops didn't mean to do that

3668
02:36:25,740 --> 02:36:27,420
uh

3669
02:36:27,420 --> 02:36:29,520
I left it in in case for for people who

3670
02:36:29,520 --> 02:36:31,200
might kind of you know look at the slide

3671
02:36:31,200 --> 02:36:33,720
deck so there's there's multiple ways to

3672
02:36:33,720 --> 02:36:35,899
go and basically get at memory right

3673
02:36:35,899 --> 02:36:38,040
again generally

3674
02:36:38,040 --> 02:36:40,080
um kind of at the the kernel level we're

3675
02:36:40,080 --> 02:36:42,180
using things like uh win pmam or proc

3676
02:36:42,180 --> 02:36:43,979
dump and you know ftk imager and so on

3677
02:36:43,979 --> 02:36:45,720
and so forth but it's not the only way

3678
02:36:45,720 --> 02:36:47,640
to go to grab memory if you're running a

3679
02:36:47,640 --> 02:36:50,460
VM of uh you know virtual uh VMware or

3680
02:36:50,460 --> 02:36:52,500
something like that uh when you pause

3681
02:36:52,500 --> 02:36:54,420
the system it actually it has a file

3682
02:36:54,420 --> 02:36:57,540
that that keeps that the memory snapshot

3683
02:36:57,540 --> 02:36:59,340
and all you got to do is grab that file

3684
02:36:59,340 --> 02:37:01,380
and you can start messing with it so

3685
02:37:01,380 --> 02:37:04,099
thank you

3686
02:37:05,460 --> 02:37:10,020
uh by the way this um links to uh an

3687
02:37:10,020 --> 02:37:12,540
article as well that kind of uh walks

3688
02:37:12,540 --> 02:37:15,180
through the whole uh it's I think the

3689
02:37:15,180 --> 02:37:17,100
whole article was about memory smear and

3690
02:37:17,100 --> 02:37:18,780
like all the various different ways to

3691
02:37:18,780 --> 02:37:20,399
capture memory and why we the way that

3692
02:37:20,399 --> 02:37:21,780
we think we're catching memory sometimes

3693
02:37:21,780 --> 02:37:23,700
isn't exactly doing what we think it's

3694
02:37:23,700 --> 02:37:26,100
doing and I don't know complicated stuff

3695
02:37:26,100 --> 02:37:28,800
whatever right but uh but it's a good

3696
02:37:28,800 --> 02:37:30,180
one for for anybody who's kind of

3697
02:37:30,180 --> 02:37:33,300
interested in in figuring out like how

3698
02:37:33,300 --> 02:37:34,800
do I know what I'm getting is what I

3699
02:37:34,800 --> 02:37:36,960
think I'm getting right crash dumps and

3700
02:37:36,960 --> 02:37:39,359
so on and so forth did somebody have oh

3701
02:37:39,359 --> 02:37:40,740
yes

3702
02:37:40,740 --> 02:37:42,240
um okay so mind this question because

3703
02:37:42,240 --> 02:37:43,859
it's very very low level because I don't

3704
02:37:43,859 --> 02:37:45,479
have much of an experience with digital

3705
02:37:45,479 --> 02:37:48,660
forensics please one question so from

3706
02:37:48,660 --> 02:37:50,100
what I understand from digital forensics

3707
02:37:50,100 --> 02:37:51,840
typically you're you're taking a mirror

3708
02:37:51,840 --> 02:37:53,340
image of you know something like let's

3709
02:37:53,340 --> 02:37:54,899
say if you're law enforcement if you're

3710
02:37:54,899 --> 02:37:56,760
like a private firm you know whatever

3711
02:37:56,760 --> 02:37:58,680
like that you're you're talking about

3712
02:37:58,680 --> 02:38:00,899
you know specifically lived

3713
02:38:00,899 --> 02:38:02,160
um live

3714
02:38:02,160 --> 02:38:03,920
um acquisition basically using

3715
02:38:03,920 --> 02:38:05,580
Velociraptor and how you're able to go

3716
02:38:05,580 --> 02:38:07,380
and do a lot more because it is a robust

3717
02:38:07,380 --> 02:38:10,020
tool so I I might have missed this

3718
02:38:10,020 --> 02:38:12,780
because I did come in late but why

3719
02:38:12,780 --> 02:38:14,640
exactly is it not being implemented then

3720
02:38:14,640 --> 02:38:16,200
because I mean I'm assuming that

3721
02:38:16,200 --> 02:38:17,580
typically they take the mirror images

3722
02:38:17,580 --> 02:38:18,960
because then it's not going to get

3723
02:38:18,960 --> 02:38:20,280
contaminated in any kind of way

3724
02:38:20,280 --> 02:38:22,260
especially if you're like you know in

3725
02:38:22,260 --> 02:38:24,780
law or something yeah I'm glad that you

3726
02:38:24,780 --> 02:38:26,220
brought that up because I meant to

3727
02:38:26,220 --> 02:38:28,380
include that as a disclaimer

3728
02:38:28,380 --> 02:38:30,479
um and I hope nobody sat through the

3729
02:38:30,479 --> 02:38:33,120
whole thing uh just mad at me because of

3730
02:38:33,120 --> 02:38:34,319
this because I meant to include this as

3731
02:38:34,319 --> 02:38:37,580
a disclaimer there absolutely is

3732
02:38:37,580 --> 02:38:40,680
reasons for taking memory snapshots of

3733
02:38:40,680 --> 02:38:42,060
things and doing dead memory analysis

3734
02:38:42,060 --> 02:38:43,979
and all that stuff that you just you

3735
02:38:43,979 --> 02:38:45,780
don't get around right so for example

3736
02:38:45,780 --> 02:38:48,660
law enforcement uh you some they raid

3737
02:38:48,660 --> 02:38:50,819
somebody's house and you know grab their

3738
02:38:50,819 --> 02:38:52,620
system they immediately they're going to

3739
02:38:52,620 --> 02:38:54,420
take a you know a forensic disk image

3740
02:38:54,420 --> 02:38:55,620
and a memory snapshot and all that stuff

3741
02:38:55,620 --> 02:38:56,520
and then they're going to do chain of

3742
02:38:56,520 --> 02:38:58,680
custody to make sure that not it wasn't

3743
02:38:58,680 --> 02:39:00,600
messed with in a way that if they take

3744
02:39:00,600 --> 02:39:02,220
that to court you know they don't want

3745
02:39:02,220 --> 02:39:03,180
it to look like anything was

3746
02:39:03,180 --> 02:39:06,420
contaminated uh so that legal reasons

3747
02:39:06,420 --> 02:39:07,740
and law enforcement and so on so forth

3748
02:39:07,740 --> 02:39:09,720
that still stands I'm not I'm not

3749
02:39:09,720 --> 02:39:11,100
talking about that I'm talking about

3750
02:39:11,100 --> 02:39:13,439
Enterprise stuff right so in an

3751
02:39:13,439 --> 02:39:15,120
Enterprise environment it's a different

3752
02:39:15,120 --> 02:39:16,680
story generally we're not taking things

3753
02:39:16,680 --> 02:39:18,420
to court we're just you know trying to

3754
02:39:18,420 --> 02:39:19,680
stop the bleeding and get rid of the

3755
02:39:19,680 --> 02:39:22,439
stuff and Lessons Learned and whatnot so

3756
02:39:22,439 --> 02:39:23,520
it doesn't matter if your original

3757
02:39:23,520 --> 02:39:27,560
memory snapshot is contaminated then

3758
02:39:28,260 --> 02:39:31,140
well so uh

3759
02:39:31,140 --> 02:39:34,439
I guess it depends on what you mean like

3760
02:39:34,439 --> 02:39:35,640
um

3761
02:39:35,640 --> 02:39:39,060
it always matters but it but maybe less

3762
02:39:39,060 --> 02:39:41,100
if you're hitting like many different

3763
02:39:41,100 --> 02:39:42,899
angles and you know whatever like I have

3764
02:39:42,899 --> 02:39:44,760
a bunch of different data and and like I

3765
02:39:44,760 --> 02:39:45,840
guess it depends on what you mean by

3766
02:39:45,840 --> 02:39:47,819
contaminated but but I'm not concerned

3767
02:39:47,819 --> 02:39:49,800
about that stuff so much because because

3768
02:39:49,800 --> 02:39:51,660
I'm getting I have Telemetry in multiple

3769
02:39:51,660 --> 02:39:52,920
different ways like system for example

3770
02:39:52,920 --> 02:39:54,359
is going to make sure that you know like

3771
02:39:54,359 --> 02:39:55,560
I'm not gonna

3772
02:39:55,560 --> 02:39:56,880
like it's

3773
02:39:56,880 --> 02:39:59,280
um it's very hard to mess with uh the

3774
02:39:59,280 --> 02:40:01,319
event logs it's possible but it's just

3775
02:40:01,319 --> 02:40:04,439
tough so it's pretty reliable

3776
02:40:04,439 --> 02:40:06,000
that's why I'm not only relying on

3777
02:40:06,000 --> 02:40:08,340
Velociraptor only volatility and so on

3778
02:40:08,340 --> 02:40:10,260
and so forth

3779
02:40:10,260 --> 02:40:12,420
any other question I have I think 15

3780
02:40:12,420 --> 02:40:16,040
seconds to answer one more huh

3781
02:40:16,260 --> 02:40:18,800
okay

3782
02:40:21,979 --> 02:40:24,680
on life she's like

3783
02:40:24,680 --> 02:40:27,300
so I'm familiar with using velociraptor

3784
02:40:27,300 --> 02:40:29,460
in a client server model okay great for

3785
02:40:29,460 --> 02:40:30,960
scaling and that's the only way I know

3786
02:40:30,960 --> 02:40:33,180
it is there like if I have just a single

3787
02:40:33,180 --> 02:40:36,240
instance that's maybe isolated uh can it

3788
02:40:36,240 --> 02:40:38,399
run just on a single it can it can it

3789
02:40:38,399 --> 02:40:41,040
can um I I'm glad that you asked that

3790
02:40:41,040 --> 02:40:42,960
you guys are did somebody implant these

3791
02:40:42,960 --> 02:40:44,520
questions now I'm glad you asked that

3792
02:40:44,520 --> 02:40:45,840
too because

3793
02:40:45,840 --> 02:40:48,240
um I meant to also mention this at 2 pm

3794
02:40:48,240 --> 02:40:50,880
uh I did mention this actually but I

3795
02:40:50,880 --> 02:40:53,220
meant to mention this again okay 2PM uh

3796
02:40:53,220 --> 02:40:54,420
Whitney and Eric are going to be talking

3797
02:40:54,420 --> 02:40:56,100
specifically about Velociraptor like

3798
02:40:56,100 --> 02:40:58,380
they're going to go into weird brain

3799
02:40:58,380 --> 02:41:00,120
twisting you can't even make sense of

3800
02:41:00,120 --> 02:41:01,439
stuff because they're just too smart

3801
02:41:01,439 --> 02:41:04,260
type of velociraptor stuff

3802
02:41:04,260 --> 02:41:05,819
um that's so they're gonna they're gonna

3803
02:41:05,819 --> 02:41:07,560
hit it from like just Velociraptor or

3804
02:41:07,560 --> 02:41:08,939
the capabilities and how they do all the

3805
02:41:08,939 --> 02:41:11,100
magic that they do uh but yes you can

3806
02:41:11,100 --> 02:41:13,560
you can just load it on a single system

3807
02:41:13,560 --> 02:41:14,760
um in fact it's super easy you just

3808
02:41:14,760 --> 02:41:16,439
download it and you run Velociraptor or

3809
02:41:16,439 --> 02:41:18,600
GUI and it'll run on just a local

3810
02:41:18,600 --> 02:41:22,140
instance uh it's so much easier because

3811
02:41:22,140 --> 02:41:24,420
it because I'm not the philosopher I

3812
02:41:24,420 --> 02:41:25,740
mean uh Velociraptor I didn't mean to

3813
02:41:25,740 --> 02:41:26,939
call you Velociraptor meant to call you

3814
02:41:26,939 --> 02:41:30,180
Whitney so Whitney uh you know she does

3815
02:41:30,180 --> 02:41:32,280
a lot of the magic back-end stuff like I

3816
02:41:32,280 --> 02:41:33,720
don't ever have to think about right I

3817
02:41:33,720 --> 02:41:34,740
just we could just use all the cool

3818
02:41:34,740 --> 02:41:36,660
stuff then I try to set up myself and

3819
02:41:36,660 --> 02:41:38,399
I'm like this is hard you know like it

3820
02:41:38,399 --> 02:41:40,439
is the certificates and setting it up in

3821
02:41:40,439 --> 02:41:42,600
Google Cloud it's not it's not it's not

3822
02:41:42,600 --> 02:41:45,000
super easy but doing the local instance

3823
02:41:45,000 --> 02:41:46,560
if you just want to learn Velociraptor

3824
02:41:46,560 --> 02:41:48,720
yeah super super easy

3825
02:41:48,720 --> 02:41:49,920
um to do that

3826
02:41:49,920 --> 02:41:51,780
um and uh and if you're interested I can

3827
02:41:51,780 --> 02:41:53,280
I can kind of point you in the direction

3828
02:41:53,280 --> 02:41:55,380
of how to do that but I would also

3829
02:41:55,380 --> 02:41:56,700
recommend anybody who's interested in

3830
02:41:56,700 --> 02:41:59,460
Velociraptor to hit that talk at 2PM

3831
02:41:59,460 --> 02:42:01,140
um it'll be magic

3832
02:42:01,140 --> 02:42:03,800
thank you

3833
02:42:04,200 --> 02:42:08,060
cool all right thanks guys

appreciate all of you giving me your

4111
03:42:12,779 --> 03:42:13,739
time

4112
03:42:13,739 --> 03:42:16,979
I hope that you will uh go a little bit

4113
03:42:16,979 --> 03:42:18,420
on this journey with me because I'm

4114
03:42:18,420 --> 03:42:20,460
talking about something that I had to

4115
03:42:20,460 --> 03:42:22,200
learn about specifically for this event

4116
03:42:22,200 --> 03:42:24,060
that I didn't normally know a lot about

4117
03:42:24,060 --> 03:42:26,580
and didn't see every day and as part of

4118
03:42:26,580 --> 03:42:31,080
my commitment to iot I am using my phone

4119
03:42:31,080 --> 03:42:33,359
to control my computer to advance my

4120
03:42:33,359 --> 03:42:36,180
slides the very talented AV team asked

4121
03:42:36,180 --> 03:42:37,560
me if I would like to use the official

4122
03:42:37,560 --> 03:42:40,080
remote and I said no I am fully

4123
03:42:40,080 --> 03:42:42,720
committed to controlling it wirelessly

4124
03:42:42,720 --> 03:42:44,340
with my phone

4125
03:42:44,340 --> 03:42:47,760
um I want to kind of get everyone on my

4126
03:42:47,760 --> 03:42:49,800
side by the end of this today

4127
03:42:49,800 --> 03:42:52,200
I want you to kind of lean in a little

4128
03:42:52,200 --> 03:42:56,040
bit into how you feel about things and

4129
03:42:56,040 --> 03:42:58,920
take note of the responses that you have

4130
03:42:58,920 --> 03:43:00,720
to the things that you see to kind of

4131
03:43:00,720 --> 03:43:04,500
use them later if they're useful for you

4132
03:43:04,500 --> 03:43:06,840
so what do we want to talk about we want

4133
03:43:06,840 --> 03:43:08,819
to talk about the world is changing I

4134
03:43:08,819 --> 03:43:10,020
think most of you in here are probably

4135
03:43:10,020 --> 03:43:12,359
Defenders if you're not I'm more than

4136
03:43:12,359 --> 03:43:13,680
happy to talk to you later and convince

4137
03:43:13,680 --> 03:43:15,660
you to become one

4138
03:43:15,660 --> 03:43:17,040
um we want to think about what really

4139
03:43:17,040 --> 03:43:19,500
matters we want to think about defending

4140
03:43:19,500 --> 03:43:21,960
the things that matter to us not just in

4141
03:43:21,960 --> 03:43:23,640
our jobs and our businesses and our work

4142
03:43:23,640 --> 03:43:26,040
but literally I want you to think about

4143
03:43:26,040 --> 03:43:27,420
the things that matter to you in your

4144
03:43:27,420 --> 03:43:29,220
heart and

4145
03:43:29,220 --> 03:43:32,220
I might cry later I don't know but I

4146
03:43:32,220 --> 03:43:34,439
want you to feel this much more than

4147
03:43:34,439 --> 03:43:36,600
resonate and think with it I want you to

4148
03:43:36,600 --> 03:43:39,060
see how you feel about the things that

4149
03:43:39,060 --> 03:43:41,040
we do as Defenders and the world that

4150
03:43:41,040 --> 03:43:42,300
we're coming into that we need to start

4151
03:43:42,300 --> 03:43:44,520
defending like what are we really

4152
03:43:44,520 --> 03:43:46,380
protecting not what are we protecting

4153
03:43:46,380 --> 03:43:47,220
from

4154
03:43:47,220 --> 03:43:50,760
malware attacks botnets but what are we

4155
03:43:50,760 --> 03:43:52,200
actually protecting and what does it

4156
03:43:52,200 --> 03:43:53,279
mean

4157
03:43:53,279 --> 03:43:54,720
and then we'll kind of look at what we

4158
03:43:54,720 --> 03:43:56,700
think the future might be and I'll ask

4159
03:43:56,700 --> 03:43:58,439
all of you to participate in a little

4160
03:43:58,439 --> 03:44:00,239
exercise at the end

4161
03:44:00,239 --> 03:44:03,600
so we're going to start with a quiz

4162
03:44:03,600 --> 03:44:05,760
does anyone know what pop quiz Hotshot

4163
03:44:05,760 --> 03:44:09,300
means if you're over 50 you probably do

4164
03:44:09,300 --> 03:44:11,279
that's from it's from speed yes so we

4165
03:44:11,279 --> 03:44:13,560
have a pop quiz first before we begin

4166
03:44:13,560 --> 03:44:17,160
the quiz raise your hand if you have

4167
03:44:17,160 --> 03:44:21,840
been currently are or want to be a cissp

4168
03:44:21,840 --> 03:44:24,359
have been will be

4169
03:44:24,359 --> 03:44:25,140
okay

4170
03:44:25,140 --> 03:44:26,160
so

4171
03:44:26,160 --> 03:44:28,920
in the cissp common body of knowledge

4172
03:44:28,920 --> 03:44:32,520
there is a lot of physical stuff that we

4173
03:44:32,520 --> 03:44:36,420
all ignored when is the last time you

4174
03:44:36,420 --> 03:44:38,760
used anything about dry pipe wet pipe

4175
03:44:38,760 --> 03:44:41,160
ABC style fire extinguishers minimum

4176
03:44:41,160 --> 03:44:43,260
Heights for a data center who's using

4177
03:44:43,260 --> 03:44:45,180
that on a daily basis

4178
03:44:45,180 --> 03:44:49,140
nobody not even a contrarian no that

4179
03:44:49,140 --> 03:44:50,939
physical stuff in the physical security

4180
03:44:50,939 --> 03:44:53,100
section of the cbk when you took your

4181
03:44:53,100 --> 03:44:56,220
cissp you memorized it you passed your

4182
03:44:56,220 --> 03:44:57,720
test and you never thought about it

4183
03:44:57,720 --> 03:45:00,420
again so what is the minimum fence

4184
03:45:00,420 --> 03:45:02,340
height for surrounding a data center

4185
03:45:02,340 --> 03:45:04,260
oh yes

4186
03:45:04,260 --> 03:45:08,040
geez Louise okay

4187
03:45:08,040 --> 03:45:09,660
very nice

4188
03:45:09,660 --> 03:45:14,660
job how did you know that so readily

4189
03:45:15,120 --> 03:45:18,239
okay so then my question to you sir when

4190
03:45:18,239 --> 03:45:19,979
is the last time you actually used that

4191
03:45:19,979 --> 03:45:22,680
information aside from in here

4192
03:45:22,680 --> 03:45:24,060
somebody asked me the question like

4193
03:45:24,060 --> 03:45:28,460
three years ago so it's trivia all right

4194
03:45:30,359 --> 03:45:32,160
so we've all established that the

4195
03:45:32,160 --> 03:45:34,439
physical information in the cissp is

4196
03:45:34,439 --> 03:45:36,779
used to win trivia contests at

4197
03:45:36,779 --> 03:45:38,160
conferences

4198
03:45:38,160 --> 03:45:39,660
nice job

4199
03:45:39,660 --> 03:45:41,399
so I want you to think about that

4200
03:45:41,399 --> 03:45:44,160
because we are coming into a physical

4201
03:45:44,160 --> 03:45:46,439
world when we talk about the Internet of

4202
03:45:46,439 --> 03:45:50,399
Things a data breach is physical now a

4203
03:45:50,399 --> 03:45:53,279
breach malware joining a botnet losing

4204
03:45:53,279 --> 03:45:55,500
credentials being attacked all of those

4205
03:45:55,500 --> 03:45:57,600
things have so many more new physical

4206
03:45:57,600 --> 03:46:01,020
realities physical implications

4207
03:46:01,020 --> 03:46:04,319
that some of that stuff in the ciss pcbk

4208
03:46:04,319 --> 03:46:07,380
it's going to become more relevant than

4209
03:46:07,380 --> 03:46:09,420
it ever has been before and you'll be

4210
03:46:09,420 --> 03:46:10,739
winning more trivia contests if you know

4211
03:46:10,739 --> 03:46:11,939
more about it

4212
03:46:11,939 --> 03:46:13,979
so let's talk about the malicious World

4213
03:46:13,979 --> 03:46:17,100
26 of all traffic on the web is

4214
03:46:17,100 --> 03:46:19,380
malicious I think that's crazy that's

4215
03:46:19,380 --> 03:46:21,540
insane think about all the raise your

4216
03:46:21,540 --> 03:46:24,300
hand if you love nanog

4217
03:46:24,300 --> 03:46:25,680
everybody you guys don't know nanog

4218
03:46:25,680 --> 03:46:27,540
North American Network operators group

4219
03:46:27,540 --> 03:46:29,460
they're the ones that keep us able to

4220
03:46:29,460 --> 03:46:31,319
talk on the internet they're incredibly

4221
03:46:31,319 --> 03:46:33,540
important they're like these old like

4222
03:46:33,540 --> 03:46:38,300
Gray beard guys like over computers but

4223
03:46:39,000 --> 03:46:42,000
but

4224
03:46:45,840 --> 03:46:48,120
they keep the world running when it

4225
03:46:48,120 --> 03:46:50,520
comes to internet worked Communications

4226
03:46:50,520 --> 03:46:52,260
so they're the ones that are allowing us

4227
03:46:52,260 --> 03:46:54,479
to actually keep that number low at 26

4228
03:46:54,479 --> 03:46:57,060
which I think is crazy but that's the

4229
03:46:57,060 --> 03:46:59,520
amount of trash just from botnets being

4230
03:46:59,520 --> 03:47:03,000
generated across networks malware 358

4231
03:47:03,000 --> 03:47:05,880
increase over the past couple of years

4232
03:47:05,880 --> 03:47:09,120
iot devices are estimated at 14 billion

4233
03:47:09,120 --> 03:47:12,720
in the world 14 billion devices and what

4234
03:47:12,720 --> 03:47:14,760
do we say when we talk about the cloud

4235
03:47:14,760 --> 03:47:16,500
it's just someone else's computer right

4236
03:47:16,500 --> 03:47:18,180
you've heard that

4237
03:47:18,180 --> 03:47:20,160
what is an iot device

4238
03:47:20,160 --> 03:47:23,700
it's just another computer but now

4239
03:47:23,700 --> 03:47:26,819
you don't have access to the hardware to

4240
03:47:26,819 --> 03:47:29,279
the software to how it operates to how

4241
03:47:29,279 --> 03:47:31,439
it updates to what it does it's a

4242
03:47:31,439 --> 03:47:33,120
completely closed system for the most

4243
03:47:33,120 --> 03:47:35,060
part when we talk about those devices

4244
03:47:35,060 --> 03:47:37,200
and now they're controlling whether or

4245
03:47:37,200 --> 03:47:39,300
not people can get in their homes

4246
03:47:39,300 --> 03:47:41,279
so it's kind of a different reality in

4247
03:47:41,279 --> 03:47:43,439
Calculus if you guys standing want

4248
03:47:43,439 --> 03:47:45,840
chairs there's some over here

4249
03:47:45,840 --> 03:47:50,279
so malware uh ransomware the the average

4250
03:47:50,279 --> 03:47:53,580
payment increased by 518 from 2020 to

4251
03:47:53,580 --> 03:47:56,819
2021. I have a feeling in 2022 it'll go

4252
03:47:56,819 --> 03:47:59,100
even higher ransomware is something that

4253
03:47:59,100 --> 03:48:00,779
we're seeing everywhere and I know what

4254
03:48:00,779 --> 03:48:03,420
you're all thinking yeah you can Ransom

4255
03:48:03,420 --> 03:48:06,479
a TV now you're all familiar that there

4256
03:48:06,479 --> 03:48:08,939
was a big ransomware outbreak in 2019

4257
03:48:08,939 --> 03:48:11,460
among Smart TVs and I think that that's

4258
03:48:11,460 --> 03:48:12,840
just the beginning we're going to see

4259
03:48:12,840 --> 03:48:14,640
more and more of that

4260
03:48:14,640 --> 03:48:17,880
so I want you to look at this list Smart

4261
03:48:17,880 --> 03:48:20,399
TVs smart speakers connected thermostats

4262
03:48:20,399 --> 03:48:22,739
home security systems domestic robots

4263
03:48:22,739 --> 03:48:25,439
which is roombas uh things like that

4264
03:48:25,439 --> 03:48:27,660
smart bulbs energy monitors connected

4265
03:48:27,660 --> 03:48:30,479
appliances door locks and cars

4266
03:48:30,479 --> 03:48:34,439
how many of you have one of these items

4267
03:48:34,439 --> 03:48:37,319
I have eight of them

4268
03:48:37,319 --> 03:48:40,319
I have everything except the door locks

4269
03:48:40,319 --> 03:48:42,359
and the car and the only reason I don't

4270
03:48:42,359 --> 03:48:43,680
have the door lock is because it looked

4271
03:48:43,680 --> 03:48:46,220
hard to install

4272
03:48:46,500 --> 03:48:47,939
and I don't have the car because they're

4273
03:48:47,939 --> 03:48:48,779
expensive

4274
03:48:48,779 --> 03:48:51,239
But ultimately I think everybody has

4275
03:48:51,239 --> 03:48:53,160
something like this in their homes and

4276
03:48:53,160 --> 03:48:54,600
their lives and not just one out of

4277
03:48:54,600 --> 03:48:57,840
these ten but five or eight or all of

4278
03:48:57,840 --> 03:48:59,220
them does anybody have all of these

4279
03:48:59,220 --> 03:49:00,300
things

4280
03:49:00,300 --> 03:49:02,460
you have all of them can you tell me

4281
03:49:02,460 --> 03:49:05,060
your home address

4282
03:49:07,979 --> 03:49:10,020
Google's out haven't you heard Chachi PT

4283
03:49:10,020 --> 03:49:11,340
is replacing it

4284
03:49:11,340 --> 03:49:15,000
so um hi my name is Sharon de grippo

4285
03:49:15,000 --> 03:49:17,040
um I've been an infosec for 18 years

4286
03:49:17,040 --> 03:49:19,140
leading threat research teams doing

4287
03:49:19,140 --> 03:49:21,120
detection development primarily Network

4288
03:49:21,120 --> 03:49:24,300
malware and threat intelligence I've

4289
03:49:24,300 --> 03:49:25,680
worked at companies like proofpoint

4290
03:49:25,680 --> 03:49:27,779
Symantec secureworks and I started out

4291
03:49:27,779 --> 03:49:30,180
in the federal government at nnsa under

4292
03:49:30,180 --> 03:49:33,000
Doe I live in Atlanta Georgia which is

4293
03:49:33,000 --> 03:49:34,859
also my hometown which is really rare if

4294
03:49:34,859 --> 03:49:36,479
you meet anyone from Atlanta ask them if

4295
03:49:36,479 --> 03:49:39,060
they're really from Atlanta I am my

4296
03:49:39,060 --> 03:49:41,040
favorite protocol is DNS anyone else

4297
03:49:41,040 --> 03:49:43,319
have their favorite protocols DNS

4298
03:49:43,319 --> 03:49:47,160
you in the back that's a great choice

4299
03:49:47,160 --> 03:49:48,899
um my second favorite protocol lately I

4300
03:49:48,899 --> 03:49:50,760
think has been DHCP because it brings me

4301
03:49:50,760 --> 03:49:52,560
back to my teen years when I couldn't

4302
03:49:52,560 --> 03:49:57,540
get dhcpd to work and I had to dhcpd.com

4303
03:49:57,540 --> 03:49:59,340
um I have a big screenshot collection

4304
03:49:59,340 --> 03:50:00,359
we're not going to look at screenshots

4305
03:50:00,359 --> 03:50:02,220
today but I think one of the things that

4306
03:50:02,220 --> 03:50:04,140
we will find valuable in your life is if

4307
03:50:04,140 --> 03:50:05,700
you take a lot of screenshots and

4308
03:50:05,700 --> 03:50:07,380
collect them because there are so many

4309
03:50:07,380 --> 03:50:09,359
times when you will go

4310
03:50:09,359 --> 03:50:12,239
I have a screenshot of that and it will

4311
03:50:12,239 --> 03:50:14,100
help you go far

4312
03:50:14,100 --> 03:50:16,380
um I have a dog that is him his name is

4313
03:50:16,380 --> 03:50:17,760
Boris Karloff

4314
03:50:17,760 --> 03:50:21,060
he is a alien space being and the best

4315
03:50:21,060 --> 03:50:23,100
thing to probably ever happen to me

4316
03:50:23,100 --> 03:50:24,779
um he's a great great little guy and I

4317
03:50:24,779 --> 03:50:27,300
am on the

4318
03:50:27,300 --> 03:50:30,000
the dumpster fire that is Twitter

4319
03:50:30,000 --> 03:50:32,220
um if you'd like to follow me I really

4320
03:50:32,220 --> 03:50:34,800
only talk about infosec dogs and um

4321
03:50:34,800 --> 03:50:36,600
lately a couple of other things but it's

4322
03:50:36,600 --> 03:50:38,939
pretty infosec heavy so

4323
03:50:38,939 --> 03:50:42,120
yet another quiz you're Exempted from

4324
03:50:42,120 --> 03:50:43,319
answering because I'm I think you're

4325
03:50:43,319 --> 03:50:45,720
some kind of ringer

4326
03:50:45,720 --> 03:50:48,600
so if you wanted to assemble your own

4327
03:50:48,600 --> 03:50:51,000
Wi-Fi Jammer how much money would you

4328
03:50:51,000 --> 03:50:53,399
need for components ten dollars a

4329
03:50:53,399 --> 03:50:55,859
hundred dollars a thousand dollars or

4330
03:50:55,859 --> 03:50:57,899
ten thousand dollars you're going with

4331
03:50:57,899 --> 03:51:00,359
ten okay you're going with 10 you're

4332
03:51:00,359 --> 03:51:01,979
going with ten has anybody in here ever

4333
03:51:01,979 --> 03:51:03,420
built one

4334
03:51:03,420 --> 03:51:04,920
you've built one that's how you know

4335
03:51:04,920 --> 03:51:09,800
okay well that answer is coming later

4336
03:51:09,960 --> 03:51:11,939
so what we're gonna do first is we're

4337
03:51:11,939 --> 03:51:13,140
going to look at something that happened

4338
03:51:13,140 --> 03:51:15,899
to me when I got a package stolen off of

4339
03:51:15,899 --> 03:51:17,399
my porch

4340
03:51:17,399 --> 03:51:19,200
I want all of you to solve the mystery

4341
03:51:19,200 --> 03:51:21,180
of this thief if you can we're going to

4342
03:51:21,180 --> 03:51:22,140
talk to the Atlanta police department

4343
03:51:22,140 --> 03:51:24,779
and get them arrested

4344
03:51:24,779 --> 03:51:26,040
so

4345
03:51:26,040 --> 03:51:30,960
first I ordered a package from Amazon

4346
03:51:30,960 --> 03:51:33,359
it didn't come it didn't come I kept

4347
03:51:33,359 --> 03:51:35,160
looking out on my porch it's not there

4348
03:51:35,160 --> 03:51:37,439
what's going on I asked the kids did you

4349
03:51:37,439 --> 03:51:40,140
see it no there's no package

4350
03:51:40,140 --> 03:51:42,479
so I said well let me look in the ring

4351
03:51:42,479 --> 03:51:44,760
doorbell and see because I have a ring

4352
03:51:44,760 --> 03:51:46,380
doorbell as was mentioned in the

4353
03:51:46,380 --> 03:51:47,580
previous slide

4354
03:51:47,580 --> 03:51:50,880
so here is my console I have a video

4355
03:51:50,880 --> 03:51:53,760
from 12 29

4356
03:51:53,760 --> 03:51:56,220
let's look at that video and see what's

4357
03:51:56,220 --> 03:51:57,180
there

4358
03:51:57,180 --> 03:51:58,560
you can see in the bottom right it's

4359
03:51:58,560 --> 03:52:00,239
small but there's a box there

4360
03:52:00,239 --> 03:52:03,479
that's my package okay it was delivered

4361
03:52:03,479 --> 03:52:06,899
there it is great so let me look at the

4362
03:52:06,899 --> 03:52:09,180
next video after it to make sure it's

4363
03:52:09,180 --> 03:52:11,279
still there we'll look at the

4364
03:52:11,279 --> 03:52:14,640
ha video does not exist

4365
03:52:14,640 --> 03:52:18,619
and then the package is gone

4366
03:52:18,960 --> 03:52:21,300
what happened where'd my package go and

4367
03:52:21,300 --> 03:52:22,560
why isn't there any video of it being

4368
03:52:22,560 --> 03:52:23,760
disappeared

4369
03:52:23,760 --> 03:52:26,540
aliens

4370
03:52:26,939 --> 03:52:28,260
so

4371
03:52:28,260 --> 03:52:30,920
what

4372
03:52:34,859 --> 03:52:36,540
I would hope I would at least see the

4373
03:52:36,540 --> 03:52:39,300
Box moving away or something

4374
03:52:39,300 --> 03:52:40,800
but what I found interesting about this

4375
03:52:40,800 --> 03:52:43,800
is that I did a standard bullying search

4376
03:52:43,800 --> 03:52:47,040
within video footage looking at two

4377
03:52:47,040 --> 03:52:48,960
different sides until I found the Middle

4378
03:52:48,960 --> 03:52:51,660
where it was there it was gone and

4379
03:52:51,660 --> 03:52:53,220
what's in between

4380
03:52:53,220 --> 03:52:55,080
somehow the video was not recorded by

4381
03:52:55,080 --> 03:52:58,920
ring why well ladies and gentlemen

4382
03:52:58,920 --> 03:53:02,100
I also have another iot system which is

4383
03:53:02,100 --> 03:53:04,739
my security system with more video so

4384
03:53:04,739 --> 03:53:06,239
let's take a look at the video that

4385
03:53:06,239 --> 03:53:08,580
happened at that same time of the

4386
03:53:08,580 --> 03:53:10,200
missing ring video this is on Simply

4387
03:53:10,200 --> 03:53:12,120
Safe so

4388
03:53:12,120 --> 03:53:14,520
this is where the video starts

4389
03:53:14,520 --> 03:53:17,760
predictable we see someone on my porch

4390
03:53:17,760 --> 03:53:19,920
goes up in my porch and disappears for a

4391
03:53:19,920 --> 03:53:21,359
minute

4392
03:53:21,359 --> 03:53:23,939
where did he go

4393
03:53:23,939 --> 03:53:28,260
hmm that's very strange this person oh

4394
03:53:28,260 --> 03:53:29,819
okay

4395
03:53:29,819 --> 03:53:32,580
he took my package

4396
03:53:32,580 --> 03:53:33,960
so

4397
03:53:33,960 --> 03:53:36,180
I don't know exactly what happened I'm

4398
03:53:36,180 --> 03:53:39,600
not a scientist or a cop but I know that

4399
03:53:39,600 --> 03:53:42,239
that moment was not captured on my ring

4400
03:53:42,239 --> 03:53:44,100
doorbell which is right by my door

4401
03:53:44,100 --> 03:53:46,500
whereas my security cameras which are up

4402
03:53:46,500 --> 03:53:49,200
pretty high did capture that moment so

4403
03:53:49,200 --> 03:53:51,600
what do we think happened there

4404
03:53:51,600 --> 03:53:54,060
I think that somebody used a Wi-Fi

4405
03:53:54,060 --> 03:53:56,460
Jammer to jam my ring doorbell because

4406
03:53:56,460 --> 03:53:58,140
they expected somebody to have a ring

4407
03:53:58,140 --> 03:53:59,279
doorbell

4408
03:53:59,279 --> 03:54:01,920
but they did not aim it high enough to

4409
03:54:01,920 --> 03:54:03,960
hit my SimpliSafe cameras because they

4410
03:54:03,960 --> 03:54:05,160
didn't think that they were there

4411
03:54:05,160 --> 03:54:06,779
they're hidden under my Eaves you can't

4412
03:54:06,779 --> 03:54:08,340
really see them and I don't think you

4413
03:54:08,340 --> 03:54:10,380
can jam two devices at once

4414
03:54:10,380 --> 03:54:11,640
so

4415
03:54:11,640 --> 03:54:14,700
Wi-Fi Jammers I got into it what's the

4416
03:54:14,700 --> 03:54:17,340
deal with these things

4417
03:54:17,340 --> 03:54:19,020
those of you who guessed ten dollars

4418
03:54:19,020 --> 03:54:21,000
were pretty much right you can actually

4419
03:54:21,000 --> 03:54:23,040
make one for as low as five but if you

4420
03:54:23,040 --> 03:54:25,199
want the higher quality items and you

4421
03:54:25,199 --> 03:54:26,939
want the nice solder you're going to

4422
03:54:26,939 --> 03:54:30,060
spend about ten dollars

4423
03:54:30,060 --> 03:54:31,979
they're illegal everyone says to me

4424
03:54:31,979 --> 03:54:33,239
share it

4425
03:54:33,239 --> 03:54:36,660
Wi-Fi Jammers are legal

4426
03:54:36,660 --> 03:54:39,439
you would never

4427
03:54:39,960 --> 03:54:42,960
stealing stuff from the porch like I

4428
03:54:42,960 --> 03:54:44,880
don't think people who are willing to go

4429
03:54:44,880 --> 03:54:47,100
up and grab a box off of someone's door

4430
03:54:47,100 --> 03:54:49,560
are super worried about like Pump Up the

4431
03:54:49,560 --> 03:54:54,019
Volume style FCC coming after that

4432
03:54:54,300 --> 03:54:57,660
so I do think projecting forward this is

4433
03:54:57,660 --> 03:54:59,040
something that we're really likely to

4434
03:54:59,040 --> 03:55:00,840
see in the future building these is

4435
03:55:00,840 --> 03:55:03,060
pretty easy porch Pirates are everywhere

4436
03:55:03,060 --> 03:55:05,880
why not Jam the ring doorbells come and

4437
03:55:05,880 --> 03:55:08,220
go as if you were never seen if I didn't

4438
03:55:08,220 --> 03:55:10,260
have that Simply Safe footage I would

4439
03:55:10,260 --> 03:55:12,180
still be wondering what the heck

4440
03:55:12,180 --> 03:55:14,220
happened to that box

4441
03:55:14,220 --> 03:55:15,840
but because I have extra footage I can

4442
03:55:15,840 --> 03:55:17,760
fill in the blanks now the next question

4443
03:55:17,760 --> 03:55:19,560
you might be asking did you call ring

4444
03:55:19,560 --> 03:55:21,779
and ask them where that video was I did

4445
03:55:21,779 --> 03:55:24,239
they had me do a full diagnostic on my

4446
03:55:24,239 --> 03:55:25,920
ring device it was found to be

4447
03:55:25,920 --> 03:55:28,979
functioning perfectly they had logs from

4448
03:55:28,979 --> 03:55:33,000
everything except that few minute time

4449
03:55:33,000 --> 03:55:35,819
span when it stopped recording

4450
03:55:35,819 --> 03:55:38,880
I can't think of any other hypothesis I

4451
03:55:38,880 --> 03:55:41,220
even talked to CNN Sean Lynn grass

4452
03:55:41,220 --> 03:55:43,620
called me from CNN and said what is

4453
03:55:43,620 --> 03:55:45,060
going on with this did you talk to the

4454
03:55:45,060 --> 03:55:47,100
police what's happening I didn't talk to

4455
03:55:47,100 --> 03:55:48,300
the police but I talked to my neighbors

4456
03:55:48,300 --> 03:55:50,100
they had missing packages and no videos

4457
03:55:50,100 --> 03:55:52,620
as well I think somebody has found a

4458
03:55:52,620 --> 03:55:54,120
pretty good scam to do in my

4459
03:55:54,120 --> 03:55:57,000
neighborhood unfortunately but now the

4460
03:55:57,000 --> 03:55:58,800
question is what am I going to do about

4461
03:55:58,800 --> 03:56:01,380
it here are some mistakes I made my

4462
03:56:01,380 --> 03:56:02,699
security cameras are battery powered

4463
03:56:02,699 --> 03:56:04,500
which means that's a bit of a

4464
03:56:04,500 --> 03:56:05,640
vulnerability right I got to change

4465
03:56:05,640 --> 03:56:07,380
those batteries

4466
03:56:07,380 --> 03:56:09,359
they're Wi-Fi connected they're not

4467
03:56:09,359 --> 03:56:11,220
hardwired I think that's something when

4468
03:56:11,220 --> 03:56:13,199
it comes to iot is going to be the easy

4469
03:56:13,199 --> 03:56:15,779
way out that manufacturers and companies

4470
03:56:15,779 --> 03:56:17,399
get us to go for that's going to

4471
03:56:17,399 --> 03:56:19,560
actually undermine what we're really

4472
03:56:19,560 --> 03:56:21,660
using these devices for oh just connect

4473
03:56:21,660 --> 03:56:23,279
it to your Wi-Fi

4474
03:56:23,279 --> 03:56:25,319
I don't care how reliable your Wi-Fi is

4475
03:56:25,319 --> 03:56:27,779
things like Wi-Fi Jammers minimum

4476
03:56:27,779 --> 03:56:30,540
interruptions and a lot of the providers

4477
03:56:30,540 --> 03:56:33,600
they will kind of slow your bandwidth

4478
03:56:33,600 --> 03:56:35,520
check your speed all the time because

4479
03:56:35,520 --> 03:56:37,260
when it's not being used they'll

4480
03:56:37,260 --> 03:56:40,680
de-prioritize you on qos

4481
03:56:40,680 --> 03:56:43,739
these devices don't get priority

4482
03:56:43,739 --> 03:56:45,239
and that means that you want to have

4483
03:56:45,239 --> 03:56:46,979
them hardwired when you can

4484
03:56:46,979 --> 03:56:48,540
I didn't pick up my package when I got

4485
03:56:48,540 --> 03:56:50,220
there it's my fault I get it I should

4486
03:56:50,220 --> 03:56:52,140
use an Amazon Locker I've learned some

4487
03:56:52,140 --> 03:56:53,939
lessons but one of the things that

4488
03:56:53,939 --> 03:56:55,439
really caught me was that in the

4489
03:56:55,439 --> 03:56:57,540
connected world we have pros and cons

4490
03:56:57,540 --> 03:56:59,580
one of the pros that I was able to kind

4491
03:56:59,580 --> 03:57:01,380
of figure out where the package went but

4492
03:57:01,380 --> 03:57:04,020
one of the cons was now I can't really

4493
03:57:04,020 --> 03:57:05,460
do anything about it and I've got to

4494
03:57:05,460 --> 03:57:07,500
upgrade the way that I operate

4495
03:57:07,500 --> 03:57:10,140
so what are we really protecting and

4496
03:57:10,140 --> 03:57:11,340
this is where

4497
03:57:11,340 --> 03:57:15,120
I hope all of you can kind of

4498
03:57:15,120 --> 03:57:18,120
get on this mindset with me because it's

4499
03:57:18,120 --> 03:57:19,560
really important and I want you all to

4500
03:57:19,560 --> 03:57:21,479
come with me on it so this is Bob

4501
03:57:21,479 --> 03:57:22,920
degrippo

4502
03:57:22,920 --> 03:57:24,540
you might notice that he shares my last

4503
03:57:24,540 --> 03:57:26,399
name

4504
03:57:26,399 --> 03:57:29,520
um he is 76 years old he will take me to

4505
03:57:29,520 --> 03:57:30,960
Home Depot three times a day if he had

4506
03:57:30,960 --> 03:57:32,520
the choice to do it

4507
03:57:32,520 --> 03:57:34,439
this is him in Home Depot he treats the

4508
03:57:34,439 --> 03:57:36,420
ladders like they're his personal Lounge

4509
03:57:36,420 --> 03:57:38,460
areas

4510
03:57:38,460 --> 03:57:41,640
um and this is my dad so I will try not

4511
03:57:41,640 --> 03:57:43,500
to cry I love my dad he's freaking

4512
03:57:43,500 --> 03:57:44,880
awesome

4513
03:57:44,880 --> 03:57:46,560
um so I bought a new house about a year

4514
03:57:46,560 --> 03:57:49,319
and a half ago and

4515
03:57:49,319 --> 03:57:51,779
the bottom left is my thermostat in my

4516
03:57:51,779 --> 03:57:53,880
new house that was already there from

4517
03:57:53,880 --> 03:57:55,140
the 50s

4518
03:57:55,140 --> 03:57:57,300
and

4519
03:57:57,300 --> 03:58:00,359
it would the heat button would only go

4520
03:58:00,359 --> 03:58:02,660
down

4521
03:58:03,359 --> 03:58:05,520
and as you can see the heat is set on

4522
03:58:05,520 --> 03:58:07,859
56.

4523
03:58:07,859 --> 03:58:09,960
because I would push up and nothing

4524
03:58:09,960 --> 03:58:11,580
would happen and I would go well does

4525
03:58:11,580 --> 03:58:14,880
the down work yeah

4526
03:58:14,880 --> 03:58:16,859
it does

4527
03:58:16,859 --> 03:58:20,100
so it kept getting colder and colder and

4528
03:58:20,100 --> 03:58:21,420
colder

4529
03:58:21,420 --> 03:58:23,399
and I finally ripped it off the wall as

4530
03:58:23,399 --> 03:58:24,779
you can see in the top

4531
03:58:24,779 --> 03:58:27,060
and I went and I bought a Google

4532
03:58:27,060 --> 03:58:29,939
thermostat on the right there

4533
03:58:29,939 --> 03:58:32,819
and I couldn't get it I was just I'm

4534
03:58:32,819 --> 03:58:34,140
pretty technical

4535
03:58:34,140 --> 03:58:36,660
I'm pretty mechanical I could not get it

4536
03:58:36,660 --> 03:58:38,760
to connect I was jamming these wires

4537
03:58:38,760 --> 03:58:40,520
into the back of this beautiful little

4538
03:58:40,520 --> 03:58:43,739
Sleek thing just jamming them in there

4539
03:58:43,739 --> 03:58:45,420
I could not get it to connect I could

4540
03:58:45,420 --> 03:58:48,660
not get it to work finally I call Bob to

4541
03:58:48,660 --> 03:58:49,739
grippo

4542
03:58:49,739 --> 03:58:52,260
I'm like Dad I cannot I cannot make this

4543
03:58:52,260 --> 03:58:53,819
thing work

4544
03:58:53,819 --> 03:58:57,420
I look at my phone he's FaceTiming me

4545
03:58:57,420 --> 03:58:59,100
share it

4546
03:58:59,100 --> 03:59:01,560
put it on put it on the video

4547
03:59:01,560 --> 03:59:03,600
so I'm showing my dad the thermostat

4548
03:59:03,600 --> 03:59:06,540
like this I'm showing him these wires at

4549
03:59:06,540 --> 03:59:08,340
the top and like it's just not working I

4550
03:59:08,340 --> 03:59:09,720
think it's broken I'm going to get a

4551
03:59:09,720 --> 03:59:10,620
different one

4552
03:59:10,620 --> 03:59:12,120
no

4553
03:59:12,120 --> 03:59:15,239
The Shield housing on the yellow wire is

4554
03:59:15,239 --> 03:59:18,720
covering too much of the copper

4555
03:59:18,720 --> 03:59:21,720
strip a little bit of that yellow off

4556
03:59:21,720 --> 03:59:23,520
wow okay Dad

4557
03:59:23,520 --> 03:59:25,080
so I strip a little bit of the yellow

4558
03:59:25,080 --> 03:59:28,500
off and jam it in there and it works

4559
03:59:28,500 --> 03:59:29,580
now

4560
03:59:29,580 --> 03:59:31,739
here's what's important about this story

4561
03:59:31,739 --> 03:59:33,060
anyone who cries I will give you a

4562
03:59:33,060 --> 03:59:34,140
dollar

4563
03:59:34,140 --> 03:59:35,460
here's what is important about this

4564
03:59:35,460 --> 03:59:36,600
story

4565
03:59:36,600 --> 03:59:39,359
my dad is freaking awesome

4566
03:59:39,359 --> 03:59:41,100
but what each of us in this room as

4567
03:59:41,100 --> 03:59:44,580
Defenders are protecting is not so much

4568
03:59:44,580 --> 03:59:46,800
my thermostat

4569
03:59:46,800 --> 03:59:48,779
but it's my ability to connect with my

4570
03:59:48,779 --> 03:59:50,460
father that lives six hours away in

4571
03:59:50,460 --> 03:59:53,040
another state who's 76 years old and

4572
03:59:53,040 --> 03:59:55,380
wants nothing more in the world to help

4573
03:59:55,380 --> 03:59:57,779
his daughter who he loves be warm in her

4574
03:59:57,779 --> 04:00:00,960
home even though he can't be there

4575
04:00:00,960 --> 04:00:03,600
that's what each of us do every day is

4576
04:00:03,600 --> 04:00:06,239
we make sure that those connections and

4577
04:00:06,239 --> 04:00:08,359
that safety and that relationship

4578
04:00:08,359 --> 04:00:10,979
functions and works the way that people

4579
04:00:10,979 --> 04:00:12,300
need them to

4580
04:00:12,300 --> 04:00:15,420
it's really easy to look at a pcap

4581
04:00:15,420 --> 04:00:18,120
and say oh this is malicious we should

4582
04:00:18,120 --> 04:00:20,520
block it oh this is fine let it go

4583
04:00:20,520 --> 04:00:21,420
through

4584
04:00:21,420 --> 04:00:23,420
but at the end of those Communications

4585
04:00:23,420 --> 04:00:27,060
are real human people that want to have

4586
04:00:27,060 --> 04:00:29,819
a connected human life experience right

4587
04:00:29,819 --> 04:00:32,040
that's why we have all these things in

4588
04:00:32,040 --> 04:00:33,779
our homes it's not because we love

4589
04:00:33,779 --> 04:00:35,819
computers which we might but it's

4590
04:00:35,819 --> 04:00:37,260
because we want to leverage them as

4591
04:00:37,260 --> 04:00:39,660
tools to make our lives better and this

4592
04:00:39,660 --> 04:00:41,279
isn't really about me putting an iot

4593
04:00:41,279 --> 04:00:42,720
thermostat which is a questionable

4594
04:00:42,720 --> 04:00:44,040
choice

4595
04:00:44,040 --> 04:00:47,699
I know I was cold

4596
04:00:47,699 --> 04:00:51,300
the point is the thing to remember is I

4597
04:00:51,300 --> 04:00:53,040
was able to have this connected close

4598
04:00:53,040 --> 04:00:56,580
experience with my old man father in

4599
04:00:56,580 --> 04:00:58,979
another state because he just facetimed

4600
04:00:58,979 --> 04:01:00,420
me and helped me

4601
04:01:00,420 --> 04:01:01,979
and those are the kinds of things that

4602
04:01:01,979 --> 04:01:03,660
when we protect people's credentials

4603
04:01:03,660 --> 04:01:06,120
when we protect data when we look at

4604
04:01:06,120 --> 04:01:07,560
Network traffic and we make sure that

4605
04:01:07,560 --> 04:01:09,359
it's only the good kind coming in and

4606
04:01:09,359 --> 04:01:11,640
out when we think about code and code

4607
04:01:11,640 --> 04:01:13,920
reviews when we do pen tests to make

4608
04:01:13,920 --> 04:01:15,540
sure the network is secure to make sure

4609
04:01:15,540 --> 04:01:17,040
that an organization is operating

4610
04:01:17,040 --> 04:01:19,620
securely when we do things to prevent

4611
04:01:19,620 --> 04:01:21,359
ransomware

4612
04:01:21,359 --> 04:01:24,300
what those things all lead to is humor

4613
04:01:24,300 --> 04:01:25,920
human interaction and connection that

4614
04:01:25,920 --> 04:01:27,300
really touches people and means

4615
04:01:27,300 --> 04:01:29,340
something to them that's the point of

4616
04:01:29,340 --> 04:01:32,279
being a Defender is to allow humans to

4617
04:01:32,279 --> 04:01:34,260
operate in a way that is satisfying and

4618
04:01:34,260 --> 04:01:35,880
fulfilling to them

4619
04:01:35,880 --> 04:01:38,040
and not let these machines control us

4620
04:01:38,040 --> 04:01:40,020
and make decisions for us and keep us

4621
04:01:40,020 --> 04:01:41,880
further apart

4622
04:01:41,880 --> 04:01:43,620
so

4623
04:01:43,620 --> 04:01:45,479
now

4624
04:01:45,479 --> 04:01:49,160
we're gonna do a little exercise

4625
04:01:49,160 --> 04:01:51,899
first we start with the question what

4626
04:01:51,899 --> 04:01:54,060
company hired the most iot engineers in

4627
04:01:54,060 --> 04:01:57,660
2022 Amazon Google alphabet Apple

4628
04:01:57,660 --> 04:02:00,420
Microsoft or Facebook meta

4629
04:02:00,420 --> 04:02:02,880
oh

4630
04:02:02,880 --> 04:02:05,880
that's not so easy as the last two

4631
04:02:05,880 --> 04:02:08,279
okay

4632
04:02:08,279 --> 04:02:10,739
so I'll give you a hint it is the

4633
04:02:10,739 --> 04:02:12,899
company that now owns all the house

4634
04:02:12,899 --> 04:02:15,319
robots

4635
04:02:15,420 --> 04:02:18,800
who owns the house robots now

4636
04:02:21,300 --> 04:02:23,160
so Amazon bought Roomba which was the

4637
04:02:23,160 --> 04:02:25,319
largest home assistant uh uh cleaning

4638
04:02:25,319 --> 04:02:27,479
robot company in the world and they also

4639
04:02:27,479 --> 04:02:30,420
hired the most iot engineers in 2022. so

4640
04:02:30,420 --> 04:02:32,399
if you want to work iot Amazon has a

4641
04:02:32,399 --> 04:02:34,380
place for you

4642
04:02:34,380 --> 04:02:37,260
but here's my question for all of you

4643
04:02:37,260 --> 04:02:39,720
does anyone in here want to be or is

4644
04:02:39,720 --> 04:02:42,979
currently a threat actor

4645
04:02:45,120 --> 04:02:48,420
I like that everyone's laughing as if no

4646
04:02:48,420 --> 04:02:50,520
no that there would never be a threat

4647
04:02:50,520 --> 04:02:52,260
actor in our midst okay good that's the

4648
04:02:52,260 --> 04:02:53,699
right answer

4649
04:02:53,699 --> 04:02:55,500
so

4650
04:02:55,500 --> 04:02:57,239
what I want to do is if you have a piece

4651
04:02:57,239 --> 04:02:58,439
of paper that's great if you want to

4652
04:02:58,439 --> 04:02:59,760
write it down on your phone if you want

4653
04:02:59,760 --> 04:03:01,199
to just keep it in your brain that's

4654
04:03:01,199 --> 04:03:04,260
okay too I want to walk with you on how

4655
04:03:04,260 --> 04:03:07,260
to build an iot attack and I want you to

4656
04:03:07,260 --> 04:03:10,080
think about what you would do if you

4657
04:03:10,080 --> 04:03:11,819
were a threat actor and I mean be super

4658
04:03:11,819 --> 04:03:14,399
devious I mean get horrible like just

4659
04:03:14,399 --> 04:03:16,199
dig down to the basis nature of

4660
04:03:16,199 --> 04:03:17,760
awfulness that you have and I know you

4661
04:03:17,760 --> 04:03:19,199
all have it

4662
04:03:19,199 --> 04:03:21,180
so who are you going to Target

4663
04:03:21,180 --> 04:03:23,399
who are you going after individuals

4664
04:03:23,399 --> 04:03:26,399
consumers business organizations or

4665
04:03:26,399 --> 04:03:28,620
governments so who are you really going

4666
04:03:28,620 --> 04:03:30,540
after

4667
04:03:30,540 --> 04:03:32,520
what device type do you like and it

4668
04:03:32,520 --> 04:03:34,140
doesn't have to be limited to the

4669
04:03:34,140 --> 04:03:37,380
devices here TVs appliances light bulbs

4670
04:03:37,380 --> 04:03:39,800
door locks robots the cars the the

4671
04:03:39,800 --> 04:03:43,500
washing machines the

4672
04:03:43,500 --> 04:03:44,880
um

4673
04:03:44,880 --> 04:03:47,520
any of the robot stuff anything that's

4674
04:03:47,520 --> 04:03:49,260
connected what device are you going to

4675
04:03:49,260 --> 04:03:51,779
try and Target think about that

4676
04:03:51,779 --> 04:03:53,939
and then what's your attack type

4677
04:03:53,939 --> 04:03:56,040
are you going to put on a botnet are you

4678
04:03:56,040 --> 04:03:57,540
going to disrupt it somehow like make

4679
04:03:57,540 --> 04:03:59,100
somebody's light bulbs Flash and really

4680
04:03:59,100 --> 04:04:00,899
spook them out

4681
04:04:00,899 --> 04:04:02,340
um are you going to take it and start

4682
04:04:02,340 --> 04:04:04,260
selling that access which is always an

4683
04:04:04,260 --> 04:04:06,359
option to make a little money are you

4684
04:04:06,359 --> 04:04:09,180
going to send messages over connected

4685
04:04:09,180 --> 04:04:13,260
speakers and tell people to buy Ovaltine

4686
04:04:13,260 --> 04:04:15,960
or whatever you want to do

4687
04:04:15,960 --> 04:04:18,779
and a classic one of course maybe maybe

4688
04:04:18,779 --> 04:04:21,239
a bit uncreative is put some ransomware

4689
04:04:21,239 --> 04:04:23,520
on those TVs you just got a new TV for

4690
04:04:23,520 --> 04:04:26,340
Christmas well now it's being ransomed

4691
04:04:26,340 --> 04:04:27,720
and you need to paste Bitcoin in order

4692
04:04:27,720 --> 04:04:30,600
to watch any shows on it

4693
04:04:30,600 --> 04:04:32,460
so and then let's talk about your final

4694
04:04:32,460 --> 04:04:34,319
goal right so that's your attack but

4695
04:04:34,319 --> 04:04:35,699
what are you really trying to get are

4696
04:04:35,699 --> 04:04:37,140
you trying to social engineer the public

4697
04:04:37,140 --> 04:04:39,060
do something with disinformation or

4698
04:04:39,060 --> 04:04:40,880
misinformation

4699
04:04:40,880 --> 04:04:43,620
disrupt the social fabric which is much

4700
04:04:43,620 --> 04:04:45,359
easier to do with these connected

4701
04:04:45,359 --> 04:04:47,760
devices than it is with a data breach or

4702
04:04:47,760 --> 04:04:51,000
with uh simply owning a remote Trojan on

4703
04:04:51,000 --> 04:04:53,699
a a host at somebody's house if you have

4704
04:04:53,699 --> 04:04:54,960
control of these you could really

4705
04:04:54,960 --> 04:04:57,180
disrupt Society in a lot of ways

4706
04:04:57,180 --> 04:04:58,800
or are you simply trying to get money

4707
04:04:58,800 --> 04:05:02,040
and maybe that's your your ransomware

4708
04:05:02,040 --> 04:05:04,020
capabilities maybe it's some spying

4709
04:05:04,020 --> 04:05:05,600
capabilities you could

4710
04:05:05,600 --> 04:05:09,479
compromise a home assistant type robot

4711
04:05:09,479 --> 04:05:10,680
like

4712
04:05:10,680 --> 04:05:14,279
um Amazon or Apple's robots you could

4713
04:05:14,279 --> 04:05:16,380
listen to what people talk about you

4714
04:05:16,380 --> 04:05:18,140
could sell sensitive conversations

4715
04:05:18,140 --> 04:05:20,399
really think about what you would do if

4716
04:05:20,399 --> 04:05:22,859
you were a threat actor so who are you

4717
04:05:22,859 --> 04:05:24,420
targeting because we can do a pretty

4718
04:05:24,420 --> 04:05:25,800
large attack I think we have the scale

4719
04:05:25,800 --> 04:05:28,080
to do it what device do you want to go

4720
04:05:28,080 --> 04:05:30,120
after or multiple

4721
04:05:30,120 --> 04:05:31,680
what kind of attack are you going to do

4722
04:05:31,680 --> 04:05:34,199
like what's the type of attack and then

4723
04:05:34,199 --> 04:05:37,199
what is your final goal in having that

4724
04:05:37,199 --> 04:05:39,899
control and doing that attack

4725
04:05:39,899 --> 04:05:41,460
got it

4726
04:05:41,460 --> 04:05:44,599
I want to think about it more

4727
04:05:45,120 --> 04:05:48,260
all right who wants to go first

4728
04:05:48,540 --> 04:05:51,180
yes over there you have to catch this

4729
04:05:51,180 --> 04:05:53,600
thing that's the first part

4730
04:05:53,600 --> 04:05:57,380
someone catch up for them

4731
04:05:59,819 --> 04:06:02,279
what do you got walking through it get

4732
04:06:02,279 --> 04:06:03,899
Evil all right I know I know this is

4733
04:06:03,899 --> 04:06:05,699
really bad I'm sorry no I want it I'll

4734
04:06:05,699 --> 04:06:08,040
go after x-ray machines x-ray machines

4735
04:06:08,040 --> 04:06:09,120
that's horrible

4736
04:06:09,120 --> 04:06:10,739
usually wrong that's a microphone by the

4737
04:06:10,739 --> 04:06:13,920
way oh uh yeah sorry x-ray machines a

4738
04:06:13,920 --> 04:06:15,420
lot of times you're on an XP or a

4739
04:06:15,420 --> 04:06:18,420
version of XP that's been turned into a

4740
04:06:18,420 --> 04:06:20,100
um that has much extra stuff on it and

4741
04:06:20,100 --> 04:06:21,660
usually hospitals are pretty bad about

4742
04:06:21,660 --> 04:06:23,520
anyways there's a lot of stuff where I

4743
04:06:23,520 --> 04:06:25,979
think it would be very vulnerable and

4744
04:06:25,979 --> 04:06:27,300
um

4745
04:06:27,300 --> 04:06:29,100
yeah especially with doctors having

4746
04:06:29,100 --> 04:06:31,080
their their Bobs everywhere they walk

4747
04:06:31,080 --> 04:06:32,699
into a room and their Bobs their

4748
04:06:32,699 --> 04:06:36,359
credentials and other things but they

4749
04:06:36,359 --> 04:06:38,340
are pretty weak so if you get into a

4750
04:06:38,340 --> 04:06:41,160
hospital system I believe that you could

4751
04:06:41,160 --> 04:06:42,899
because they're pretty weak and they're

4752
04:06:42,899 --> 04:06:45,420
on an XP you could take them over pretty

4753
04:06:45,420 --> 04:06:47,279
easily and the problem is they have a

4754
04:06:47,279 --> 04:06:48,779
lot of proprietary stuff on them so you

4755
04:06:48,779 --> 04:06:50,100
start messing with them you could get

4756
04:06:50,100 --> 04:06:52,979
them to do over radiation and kill

4757
04:06:52,979 --> 04:06:54,140
people

4758
04:06:54,140 --> 04:06:57,359
wow okay

4759
04:06:57,359 --> 04:07:00,739
so so anyways the final goal would be

4760
04:07:00,739 --> 04:07:02,819
civil destroy it would be disruption

4761
04:07:02,819 --> 04:07:04,380
it'd be a terrorist attack

4762
04:07:04,380 --> 04:07:07,500
okay so let's let's just quickly walk

4763
04:07:07,500 --> 04:07:09,359
through your scenario because I want to

4764
04:07:09,359 --> 04:07:11,819
make sure that we have it straight

4765
04:07:11,819 --> 04:07:13,739
remember you all said you were not going

4766
04:07:13,739 --> 04:07:16,439
to be threat actors when I asked and you

4767
04:07:16,439 --> 04:07:19,260
laughed at me for saying that so this is

4768
04:07:19,260 --> 04:07:21,540
a thought experiment so you're gonna go

4769
04:07:21,540 --> 04:07:24,420
after organizations essentially that are

4770
04:07:24,420 --> 04:07:27,180
Healthcare that have x-ray machines your

4771
04:07:27,180 --> 04:07:29,100
device type is x-ray machines that are

4772
04:07:29,100 --> 04:07:32,160
running vulnerable software like XP

4773
04:07:32,160 --> 04:07:36,300
your attack type is to increase their

4774
04:07:36,300 --> 04:07:37,739
functionality so that they are

4775
04:07:37,739 --> 04:07:40,680
physically harming people and your final

4776
04:07:40,680 --> 04:07:44,760
goal is Terrorism yeah okay

4777
04:07:44,760 --> 04:07:48,090
you guys can do better I bet nicer

4778
04:07:48,090 --> 04:07:49,260
[Applause]

4779
04:07:49,260 --> 04:07:51,540
I want to point out

4780
04:07:51,540 --> 04:07:55,520
she understood the assignment

4781
04:07:57,180 --> 04:07:59,340
who wants to try another one

4782
04:07:59,340 --> 04:08:01,680
we got way in the back how good is your

4783
04:08:01,680 --> 04:08:04,500
throwing slash catching skills

4784
04:08:04,500 --> 04:08:09,680
catch yes nice oh

4785
04:08:10,680 --> 04:08:12,840
good job all right so tell me

4786
04:08:12,840 --> 04:08:13,920
the target

4787
04:08:13,920 --> 04:08:15,479
I actually kind of approached it from

4788
04:08:15,479 --> 04:08:16,800
the back and I thought about the final

4789
04:08:16,800 --> 04:08:18,899
goal going that way and so I picked

4790
04:08:18,899 --> 04:08:20,520
civil disruption I really wanted to do

4791
04:08:20,520 --> 04:08:22,739
damage like I'm not talking disrupt for

4792
04:08:22,739 --> 04:08:24,600
a month I'm talking like it'd be known

4793
04:08:24,600 --> 04:08:27,420
for decades so I thought well I need to

4794
04:08:27,420 --> 04:08:29,399
disrupt the functionality of something

4795
04:08:29,399 --> 04:08:32,160
that really matters and you know

4796
04:08:32,160 --> 04:08:33,960
society's Three Square meals away from

4797
04:08:33,960 --> 04:08:36,060
Revolution so how about we disrupt

4798
04:08:36,060 --> 04:08:37,979
fridges people put a lot of food in

4799
04:08:37,979 --> 04:08:40,739
there it's expensive to replace if you

4800
04:08:40,739 --> 04:08:42,899
completely block out all the fridges or

4801
04:08:42,899 --> 04:08:44,760
as many fridges as you can get the food

4802
04:08:44,760 --> 04:08:46,500
inside's gonna rot people are going to

4803
04:08:46,500 --> 04:08:47,939
want to replace the fridge and the food

4804
04:08:47,939 --> 04:08:49,620
which the fridge isn't going to be easy

4805
04:08:49,620 --> 04:08:51,000
to replace and the food's going to be

4806
04:08:51,000 --> 04:08:53,040
gone so you put stress on food supply

4807
04:08:53,040 --> 04:08:55,800
lines you put stress on people's mental

4808
04:08:55,800 --> 04:08:58,020
well-being because they'll be hungry and

4809
04:08:58,020 --> 04:08:59,699
by doing that you're kind of targeting

4810
04:08:59,699 --> 04:09:01,620
individuals but I think it'd bleed over

4811
04:09:01,620 --> 04:09:04,199
into more stuff so and if you do that to

4812
04:09:04,199 --> 04:09:07,500
a more effective extent it'll extend on

4813
04:09:07,500 --> 04:09:09,660
longer not only are you stressing the

4814
04:09:09,660 --> 04:09:12,060
food now but you're putting stress on

4815
04:09:12,060 --> 04:09:13,439
food that's being planted now they're

4816
04:09:13,439 --> 04:09:15,359
not planting for that so it could really

4817
04:09:15,359 --> 04:09:18,180
Ripple and frankly food's expensive now

4818
04:09:18,180 --> 04:09:20,340
too you're hitting them financially

4819
04:09:20,340 --> 04:09:22,859
so you're you're essentially going for a

4820
04:09:22,859 --> 04:09:24,840
civil disruption and a kind of social

4821
04:09:24,840 --> 04:09:27,840
fabric tearing apart at the food supply

4822
04:09:27,840 --> 04:09:30,300
and people's ability to maintain Cold

4823
04:09:30,300 --> 04:09:33,420
Storage on perishables yeah yeah

4824
04:09:33,420 --> 04:09:36,020
okay that

4825
04:09:37,920 --> 04:09:39,720
that is great

4826
04:09:39,720 --> 04:09:42,300
um and I know that LG Samsung Maytag

4827
04:09:42,300 --> 04:09:45,359
KitchenAid there's like 12 different

4828
04:09:45,359 --> 04:09:46,920
leading brands that all have internet

4829
04:09:46,920 --> 04:09:49,800
connected fridges that not only can you

4830
04:09:49,800 --> 04:09:51,779
connect to remotely but you can have

4831
04:09:51,779 --> 04:09:54,000
them connect back out I'm sure have you

4832
04:09:54,000 --> 04:09:55,380
seen where the fridge posts on Twitter

4833
04:09:55,380 --> 04:09:57,840
because yeah mom takes away the phone

4834
04:09:57,840 --> 04:09:59,580
and she's posting from the Samsung

4835
04:09:59,580 --> 04:10:01,560
fridge they're also not thought of as an

4836
04:10:01,560 --> 04:10:02,760
attack Vector too so they're probably

4837
04:10:02,760 --> 04:10:04,620
not well defended I also think they're

4838
04:10:04,620 --> 04:10:07,020
not well defended in fact in 2016 proof

4839
04:10:07,020 --> 04:10:08,520
Point released a Blog that talked about

4840
04:10:08,520 --> 04:10:10,500
a fridge that was sending spam at mass

4841
04:10:10,500 --> 04:10:12,600
volume because it had been compromised

4842
04:10:12,600 --> 04:10:14,160
it's a great piece

4843
04:10:14,160 --> 04:10:15,620
all right

4844
04:10:15,620 --> 04:10:17,939
anyone else have a horror story they

4845
04:10:17,939 --> 04:10:19,739
would like to share

4846
04:10:19,739 --> 04:10:21,600
one more I think we had one more in the

4847
04:10:21,600 --> 04:10:23,720
back

4848
04:10:25,380 --> 04:10:27,600
all right tell us uh who you want to

4849
04:10:27,600 --> 04:10:29,880
Target what your devices are businesses

4850
04:10:29,880 --> 04:10:33,239
robots someone that does manufacturing

4851
04:10:33,239 --> 04:10:35,460
um I would want to hack in and uh take

4852
04:10:35,460 --> 04:10:37,199
Ransom there the G-Code that they're

4853
04:10:37,199 --> 04:10:41,279
using be able to sell that off or take

4854
04:10:41,279 --> 04:10:43,920
it hostage so that they cannot run their

4855
04:10:43,920 --> 04:10:47,040
manufacturing and in manufacturing a lot

4856
04:10:47,040 --> 04:10:49,080
of the people who are running that

4857
04:10:49,080 --> 04:10:51,960
equipment are not um they're sharing

4858
04:10:51,960 --> 04:10:53,000
that information

4859
04:10:53,000 --> 04:10:56,460
not not as readily as uh or keeping it

4860
04:10:56,460 --> 04:10:58,620
as secure and then taking that money to

4861
04:10:58,620 --> 04:11:00,180
move to some place that is

4862
04:11:00,180 --> 04:11:03,180
non-extraditable

4863
04:11:03,420 --> 04:11:05,220
I like that you have an escape plan

4864
04:11:05,220 --> 04:11:07,080
that's an important part that many of

4865
04:11:07,080 --> 04:11:09,479
these criminals did not include in their

4866
04:11:09,479 --> 04:11:12,120
plan

4867
04:11:12,120 --> 04:11:13,920
um and so let me understand too so

4868
04:11:13,920 --> 04:11:15,540
you're going to shut down some

4869
04:11:15,540 --> 04:11:18,960
manufacturing robots is the plan to get

4870
04:11:18,960 --> 04:11:21,840
Ransom from them to turn them back on

4871
04:11:21,840 --> 04:11:24,000
correct and then take that proprietary

4872
04:11:24,000 --> 04:11:25,140
information about how they're

4873
04:11:25,140 --> 04:11:27,779
manufacturing and sell it off to other

4874
04:11:27,779 --> 04:11:29,520
actors that will

4875
04:11:29,520 --> 04:11:32,160
you know some some uh

4876
04:11:32,160 --> 04:11:34,439
companies from countries that don't have

4877
04:11:34,439 --> 04:11:38,220
as much rigor as well okay that's what

4878
04:11:38,220 --> 04:11:40,680
we call a double extortion which means

4879
04:11:40,680 --> 04:11:41,819
you're going to Ransom them and then

4880
04:11:41,819 --> 04:11:43,140
you're also going to take their stuff

4881
04:11:43,140 --> 04:11:46,199
unless they pay you I like that

4882
04:11:46,199 --> 04:11:47,220
um

4883
04:11:47,220 --> 04:11:49,979
that's a good one that's a good one

4884
04:11:49,979 --> 04:11:51,899
uh I also like your escape plan to

4885
04:11:51,899 --> 04:11:53,580
non-extradable Country good luck with

4886
04:11:53,580 --> 04:11:54,420
that

4887
04:11:54,420 --> 04:11:57,540
anybody else want to share one more

4888
04:11:57,540 --> 04:11:59,699
all right we have um some over here I

4889
04:11:59,699 --> 04:12:01,439
think where is it at sorry I think we

4890
04:12:01,439 --> 04:12:03,479
had a couple over here in this row

4891
04:12:03,479 --> 04:12:06,180
everyone's really do it throw it here it

4892
04:12:06,180 --> 04:12:08,300

yes

4894
04:12:11,760 --> 04:12:15,060
okay all right

4895
04:12:15,060 --> 04:12:18,359
okay so I'm a bad country that wants to

4896
04:12:18,359 --> 04:12:21,660
take over our country okay and

4897
04:12:21,660 --> 04:12:24,899
um we have um we have thank you uh but

4898
04:12:24,899 --> 04:12:26,580
bombs and guns and all that they're a

4899
04:12:26,580 --> 04:12:29,399
waste so we come to Phoenix Arizona

4900
04:12:29,399 --> 04:12:33,420
where the only Emergency Management task

4901
04:12:33,420 --> 04:12:35,580
is to prevent

4902
04:12:35,580 --> 04:12:39,180
um power outage in a heat wave so like

4903
04:12:39,180 --> 04:12:42,359
why waste all you have to do is get into

4904
04:12:42,359 --> 04:12:44,580
those thermostats

4905
04:12:44,580 --> 04:12:47,819
get the now data centers and frozen food

4906
04:12:47,819 --> 04:12:50,340
have redundancy but people in their

4907
04:12:50,340 --> 04:12:54,000
homes do not in fact we're all like cars

4908
04:12:54,000 --> 04:12:56,399
in the parking lot if the AC is down so

4909
04:12:56,399 --> 04:12:59,520
you have mass casualties of individuals

4910
04:12:59,520 --> 04:13:02,520
now uh the power companies will get into

4911
04:13:02,520 --> 04:13:06,899
will will rebate Your Nest and they will

4912
04:13:06,899 --> 04:13:09,660
do demand management so they will Peak

4913
04:13:09,660 --> 04:13:12,060
shave and just kind of switch it off

4914
04:13:12,060 --> 04:13:14,520
during the peak so you don't break the

4915
04:13:14,520 --> 04:13:15,479
grid

4916
04:13:15,479 --> 04:13:18,300
but if somebody were to go the same way

4917
04:13:18,300 --> 04:13:22,260
and turn all the ACs on

4918
04:13:22,260 --> 04:13:26,040
and spica Peak the grid goes down second

4919
04:13:26,040 --> 04:13:28,020
they try to bring it back up again do it

4920
04:13:28,020 --> 04:13:30,000
again they will never get up off their

4921
04:13:30,000 --> 04:13:32,279
knees and it will only hurt people

4922
04:13:32,279 --> 04:13:34,859
so there's my story I love it and I want

4923
04:13:34,859 --> 04:13:35,819
to point out a couple of things about

4924
04:13:35,819 --> 04:13:37,560
this one that I really like number one

4925
04:13:37,560 --> 04:13:38,939
she did something that the rest of you

4926
04:13:38,939 --> 04:13:40,560
didn't mention you may have said it in

4927
04:13:40,560 --> 04:13:42,540
your head but you didn't call out she

4928
04:13:42,540 --> 04:13:44,580
already thought about what the Defenders

4929
04:13:44,580 --> 04:13:46,560
had been doing and what the mitigations

4930
04:13:46,560 --> 04:13:49,680
would be so commercial and data centers

4931
04:13:49,680 --> 04:13:51,720
have redundancy so the first thing that

4932
04:13:51,720 --> 04:13:53,160
she thought was those aren't good

4933
04:13:53,160 --> 04:13:55,260
targets because my exploit or my attack

4934
04:13:55,260 --> 04:13:57,060
won't necessarily be successful at

4935
04:13:57,060 --> 04:13:58,920
places that have redundancy capability

4936
04:13:58,920 --> 04:14:00,899
so I'm going to go after the more

4937
04:14:00,899 --> 04:14:03,420
vulnerable systems which are consumers

4938
04:14:03,420 --> 04:14:06,479
in their homes to spike the grid and

4939
04:14:06,479 --> 04:14:08,460
then shut down the ability to cool homes

4940
04:14:08,460 --> 04:14:11,100
in a very hot place in a hot time so I

4941
04:14:11,100 --> 04:14:12,479
really like the idea that you're

4942
04:14:12,479 --> 04:14:15,239
thinking what are the pre-built-in

4943
04:14:15,239 --> 04:14:17,880
mitigations at these targets that I need

4944
04:14:17,880 --> 04:14:20,100
to either get rid of that as a Target

4945
04:14:20,100 --> 04:14:22,260
option or find a way to get around those

4946
04:14:22,260 --> 04:14:24,600
mitigations that's pretty nice

4947
04:14:24,600 --> 04:14:26,460
okay as Defenders we're gonna think

4948
04:14:26,460 --> 04:14:28,739
about that first part that the threat

4949
04:14:28,739 --> 04:14:30,359
actors are then finishing the sentences

4950
04:14:30,359 --> 04:14:32,520
for there's a lot of murderers in this

4951
04:14:32,520 --> 04:14:34,140
room

4952
04:14:34,140 --> 04:14:38,960
only safe guys extradition guy so far

4953
04:14:39,180 --> 04:14:40,979
okay let's do one more I think we had

4954
04:14:40,979 --> 04:14:43,680
like one more right here uh two in front

4955
04:14:43,680 --> 04:14:45,920
of you

4956
04:14:49,800 --> 04:14:51,000
so

4957
04:14:51,000 --> 04:14:53,580
um I think I kind of took the same

4958
04:14:53,580 --> 04:14:55,199
approach as someone who was in the back

4959
04:14:55,199 --> 04:14:57,600
that was talking in terms of looking at

4960
04:14:57,600 --> 04:15:00,000
final goal and I wouldn't say this is

4961
04:15:00,000 --> 04:15:03,239
like a large scale type of attack but I

4962
04:15:03,239 --> 04:15:03,899
think

4963
04:15:03,899 --> 04:15:06,840
I would go straight for petty Revenge so

4964
04:15:06,840 --> 04:15:09,300
I'd attack my uh neighbor as an

4965
04:15:09,300 --> 04:15:12,858
individual I hate that

4966
04:15:15,720 --> 04:15:17,340
because I know there are people in this

4967
04:15:17,340 --> 04:15:19,140
room that work with me I would

4968
04:15:19,140 --> 04:15:22,739
absolutely never never do this but if I

4969
04:15:22,739 --> 04:15:24,239
were going to this is the thought

4970
04:15:24,239 --> 04:15:26,100
actually I'd go after my I'd go after my

4971
04:15:26,100 --> 04:15:27,000
neighbor

4972
04:15:27,000 --> 04:15:31,380
and I would uh look for like an Apple

4973
04:15:31,380 --> 04:15:34,260
Watch or Fitbit because those are really

4974
04:15:34,260 --> 04:15:37,080
just remotes for everything else in your

4975
04:15:37,080 --> 04:15:38,580
house

4976
04:15:38,580 --> 04:15:40,800
um I'd look for intercepting messages

4977
04:15:40,800 --> 04:15:43,080
between the person's phone and their

4978
04:15:43,080 --> 04:15:47,040
Fitbit or or their Apple watch and then

4979
04:15:47,040 --> 04:15:49,439
I'd also turn their alarms off like I'd

4980
04:15:49,439 --> 04:15:53,040
just be fairly heinous about turn off

4981
04:15:53,040 --> 04:15:55,979
their alarms so they're late for work

4982
04:15:55,979 --> 04:15:58,020
intercept messages to see if there's

4983
04:15:58,020 --> 04:15:59,580
sensitive information my neighbor's

4984
04:15:59,580 --> 04:16:02,580
probably having an affair so

4985
04:16:02,580 --> 04:16:05,220
I could resell that information

4986
04:16:05,220 --> 04:16:07,979
wow I love this okay so petty Revenge

4987
04:16:07,979 --> 04:16:09,840
the petty Revenge angle I love it gonna

4988
04:16:09,840 --> 04:16:12,779
be a nuisance annoy them and you believe

4989
04:16:12,779 --> 04:16:15,359
they're having an affair

4990
04:16:15,359 --> 04:16:17,460
so if they have any connected security

4991
04:16:17,460 --> 04:16:21,359
devices that do video you could catch

4992
04:16:21,359 --> 04:16:25,380
video perhaps at this affair and then

4993
04:16:25,380 --> 04:16:27,960
so double extortion is always the way to

4994
04:16:27,960 --> 04:16:29,640
go if you are ever extorting

4995
04:16:29,640 --> 04:16:32,399
blackmailing or ransoming somebody don't

4996
04:16:32,399 --> 04:16:34,380
stop at one

4997
04:16:34,380 --> 04:16:37,140
so what you would want to do is you want

4998
04:16:37,140 --> 04:16:39,060
to get the pictures of them having an

4999
04:16:39,060 --> 04:16:41,520
affair you tell the neighbor I have

5000
04:16:41,520 --> 04:16:43,739
pictures of you having an affair pay me

5001
04:16:43,739 --> 04:16:45,720
or I'm going to sell them or give them

5002
04:16:45,720 --> 04:16:48,359
away and then you tell the spouse I have

5003
04:16:48,359 --> 04:16:50,580
pictures of your spouse having an affair

5004
04:16:50,580 --> 04:16:52,979
pay me and I'll give them to you

5005
04:16:52,979 --> 04:16:56,100
always double your money good okay

5006
04:16:56,100 --> 04:17:00,239
great job divorce is expensive so I will

5007
04:17:00,239 --> 04:17:02,880
tell you mine because I just made this

5008
04:17:02,880 --> 04:17:05,220
up uh recently

5009
04:17:05,220 --> 04:17:06,960
um I'm used to doing a lot of threat

5010
04:17:06,960 --> 04:17:09,300
after psychology think like an attacker

5011
04:17:09,300 --> 04:17:10,800
that's kind of one of the things that

5012
04:17:10,800 --> 04:17:13,199
I'm really focused on understanding that

5013
04:17:13,199 --> 04:17:16,199
threat actor mindset and all of you seem

5014
04:17:16,199 --> 04:17:18,239
to really understand a Potential Threat

5015
04:17:18,239 --> 04:17:20,220
actor mindset you are devious devious

5016
04:17:20,220 --> 04:17:23,220
people congratulations on that

5017
04:17:23,220 --> 04:17:23,819
um

5018
04:17:23,819 --> 04:17:27,479
but mine is I went um a couple months

5019
04:17:27,479 --> 04:17:30,260
ago and I saw Lady Gaga at in Atlanta

5020
04:17:30,260 --> 04:17:32,880
and in order to do anything you had to

5021
04:17:32,880 --> 04:17:34,800
have these connected wristbands that got

5022
04:17:34,800 --> 04:17:36,899
you into the show you could pay for food

5023
04:17:36,899 --> 04:17:39,720
and merchandise with them and I think I

5024
04:17:39,720 --> 04:17:42,239
would attack those wristbands

5025
04:17:42,239 --> 04:17:43,920
I would make it so that none of them

5026
04:17:43,920 --> 04:17:46,859
worked except for mine and my friends so

5027
04:17:46,859 --> 04:17:49,680
no one else could get in and I would see

5028
04:17:49,680 --> 04:17:53,520
like Depeche Mode purely by myself

5029
04:17:53,520 --> 04:17:55,680
while all the other people are standing

5030
04:17:55,680 --> 04:17:58,140
outside like trying to swipe in

5031
04:17:58,140 --> 04:17:59,760
um so that I could have a private

5032
04:17:59,760 --> 04:18:03,560
concert I wouldn't kill anyone

5033
04:18:03,899 --> 04:18:09,019
but some of you would which is fine

5034
04:18:10,380 --> 04:18:12,720
so I think that a lot of you kind of

5035
04:18:12,720 --> 04:18:14,819
took away from that exercise first of

5036
04:18:14,819 --> 04:18:17,520
all everyone did fantastic I know that

5037
04:18:17,520 --> 04:18:18,899
um you would never actually hurt anyone

5038
04:18:18,899 --> 04:18:21,960
but the reality is the adversaries that

5039
04:18:21,960 --> 04:18:24,300
we face today absolutely will it's very

5040
04:18:24,300 --> 04:18:27,479
much a threat actor doggy dog kind of

5041
04:18:27,479 --> 04:18:30,300
situation if you read the Conti leaks if

5042
04:18:30,300 --> 04:18:32,100
you didn't I suggest you do but if you

5043
04:18:32,100 --> 04:18:34,920
read the Conti leaks you saw not only do

5044
04:18:34,920 --> 04:18:37,500
they operate professionally as a group

5045
04:18:37,500 --> 04:18:41,399
of criminals their organized crime

5046
04:18:41,399 --> 04:18:43,500
but they interweave with each other they

5047
04:18:43,500 --> 04:18:46,319
have Petty disputes with each other they

5048
04:18:46,319 --> 04:18:48,180
fight with each other while they're

5049
04:18:48,180 --> 04:18:50,460
working together it's really really a

5050
04:18:50,460 --> 04:18:51,600
criminal Enterprise it's pretty

5051
04:18:51,600 --> 04:18:54,120
Cutthroat and some of these ideas seem

5052
04:18:54,120 --> 04:18:56,220
horrifying to us but to the threat

5053
04:18:56,220 --> 04:18:59,100
actors they're just another way to get

5054
04:18:59,100 --> 04:19:01,800
paid to further their own Ambitions to

5055
04:19:01,800 --> 04:19:03,180
do something on behalf of a government

5056
04:19:03,180 --> 04:19:05,399
that they possibly work for

5057
04:19:05,399 --> 04:19:07,080
these are important things to think

5058
04:19:07,080 --> 04:19:10,620
about because as I said it really is

5059
04:19:10,620 --> 04:19:12,899
more than data now we've talked about

5060
04:19:12,899 --> 04:19:14,640
data breaches for a long time in

5061
04:19:14,640 --> 04:19:16,260
security and how terrible they can be

5062
04:19:16,260 --> 04:19:18,300
they are right you have to clean up

5063
04:19:18,300 --> 04:19:20,279
identity theft or credentials being

5064
04:19:20,279 --> 04:19:22,620
stolen but what we're talking about when

5065
04:19:22,620 --> 04:19:24,180
we start having a more connected

5066
04:19:24,180 --> 04:19:26,580
physical world when we start looking at

5067
04:19:26,580 --> 04:19:29,520
things that actually impact you and your

5068
04:19:29,520 --> 04:19:31,560
body and your ability to live and your

5069
04:19:31,560 --> 04:19:33,120
ability to move around

5070
04:19:33,120 --> 04:19:36,540
that's a different level of threat that

5071
04:19:36,540 --> 04:19:38,580
we all now need to think about and be

5072
04:19:38,580 --> 04:19:40,439
conscious of because it is kind of this

5073
04:19:40,439 --> 04:19:41,640
new world that we haven't thought of

5074
04:19:41,640 --> 04:19:42,720
before

5075
04:19:42,720 --> 04:19:45,300
and we have to think about that as part

5076
04:19:45,300 --> 04:19:47,460
of the new attack surface

5077
04:19:47,460 --> 04:19:49,859
and what I want all of you to do you're

5078
04:19:49,859 --> 04:19:51,840
here on a Saturday

5079
04:19:51,840 --> 04:19:53,699
this stuff matters to you and you can't

5080
04:19:53,699 --> 04:19:55,620
argue me out of that I know that all of

5081
04:19:55,620 --> 04:19:57,779
you take this really personally for me

5082
04:19:57,779 --> 04:19:59,760
information security is a calling in my

5083
04:19:59,760 --> 04:20:01,380
heart I know that sounds dorky and

5084
04:20:01,380 --> 04:20:02,279
whatever

5085
04:20:02,279 --> 04:20:06,060
but I feel a calling inside myself to

5086
04:20:06,060 --> 04:20:08,520
protect the human connections that we

5087
04:20:08,520 --> 04:20:10,500
can have with each other using

5088
04:20:10,500 --> 04:20:12,720
technology the idea that I can FaceTime

5089
04:20:12,720 --> 04:20:14,180
my dad and get help of my thermostat

5090
04:20:14,180 --> 04:20:17,160
something that was Unthinkable 10 or 15

5091
04:20:17,160 --> 04:20:18,479
years ago

5092
04:20:18,479 --> 04:20:21,660
it's really important to me that you and

5093
04:20:21,660 --> 04:20:23,939
I work together to make those connect

5094
04:20:23,939 --> 04:20:27,600
connections and relationships safe

5095
04:20:27,600 --> 04:20:29,220
and now that we have this whole other

5096
04:20:29,220 --> 04:20:31,500
attack surface to think about we're

5097
04:20:31,500 --> 04:20:32,819
going to have to work a lot harder to

5098
04:20:32,819 --> 04:20:34,500
keep things safe and we're all going to

5099
04:20:34,500 --> 04:20:36,420
have to sort of think about why we're

5100
04:20:36,420 --> 04:20:38,640
doing this because if you work in a sock

5101
04:20:38,640 --> 04:20:41,279
or if you work in architecture or if you

5102
04:20:41,279 --> 04:20:42,779
work in a situation that's really high

5103
04:20:42,779 --> 04:20:44,640
pressure you can start questioning why

5104
04:20:44,640 --> 04:20:47,640
you do it take care of yourself get that

5105
04:20:47,640 --> 04:20:49,560
balance but remember the reason that

5106
04:20:49,560 --> 04:20:51,120
you're doing it is for Bob to grippo so

5107
04:20:51,120 --> 04:20:53,220
that he can FaceTime me

5108
04:20:53,220 --> 04:20:55,020
and that I can make my thermostat work

5109
04:20:55,020 --> 04:20:57,239
and it's not just me right like there's

5110
04:20:57,239 --> 04:20:58,920
people like that in every one of your

5111
04:20:58,920 --> 04:21:00,660
jobs even if you don't see them talk to

5112
04:21:00,660 --> 04:21:02,220
them and know them when you're

5113
04:21:02,220 --> 04:21:03,779
protecting their data and protecting

5114
04:21:03,779 --> 04:21:05,760
these attack surfaces you're protecting

5115
04:21:05,760 --> 04:21:06,899
their ability to have those human

5116
04:21:06,899 --> 04:21:09,000
connections and you have to follow that

5117
04:21:09,000 --> 04:21:11,520
through we look at attack chains right

5118
04:21:11,520 --> 04:21:12,899
we look at an attack chain from the

5119
04:21:12,899 --> 04:21:14,699
beginning to the end we need to look at

5120
04:21:14,699 --> 04:21:16,140
protection chains from the beginning to

5121
04:21:16,140 --> 04:21:18,120
the end too you're not just protecting

5122
04:21:18,120 --> 04:21:19,979
that database or that server or that

5123
04:21:19,979 --> 04:21:22,319
Network you're protecting all of the

5124
04:21:22,319 --> 04:21:24,120
people that have to use it and depend on

5125
04:21:24,120 --> 04:21:25,680
it and rely on it

5126
04:21:25,680 --> 04:21:27,540
and that's really what that calling is

5127
04:21:27,540 --> 04:21:29,040
about and I hope that you can listen to

5128
04:21:29,040 --> 04:21:31,080
kind of what's inside of you to find

5129
04:21:31,080 --> 04:21:32,640
what part of that calling is pulling you

5130
04:21:32,640 --> 04:21:34,620
toward the work

5131
04:21:34,620 --> 04:21:36,120
so

5132
04:21:36,120 --> 04:21:38,520
uh I have time for questions

5133
04:21:38,520 --> 04:21:40,319
if you have questions

5134
04:21:40,319 --> 04:21:44,180
the other option is to sit quietly

5135
04:21:48,180 --> 04:21:50,340
anyone want the Box

5136
04:21:50,340 --> 04:21:54,080
we have one person that wants the Box

5137
04:21:57,899 --> 04:21:59,939
do you have any other information on the

5138
04:21:59,939 --> 04:22:02,520
person that was doing the uh

5139
04:22:02,520 --> 04:22:04,979
Wi-Fi jamming uh with the ceiling

5140
04:22:04,979 --> 04:22:06,000
packages

5141
04:22:06,000 --> 04:22:09,060
Oh you mean at my house yes that's

5142
04:22:09,060 --> 04:22:10,439
essentially all the information that I

5143
04:22:10,439 --> 04:22:13,100
have was what I captured

5144
04:22:13,859 --> 04:22:16,020
from CNN that interviewed me he also

5145
04:22:16,020 --> 04:22:17,460
talked to the Atlanta police department

5146
04:22:17,460 --> 04:22:19,380
and they had heard of tons of package

5147
04:22:19,380 --> 04:22:21,779
thefts in my my neighborhood but they

5148
04:22:21,779 --> 04:22:22,979
couldn't say whether there was a Wi-Fi

5149
04:22:22,979 --> 04:22:24,540
Jammer or not and the police actually

5150
04:22:24,540 --> 04:22:26,700
said to him aren't those illegal

5151
04:22:26,700 --> 04:22:30,430
[Laughter]

5152
04:22:32,460 --> 04:22:34,859
I think I think they met like you can't

5153
04:22:34,859 --> 04:22:38,100
buy them you can but really the

5154
04:22:38,100 --> 04:22:40,439
tutorials to make them are I think what

5155
04:22:40,439 --> 04:22:43,220
people are probably doing

5156
04:22:44,699 --> 04:22:46,439
do you have any more information about

5157
04:22:46,439 --> 04:22:49,399
the guys stealing us

5158
04:22:50,120 --> 04:22:52,340
no

5159
04:22:52,340 --> 04:22:56,359
I want that ring light back

5160
04:22:58,380 --> 04:22:59,880
what's your favorite part of the Conti

5161
04:22:59,880 --> 04:23:02,300
leaks

5162
04:23:03,479 --> 04:23:06,438
oh I've waited

5163
04:23:07,319 --> 04:23:08,340
waited what is my favorite part of the

5164
04:23:08,340 --> 04:23:09,600
country links it's impossible to pick a

5165
04:23:09,600 --> 04:23:11,399
favorite it's like the Oscar is [ __ ]

5166
04:23:11,399 --> 04:23:12,720
so

5167
04:23:12,720 --> 04:23:14,640
okay so for those of you that don't know

5168
04:23:14,640 --> 04:23:16,319
about the Conti leaks essentially Conti

5169
04:23:16,319 --> 04:23:18,600
is a ransomware group that

5170
04:23:18,600 --> 04:23:21,359
um declared its allegiance to Russia at

5171
04:23:21,359 --> 04:23:22,620
the beginning of the Russia Ukraine

5172
04:23:22,620 --> 04:23:25,020
conflict their ransomware group malware

5173
04:23:25,020 --> 04:23:27,420
operators they're very talented they're

5174
04:23:27,420 --> 04:23:28,380
quite good

5175
04:23:28,380 --> 04:23:30,180
they said hey we're Russian we're on the

5176
04:23:30,180 --> 04:23:31,620
side of Russia well there was a couple

5177
04:23:31,620 --> 04:23:33,239
people in the group operating as

5178
04:23:33,239 --> 04:23:34,500
criminals working with them doing

5179
04:23:34,500 --> 04:23:37,260
ransomware who said we're Ukrainian were

5180
04:23:37,260 --> 04:23:39,300
Ukraine and we're not going to take this

5181
04:23:39,300 --> 04:23:42,600
so they leaked all of the documents chat

5182
04:23:42,600 --> 04:23:44,760
transcripts everything internally from

5183
04:23:44,760 --> 04:23:46,560
this threat actor group that we have

5184
04:23:46,560 --> 04:23:48,479
been tracking I mean I don't know it's

5185
04:23:48,479 --> 04:23:51,380
crazy it's crazy

5186
04:23:51,479 --> 04:23:53,760
um and so at the time when I was working

5187
04:23:53,760 --> 04:23:55,439
at proof point we spent a lot of time

5188
04:23:55,439 --> 04:23:56,819
translating all that Russian into

5189
04:23:56,819 --> 04:23:58,500
English to understand it the

5190
04:23:58,500 --> 04:24:00,239
personalities really came out I think it

5191
04:24:00,239 --> 04:24:01,800
is a hundred percent worth taking a look

5192
04:24:01,800 --> 04:24:05,399
at that leak cash it's fascinating you

5193
04:24:05,399 --> 04:24:06,540
can put it through Google translate and

5194
04:24:06,540 --> 04:24:08,399
get the idea some of the things that

5195
04:24:08,399 --> 04:24:11,520
that they gave to us a gift as defenders

5196
04:24:11,520 --> 04:24:13,979
in is this insight into how these groups

5197
04:24:13,979 --> 04:24:16,260
work one of them is they are paid

5198
04:24:16,260 --> 04:24:21,000
salaries they are paid with paychecks by

5199
04:24:21,000 --> 04:24:22,979
the threat actor groups it's organized

5200
04:24:22,979 --> 04:24:24,899
crime when I say organized I mean just

5201
04:24:24,899 --> 04:24:27,660
as organized as anybody else's job I

5202
04:24:27,660 --> 04:24:28,680
think that was one of the things is

5203
04:24:28,680 --> 04:24:29,819
seeing how much everyone was getting

5204
04:24:29,819 --> 04:24:32,819
paid which was pretty good for

5205
04:24:32,819 --> 04:24:33,420
um

5206
04:24:33,420 --> 04:24:35,640
you know Russian salaries like it you

5207
04:24:35,640 --> 04:24:37,199
could definitely live really well off of

5208
04:24:37,199 --> 04:24:39,600
that second oh yeah how do they compare

5209
04:24:39,600 --> 04:24:40,150
to proof point

5210
04:24:40,150 --> 04:24:45,230
[Laughter]

5211
04:24:47,120 --> 04:24:49,680
I'll get this back

5212
04:24:49,680 --> 04:24:51,359
it's a good question

5213
04:24:51,359 --> 04:24:53,819
um I'm not going to live in Russia and

5214
04:24:53,819 --> 04:24:56,699
do crime if that's what you're asking

5215
04:24:56,699 --> 04:24:58,620
um so that was really interesting and I

5216
04:24:58,620 --> 04:25:00,060
think the Conti leaks are a gift to us

5217
04:25:00,060 --> 04:25:01,560
as Defenders because they give us that

5218
04:25:01,560 --> 04:25:03,600
inside perspective another thing that I

5219
04:25:03,600 --> 04:25:05,220
found that was interesting is that

5220
04:25:05,220 --> 04:25:07,199
people within that group were also

5221
04:25:07,199 --> 04:25:08,819
working with other ransomware groups so

5222
04:25:08,819 --> 04:25:10,560
they were employed with both and they

5223
04:25:10,560 --> 04:25:13,880
would cross code which allowed us to

5224
04:25:13,880 --> 04:25:16,920
give high confidence attribution to

5225
04:25:16,920 --> 04:25:20,220
these groups for these certain attacks

5226
04:25:20,220 --> 04:25:22,800
because we always wondered are they is

5227
04:25:22,800 --> 04:25:24,120
it the same guy working in the same

5228
04:25:24,120 --> 04:25:25,500
place and this was the first time we

5229
04:25:25,500 --> 04:25:28,260
were able to definitively say yes there

5230
04:25:28,260 --> 04:25:29,699
are multiple groups that are linked it

5231
04:25:29,699 --> 04:25:31,439
gave us a view into the initial access

5232
04:25:31,439 --> 04:25:33,720
broker landscape of who's selling access

5233
04:25:33,720 --> 04:25:35,540
to what who's the ransomware operator

5234
04:25:35,540 --> 04:25:37,979
who's selling things on the gray Market

5235
04:25:37,979 --> 04:25:39,060
that they don't know what happens

5236
04:25:39,060 --> 04:25:41,699
Colonial pipe is a great example

5237
04:25:41,699 --> 04:25:45,300
that attack was Shadow Brokers but

5238
04:25:45,300 --> 04:25:47,640
they said oh we didn't know that it was

5239
04:25:47,640 --> 04:25:49,800
a infrastructure pipeline for gas that

5240
04:25:49,800 --> 04:25:51,359
it would cause people to put gasoline in

5241
04:25:51,359 --> 04:25:52,979
tote bags or whatever did you guys see

5242
04:25:52,979 --> 04:25:54,960
that remember there are people yeah they

5243
04:25:54,960 --> 04:25:56,220
were like oh we didn't know that we're

5244
04:25:56,220 --> 04:25:57,359
sorry

5245
04:25:57,359 --> 04:25:59,520
and I think that that is actually true

5246
04:25:59,520 --> 04:26:02,699
they didn't know that but um yeah I

5247
04:26:02,699 --> 04:26:03,899
think the the content leaks are worth

5248
04:26:03,899 --> 04:26:05,520
checking out their bank it's nothing but

5249
04:26:05,520 --> 04:26:07,319
bangers all the way down it's it's full

5250
04:26:07,319 --> 04:26:09,540
chat transcripts of Russian threat

5251
04:26:09,540 --> 04:26:10,800
actors doing what Russian threat actors

5252
04:26:10,800 --> 04:26:13,640
do with ransomware

5253
04:26:15,659 --> 04:26:18,359
anything else

5254
04:26:18,359 --> 04:26:19,859
all right we can move straight to quiet

5255
04:26:19,859 --> 04:26:23,220

I wanted to keep playing right like

5342
04:41:34,680 --> 04:41:36,360
because you won and you wanted to play

5343
04:41:36,360 --> 04:41:38,160
with the next people you can do that

5344
04:41:38,160 --> 04:41:39,900
whenever you want to here's why I wanted

5345
04:41:39,900 --> 04:41:41,400
you to stand up and meet the people next

5346
04:41:41,400 --> 04:41:42,480
to you

5347
04:41:42,480 --> 04:41:43,920
because that's what this conference is

5348
04:41:43,920 --> 04:41:45,840
about meeting people it's about

5349
04:41:45,840 --> 04:41:47,820
introducing yourself to people and

5350
04:41:47,820 --> 04:41:50,340
what's weird is that if I had you all

5351
04:41:50,340 --> 04:41:52,080
get up and keep doing it keep doing it

5352
04:41:52,080 --> 04:41:53,520
keep doing until you you know we had

5353
04:41:53,520 --> 04:41:55,080
like the final round up here and

5354
04:41:55,080 --> 04:41:56,458
everything and it's like rock paper

5355
04:41:56,458 --> 04:41:58,940
you'd all be like

5356
04:41:58,940 --> 04:42:01,560
but if you all were to meet each other

5357
04:42:01,560 --> 04:42:03,420
in the hallway prior to this you

5358
04:42:03,420 --> 04:42:05,040
wouldn't even look at each other

5359
04:42:05,040 --> 04:42:06,780
go and talk to each other want to

5360
04:42:06,780 --> 04:42:08,458
introduce yourself to each other and

5361
04:42:08,458 --> 04:42:10,020
it's weird because human beings are like

5362
04:42:10,020 --> 04:42:11,878
that we're like stranger

5363
04:42:11,878 --> 04:42:13,740
stranger danger

5364
04:42:13,740 --> 04:42:16,020
I don't like it and so I want you to

5365
04:42:16,020 --> 04:42:17,878
raise your hand if you're shy where's

5366
04:42:17,878 --> 04:42:19,320
your hand if you're shy

5367
04:42:19,320 --> 04:42:22,200
all right so go ahead and put it down uh

5368
04:42:22,200 --> 04:42:23,458
what I'm about to talk about for like

5369
04:42:23,458 --> 04:42:29,180
the next 48 minutes is going to hurt you

5370
04:42:29,340 --> 04:42:31,500
you're going to feel uncomfortable with

5371
04:42:31,500 --> 04:42:33,240
all the things I say I'm pretty sure

5372
04:42:33,240 --> 04:42:35,458
that all the down arrows I get on on

5373
04:42:35,458 --> 04:42:37,260
YouTube of people are like I don't like

5374
04:42:37,260 --> 04:42:39,780
it is with people going no

5375
04:42:39,780 --> 04:42:42,180
no because your brain as I talk about

5376
04:42:42,180 --> 04:42:43,798
these things things your brain's gonna

5377
04:42:43,798 --> 04:42:49,100
go no that is no no Jason

5378
04:42:49,100 --> 04:42:51,360
no so what we're going to do is we're

5379
04:42:51,360 --> 04:42:52,620
going to talk about job hunting like a

5380
04:42:52,620 --> 04:42:55,920
hacker uh so I a long time ago just to

5381
04:42:55,920 --> 04:42:57,600
give you a real brief you know history

5382
04:42:57,600 --> 04:43:00,360
of me I taught at a film School in Full

5383
04:43:00,360 --> 04:43:02,820

in Florida I taught it film it taught

5385
04:43:05,160 --> 04:43:07,138
content creation and filmmaking and what

5386
04:43:07,138 --> 04:43:08,520
happened is I had classrooms just like

5387
04:43:08,520 --> 04:43:10,020
you you know people sit in classrooms

5388
04:43:10,020 --> 04:43:11,218
and they all wanted to be in the film

5389
04:43:11,218 --> 04:43:12,958
industry and the film industry is not

5390
04:43:12,958 --> 04:43:15,718
easy it's not easy at all and so in

5391
04:43:15,718 --> 04:43:17,100
order to work in the film industry you

5392
04:43:17,100 --> 04:43:19,560
have to constantly work on gigs like you

5393
04:43:19,560 --> 04:43:21,298
have a three-day job

5394
04:43:21,298 --> 04:43:23,218
that's how long your job is three days

5395
04:43:23,218 --> 04:43:24,600
and then you have a two-day job and then

5396
04:43:24,600 --> 04:43:25,620
you have a one day job and then you

5397
04:43:25,620 --> 04:43:27,360
don't work for six weeks and then you

5398
04:43:27,360 --> 04:43:28,680
work for two days and then you work for

5399
04:43:28,680 --> 04:43:30,060
one day and then you don't work for six

5400
04:43:30,060 --> 04:43:31,860
weeks like that's how filmmaking

5401
04:43:31,860 --> 04:43:34,740
industry works like it's gig economy you

5402
04:43:34,740 --> 04:43:36,360
work you work you work so the only way

5403
04:43:36,360 --> 04:43:37,980
to get jobs is to meet people to

5404
04:43:37,980 --> 04:43:39,420
introduce yourself to people to network

5405
04:43:39,420 --> 04:43:41,400
with people constantly over and over and

5406
04:43:41,400 --> 04:43:44,040
over and over and over again and so you

5407
04:43:44,040 --> 04:43:46,560
have to be comfortable with being able

5408
04:43:46,560 --> 04:43:49,138
to be rejected

5409
04:43:49,138 --> 04:43:51,000
and that's what most of us have a hard

5410
04:43:51,000 --> 04:43:52,920
time being we don't like to be rejected

5411
04:43:52,920 --> 04:43:55,440
and so when you're job hunting it's all

5412
04:43:55,440 --> 04:43:56,280
that

5413
04:43:56,280 --> 04:43:59,820
it's constant rejection I sent something

5414
04:43:59,820 --> 04:44:02,520
no one responded they must hate me and

5415
04:44:02,520 --> 04:44:04,260
they think I'm terrible

5416
04:44:04,260 --> 04:44:05,940
like that's what happens in your brain

5417
04:44:05,940 --> 04:44:08,580
so I need you today as we talk about

5418
04:44:08,580 --> 04:44:10,020
these things you're going to have a hard

5419
04:44:10,020 --> 04:44:11,400
time with some of the stuff because you

5420
04:44:11,400 --> 04:44:13,020
have to go against all the things your

5421
04:44:13,020 --> 04:44:14,820
brain is telling you it's literally

5422
04:44:14,820 --> 04:44:17,160
called cognitive dissonance

5423
04:44:17,160 --> 04:44:19,500
cognitive dissonance is where your brain

5424
04:44:19,500 --> 04:44:21,718
believes a certain thing I'm introducing

5425
04:44:21,718 --> 04:44:23,218
new things and your brain's going to go

5426
04:44:23,218 --> 04:44:26,940
no oh and that's fine

5427
04:44:26,940 --> 04:44:28,680
at the end of this you may like walk out

5428
04:44:28,680 --> 04:44:30,780
here and go that guy was an idiot

5429
04:44:30,780 --> 04:44:32,820
I didn't like any of that stuff and some

5430
04:44:32,820 --> 04:44:33,840
of you might walk out here and go like

5431
04:44:33,840 --> 04:44:35,100
I'm going to use all that stuff and I'm

5432
04:44:35,100 --> 04:44:36,240
going to get the best damn job I ever

5433
04:44:36,240 --> 04:44:38,000
had and there's somewhere in between

5434
04:44:38,000 --> 04:44:40,560
right so what we're going to do today is

5435
04:44:40,560 --> 04:44:41,580
we're going to talk about job hunting

5436
04:44:41,580 --> 04:44:43,080
like a hacker my name is Jason Blanchard

5437
04:44:43,080 --> 04:44:45,360
I go by banjo crash land on the Internet

5438
04:44:45,360 --> 04:44:47,218
it's just an anagram for Jason Blanchard

5439
04:44:47,218 --> 04:44:49,138
if you mix all letters together and you

5440
04:44:49,138 --> 04:44:50,700
know people like do you like banjos and

5441
04:44:50,700 --> 04:44:51,780
I was like no

5442
04:44:51,780 --> 04:44:54,060
no not at all okay so what we're going

5443
04:44:54,060 --> 04:44:55,320
to do today is we're going to Target

5444
04:44:55,320 --> 04:44:56,638
companies

5445
04:44:56,638 --> 04:44:59,040
we're going to Target companies so my

5446
04:44:59,040 --> 04:45:01,138
background is in filmmaking and helping

5447
04:45:01,138 --> 04:45:03,180
film students and people get jobs in the

5448
04:45:03,180 --> 04:45:05,280
film industry and so I got real good at

5449
04:45:05,280 --> 04:45:06,958
networking meeting people introducing

5450
04:45:06,958 --> 04:45:08,700
myself all that stuff teaching people to

5451
04:45:08,700 --> 04:45:10,500
do that Network meet people introduce

5452
04:45:10,500 --> 04:45:11,458
themselves

5453
04:45:11,458 --> 04:45:13,138
and then when I got into the cyber

5454
04:45:13,138 --> 04:45:14,580
security industry

5455
04:45:14,580 --> 04:45:16,620
I got introduced to the pen test

5456
04:45:16,620 --> 04:45:18,420
methodology

5457
04:45:18,420 --> 04:45:20,700
of reconnaissance and exploitation and

5458
04:45:20,700 --> 04:45:22,680
post-exploitation and all this stuff and

5459
04:45:22,680 --> 04:45:24,360
I was like wait a second

5460
04:45:24,360 --> 04:45:26,820
that's job hunting

5461
04:45:26,820 --> 04:45:29,040
if you target companies if you try to

5462
04:45:29,040 --> 04:45:30,840
figure out how to get into a company if

5463
04:45:30,840 --> 04:45:32,878
you start figuring out ways to bypass

5464
04:45:32,878 --> 04:45:35,580
the normal ways of getting hired like if

5465
04:45:35,580 --> 04:45:37,740
you create a custom exploit which is a

5466
04:45:37,740 --> 04:45:40,080
resume that's made specifically for job

5467
04:45:40,080 --> 04:45:42,298
description instead of one job like

5468
04:45:42,298 --> 04:45:44,400
imagine having like one exploit and you

5469
04:45:44,400 --> 04:45:45,600
just throw it everywhere and see if it

5470
04:45:45,600 --> 04:45:48,180
works or if you have one you're like I

5471
04:45:48,180 --> 04:45:50,400
know it's going to work for this and so

5472
04:45:50,400 --> 04:45:52,020
job descriptions become your like

5473
04:45:52,020 --> 04:45:53,580
framework for how to write your resume

5474
04:45:53,580 --> 04:45:55,980
instead of writing a resume

5475
04:45:55,980 --> 04:45:57,958
look at a job description and then just

5476
04:45:57,958 --> 04:45:58,760
go

5477
04:45:58,760 --> 04:46:01,440
yeah I got all that stuff

5478
04:46:01,440 --> 04:46:03,840
and then instead of just applying at the

5479
04:46:03,840 --> 04:46:05,218
company's website or applying on

5480
04:46:05,218 --> 04:46:07,680
LinkedIn no you go to the company's

5481
04:46:07,680 --> 04:46:09,780
website you figure out everything about

5482
04:46:09,780 --> 04:46:12,060
that company you read press releases

5483
04:46:12,060 --> 04:46:13,920
about that company you find out the

5484
04:46:13,920 --> 04:46:15,600
executives that work there you track

5485
04:46:15,600 --> 04:46:17,520
them down on LinkedIn you find out all

5486
04:46:17,520 --> 04:46:19,378
their connections you connect with all

5487
04:46:19,378 --> 04:46:20,760
their connections and then all of a

5488
04:46:20,760 --> 04:46:22,740
sudden they're like I keep hearing about

5489
04:46:22,740 --> 04:46:24,900
you everywhere I go why don't we have

5490
04:46:24,900 --> 04:46:26,878
you working here you're like that's

5491
04:46:26,878 --> 04:46:29,120
right

5492
04:46:31,440 --> 04:46:34,378
and then lastly it's like a report right

5493
04:46:34,378 --> 04:46:36,060
in pen testing you always write a report

5494
04:46:36,060 --> 04:46:37,920
you know you don't just like I did a

5495
04:46:37,920 --> 04:46:39,540
bunch of hacks

5496
04:46:39,540 --> 04:46:41,760
no you write down all the things you did

5497
04:46:41,760 --> 04:46:43,620
so you keep track of what you're doing

5498
04:46:43,620 --> 04:46:45,360
at job hunting because some of you if

5499
04:46:45,360 --> 04:46:47,100
you've been job hunting or you're about

5500
04:46:47,100 --> 04:46:49,200
to be job hunting or unfortunately

5501
04:46:49,200 --> 04:46:50,580
you're about to be job hunting or

5502
04:46:50,580 --> 04:46:52,680
whatever the case is like there's times

5503
04:46:52,680 --> 04:46:54,360
where it's been like that's three months

5504
04:46:54,360 --> 04:46:56,040
I spent I've been unemployed for three

5505
04:46:56,040 --> 04:46:58,138
months and nothing's working you're like

5506
04:46:58,138 --> 04:47:00,120
really did you keep track of all the

5507
04:47:00,120 --> 04:47:01,798
things that's not working did you follow

5508
04:47:01,798 --> 04:47:03,180
up with some of the people because

5509
04:47:03,180 --> 04:47:04,500
here's for somebody right now if you're

5510
04:47:04,500 --> 04:47:06,420
job hunting and you're like hey I sent

5511
04:47:06,420 --> 04:47:08,580
an email a month ago and they never got

5512
04:47:08,580 --> 04:47:10,740
back to me and my first like did you

5513
04:47:10,740 --> 04:47:12,958
send a follow-up

5514
04:47:12,958 --> 04:47:15,180
okay cool you sent the follow-up did you

5515
04:47:15,180 --> 04:47:16,980
send a second follow-up

5516
04:47:16,980 --> 04:47:19,878
a second follow-up isn't that harassment

5517
04:47:19,878 --> 04:47:25,820
well maybe depending on the email

5518
04:47:26,820 --> 04:47:29,400
but no I like can see the thing about

5519
04:47:29,400 --> 04:47:31,500
job hunting is it's like it's sales and

5520
04:47:31,500 --> 04:47:33,660
marketing I'm sorry

5521
04:47:33,660 --> 04:47:35,218
it's sales and marketing you're

5522
04:47:35,218 --> 04:47:36,718
marketing yourself you're selling your

5523
04:47:36,718 --> 04:47:38,458
services to a company you're doing sales

5524
04:47:38,458 --> 04:47:40,440
and marketing and in sales and marketing

5525
04:47:40,440 --> 04:47:42,840
you follow up with people you don't

5526
04:47:42,840 --> 04:47:44,400
assume they got it the very first time

5527
04:47:44,400 --> 04:47:47,340
in fact the thing about marketing oh God

5528
04:47:47,340 --> 04:47:48,900
I work in marketing the thing about

5529
04:47:48,900 --> 04:47:51,180
marketing is this I send out let's say

5530
04:47:51,180 --> 04:47:55,320
100 emails how many how many of those

5531
04:47:55,320 --> 04:47:56,520
emails do you think people are going to

5532
04:47:56,520 --> 04:47:58,680
open I sent a hundred throw out some

5533
04:47:58,680 --> 04:48:00,718
numbers how many of those out of the 100

5534
04:48:00,718 --> 04:48:03,798
you think people will open

5535
04:48:05,520 --> 04:48:06,718
well

5536
04:48:06,718 --> 04:48:10,138
it depends on the subject line

5537
04:48:10,138 --> 04:48:12,420
if that subject line sucks it's like

5538
04:48:12,420 --> 04:48:13,680
three percent

5539
04:48:13,680 --> 04:48:16,138
subject line is good maybe 15 if it's

5540
04:48:16,138 --> 04:48:19,620
superb it's 30 if you like me it might

5541
04:48:19,620 --> 04:48:22,138
be 35 percent

5542
04:48:22,138 --> 04:48:24,298
so when you're sending things out into

5543
04:48:24,298 --> 04:48:26,280
the void how many responses do you think

5544
04:48:26,280 --> 04:48:28,020
you should get

5545
04:48:28,020 --> 04:48:30,240
it's not that many and so what most of

5546
04:48:30,240 --> 04:48:31,740
us were job hunting we're like well we

5547
04:48:31,740 --> 04:48:34,020
sent 100 like resumes out

5548
04:48:34,020 --> 04:48:35,820
I've only heard back from two people I'm

5549
04:48:35,820 --> 04:48:37,560
like

5550
04:48:37,560 --> 04:48:39,780
that's pretty good

5551
04:48:39,780 --> 04:48:43,440
not bad and so the expectations of these

5552
04:48:43,440 --> 04:48:45,718
things so we're going to get into all

5553
04:48:45,718 --> 04:48:46,980
that right now and I'm actually going to

5554
04:48:46,980 --> 04:48:48,480
go back up to the stage and hopefully

5555
04:48:48,480 --> 04:48:49,980
don't fall down

5556
04:48:49,980 --> 04:48:52,080
all right here we go so I'm gonna do

5557
04:48:52,080 --> 04:48:54,840
live demos today I'm gonna do live demos

5558
04:48:54,840 --> 04:48:56,580
I'm going to unlock that

5559
04:48:56,580 --> 04:48:57,900
all right does anyone here ever seen

5560
04:48:57,900 --> 04:49:00,060
LinkedIn

5561
04:49:00,060 --> 04:49:03,840
cool so do recruiters okay so recruiters

5562
04:49:03,840 --> 04:49:05,580
use LinkedIn and if those 22

5563
04:49:05,580 --> 04:49:07,560
notifications at the top bother you they

5564
04:49:07,560 --> 04:49:10,980
don't bother me and I'll be fine okay so

5565
04:49:10,980 --> 04:49:14,280
on LinkedIn is everything that you need

5566
04:49:14,280 --> 04:49:16,320
to start researching and figuring out

5567
04:49:16,320 --> 04:49:18,660
where you want to work now what we're

5568
04:49:18,660 --> 04:49:20,760
going to do first and this goes against

5569
04:49:20,760 --> 04:49:22,740
what most of you believe about job

5570
04:49:22,740 --> 04:49:25,378
hunting is instead of going to search

5571
04:49:25,378 --> 04:49:27,480
for jobs we're going to figure out the

5572
04:49:27,480 --> 04:49:29,820
companies we want to Target first

5573
04:49:29,820 --> 04:49:31,798
instead of searching for jobs you're

5574
04:49:31,798 --> 04:49:33,600
going to figure out the target companies

5575
04:49:33,600 --> 04:49:35,878
you want to work for because there's a

5576
04:49:35,878 --> 04:49:37,500
difference I don't know how many of you

5577
04:49:37,500 --> 04:49:39,958
are here in your 40s

5578
04:49:39,958 --> 04:49:43,200
Okay cool so when I was a teenager if I

5579
04:49:43,200 --> 04:49:45,360
wanted a job I literally had to get in a

5580
04:49:45,360 --> 04:49:47,878
car and drive around town and look for

5581
04:49:47,878 --> 04:49:50,580
Help Wanted signs I had to look for Help

5582
04:49:50,580 --> 04:49:52,560
Wanted signs and when I saw one I would

5583
04:49:52,560 --> 04:49:54,958
like stop the car go inside I'd fill out

5584
04:49:54,958 --> 04:49:56,940
an application and then wait for them to

5585
04:49:56,940 --> 04:49:59,760
contact me that's how job hunting in the

5586
04:49:59,760 --> 04:50:01,798
90s worked now some of you may be a

5587
04:50:01,798 --> 04:50:02,820
little older than that and you're like

5588
04:50:02,820 --> 04:50:04,378
oh that 80s Jason you should have seen

5589
04:50:04,378 --> 04:50:07,440
the 80s but in the 90s you drove around

5590
04:50:07,440 --> 04:50:09,000
you look for Help Wanted signs and then

5591
04:50:09,000 --> 04:50:11,638
the internet came along and that's now

5592
04:50:11,638 --> 04:50:13,560
what it's like to just drive around and

5593
04:50:13,560 --> 04:50:15,900
look for Help Wanted signs LinkedIn is

5594
04:50:15,900 --> 04:50:17,400
driving around looking for help wanted

5595
04:50:17,400 --> 04:50:20,340
signs and most of you don't want to work

5596
04:50:20,340 --> 04:50:23,280
those places like imagine driving around

5597
04:50:23,280 --> 04:50:24,840
your town and seeing like a crappy

5598
04:50:24,840 --> 04:50:26,218
restaurant with a help wanted sign

5599
04:50:26,218 --> 04:50:29,218
you're like all right

5600
04:50:29,218 --> 04:50:32,340
let's go and that's what most of you

5601
04:50:32,340 --> 04:50:33,480
don't even know the names of the

5602
04:50:33,480 --> 04:50:35,160
companies you just see a job description

5603
04:50:35,160 --> 04:50:36,900
you just see well hey all right I'm

5604

going to apply

5605
04:50:38,458 --> 04:50:39,900
that's not where you want to work you

5606
04:50:39,900 --> 04:50:41,580
want to work someplace that's cool you

5607
04:50:41,580 --> 04:50:42,780
want to work someplace that you know

5608

someplace that you recognize someplace

5609
04:50:44,280 --> 04:50:46,920

5610
04:50:46,920 --> 04:50:48,600

Intel

5642
04:51:59,760 --> 04:52:02,100
they just had a massive uh drop in their

5643
04:52:02,100 --> 04:52:04,920
stock price they might be yep

5644
04:52:04,920 --> 04:52:07,680
Disney okay okay

5645
04:52:07,680 --> 04:52:10,138
not Intel Disney that is

5646
04:52:10,138 --> 04:52:12,660
that's something different okay so we

5647
04:52:12,660 --> 04:52:14,340
have our top 10 companies up here I'm

5648
04:52:14,340 --> 04:52:16,440
gonna shrink a little bit

5649
04:52:16,440 --> 04:52:18,180
now how many of you have ever job hunted

5650
04:52:18,180 --> 04:52:19,560
like this you put a list together of the

5651
04:52:19,560 --> 04:52:20,700
companies you want to work for and you

5652
04:52:20,700 --> 04:52:21,958
go look for them

5653
04:52:21,958 --> 04:52:24,718
yeah got a couple hands cool most of you

5654
04:52:24,718 --> 04:52:26,340
do the driving around thing looking for

5655
04:52:26,340 --> 04:52:28,080
help wanted signs and that's okay that's

5656
04:52:28,080 --> 04:52:30,480
what you did let's think about what we

5657
04:52:30,480 --> 04:52:33,060
can do next time sorry so it's the top

5658
04:52:33,060 --> 04:52:36,600
10 list and guess what you do next

5659
04:52:36,600 --> 04:52:40,500
you put it in the order of importance

5660
04:52:40,500 --> 04:52:42,360
you put it in the order of importance of

5661
04:52:42,360 --> 04:52:44,458
where do you want to work the most to

5662
04:52:44,458 --> 04:52:45,840
where you want to work the least now

5663
04:52:45,840 --> 04:52:48,180
remember when you put your list together

5664
04:52:48,180 --> 04:52:51,420
it's still your list so even number 10

5665
04:52:51,420 --> 04:52:52,920
is a place that you would want to work

5666
04:52:52,920 --> 04:52:55,560
it's just the least favorite place on

5667
04:52:55,560 --> 04:52:57,298
the list it's still your favorite

5668
04:52:57,298 --> 04:52:59,580
companies and then you put your favorite

5669
04:52:59,580 --> 04:53:01,860
company at the very top of that list so

5670
04:53:01,860 --> 04:53:03,718
you put it in order of importance so

5671
04:53:03,718 --> 04:53:05,878
just by a show of hands who would want

5672
04:53:05,878 --> 04:53:08,638
to work at Disney the most

5673
04:53:08,638 --> 04:53:12,620
yeah okay uh how about we do it this way

5674
04:53:12,620 --> 04:53:15,480
where crap

5675
04:53:15,480 --> 04:53:17,458
um normally I have like a chat and I

5676
04:53:17,458 --> 04:53:19,320
just see a whole bunch of things in the

5677
04:53:19,320 --> 04:53:21,350
chat uh

5678
04:53:21,350 --> 04:53:22,620
[Music]

5679
04:53:22,620 --> 04:53:24,540
uh we'll just put an order of alphabet

5680
04:53:24,540 --> 04:53:26,580
yeah

5681
04:53:26,580 --> 04:53:28,920
there we go

5682
04:53:28,920 --> 04:53:31,200
okay so let's say this was the order

5683
04:53:31,200 --> 04:53:33,420
that we wanted to put it in that Apple

5684
04:53:33,420 --> 04:53:35,040
was the company we wanted to work for

5685
04:53:35,040 --> 04:53:37,020
most Black Hills is that company all the

5686
04:53:37,020 --> 04:53:39,780
way down to South that's that's actually

5687
04:53:39,780 --> 04:53:42,660
probably legit all right

5688
04:53:42,660 --> 04:53:45,920
yeah that makes sense okay

5689
04:53:47,638 --> 04:53:49,560
okay

5690
04:53:49,560 --> 04:53:51,420
by a show of hey

5691
04:53:51,420 --> 04:53:53,100
raise your hand if you think you should

5692
04:53:53,100 --> 04:53:55,260
start at the top of your list and work

5693
04:53:55,260 --> 04:53:57,798
your way down

5694
04:54:01,200 --> 04:54:02,458
now raise your hand if you think you

5695
04:54:02,458 --> 04:54:03,718
should start at the bottom of your list

5696
04:54:03,718 --> 04:54:06,060
and work your way up

5697
04:54:06,060 --> 04:54:09,958
good job there was a correct answer

5698
04:54:09,958 --> 04:54:11,878
you start at the bottom of your list and

5699
04:54:11,878 --> 04:54:13,320
work your way up why do you think you

5700
04:54:13,320 --> 04:54:14,580
start at the bottom of your list and

5701
04:54:14,580 --> 04:54:17,120
work your way up

5702
04:54:25,040 --> 04:54:26,820
exactly

5703
04:54:26,820 --> 04:54:28,740
that company at the bottom is getting

5704
04:54:28,740 --> 04:54:30,718
the worst version of you the worst

5705
04:54:30,718 --> 04:54:32,400
version of your resume the worst version

5706
04:54:32,400 --> 04:54:34,080
of recovery letter the worst version of

5707
04:54:34,080 --> 04:54:36,620
reaching out

5708
04:54:37,138 --> 04:54:38,580
and you're going to get better and

5709
04:54:38,580 --> 04:54:40,260
better and better as you work your way

5710
04:54:40,260 --> 04:54:42,060
up you know I used to do this you know

5711
04:54:42,060 --> 04:54:43,560
during the pandemic I did these live

5712
04:54:43,560 --> 04:54:44,820
streams where I helped people find jobs

5713
04:54:44,820 --> 04:54:46,980
222 people came back and said they found

5714
04:54:46,980 --> 04:54:49,138
jobs we rang the bell for him it was

5715
04:54:49,138 --> 04:54:51,600
awesome it was a great time I retired in

5716
04:54:51,600 --> 04:54:53,580
March of last year just you know did it

5717
04:54:53,580 --> 04:54:55,138
for two straight years and it was

5718
04:54:55,138 --> 04:54:56,760
exciting it was fun it was great I'm

5719
04:54:56,760 --> 04:54:59,100
glad I got to do it it was fun

5720
04:54:59,100 --> 04:55:00,660
but here's what I learned during that

5721
04:55:00,660 --> 04:55:01,740
period of time

5722
04:55:01,740 --> 04:55:03,660
I would get the same question over and

5723
04:55:03,660 --> 04:55:04,860
over again and you might be thinking it

5724
04:55:04,860 --> 04:55:07,920
yourself right now Jason what happens if

5725
04:55:07,920 --> 04:55:11,400
I get a job at crowd strike

5726
04:55:11,400 --> 04:55:14,160
oh I am so sorry

5727
04:55:14,160 --> 04:55:16,560
that you landed a job at one of your top

5728
04:55:16,560 --> 04:55:18,540
10 companies

5729
04:55:18,540 --> 04:55:20,760
my bad

5730
04:55:20,760 --> 04:55:23,280
take the job at crowdstrike work there

5731
04:55:23,280 --> 04:55:25,138
for a while and then keep applying a

5732
04:55:25,138 --> 04:55:27,660
bishop Fox black hills and apple until

5733
04:55:27,660 --> 04:55:29,820
you work there

5734
04:55:29,820 --> 04:55:32,700
so it's what you do is you start at the

5735
04:55:32,700 --> 04:55:34,200
bottom you work your way up now here's

5736
04:55:34,200 --> 04:55:35,218
what we're gonna do we're going to start

5737
04:55:35,218 --> 04:55:37,920
at Southwest Airlines today

5738
04:55:37,920 --> 04:55:39,600
we're going to get a job at Southwest

5739
04:55:39,600 --> 04:55:41,580
Airlines today

5740
04:55:41,580 --> 04:55:43,798
so what we do next is we go over here to

5741
04:55:43,798 --> 04:55:46,217
LinkedIn

5742
04:55:46,620 --> 04:55:49,560
and we type in southwest

5743
04:55:49,560 --> 04:55:51,120
Airlines

5744
04:55:51,120 --> 04:55:54,360
and and notice I do not go to jobs I

5745
04:55:54,360 --> 04:55:56,040
don't go to Southwest Airlines and look

5746
04:55:56,040 --> 04:55:59,280
at jobs I go to the company itself

5747
04:55:59,280 --> 04:56:00,840
and then when I get to the company

5748
04:56:00,840 --> 04:56:03,060
itself then I might look at jobs if I

5749
04:56:03,060 --> 04:56:05,160
want to and I see that they have 21 jobs

5750
04:56:05,160 --> 04:56:08,400
opening open one is a knock analytics

5751
04:56:08,400 --> 04:56:10,920
consultant I don't know what that is but

5752
04:56:10,920 --> 04:56:12,540
if you look that's they only have 21

5753
04:56:12,540 --> 04:56:14,820
jobs available normally companies would

5754
04:56:14,820 --> 04:56:16,680
have like 1200 jobs available like

5755
04:56:16,680 --> 04:56:18,180
during the pandemic there was tons of

5756
04:56:18,180 --> 04:56:20,878
jobs available and now it's got a little

5757
04:56:20,878 --> 04:56:23,400
tighter

5758
04:56:23,400 --> 04:56:25,860
and so what I want you to be is a little

5759
04:56:25,860 --> 04:56:27,360
bit better than all the other people

5760
04:56:27,360 --> 04:56:29,218
applying

5761
04:56:29,218 --> 04:56:31,020
so what we're going to do next is

5762
04:56:31,020 --> 04:56:32,340
instead of look at jobs we're going to

5763
04:56:32,340 --> 04:56:34,260
look at people because I love people

5764
04:56:34,260 --> 04:56:36,480
I love people way more than jobs and

5765
04:56:36,480 --> 04:56:39,600
there are currently 32 790 employees

5766
04:56:39,600 --> 04:56:41,940
that have somehow worked at Southwest or

5767
04:56:41,940 --> 04:56:44,218
have Southwest listed as an employer and

5768
04:56:44,218 --> 04:56:45,480
did you know that you could go here and

5769
04:56:45,480 --> 04:56:47,458
type in this

5770
04:56:47,458 --> 04:56:49,920
type in recruiter

5771
04:56:49,920 --> 04:56:52,560
and it would give you the 439 magical

5772
04:56:52,560 --> 04:56:54,420
job fairies that work

5773
04:56:54,420 --> 04:56:56,760
at this company

5774
04:56:56,760 --> 04:56:59,638
like Gabriel here and Devin and Heather

5775
04:56:59,638 --> 04:57:03,980
and Shannon and Darius and and

5776
04:57:03,980 --> 04:57:08,160
Kylie Laundry Savannah

5777
04:57:08,160 --> 04:57:09,780
so

5778
04:57:09,780 --> 04:57:13,440
the thing about job hunting is that

5779
04:57:13,440 --> 04:57:16,560
people give jobs to people

5780
04:57:16,560 --> 04:57:19,940
until chat gbt does it for us

5781
04:57:19,940 --> 04:57:22,798
it's still people doing this for people

5782
04:57:22,798 --> 04:57:25,798
and so there's nothing stopping you from

5783
04:57:25,798 --> 04:57:27,980
introducing yourself to Laundry Savannah

5784
04:57:27,980 --> 04:57:32,160
oh I can't pronounce it and Molly

5785
04:57:32,160 --> 04:57:34,740
and so you could introduce yourself to

5786
04:57:34,740 --> 04:57:36,840
these people now remember at the very

5787
04:57:36,840 --> 04:57:38,400
beginning of today when I asked you to

5788
04:57:38,400 --> 04:57:39,900
stand up and play Rock Paper Scissors

5789
04:57:39,900 --> 04:57:41,700
there was some hesitation but you still

5790
04:57:41,700 --> 04:57:43,860
did it anyway because I asked you to

5791
04:57:43,860 --> 04:57:45,420
there's going to be hesitation before

5792
04:57:45,420 --> 04:57:47,580
you reach out to any of these people

5793
04:57:47,580 --> 04:57:48,718
you're gonna think you're doing

5794
04:57:48,718 --> 04:57:50,100
something wrong

5795
04:57:50,100 --> 04:57:51,540
you're going to think if you send an

5796
04:57:51,540 --> 04:57:53,218
email to one of those people you're

5797
04:57:53,218 --> 04:57:55,560
going to get like like put on a list

5798
04:57:55,560 --> 04:57:59,520
somewhere never to be hired

5799
04:57:59,520 --> 04:58:02,400
but guess what Southwest Airlines is at

5800
04:58:02,400 --> 04:58:03,660
the bottom of your list

5801
04:58:03,660 --> 04:58:06,620
who cares

5802
04:58:10,320 --> 04:58:12,780
what's awesome about job hunting at the

5803
04:58:12,780 --> 04:58:14,040
bottom of your list is you're like

5804
04:58:14,040 --> 04:58:17,298
whatever YOLO

5805
04:58:17,400 --> 04:58:19,260
now when you get to the top of your list

5806
04:58:19,260 --> 04:58:22,500
you're like dear Landry

5807
04:58:22,500 --> 04:58:26,180

5808
04:58:26,400 --> 04:58:28,020
you're gonna can someone read this for

5809
04:58:28,020 --> 04:58:30,120
me does this make any sense at all

5810
04:58:30,120 --> 04:58:32,820
so at the bottom of your list this

5811
04:58:32,820 --> 04:58:34,980
stress is so much less and you can do

5812
04:58:34,980 --> 04:58:37,138
whatever you want and so it's cool to do

5813
04:58:37,138 --> 04:58:39,360
it that way all right so what happens

5814
04:58:39,360 --> 04:58:42,420
now is you know we find the people here

5815
04:58:42,420 --> 04:58:44,940
but we still need a job how do we get a

5816
04:58:44,940 --> 04:58:47,580
job at Southwest Airlines so we are

5817
04:58:47,580 --> 04:58:48,840
going to look through all the jobs over

5818
04:58:48,840 --> 04:58:49,860
here and I'm going to type in the word

5819
04:58:49,860 --> 04:58:52,260
security which is what you could do and

5820
04:58:52,260 --> 04:58:53,820
if you're right now are sitting here

5821
04:58:53,820 --> 04:58:55,440
going I don't know the 10 companies I

5822
04:58:55,440 --> 04:58:57,780
want to work for like that that's the

5823
04:58:57,780 --> 04:58:59,040
part I don't even know how to get

5824
04:58:59,040 --> 04:59:00,600
started with the 10 companies I want to

5825
04:59:00,600 --> 04:59:04,218
work for a great Google search is this

5826
04:59:04,218 --> 04:59:09,660
companies thriving in 2023

5827
04:59:10,560 --> 04:59:14,760
companies thriving in 2023 because right

5828
04:59:14,760 --> 04:59:17,040
now the recession is like what what and

5829
04:59:17,040 --> 04:59:18,660
so there's like all these companies that

5830
04:59:18,660 --> 04:59:21,000
they're doing uh articles on like even

5831
04:59:21,000 --> 04:59:22,980
though the recession is you know taking

5832
04:59:22,980 --> 04:59:24,958
place these companies are still thriving

5833
04:59:24,958 --> 04:59:27,120
you're like okay top 10 lists right

5834
04:59:27,120 --> 04:59:29,400
there uh just put in order all right so

5835
04:59:29,400 --> 04:59:32,040
I put in here security and we didn't

5836
04:59:32,040 --> 04:59:34,440
really get many jobs available at

5837
04:59:34,440 --> 04:59:37,920
Southwest and that's okay right so it's

5838
04:59:37,920 --> 04:59:39,180
still in the bottom of our list where

5839
04:59:39,180 --> 04:59:40,560
you're like well what would we do

5840
04:59:40,560 --> 04:59:42,060
differently if we wanted a job at

5841
04:59:42,060 --> 04:59:43,798
Southwest in security or whatever it is

5842
04:59:43,798 --> 04:59:45,360
that you want to do so what we're going

5843
04:59:45,360 --> 04:59:47,340
to do next is we're going to go to

5844
04:59:47,340 --> 04:59:50,340
southwestairlines.com

5845
04:59:51,840 --> 04:59:54,060
I gotta fly Southwest tomorrow I hope

5846
04:59:54,060 --> 04:59:55,440
they don't find out about this

5847
04:59:55,440 --> 04:59:57,378
presentation

5848
04:59:57,378 --> 05:00:01,020
and they deny me access to the

5849
05:00:01,020 --> 05:00:02,760
all right so whenever you go to a

5850
05:00:02,760 --> 05:00:05,218
company's website generally towards the

5851
05:00:05,218 --> 05:00:06,240
bottom there's going to be something

5852
05:00:06,240 --> 05:00:09,240
called careers so you gotta like find it

5853
05:00:09,240 --> 05:00:11,520
there it is so whenever you go to a

5854
05:00:11,520 --> 05:00:13,378
company's website go to the careers page

5855
05:00:13,378 --> 05:00:15,840
and then it says land a career with

5856
05:00:15,840 --> 05:00:18,060
hearts in Southwest Airline you're like

5857
05:00:18,060 --> 05:00:20,340
cool and so I go over here and I type in

5858
05:00:20,340 --> 05:00:22,080
the word security too just to make sure

5859
05:00:22,080 --> 05:00:25,620
that it's not not on linked wow geez

5860
05:00:25,620 --> 05:00:27,860
Southwest

5861
05:00:28,020 --> 05:00:30,240
so I'm going to scroll down here

5862
05:00:30,240 --> 05:00:33,360
and sometimes they have things not

5863
05:00:33,360 --> 05:00:34,860
listed on LinkedIn but they actually

5864
05:00:34,860 --> 05:00:36,420
have it listed on the company's website

5865
05:00:36,420 --> 05:00:37,980
that's why if you're only searching on

5866
05:00:37,980 --> 05:00:40,080
LinkedIn and Glassdoor and monster and

5867
05:00:40,080 --> 05:00:41,700
indeed you may not see all the things

5868
05:00:41,700 --> 05:00:43,440
that are available for these companies

5869
05:00:43,440 --> 05:00:46,020
so you go to the company's website and

5870
05:00:46,020 --> 05:00:47,878
still you know I'm here right now I'm

5871
05:00:47,878 --> 05:00:49,740
like uh I'm not really seeing the thing

5872
05:00:49,740 --> 05:00:51,660

to be hard to see can everyone see like

5893
05:01:34,980 --> 05:01:37,798
I know it's hard to see this but look at

5894
05:01:37,798 --> 05:01:40,458
the very top where it says

5895
05:01:40,458 --> 05:01:43,020
careers.southwestair.com job slash

5896
05:01:43,020 --> 05:01:46,020
r-2022-15646

5897
05:01:48,600 --> 05:01:49,980
can you see that

5898
05:01:49,980 --> 05:01:52,320
okay so in the world of recruiting and

5899
05:01:52,320 --> 05:01:57,060
Human Resources every job has a code to

5900
05:01:57,060 --> 05:01:58,620
go along with it because that's the only

5901
05:01:58,620 --> 05:02:00,420
way the recruiters and and people can

5902
05:02:00,420 --> 05:02:02,218
keep track of what jobs are open and

5903
05:02:02,218 --> 05:02:03,240
what jobs need to be filled because

5904
05:02:03,240 --> 05:02:05,760
remember they have like photos they have

5905
05:02:05,760 --> 05:02:07,560
like how did you do this week did you

5906
05:02:07,560 --> 05:02:09,780
feel any jobs well no not this week well

5907
05:02:09,780 --> 05:02:11,458
but then you kind of suck at recruiting

5908
05:02:11,458 --> 05:02:14,218
all right so they have all the things

5909
05:02:14,218 --> 05:02:15,780
that they need to do to be successful

5910
05:02:15,780 --> 05:02:17,760
and so they keep track of all their jobs

5911
05:02:17,760 --> 05:02:20,340
through this way up here so you're going

5912
05:02:20,340 --> 05:02:21,958
to use that information whenever you

5913
05:02:21,958 --> 05:02:24,298
find a job that you're interested in to

5914
05:02:24,298 --> 05:02:25,860
keep track of so that way when you reach

5915
05:02:25,860 --> 05:02:27,360
out to the humans that work at those

5916
05:02:27,360 --> 05:02:29,940

5920
05:02:37,980 --> 05:02:39,480
sudden the recruiter goes I know what

5921
05:02:39,480 --> 05:02:41,899

5922
05:02:42,120 --> 05:02:44,298
foreign

5923
05:02:48,420 --> 05:02:52,339

5924

okay test test us cool is everyone

5925

5926
05:02:57,120 --> 05:02:58,500
company's website

5927
05:02:58,500 --> 05:03:00,060
everyone understand what we're looking

5928
05:03:00,060 --> 05:03:01,798
for okay so we're starting to do

5929
05:03:01,798 --> 05:03:03,660
reconnaissance we're starting to see

5930
05:03:03,660 --> 05:03:05,638
what we can find now

5931
05:03:05,638 --> 05:03:07,980
I get this question all the time Jason

5932
05:03:07,980 --> 05:03:11,280
is my resume good

5933
05:03:11,280 --> 05:03:14,160
and when I look at it I go I don't know

5934
05:03:14,160 --> 05:03:16,080
is it

5935
05:03:16,080 --> 05:03:18,900
and you're like I asked you

5936
05:03:18,900 --> 05:03:21,298
I was like can I see the job description

5937
05:03:21,298 --> 05:03:23,100
that you're applying for

5938
05:03:23,100 --> 05:03:25,500
no it's my resume is it good

5939
05:03:25,500 --> 05:03:27,420
I don't know

5940
05:03:27,420 --> 05:03:29,100
can I see the job description you're

5941
05:03:29,100 --> 05:03:30,480
applying for

5942
05:03:30,480 --> 05:03:32,040
and all of a sudden you're like

5943
05:03:32,040 --> 05:03:32,638
um

5944
05:03:32,638 --> 05:03:34,798
I think I understand what you're saying

5945
05:03:34,798 --> 05:03:37,560
because this job description has a whole

5946
05:03:37,560 --> 05:03:39,120
bunch of bullet points for what they're

5947
05:03:39,120 --> 05:03:40,798
looking for

5948
05:03:40,798 --> 05:03:42,600
and what most of you have been doing

5949
05:03:42,600 --> 05:03:44,458
your whole life is you make a resume

5950
05:03:44,458 --> 05:03:47,760
first and then you apply for jobs

5951
05:03:47,760 --> 05:03:51,060
I want you to look at the jobs and then

5952
05:03:51,060 --> 05:03:52,740
build a resume

5953
05:03:52,740 --> 05:03:54,480
look at the jobs you're applying for

5954
05:03:54,480 --> 05:03:56,520
then build a resume instead of building

5955
05:03:56,520 --> 05:03:58,620
a resume and then looking for jobs

5956
05:03:58,620 --> 05:04:00,840
what the heck do you put on your resume

5957
05:04:00,840 --> 05:04:02,280
if you don't know what the companies are

5958
05:04:02,280 --> 05:04:03,718
looking for

5959
05:04:03,718 --> 05:04:06,360
and so if you look up here uh you know

5960
05:04:06,360 --> 05:04:07,680
one of my favorite things about humans

5961
05:04:07,680 --> 05:04:10,320
and this goes for all of you me too is

5962
05:04:10,320 --> 05:04:11,760
you see all those bullet points up there

5963
05:04:11,760 --> 05:04:14,059
how many

5964
05:04:14,280 --> 05:04:16,500
looking at the ones you can't do

5965
05:04:16,500 --> 05:04:18,360
anybody here looking at the list looking

5966
05:04:18,360 --> 05:04:19,980
at the ones you can't do what most

5967
05:04:19,980 --> 05:04:21,660
humans do is every time they find a job

5968
05:04:21,660 --> 05:04:23,340
description they scan it really quickly

5969
05:04:23,340 --> 05:04:25,320
to find the one like thing on the list

5970
05:04:25,320 --> 05:04:26,580
they can't do

5971
05:04:26,580 --> 05:04:28,080
and as soon as they find that thing on

5972
05:04:28,080 --> 05:04:29,458
the list they can't do they're like oh

5973
05:04:29,458 --> 05:04:31,740
I'm out

5974
05:04:31,740 --> 05:04:33,298
I knew it

5975
05:04:33,298 --> 05:04:34,798
can't do this one

5976
05:04:34,798 --> 05:04:38,400
so if that's been you in the past first

5977
05:04:38,400 --> 05:04:39,660
of all stop

5978
05:04:39,660 --> 05:04:42,540
second of all can anyone here raise

5979
05:04:42,540 --> 05:04:44,458
their hand and tell me what percentage

5980
05:04:44,458 --> 05:04:46,320
of bullet points should you be able to

5981
05:04:46,320 --> 05:04:49,260
successfully complete or do in order for

5982
05:04:49,260 --> 05:04:51,540
you to apply for the job anybody here

5983
05:04:51,540 --> 05:04:53,040
yes

5984
05:04:53,040 --> 05:04:55,680
80 percent anyone else

5985
05:04:55,680 --> 05:04:57,718
now that he said it you're like

5986
05:04:57,718 --> 05:05:00,120
I'm sure that's right

5987
05:05:00,120 --> 05:05:01,980
Ray

5988
05:05:01,980 --> 05:05:03,840
one percent well now we have the whole

5989
05:05:03,840 --> 05:05:06,600
gamut don't we Matt

5990
05:05:06,600 --> 05:05:08,520
50 okay

5991
05:05:08,520 --> 05:05:10,378
anybody else yeah

5992
05:05:10,378 --> 05:05:12,240
yeah 60 percent

5993
05:05:12,240 --> 05:05:14,340
20. you know what I love about this

5994
05:05:14,340 --> 05:05:16,440
nobody knows

5995
05:05:16,440 --> 05:05:19,138
nobody knows nobody knows seriously

5996
05:05:19,138 --> 05:05:20,458
nobody knows

5997
05:05:20,458 --> 05:05:22,138
nobody knows

5998
05:05:22,138 --> 05:05:24,420
uh there was a report that came out and

5999
05:05:24,420 --> 05:05:26,340
uh unfortunately

6000
05:05:26,340 --> 05:05:28,860
this is a little gender biased

6001
05:05:28,860 --> 05:05:31,560
that generally women will want to be

6002
05:05:31,560 --> 05:05:33,420
able to do a hundred percent of bullet

6003
05:05:33,420 --> 05:05:34,500
points

6004
05:05:34,500 --> 05:05:39,798
to apply men go YOLO at 50.

6005
05:05:40,500 --> 05:05:42,660
but the report also said women get a

6006
05:05:42,660 --> 05:05:44,340
higher percentage of the jobs they apply

6007
05:05:44,340 --> 05:05:45,780
for

6008
05:05:45,780 --> 05:05:47,340
that men do

6009
05:05:47,340 --> 05:05:50,820
so men are like praying in Spring

6010
05:05:50,820 --> 05:05:53,638
and women are like these

6011
05:05:53,638 --> 05:05:55,620
these make sense to me

6012
05:05:55,620 --> 05:05:58,740
so there's somewhere in between there

6013
05:05:58,740 --> 05:06:01,378
where it's good for all of us

6014
05:06:01,378 --> 05:06:04,320
so instead of being like 100 sure maybe

6015
05:06:04,320 --> 05:06:06,900
80 for you whatever it feels comfortable

6016
05:06:06,900 --> 05:06:08,100
for you

6017
05:06:08,100 --> 05:06:10,500
but the thing is you don't have to be

6018
05:06:10,500 --> 05:06:13,440
all those things that's aspirational the

6019
05:06:13,440 --> 05:06:16,200
company is a being a little excessive

6020
05:06:16,200 --> 05:06:17,760
every company is being a little

6021
05:06:17,760 --> 05:06:18,958
excessive

6022
05:06:18,958 --> 05:06:20,280
generally why do you think they're

6023
05:06:20,280 --> 05:06:23,780
hiring for a position in the first place

6024
05:06:24,180 --> 05:06:25,740
somebody quit

6025
05:06:25,740 --> 05:06:27,360
says they want you to come in and

6026
05:06:27,360 --> 05:06:28,740
replace this person that's got like five

6027
05:06:28,740 --> 05:06:30,060
years of tenure

6028
05:06:30,060 --> 05:06:32,160
that is like just built up to this point

6029
05:06:32,160 --> 05:06:33,718
of being able to accomplish all these

6030
05:06:33,718 --> 05:06:35,520
things why else would they want to open

6031
05:06:35,520 --> 05:06:38,540
a job description

6032
05:06:38,780 --> 05:06:40,798
overworked you know what they put on

6033
05:06:40,798 --> 05:06:44,340
there everything they can't accomplish

6034
05:06:44,340 --> 05:06:45,840
and they're like oh we just need someone

6035
05:06:45,840 --> 05:06:47,700
to come in and just do all this stuff

6036
05:06:47,700 --> 05:06:49,980
and then our lives will be better

6037
05:06:49,980 --> 05:06:52,980
so the thing is like your resume doesn't

6038
05:06:52,980 --> 05:06:55,798
meet all this and you won't meet all of

6039
05:06:55,798 --> 05:06:56,760
that

6040
05:06:56,760 --> 05:06:59,100
the company can't want everything and

6041
05:06:59,100 --> 05:07:00,718
you can't give them everything and so

6042
05:07:00,718 --> 05:07:02,400
you find somewhere in the middle

6043
05:07:02,400 --> 05:07:04,260
that's why negotiations take place

6044
05:07:04,260 --> 05:07:06,420
that's why maybe you're willing to do

6045
05:07:06,420 --> 05:07:07,860
this for fifty thousand someone else

6046
05:07:07,860 --> 05:07:09,420
will do it for seventy thousand they'll

6047
05:07:09,420 --> 05:07:10,920
take you for fifty thousand instead of

6048
05:07:10,920 --> 05:07:12,360
someone else more bullet points for

6049
05:07:12,360 --> 05:07:13,920
seventy thousand

6050
05:07:13,920 --> 05:07:15,360
so it's like there's a lot of

6051
05:07:15,360 --> 05:07:17,100
negotiation there's a lot of like wiggle

6052
05:07:17,100 --> 05:07:18,958
room and all this stuff and so if you're

6053
05:07:18,958 --> 05:07:21,660
like oh I hate wiggle room I just want

6054
05:07:21,660 --> 05:07:23,160
like clear facts

6055
05:07:23,160 --> 05:07:25,920
black and white stuff all right okay so

6056
05:07:25,920 --> 05:07:28,740
we have this list up here of what

6057
05:07:28,740 --> 05:07:31,560
they're looking for and I'm about to

6058
05:07:31,560 --> 05:07:32,820
show you something that's gonna like

6059
05:07:32,820 --> 05:07:36,480
really mess with you uh no thanks okay

6060
05:07:36,480 --> 05:07:39,240
so how do you create a job just like a

6061
05:07:39,240 --> 05:07:42,480
resume well you kind of take this

6062
05:07:42,480 --> 05:07:45,420
and then you just kind of like copy it

6063
05:07:45,420 --> 05:07:47,580
and you just scroll all the way down to

6064
05:07:47,580 --> 05:07:49,680
the bottom

6065
05:07:49,680 --> 05:07:51,660
and you just go over here to there and

6066
05:07:51,660 --> 05:07:54,060
we get copy then we go over here to a

6067
05:07:54,060 --> 05:07:55,980
blank document

6068
05:07:55,980 --> 05:07:57,660
and then we go to here and then we like

6069
05:07:57,660 --> 05:08:00,620
paste okay

6070
05:08:00,660 --> 05:08:04,040
so how long can your resume be

6071
05:08:06,360 --> 05:08:09,000
how many pages can your resume be

6072
05:08:09,000 --> 05:08:11,480
huh

6073
05:08:12,740 --> 05:08:14,458
okay

6074
05:08:14,458 --> 05:08:17,040
so my general rule of thumb is if it

6075
05:08:17,040 --> 05:08:18,840
takes them three pages to explain what

6076
05:08:18,840 --> 05:08:20,458
they're looking for you got three pages

6077
05:08:20,458 --> 05:08:22,620
to explain Who You Are

6078
05:08:22,620 --> 05:08:24,360
if it takes them one page to explain who

6079
05:08:24,360 --> 05:08:25,620
they're looking for you got one page to

6080
05:08:25,620 --> 05:08:27,000
explain Who You Are

6081
05:08:27,000 --> 05:08:29,160
it's always based on the job description

6082
05:08:29,160 --> 05:08:31,740
let that be the framework for who you

6083
05:08:31,740 --> 05:08:33,840
are all right so if I get rid of some of

6084
05:08:33,840 --> 05:08:35,458
this other stuff here

6085
05:08:35,458 --> 05:08:37,138
uh so we get rid of that we got job

6086
05:08:37,138 --> 05:08:39,120
description it says the knock engineer

6087
05:08:39,120 --> 05:08:41,458
supports safe and efficient aircraft

6088
05:08:41,458 --> 05:08:43,620
operations through the study education

6089
05:08:43,620 --> 05:08:46,218
analysis and evaluation of airplane

6090
05:08:46,218 --> 05:08:48,120
performance capabilities and

6091
05:08:48,120 --> 05:08:49,740
functionalities that's a long run on

6092
05:08:49,740 --> 05:08:51,420
sentence

6093
05:08:51,420 --> 05:08:54,680
so I would change this to

6094
05:08:54,680 --> 05:08:56,298
currently

6095
05:08:56,298 --> 05:08:59,400
looking for

6096
05:08:59,400 --> 05:09:04,340
a role where I can

6097
05:09:06,060 --> 05:09:09,378
support safe

6098
05:09:22,260 --> 05:09:23,820
yes

6099
05:09:23,820 --> 05:09:26,040
I do mean this

6100
05:09:26,040 --> 05:09:27,718
now it's going to need a little more

6101
05:09:27,718 --> 05:09:29,580
finessing it's going to need a little

6102
05:09:29,580 --> 05:09:32,580
tweaking to it but all of a sudden like

6103
05:09:32,580 --> 05:09:34,878
you're sitting there like oh damn it

6104
05:09:34,878 --> 05:09:38,218
I've been just trying to describe myself

6105
05:09:38,218 --> 05:09:39,840
for so long

6106
05:09:39,840 --> 05:09:43,080
when all I had to do because this is a

6107
05:09:43,080 --> 05:09:44,400
job you want to apply for when you find

6108
05:09:44,400 --> 05:09:46,580
a job

6109
05:09:49,320 --> 05:09:50,580
do so

6110
05:09:50,580 --> 05:09:52,200
so trying to reinvent the wheel every

6111
05:09:52,200 --> 05:09:53,580
time just take the words that they you

6112
05:09:53,580 --> 05:09:54,958
and rearrange them a little bit and say

6113
05:09:54,958 --> 05:09:57,600
I'm the thing you're looking for so hire

6114
05:09:57,600 --> 05:09:58,378
me

6115
05:09:58,378 --> 05:10:00,120
and I know that some of you right now

6116
05:10:00,120 --> 05:10:01,740
are like nah

6117
05:10:01,740 --> 05:10:04,878
they're gonna notice

6118
05:10:05,820 --> 05:10:08,280
what if they do

6119
05:10:08,280 --> 05:10:10,280
you think that like recruiters go like

6120
05:10:10,280 --> 05:10:13,798
oh my goodness

6121
05:10:13,798 --> 05:10:16,458
oh

6122
05:10:17,520 --> 05:10:19,798
okay so down here it says as a knock

6123
05:10:19,798 --> 05:10:22,620
engineer you can expect to Fly for Free

6124
05:10:22,620 --> 05:10:24,958
let's all right we probably don't need

6125
05:10:24,958 --> 05:10:26,638
that right here so we're gonna take this

6126
05:10:26,638 --> 05:10:29,580
right here we'll mix this up all right

6127
05:10:29,580 --> 05:10:32,100
okay all right so when it says

6128
05:10:32,100 --> 05:10:33,600
responsibilities

6129
05:10:33,600 --> 05:10:36,718
responsible take off and run I only

6130
05:10:36,718 --> 05:10:38,218
apply for this job if you can do this

6131
05:10:38,218 --> 05:10:40,138
sorry

6132
05:10:40,138 --> 05:10:43,320
so whenever it says responsibilities I

6133
05:10:43,320 --> 05:10:45,600
have to

6134
05:10:45,600 --> 05:10:48,440
bills

6135
05:10:52,440 --> 05:10:54,958
and I know I'm being a little funny but

6136
05:10:54,958 --> 05:10:58,200
I literally do this experience you could

6137
05:10:58,200 --> 05:10:59,520
change skills through experience you can

6138
05:10:59,520 --> 05:11:01,980
change it to whatever it is and so if

6139
05:11:01,980 --> 05:11:04,320
you can do these things then do these

6140
05:11:04,320 --> 05:11:05,520
things

6141
05:11:05,520 --> 05:11:07,378
you don't have to reinvent the wheel

6142
05:11:07,378 --> 05:11:11,218
every time but don't be don't lie you're

6143
05:11:11,218 --> 05:11:12,958
not lying if you can do the job then say

6144
05:11:12,958 --> 05:11:14,760
you can do the job and you may need to

6145
05:11:14,760 --> 05:11:16,378
reword some of the stuff you need to

6146
05:11:16,378 --> 05:11:18,240
make sure that these are all 100 true

6147
05:11:18,240 --> 05:11:19,798
about you I don't want you to lie on a

6148
05:11:19,798 --> 05:11:22,440
resume I never want you to lie I want

6149
05:11:22,440 --> 05:11:24,958
you to put exactly what the truth is

6150
05:11:24,958 --> 05:11:26,458
and when you go through here and you're

6151
05:11:26,458 --> 05:11:28,378
like I can do that I can do that I can

6152
05:11:28,378 --> 05:11:29,820
do that I can do that if there's

6153
05:11:29,820 --> 05:11:31,138
something up here you can't do delete

6154
05:11:31,138 --> 05:11:33,000
that whole thing

6155
05:11:33,000 --> 05:11:35,638
I want you to imagine the hiring manager

6156
05:11:35,638 --> 05:11:37,440
recruiter who gets this type of resume

6157
05:11:37,440 --> 05:11:40,378
sent to them

6158
05:11:40,378 --> 05:11:42,240
is it fancy

6159
05:11:42,240 --> 05:11:47,040
no is it template no is it just really

6160
05:11:47,040 --> 05:11:49,378
factual yes

6161
05:11:49,378 --> 05:11:51,240
and instead of looking at your resume

6162
05:11:51,240 --> 05:11:53,458
trying to figure out if you can do the

6163
05:11:53,458 --> 05:11:55,320
job because you have that one resume

6164
05:11:55,320 --> 05:11:57,060
where it just puts all your things and

6165
05:11:57,060 --> 05:12:01,340
you're like now you're like uh

6166
05:12:01,798 --> 05:12:04,039
uh

6167
05:12:08,218 --> 05:12:09,900
oh

6168
05:12:09,900 --> 05:12:13,378
well I think yeah that one

6169
05:12:13,378 --> 05:12:15,060
so instead of that all of a sudden they

6170
05:12:15,060 --> 05:12:18,660
go got it got it got it got it got it

6171
05:12:18,660 --> 05:12:20,820
got it all right let's call him in for

6172
05:12:20,820 --> 05:12:23,120
an interview

6173
05:12:23,520 --> 05:12:25,138
have you ever heard about you know like

6174
05:12:25,138 --> 05:12:26,820
those things that screen looking for

6175
05:12:26,820 --> 05:12:29,540
keywords

6176
05:12:33,298 --> 05:12:35,520
hit 100

6177
05:12:35,520 --> 05:12:38,040
all right so once again if there's a

6178
05:12:38,040 --> 05:12:40,860
thing you can't do then get rid of it

6179
05:12:40,860 --> 05:12:42,420
get rid of it because if you can't do it

6180
05:12:42,420 --> 05:12:44,700
don't don't put it down make it 100 true

6181
05:12:44,700 --> 05:12:46,440
about you all right you see where it

6182
05:12:46,440 --> 05:12:47,760
says knowledge skills and abilities

6183
05:12:47,760 --> 05:12:49,200
we're going to talk about that for a

6184
05:12:49,200 --> 05:12:50,638
second so I'm going to go over here to a

6185
05:12:50,638 --> 05:12:52,138
all right

6186
05:12:52,138 --> 05:12:54,180
some of you in here are recent graduates

6187
05:12:54,180 --> 05:12:55,500
are getting ready to graduate some of

6188
05:12:55,500 --> 05:12:56,940
you are transitioning from one career

6189
05:12:56,940 --> 05:12:58,560
field to another some of you have been

6190
05:12:58,560 --> 05:13:00,840
doing this for 15 years so your

6191
05:13:00,840 --> 05:13:03,240
knowledge varies all over the place so I

6192
05:13:03,240 --> 05:13:06,120
want you to know that it's okay for your

6193
05:13:06,120 --> 05:13:08,218
knowledge to vary

6194
05:13:08,218 --> 05:13:10,378
because what most of us do is whenever

6195
05:13:10,378 --> 05:13:12,298
we go to a job description and we see a

6196
05:13:12,298 --> 05:13:14,400
bullet point we assume

6197
05:13:14,400 --> 05:13:16,860
that we have to be an expert in every

6198
05:13:16,860 --> 05:13:18,360
single bullet point

6199
05:13:18,360 --> 05:13:20,400
and if we're not then there must be

6200
05:13:20,400 --> 05:13:22,680
someone out there some fictional person

6201
05:13:22,680 --> 05:13:24,718
that you've created in your mind that is

6202
05:13:24,718 --> 05:13:27,240
more qualified than you which is why

6203
05:13:27,240 --> 05:13:29,400
you're not applying for that job you're

6204
05:13:29,400 --> 05:13:31,680
assuming that they're more of an expert

6205
05:13:31,680 --> 05:13:34,138
than you are and so that's why we deny

6206
05:13:34,138 --> 05:13:35,638
ourselves from applying for a lot of

6207
05:13:35,638 --> 05:13:36,900
things that we want to apply for because

6208
05:13:36,900 --> 05:13:38,218
we're like no

6209
05:13:38,218 --> 05:13:40,740
no all right so there are three levels

6210
05:13:40,740 --> 05:13:42,298
of knowledge so that way you can start

6211
05:13:42,298 --> 05:13:44,160
to go you know what I'm not an expert in

6212
05:13:44,160 --> 05:13:45,660
it but I got knowledge right I'm

6213
05:13:45,660 --> 05:13:47,400
proficient in it so I'm going to go

6214
05:13:47,400 --> 05:13:49,378
ahead and zoom in here going to increase

6215
05:13:49,378 --> 05:13:51,780
the size of this all right so get into

6216
05:13:51,780 --> 05:13:55,440
the habit of uh of well I don't know

6217
05:13:55,440 --> 05:13:56,700
what that is

6218
05:13:56,700 --> 05:13:59,400
undo okay so the three levels of

6219
05:13:59,400 --> 05:14:02,700
knowledge so three levels

6220
05:14:02,700 --> 05:14:04,138
sure

6221
05:14:04,138 --> 05:14:05,760
all right the first one you're gonna see

6222
05:14:05,760 --> 05:14:10,217
from time to time is knowledge of

6223
05:14:12,180 --> 05:14:14,840
no

6224
05:14:17,940 --> 05:14:19,020
all right so you're going to see

6225
05:14:19,020 --> 05:14:21,958
knowledge of or familiar with how many

6226
05:14:21,958 --> 05:14:23,520
of you see this one resumes all the time

6227
05:14:23,520 --> 05:14:25,620
it says knowledge of familiar ones right

6228
05:14:25,620 --> 05:14:29,360
let me explain to you what that means

6229
05:14:29,360 --> 05:14:33,718
I've heard of it before

6230
05:14:33,718 --> 05:14:35,878
that's kind of what it means like when

6231
05:14:35,878 --> 05:14:37,320
you're like hey do you have knowledge of

6232
05:14:37,320 --> 05:14:39,900
this you're like yes I've heard of it

6233
05:14:39,900 --> 05:14:41,700
are you familiar with this absolutely

6234
05:14:41,700 --> 05:14:43,080
I've heard of it

6235
05:14:43,080 --> 05:14:45,620
and so

6236
05:14:49,320 --> 05:14:50,400
a word

6237
05:14:50,400 --> 05:14:53,218
no it heard of Microsoft Word you've

6238
05:14:53,218 --> 05:14:55,620
used it a few times okay so some of you

6239
05:14:55,620 --> 05:14:57,240
have taken boot camps or you've taken

6240
05:14:57,240 --> 05:14:58,680
some classes on it you've done some try

6241
05:14:58,680 --> 05:15:00,060
to hack Mees you've done hack the Box

6242
05:15:00,060 --> 05:15:02,100
something like that most likely you have

6243
05:15:02,100 --> 05:15:03,600
knowledge of or you're familiar with

6244
05:15:03,600 --> 05:15:05,638
these terms these tools and these types

6245
05:15:05,638 --> 05:15:07,980
of techniques you have knowledge of them

6246
05:15:07,980 --> 05:15:11,160
and so stop worrying about being an

6247
05:15:11,160 --> 05:15:13,020
expert and just let people know I have

6248
05:15:13,020 --> 05:15:14,458
knowledge of these things you can

6249
05:15:14,458 --> 05:15:16,320
literally say I have knowledge of and

6250
05:15:16,320 --> 05:15:17,820
list all the things you have knowledge

6251
05:15:17,820 --> 05:15:19,500
of in the tools and capabilities you

6252
05:15:19,500 --> 05:15:21,420
have knowledge of thank you I got 15

6253
05:15:21,420 --> 05:15:23,760
minutes left to go all right so the next

6254
05:15:23,760 --> 05:15:25,798
one up here is proficient in so you'll

6255
05:15:25,798 --> 05:15:27,660
see this one from time to time so it's a

6256
05:15:27,660 --> 05:15:28,740
proficient

6257
05:15:28,740 --> 05:15:32,218
in here's what this one means I use it

6258
05:15:32,218 --> 05:15:34,020
all the time

6259
05:15:34,020 --> 05:15:36,360
that's what it means I'm proficient in

6260
05:15:36,360 --> 05:15:39,240
it I use it all the time so that way you

6261
05:15:39,240 --> 05:15:41,580
can say look I use this all the time I

6262
05:15:41,580 --> 05:15:43,620
use these tools all the time I know this

6263
05:15:43,620 --> 05:15:46,200
I do it all the time I'm proficient in

6264
05:15:46,200 --> 05:15:50,940
these things and lastly is expert in and

6265
05:15:50,940 --> 05:15:52,980
this is the hardest one

6266
05:15:52,980 --> 05:15:54,660
this is the hardest one because it goes

6267
05:15:54,660 --> 05:15:57,540
against everything inside of you

6268
05:15:57,540 --> 05:15:59,520
you have the hardest time telling

6269
05:15:59,520 --> 05:16:01,200
yourself you're an expert in anything

6270
05:16:01,200 --> 05:16:03,718
because if you are an expert in

6271
05:16:03,718 --> 05:16:05,700
something you know that you're not an

6272
05:16:05,700 --> 05:16:07,620
expert in it because to be an expert in

6273
05:16:07,620 --> 05:16:08,760
it means you would know all the things

6274
05:16:08,760 --> 05:16:09,900
that you don't know and since you don't

6275
05:16:09,900 --> 05:16:11,160
know those things how could I be an

6276
05:16:11,160 --> 05:16:12,298
expert in it

6277
05:16:12,298 --> 05:16:15,180
and so we sit there and we're like no

6278
05:16:15,180 --> 05:16:17,218
and when you see someone call themselves

6279
05:16:17,218 --> 05:16:19,680
an expert in it you're like nope

6280
05:16:19,680 --> 05:16:22,620
arrogant jerk

6281
05:16:22,620 --> 05:16:25,138
so when you you have a hard time calling

6282
05:16:25,138 --> 05:16:26,760
your expert in it because you don't want

6283
05:16:26,760 --> 05:16:28,798
to be an arrogant jerk either but here's

6284
05:16:28,798 --> 05:16:30,660
the problem you're in sales and

6285
05:16:30,660 --> 05:16:31,980
marketing

6286
05:16:31,980 --> 05:16:33,718
you're trying to get a job this is not

6287
05:16:33,718 --> 05:16:35,700
the time to be humble it's the time to

6288
05:16:35,700 --> 05:16:37,560
be honest

6289
05:16:37,560 --> 05:16:41,160
not humble honest not humble

6290
05:16:41,160 --> 05:16:43,260
because humble people

6291
05:16:43,260 --> 05:16:45,600
Unfortunately they go oh well we're

6292
05:16:45,600 --> 05:16:48,680
looking for an expert in this

6293
05:16:49,260 --> 05:16:53,458
so honest not humble not at this time so

6294
05:16:53,458 --> 05:16:55,320
an expert in here's the definition of

6295
05:16:55,320 --> 05:16:58,500
this this way it will help you in the

6296
05:16:58,500 --> 05:17:00,240
future be able to say you're an expert

6297
05:17:00,240 --> 05:17:03,060
and I know

6298
05:17:03,060 --> 05:17:04,980
it's so well

6299
05:17:04,980 --> 05:17:10,378
I could teach it to someone else

6300
05:17:10,378 --> 05:17:13,620
I know it so well I could teach it to

6301
05:17:13,620 --> 05:17:14,820
someone else

6302
05:17:14,820 --> 05:17:17,040
if you know it so well you could teach

6303
05:17:17,040 --> 05:17:19,260
it to someone else feel free to call

6304
05:17:19,260 --> 05:17:22,200
yourself an expert in that thing not all

6305
05:17:22,200 --> 05:17:24,420
the things not every aspect of that

6306
05:17:24,420 --> 05:17:26,218
thing but in that one thing you know so

6307
05:17:26,218 --> 05:17:27,420
well you can teach to someone else you

6308
05:17:27,420 --> 05:17:28,740
can call yourself an expert in that

6309
05:17:28,740 --> 05:17:30,840
thing and so when it's time for you to

6310
05:17:30,840 --> 05:17:32,400
put your resume together you can say I'm

6311
05:17:32,400 --> 05:17:36,120
an expert in this this and this

6312
05:17:36,120 --> 05:17:39,060
and you're not being humble but you are

6313
05:17:39,060 --> 05:17:41,760
being honest

6314
05:17:41,760 --> 05:17:43,560
all right so that's the three levels of

6315
05:17:43,560 --> 05:17:45,600
knowledge so when you're quantifying

6316
05:17:45,600 --> 05:17:47,040
your levels of knowledge when putting a

6317
05:17:47,040 --> 05:17:48,600
resume together here let me show what it

6318
05:17:48,600 --> 05:17:50,580
looks like when I go back over here

6319
05:17:50,580 --> 05:17:52,680
you see where it says knowledge skills

6320
05:17:52,680 --> 05:17:54,718
and abilities require excellent must be

6321
05:17:54,718 --> 05:17:56,600
organized

6322
05:17:56,600 --> 05:17:58,440
down here you can put like your

6323
05:17:58,440 --> 05:18:00,480
education your experience you can put

6324
05:18:00,480 --> 05:18:02,160
where you went to school all that stuff

6325
05:18:02,160 --> 05:18:04,740
you can put it down here on the list all

6326
05:18:04,740 --> 05:18:06,240
these things you can absolutely put down

6327
05:18:06,240 --> 05:18:07,980
here but let's go back up here and let

6328
05:18:07,980 --> 05:18:10,458
me show you this

6329
05:18:10,740 --> 05:18:13,080
it says responsible for takeoff analyze

6330
05:18:13,080 --> 05:18:15,980
the aircraft performance

6331
05:18:22,798 --> 05:18:25,320
knowledge of an alignment that is not

6332
05:18:25,320 --> 05:18:26,100
right

6333
05:18:26,100 --> 05:18:26,958
foreign

6334
05:18:26,958 --> 05:18:29,760
knowledge of analyzing aircraft

6335
05:18:29,760 --> 05:18:33,958
performance does doesn't that change it

6336
05:18:33,958 --> 05:18:36,900
like I've heard of that

6337
05:18:36,900 --> 05:18:39,240
seems pretty critical uh once again

6338
05:18:39,240 --> 05:18:41,160
don't apply for this I'm flying on

6339
05:18:41,160 --> 05:18:45,740
Southwest tomorrow this is not the time

6340
05:18:47,100 --> 05:18:50,100
all right so if you were going to apply

6341
05:18:50,100 --> 05:18:52,260
for this job so you've done the research

6342
05:18:52,260 --> 05:18:54,958
you've created a resume specifically for

6343
05:18:54,958 --> 05:18:57,420
this job and then you go down here once

6344
05:18:57,420 --> 05:18:59,458
you've created this resume for this job

6345
05:18:59,458 --> 05:19:01,620
and then you hit apply now

6346
05:19:01,620 --> 05:19:03,240
then it's going to say would you like to

6347
05:19:03,240 --> 05:19:06,240
create an account and you say absolutely

6348
05:19:06,240 --> 05:19:08,638
heck yeah I do I want to create an

6349
05:19:08,638 --> 05:19:10,378
account I want to put my username and

6350
05:19:10,378 --> 05:19:12,120
password I want to put my email address

6351
05:19:12,120 --> 05:19:13,798
in here so if you're currently job

6352
05:19:13,798 --> 05:19:15,240
hunting right now I need you to create a

6353
05:19:15,240 --> 05:19:17,400
new email address it's

6354
05:19:17,400 --> 05:19:20,638
Jason knock at

6355
05:19:20,638 --> 05:19:24,780
do you hire me gmail.com

6356
05:19:24,780 --> 05:19:28,320
so think about this have a have an email

6357
05:19:28,320 --> 05:19:30,958
account specifically for job hunting

6358
05:19:30,958 --> 05:19:33,060
so that way all job hunting emails go

6359
05:19:33,060 --> 05:19:34,500
into the same inbox

6360
05:19:34,500 --> 05:19:36,480
and in the future guess what when you

6361
05:19:36,480 --> 05:19:38,580
sign up for Southwest to say I want to

6362
05:19:38,580 --> 05:19:39,660
apply for this job you know what they're

6363
05:19:39,660 --> 05:19:41,458
going to do every time a job comes up

6364
05:19:41,458 --> 05:19:42,718
that's similar to the one that you

6365
05:19:42,718 --> 05:19:44,520
applied for they're like hey we got a

6366
05:19:44,520 --> 05:19:45,480
new job

6367
05:19:45,480 --> 05:19:48,060
hey we got a new job hey we got a new

6368
05:19:48,060 --> 05:19:49,560
job and it's just going to keep coming

6369
05:19:49,560 --> 05:19:51,120
in keep coming in they're like but Jason

6370
05:19:51,120 --> 05:19:52,920
I work a crowdstrike now why would I

6371
05:19:52,920 --> 05:19:54,780
want to work at Southwest well maybe you

6372
05:19:54,780 --> 05:19:56,940
didn't you don't like crowdstrike

6373
05:19:56,940 --> 05:20:00,120
and so the jobs keep coming in so that's

6374
05:20:00,120 --> 05:20:01,680
why you apply at the company's website

6375
05:20:01,680 --> 05:20:04,560
so that they keep coming in over and

6376
05:20:04,560 --> 05:20:07,440
over and over again until you decide if

6377
05:20:07,440 --> 05:20:09,420
you want to leave or not because here's

6378
05:20:09,420 --> 05:20:11,400
the main thing about today

6379
05:20:11,400 --> 05:20:13,500
please job hunt before you need a job

6380
05:20:13,500 --> 05:20:14,458
hunt

6381
05:20:14,458 --> 05:20:16,260
please make a resume before you need to

6382
05:20:16,260 --> 05:20:17,878
make a resume please network with people

6383
05:20:17,878 --> 05:20:19,378
before you need to network with people

6384
05:20:19,378 --> 05:20:22,620
because the day will come when all of a

6385
05:20:22,620 --> 05:20:24,958
sudden you will need a resume when

6386
05:20:24,958 --> 05:20:26,580
you'll need a network and when you'll

6387
05:20:26,580 --> 05:20:29,100
need a job hunt and that is the worst

6388
05:20:29,100 --> 05:20:30,958
time to do any of those

6389
05:20:30,958 --> 05:20:33,840
because you are mentally distraught

6390
05:20:33,840 --> 05:20:36,420
you are down on yourself because you

6391
05:20:36,420 --> 05:20:38,218
were laid off and other people weren't

6392
05:20:38,218 --> 05:20:41,638
so your self-confidence is killed so all

6393
05:20:41,638 --> 05:20:43,920
of a sudden that is the worst time to

6394
05:20:43,920 --> 05:20:46,260
put all this stuff together because the

6395
05:20:46,260 --> 05:20:48,780
entire time instead of being humble and

6396
05:20:48,780 --> 05:20:52,579
honest you're like I suck

6397
05:20:54,860 --> 05:20:57,480
and so that's why it's not good to build

6398
05:20:57,480 --> 05:20:59,458
a resume when you need one

6399
05:20:59,458 --> 05:21:01,080
so the other thing right now if you

6400
05:21:01,080 --> 05:21:03,298
currently have a job set a reminder in

6401
05:21:03,298 --> 05:21:04,740
your phone or something that every six

6402
05:21:04,740 --> 05:21:06,360
months update your resume

6403
05:21:06,360 --> 05:21:07,920
to set a reminder every six months

6404
05:21:07,920 --> 05:21:09,480
update your resume even if you have a

6405
05:21:09,480 --> 05:21:11,340
job just update it here's a really good

6406
05:21:11,340 --> 05:21:13,138
time to update your resume after any

6407
05:21:13,138 --> 05:21:14,878
performance review

6408
05:21:14,878 --> 05:21:16,620
you get a performance review they say a

6409
05:21:16,620 --> 05:21:18,060
couple nice things about you you slap

6410
05:21:18,060 --> 05:21:19,860
those nice things into your your new

6411
05:21:19,860 --> 05:21:21,180
resume and you're like there we go got

6412
05:21:21,180 --> 05:21:23,160
it you have some achievements at work

6413
05:21:23,160 --> 05:21:24,900
you just knocked out of the park take

6414
05:21:24,900 --> 05:21:26,040
those things throw it in your resume

6415
05:21:26,040 --> 05:21:27,900
update it all the time because here's

6416
05:21:27,900 --> 05:21:29,400
the thing some of you might work for the

6417
05:21:29,400 --> 05:21:30,840
same company for 12 years and all of a

6418
05:21:30,840 --> 05:21:32,700
sudden you get let go and now you have

6419
05:21:32,700 --> 05:21:34,860
to go what the hell did I do for 12

6420
05:21:34,860 --> 05:21:36,120
years

6421
05:21:36,120 --> 05:21:38,100
oh my God

6422
05:21:38,100 --> 05:21:41,218
I don't remember any of that and so

6423
05:21:41,218 --> 05:21:42,958
that's the worst time to try to figure

6424
05:21:42,958 --> 05:21:45,660
out what you did all those years okay so

6425
05:21:45,660 --> 05:21:47,760
step number one is to find a job to

6426
05:21:47,760 --> 05:21:50,100
apply for by creating a list of where

6427
05:21:50,100 --> 05:21:52,020
you want to work so we found Southwest

6428
05:21:52,020 --> 05:21:54,298
we went and researched Southwest we went

6429
05:21:54,298 --> 05:21:56,400
to southwestcareers.com we found a job

6430
05:21:56,400 --> 05:21:58,798
to apply for we created a resume based

6431
05:21:58,798 --> 05:22:00,420
on the job description not just the

6432
05:22:00,420 --> 05:22:02,580
resume and now you start tracking down

6433
05:22:02,580 --> 05:22:04,200
the people who actually work at the

6434
05:22:04,200 --> 05:22:06,900
company so if I go back over here and I

6435
05:22:06,900 --> 05:22:09,780
go to Southwest and I find the people so

6436
05:22:09,780 --> 05:22:13,080
once again you find people and I type in

6437
05:22:13,080 --> 05:22:16,020
let's see who do I want to work so I

6438
05:22:16,020 --> 05:22:18,660
would type in recruiter right

6439
05:22:18,660 --> 05:22:21,540
so recruiter wow

6440
05:22:21,540 --> 05:22:23,820
it's because you're all watching right

6441
05:22:23,820 --> 05:22:25,680
so I find these recruiters and I can

6442
05:22:25,680 --> 05:22:27,420
just go over here to Gabriel

6443
05:22:27,420 --> 05:22:30,120
and Gabriel's got his messages locked oh

6444
05:22:30,120 --> 05:22:32,400
man Gabriel why would you do that okay

6445
05:22:32,400 --> 05:22:34,620
so instead of being able to just send a

6446
05:22:34,620 --> 05:22:36,360
message freely through to Gabriel

6447
05:22:36,360 --> 05:22:38,580
through Linkedin I'll have to do it the

6448
05:22:38,580 --> 05:22:41,580
hacker way so I go down here to show out

6451
05:22:45,660 --> 05:22:49,020

6452
05:22:49,020 --> 05:22:51,360

because they have 395 jobs open and I'm

6522
05:25:44,280 --> 05:25:48,020
going to type in CTO

6523
05:25:50,580 --> 05:25:53,400
all right so we got a couple senior

6524
05:25:53,400 --> 05:25:56,160
Executives here we got John

6525
05:25:56,160 --> 05:25:59,400
and John's messages are are not open

6526
05:25:59,400 --> 05:26:02,340
but I could look at John's activity and

6527
05:26:02,340 --> 05:26:04,200
maybe on the right hand side it might

6528
05:26:04,200 --> 05:26:05,760
introduce me to other people who work

6529
05:26:05,760 --> 05:26:07,560
there like an information security

6530
05:26:07,560 --> 05:26:10,680
person we got this here and I look and

6531
05:26:10,680 --> 05:26:12,780
see is there any activity

6532
05:26:12,780 --> 05:26:14,638
nine months ago

6533
05:26:14,638 --> 05:26:16,980

6534
05:26:16,980 --> 05:26:20,400
and that's okay so some of you it's okay

6535

response

6552
05:26:52,440 --> 05:26:54,000
I don't know

6553
05:26:54,000 --> 05:26:55,260
I don't know

6554
05:26:55,260 --> 05:26:56,878
but if you send 100 of those how many

6555
05:26:56,878 --> 05:26:59,940
should you respect expect back

6556
05:26:59,940 --> 05:27:01,860
two to three percent

6557
05:27:01,860 --> 05:27:04,680
isn't that better than zero

6558
05:27:04,680 --> 05:27:06,540

6560

you have for someone like me

6564
05:27:13,260 --> 05:27:17,280
lastly lastly in conclusion

6565
05:27:17,280 --> 05:27:18,900
you know we've been doing all this

6566
05:27:18,900 --> 05:27:20,458
searches we've been creating all this

6567
05:27:20,458 --> 05:27:21,958
information we've been finding things

6568
05:27:21,958 --> 05:27:23,878
we've been looking stuff up so what do

6569
05:27:23,878 --> 05:27:27,920
you do with it all you keep track of it

6570
05:27:28,260 --> 05:27:30,240
you keep track of it you keep track of

6571
05:27:30,240 --> 05:27:32,940
who you reached out to what company you

6572
05:27:32,940 --> 05:27:34,920
talk to who at that company you reached

6573
05:27:34,920 --> 05:27:37,080
out to when you reached out to them did

6574
05:27:37,080 --> 05:27:39,298
they respond back to you did you send a

6575
05:27:39,298 --> 05:27:41,040
follow-up did they respond to that

6576
05:27:41,040 --> 05:27:43,020
follow-up if they did not did you send

6577
05:27:43,020 --> 05:27:44,760
one more follow-up

6578
05:27:44,760 --> 05:27:47,218
so here's the the Cadence of follow-ups

6579
05:27:47,218 --> 05:27:49,200
you can send a message

6580
05:27:49,200 --> 05:27:51,060
and then seven days later you can send

6581
05:27:51,060 --> 05:27:53,878
another message and then 21 days later

6582
05:27:53,878 --> 05:27:56,458
you can send one more message and that

6583
05:27:56,458 --> 05:27:58,680
is called not harassment

6584
05:27:58,680 --> 05:28:00,360
if you send one today and one tomorrow

6585
05:28:00,360 --> 05:28:02,280
and then one the day after that say why

6586
05:28:02,280 --> 05:28:04,320
didn't you respond what is wrong

6587
05:28:04,320 --> 05:28:05,760
are you okay

6588
05:28:05,760 --> 05:28:09,920
are we fine I missed you

6589
05:28:10,980 --> 05:28:13,378
that's not good don't do that

6590
05:28:13,378 --> 05:28:15,000
but if you send a message a week later

6591
05:28:15,000 --> 05:28:16,500
say hey

6592
05:28:16,500 --> 05:28:18,600
is it possible to talk to you about this

6593
05:28:18,600 --> 05:28:21,540
job and see if it's still available

6594
05:28:21,540 --> 05:28:22,920
I wanted to see if I could top your

6595
05:28:22,920 --> 05:28:25,798
inbox is there a better way to reach you

6596
05:28:25,798 --> 05:28:27,958
than through Linkedin

6597
05:28:27,958 --> 05:28:30,360
and what happens is everyone's busy do

6598
05:28:30,360 --> 05:28:32,218
you know what you are when you reach out

6599
05:28:32,218 --> 05:28:33,480
to these people

6600
05:28:33,480 --> 05:28:35,638
you're a distraction from what they're

6601
05:28:35,638 --> 05:28:38,100
trying to accomplish and in that moment

6602
05:28:38,100 --> 05:28:39,718
they may not have the time for your

6603
05:28:39,718 --> 05:28:42,420
distraction but they will a week later

6604
05:28:42,420 --> 05:28:43,620
Maybe

6605
05:28:43,620 --> 05:28:46,080
they might three weeks later they might

6606
05:28:46,080 --> 05:28:47,760
be thinking about you every single night

6607
05:28:47,760 --> 05:28:49,740
before they fall asleep going I should

6608
05:28:49,740 --> 05:28:51,860
probably respond to that student

6609
05:28:51,860 --> 05:28:54,000
I just need to do that and then three

6610
05:28:54,000 --> 05:28:55,860
weeks goes by and then that's one more

6611
05:28:55,860 --> 05:28:57,360
follow-up message and they're like you

6612
05:28:57,360 --> 05:28:59,218
know what I have time today

6613
05:28:59,218 --> 05:29:01,080
I have time today

6614
05:29:01,080 --> 05:29:02,280
so the

6615
05:29:02,280 --> 05:29:05,660
I want to leave you with this

6616
05:29:07,680 --> 05:29:09,900
it's going to get rough out there

6617
05:29:09,900 --> 05:29:11,878
it will be

6618
05:29:11,878 --> 05:29:13,378
uh but you're not going to do it like

6619
05:29:13,378 --> 05:29:15,480
everybody else's you're gonna do it

6620
05:29:15,480 --> 05:29:16,740
differently you're gonna do it like a

6621
05:29:16,740 --> 05:29:18,180
hacker you're gonna say you know what

6622
05:29:18,180 --> 05:29:20,340
I'm gonna find my way through I'm gonna

6623
05:29:20,340 --> 05:29:22,440
and if I run into a roadblock I'll try

6624
05:29:22,440 --> 05:29:24,120
something else and if I run into a

6625
05:29:24,120 --> 05:29:25,500
roadblock I'll try something else if I

6626
05:29:25,500 --> 05:29:26,638
run into a roadblock I would try

6627
05:29:26,638 --> 05:29:28,500
something else and I will figure out

6628
05:29:28,500 --> 05:29:29,878
where I want to work

6629
05:29:29,878 --> 05:29:31,860
and then I will create a custom tailored

6630
05:29:31,860 --> 05:29:33,840
resume for that job description so that

6631
05:29:33,840 --> 05:29:36,660
way I let you know I can do the things

6632
05:29:36,660 --> 05:29:39,360
that you want to do I will track down

6633
05:29:39,360 --> 05:29:41,638
the people through your website I will

6634
05:29:41,638 --> 05:29:43,920
find the people who give jobs and I will

6635
05:29:43,920 --> 05:29:45,480
keep track of all the stuff so that way

6636
05:29:45,480 --> 05:29:48,120
when I get my job I can literally say I

6637

6682
05:31:27,240 --> 05:31:29,040
part where did you get the skills does

6683
05:31:29,040 --> 05:31:31,260
it matter you just have the skills

6684
05:31:31,260 --> 05:31:35,179
okay all right thank you yes

6685
05:31:36,060 --> 05:31:37,520
chuck chuck

6686
05:31:37,520 --> 05:31:40,740
uh from the other perspective it's like

6687
05:31:40,740 --> 05:31:43,020
obviously a whole nother talk but how

6688
05:31:43,020 --> 05:31:44,520
would you

6689
05:31:44,520 --> 05:31:48,298
use what you just uh gave us from the

6690
05:31:48,298 --> 05:31:49,860
other perspective of writing job

6691
05:31:49,860 --> 05:31:52,440
descriptions to hire people so writing

6692
05:31:52,440 --> 05:31:54,540
job descriptions first of all uh don't

6693
05:31:54,540 --> 05:31:57,298
put too much on there like really get

6694
05:31:57,298 --> 05:31:59,280
the things that you really need instead

6695
05:31:59,280 --> 05:32:00,780
of putting all the things on there

6696
05:32:00,780 --> 05:32:03,420
because what that does is deter so many

6697
05:32:03,420 --> 05:32:05,340
people because they see all these things

6698
05:32:05,340 --> 05:32:06,540
and they're like I can't do all those

6699
05:32:06,540 --> 05:32:08,100
things like so narrow down the things

6700
05:32:08,100 --> 05:32:10,440
that you really really need and if it's

6701
05:32:10,440 --> 05:32:12,780
entry level then really be entry level

6702
05:32:12,780 --> 05:32:15,060
if it's intermediate then really BE

6703
05:32:15,060 --> 05:32:16,798
intermediate and if it's an expert level

6704
05:32:16,798 --> 05:32:19,080
then be really expert level because what

6705
05:32:19,080 --> 05:32:21,240
happens is people who are job hunting

6706
05:32:21,240 --> 05:32:22,980
don't understand a lot of times they're

6707
05:32:22,980 --> 05:32:25,020
like it's an entry level job but you're

6708
05:32:25,020 --> 05:32:26,878
looking for five years of experience and

6709
05:32:26,878 --> 05:32:28,378
so be honest in what you're looking for

6710
05:32:28,378 --> 05:32:30,958
and just the bare bones of what you

6711
05:32:30,958 --> 05:32:33,480
really really want and say these are the

6712
05:32:33,480 --> 05:32:35,100
things we really want these are a must

6713
05:32:35,100 --> 05:32:37,500
or nice to haves because that nice to

6714
05:32:37,500 --> 05:32:38,940
have is then people are like oh cool

6715
05:32:38,940 --> 05:32:40,860
well I don't have that but I do have

6716
05:32:40,860 --> 05:32:43,260
these things and so now they can make an

6717
05:32:43,260 --> 05:32:45,000
honest assessment of themselves is to

6718
05:32:45,000 --> 05:32:47,400
apply for the job yeah yeah can I

6719
05:32:47,400 --> 05:32:49,560
broaden that to maybe even a little bit

6720
05:32:49,560 --> 05:32:51,480
further can you flip this and do another

6721
05:32:51,480 --> 05:32:54,360
talk to uh how to head hunt or hiring

6722
05:32:54,360 --> 05:32:57,060
manager like a hacker and how how to

6723
05:32:57,060 --> 05:32:58,500
hire the best possible people for the

6724
05:32:58,500 --> 05:33:00,360
positions you're looking for

6725
05:33:00,360 --> 05:33:03,860
I will uh consider that

6726
05:33:09,420 --> 05:33:12,540
thing's cool so I just wanted uh some

6727
05:33:12,540 --> 05:33:14,878
jobs ask for like required two to three

6728
05:33:14,878 --> 05:33:16,440
years or like three to five years of

6729
05:33:16,440 --> 05:33:18,840
experience okay if someone doesn't have

6730
05:33:18,840 --> 05:33:20,218
that number of peers does it

6731
05:33:20,218 --> 05:33:22,320
automatically disqualify you yeah so

6732
05:33:22,320 --> 05:33:24,420
here's the thing about experience

6733
05:33:24,420 --> 05:33:26,458
the the issue is a lot of times your

6734
05:33:26,458 --> 05:33:27,660
students or a lot of times you're new

6735
05:33:27,660 --> 05:33:29,040
and you're like well I don't have two to

6736
05:33:29,040 --> 05:33:30,840
three years of experience but you kind

6737
05:33:30,840 --> 05:33:32,520
of do

6738
05:33:32,520 --> 05:33:34,620
what most of us think experience is is

6739
05:33:34,620 --> 05:33:36,718
that someone paid us for it

6740
05:33:36,718 --> 05:33:38,580
and you think the only experience is

6741
05:33:38,580 --> 05:33:40,440
when someone paid you for it but that's

6742
05:33:40,440 --> 05:33:42,480
not true if you don't hack the Box try

6743
05:33:42,480 --> 05:33:43,620
to hack me if you're doing your own

6744
05:33:43,620 --> 05:33:45,000
independent studies if you have your own

6745
05:33:45,000 --> 05:33:46,560
home lab if there's things that you're

6746
05:33:46,560 --> 05:33:48,360
doing that you consider experience

6747
05:33:48,360 --> 05:33:50,878
that's experience and so it's okay to

6748
05:33:50,878 --> 05:33:52,620
list those things because like when I

6749
05:33:52,620 --> 05:33:54,120
started out in the in the film industry

6750
05:33:54,120 --> 05:33:57,060
no one was giving me a shot so what I

6751
05:33:57,060 --> 05:33:58,860
had to do was do my own film shoots my

6752
05:33:58,860 --> 05:34:01,080
own short films my own music videos my

6753
05:34:01,080 --> 05:34:02,340
own things I had to like go out and

6754
05:34:02,340 --> 05:34:04,620
hustle and find people and after three

6755
05:34:04,620 --> 05:34:06,360
years I had three years of experience

6756
05:34:06,360 --> 05:34:09,120
and no one ever paid me for it but all

6757
05:34:09,120 --> 05:34:10,200
of a sudden I started getting jobs

6758
05:34:10,200 --> 05:34:11,638
because I could say I have three years

6759
05:34:11,638 --> 05:34:13,378
of experience and I had to create it

6760
05:34:13,378 --> 05:34:16,138
myself so it's okay if your experience

6761
05:34:16,138 --> 05:34:17,458
came from the things that you're doing

6762
05:34:17,458 --> 05:34:19,980
for yourself literally call yourself an

6763
05:34:19,980 --> 05:34:21,900
LLC and you paid yourself an experience

6764
05:34:21,900 --> 05:34:24,298
right and so it's okay to say I have

6765
05:34:24,298 --> 05:34:26,218
this experience that it came from I gave

6766
05:34:26,218 --> 05:34:28,080
it to myself

6767
05:34:28,080 --> 05:34:30,840
uh last one

6768
05:34:30,840 --> 05:34:33,260
yes

6769
05:34:35,878 --> 05:34:40,440
all right uh so they're in that in you

6770
05:34:40,440 --> 05:34:43,560
talking about experience how often

6771
05:34:43,560 --> 05:34:46,798
should we put down an accomplishment of

6772
05:34:46,798 --> 05:34:49,798
experience you know maybe we've

6773
05:34:49,798 --> 05:34:51,958
um worked at

6774
05:34:51,958 --> 05:34:52,940
um

6775
05:34:52,940 --> 05:34:55,798
some some random thing here here and

6776
05:34:55,798 --> 05:34:58,980
there or you know like

6777
05:34:58,980 --> 05:35:02,040
if I'm working in my home lab how much

6778
05:35:02,040 --> 05:35:04,200
at what point do I say okay I have

6779
05:35:04,200 --> 05:35:06,718
experience with

6780
05:35:06,718 --> 05:35:10,080
um SQL injection or a SQL or whatever so

6781
05:35:10,080 --> 05:35:12,060
the question is what kind of experience

6782
05:35:12,060 --> 05:35:14,458
would you list like what's good and

6783
05:35:14,458 --> 05:35:17,100
what's do you leave off remember the job

6784
05:35:17,100 --> 05:35:18,718
descriptions the framework

6785
05:35:18,718 --> 05:35:20,878
if the job descriptions looking for SQL

6786
05:35:20,878 --> 05:35:22,680
and you have SQL experience and listed

6787
05:35:22,680 --> 05:35:24,240
if the job description is looking for

6788
05:35:24,240 --> 05:35:25,680
this then listed the job descriptions

6789
05:35:25,680 --> 05:35:27,540
looking for this and list it if it's not

6790
05:35:27,540 --> 05:35:28,798
looking for that you don't need to put

6791
05:35:28,798 --> 05:35:30,660
it on there so once again the job

6792
05:35:30,660 --> 05:35:32,340
description is the framework for what

6793
05:35:32,340 --> 05:35:34,740
you put on your resume and you use that

6794
05:35:34,740 --> 05:35:36,600
if they're looking for this and you have

6795
05:35:36,600 --> 05:35:38,100
that then you list it if you don't have

6796
05:35:38,100 --> 05:35:39,780
it then you don't list it does that

6797
05:35:39,780 --> 05:35:42,060
answer your question yeah okay all right

6798
05:35:42,060 --> 05:35:44,040

see it as going but I'll have Ken

6847
05:44:17,820 --> 05:44:19,320
introduce himself and then we'll have

6848
05:44:19,320 --> 05:44:21,540
our other panelists introduce themselves

6849
05:44:21,540 --> 05:44:24,058
as well sure yeah so I'm Seth's co-host

6850
05:44:24,058 --> 05:44:26,280
on our podcast absolute absec has

6851
05:44:26,280 --> 05:44:27,360
anybody actually seen the podcast

6852
05:44:27,360 --> 05:44:31,200
anybody a couple few sweet so not a ton

6853
05:44:31,200 --> 05:44:34,020
but yeah it's pretty much not a ton not

6854
05:44:34,020 --> 05:44:37,200
a ton but it's like a practical sort of

6855
05:44:37,200 --> 05:44:39,900
uh yeah appsec focused obviously podcast

6856
05:44:39,900 --> 05:44:42,718
and so uh yeah I'm Ken Johnson at CK

6857
05:44:42,718 --> 05:44:45,600
tricky on Twitter and his is uh anyways

6858
05:44:45,600 --> 05:44:48,120
long story short uh I guess my

6859
05:44:48,120 --> 05:44:50,760
background would be uh uh Builder and

6860
05:44:50,760 --> 05:44:52,860
breaker so I've been on the uh internal

6861
05:44:52,860 --> 05:44:54,780
Defender side right now I'm at GitHub I

6862
05:44:54,780 --> 05:44:57,180
manage a few teams uh their red team and

6863
05:44:57,180 --> 05:44:58,620
assessments uh kind of the more

6864
05:44:58,620 --> 05:45:00,420
applicable to this talk so application

6865
05:45:00,420 --> 05:45:02,340
security but also full-on red teaming

6866
05:45:02,340 --> 05:45:04,860
but um anyways so I guess you know

6867
05:45:04,860 --> 05:45:06,780
that's how I met Seth a long long time

6868
05:45:06,780 --> 05:45:08,458
ago when Fishnet security was still

6869
05:45:08,458 --> 05:45:11,160
Fishnet security before optiv worked at

6870
05:45:11,160 --> 05:45:12,660
Living Social with Mike over there on

6871
05:45:12,660 --> 05:45:14,218
the end which we'll get to Mike's

6872
05:45:14,218 --> 05:45:16,138
background here in a bit I've known

6873
05:45:16,138 --> 05:45:18,240
Andrew forever like I was at fishnet

6874
05:45:18,240 --> 05:45:20,340
when uh when I met Andrew does anyone

6875
05:45:20,340 --> 05:45:22,260
here know Andrew

6876
05:45:22,260 --> 05:45:25,260
on

6877
05:45:29,100 --> 05:45:30,780
so he's like the original founder of

6878
05:45:30,780 --> 05:45:32,160
this conference yes for you guys didn't

6879
05:45:32,160 --> 05:45:33,840
know uh

6880
05:45:33,840 --> 05:45:35,400
something like that right I think I got

6881
05:45:35,400 --> 05:45:36,780
that right that sounds right that sounds

6882
05:45:36,780 --> 05:45:38,040
about right but we've all known each

6883
05:45:38,040 --> 05:45:39,780
other for a long time and I guess the

6884
05:45:39,780 --> 05:45:41,040
point you know I could go on and on

6885
05:45:41,040 --> 05:45:42,780
about credentials or whatever but like

6886
05:45:42,780 --> 05:45:44,638
the point is is we've all been in this

6887
05:45:44,638 --> 05:45:46,320
industry for a long time we've known

6888
05:45:46,320 --> 05:45:48,120
each other for a long time and we kind

6889
05:45:48,120 --> 05:45:50,218
of grew up from like young 20 year olds

6890
05:45:50,218 --> 05:45:51,718
into middle-aged

6891
05:45:51,718 --> 05:45:53,700
people right so

6892
05:45:53,700 --> 05:45:55,558
in this industry so I think that's the

6893
05:45:55,558 --> 05:45:57,298
the most important part to kind of talk

6894
05:45:57,298 --> 05:45:58,860
about with all of us is we're going to

6895
05:45:58,860 --> 05:46:00,420
share our insights what's changed what

6896
05:46:00,420 --> 05:46:03,058
hasn't yeah but we yeah we will do

6897
05:46:03,058 --> 05:46:04,860
introductions I'll have Mike go first

6898
05:46:04,860 --> 05:46:07,680
we'll go outside in sure if my mic is

6899
05:46:07,680 --> 05:46:10,138

uh yes I am one of the co-founders of

6917
05:46:44,940 --> 05:46:47,040
cactuscon it's not I would I hate to say

6918
05:46:47,040 --> 05:46:49,440
it was my conference but uh as a lead

6919
05:46:49,440 --> 05:46:51,298
organizer for the first eight years and

6920
05:46:51,298 --> 05:46:52,860
now my wife is running it this year

6921
05:46:52,860 --> 05:46:55,680
we've had some kind of help between that

6922
05:46:55,680 --> 05:46:57,900
um outside of cactuscon I currently am

6923
05:46:57,900 --> 05:46:59,638
the vice president and general manager

6924
05:46:59,638 --> 05:47:01,620
of Latin America I'm actually living in

6925
05:47:01,620 --> 05:47:04,138
Mexico and I ran the consulting services

6926
05:47:04,138 --> 05:47:06,718
and Delivery for Bishop Fox and I was an

6927
05:47:06,718 --> 05:47:09,540
app pen testing specialist for most of

6928
05:47:09,540 --> 05:47:12,058
my career so I've been with the company

6929
05:47:12,058 --> 05:47:14,100
there for 11 years so I don't really

6930
05:47:14,100 --> 05:47:16,378
have a lot of other stories about you

6931
05:47:16,378 --> 05:47:17,878
know cool small companies like cap one

6932
05:47:17,878 --> 05:47:20,520
but I've been working uh I've been

6933
05:47:20,520 --> 05:47:22,378
working in absec for pretty much the

6934
05:47:22,378 --> 05:47:24,600
entirety of my professional career some

6935
05:47:24,600 --> 05:47:26,820
some level of software engineering or

6936
05:47:26,820 --> 05:47:30,840
breaking into things great all right so

6937
05:47:30,840 --> 05:47:32,878
how this is going to flow if you have

6938
05:47:32,878 --> 05:47:35,218
questions please feel freighter free to

6939
05:47:35,218 --> 05:47:37,138
raise your hand at any time like we're

6940
05:47:37,138 --> 05:47:38,458
not going to wait until the end we want

6941
05:47:38,458 --> 05:47:40,500
it to be pretty informal as you've heard

6942
05:47:40,500 --> 05:47:43,138
we've got a fair bit of experience in

6943
05:47:43,138 --> 05:47:45,660
the application security field I I dare

6944
05:47:45,660 --> 05:47:47,638
say most of us started in application

6945
05:47:47,638 --> 05:47:50,638
security before it was termed

6946
05:47:50,638 --> 05:47:52,878
application security

6947
05:47:52,878 --> 05:47:55,320
but that's where I wanted to start with

6948
05:47:55,320 --> 05:47:57,600
the panel today is

6949
05:47:57,600 --> 05:47:58,520
um

6950
05:47:58,520 --> 05:48:00,298
where

6951
05:48:00,298 --> 05:48:02,700
well maybe we'll start with yeah I'll

6952
05:48:02,700 --> 05:48:04,440
say this one of the things I'm trying to

6953
05:48:04,440 --> 05:48:07,320
get out of this is what exactly has

6954
05:48:07,320 --> 05:48:09,240
changed in your day-to-day job I mean

6955
05:48:09,240 --> 05:48:10,860
obviously all of our jobs have evolved

6956
05:48:10,860 --> 05:48:12,780
over time from being you know straight

6957
05:48:12,780 --> 05:48:16,320
up Hands-On keyboard ICS although we but

6958
05:48:16,320 --> 05:48:19,200
all do some of that but in terms of you

6959
05:48:19,200 --> 05:48:21,420
know just the General State of how

6960
05:48:21,420 --> 05:48:23,940
either defense goes or how the offense

6961
05:48:23,940 --> 05:48:26,040
goes or just in general your thoughts on

6962
05:48:26,040 --> 05:48:28,378
yeah how have jobs changed in this field

6963
05:48:28,378 --> 05:48:30,718
and by the way just to clarify in case

6964
05:48:30,718 --> 05:48:32,580
you aren't familiar with appsec it's web

6965
05:48:32,580 --> 05:48:33,958
security but I think most people in the

6966
05:48:33,958 --> 05:48:36,480
room know what absec is yeah does anyone

6967
05:48:36,480 --> 05:48:38,520
know what application security is who

6968
05:48:38,520 --> 05:48:41,040
wants to Define it for us

6969
05:48:41,040 --> 05:48:43,700
Mike

6970
05:48:44,100 --> 05:48:47,040
well philosophically philosophically yes

6971
05:48:47,040 --> 05:48:49,500
yes I mean traditionally spin testing

6972
05:48:49,500 --> 05:48:50,940
web applications but obviously that's

6973
05:48:50,940 --> 05:48:53,458
changed a lot mobile applications iot it

6974
05:48:53,458 --> 05:48:55,500
all falls under absec these days but

6975
05:48:55,500 --> 05:48:58,020
code review Dynamic testing

6976
05:48:58,020 --> 05:49:00,718
sort of pen testing all those kind of

6977
05:49:00,718 --> 05:49:02,580
things fall within the abstract realm

6978
05:49:02,580 --> 05:49:05,100
yeah okay so how has it changed for you

6979
05:49:05,100 --> 05:49:08,820
since your yeah since your Advent in the

6980
05:49:08,820 --> 05:49:11,580
space I would say things have improved

6981
05:49:11,580 --> 05:49:14,040
but I'd say it's uneven because I feel

6982
05:49:14,040 --> 05:49:15,480
like when you do we do a lot of

6983
05:49:15,480 --> 05:49:17,040
engagements that are Consulting so come

6984
05:49:17,040 --> 05:49:18,840
in do a few weeks of testing and then

6985
05:49:18,840 --> 05:49:21,718
write up a report and say what is

6986
05:49:21,718 --> 05:49:24,360
good bad or ugly and so sometimes you'll

6987
05:49:24,360 --> 05:49:25,740
go into a place and you'll spend a lot

6988
05:49:25,740 --> 05:49:27,360
of time and not a lot will come out and

6989
05:49:27,360 --> 05:49:28,558
you're like well these guys take

6990
05:49:28,558 --> 05:49:29,878
security seriously they've probably done

6991
05:49:29,878 --> 05:49:31,500
a code review they've done abstract

6992
05:49:31,500 --> 05:49:32,700
testing before

6993
05:49:32,700 --> 05:49:34,740
and then you might find some very

6994
05:49:34,740 --> 05:49:36,980
interesting Edge case or maybe a

6995
05:49:36,980 --> 05:49:38,878
framework or language specific

6996
05:49:38,878 --> 05:49:40,080
vulnerability and that would be like

6997
05:49:40,080 --> 05:49:41,700
your big thing for that for that

6998
05:49:41,700 --> 05:49:43,320
engagement so you'll be like okay these

6999
05:49:43,320 --> 05:49:45,480
people have improved clearly

7000
05:49:45,480 --> 05:49:47,340
things have improved then you'll go

7001
05:49:47,340 --> 05:49:48,840
somewhere else and you like day one

7002
05:49:48,840 --> 05:49:50,760
you'll have you know full remote code

7003
05:49:50,760 --> 05:49:52,200
execution and you're like well nothing's

7004
05:49:52,200 --> 05:49:54,718
changed the industry is a fraud and you

7005
05:49:54,718 --> 05:49:57,120
know we make we make no impact so I'd

7006
05:49:57,120 --> 05:49:59,040
say it's it's improved in certain ways

7007
05:49:59,040 --> 05:50:01,680
obviously there's much more awareness of

7008
05:50:01,680 --> 05:50:04,260
security and application security coding

7009
05:50:04,260 --> 05:50:06,058
standards and just like ways to avoid

7010
05:50:06,058 --> 05:50:07,680
these things and I think Frameworks have

7011
05:50:07,680 --> 05:50:10,440
helped out a huge amount but it's

7012
05:50:10,440 --> 05:50:12,718
definitely uneven okay when you say

7013
05:50:12,718 --> 05:50:14,700
Frameworks though like do you like can

7014
05:50:14,700 --> 05:50:16,378
you expand upon that piece because

7015
05:50:16,378 --> 05:50:17,878
that's that's known to us but I'm not

7016
05:50:17,878 --> 05:50:20,340
sure if everybody knows like yeah Django

7017
05:50:20,340 --> 05:50:21,718
I think has a really great security

7018
05:50:21,718 --> 05:50:23,878
model they do a lot of Forward Thinking

7019
05:50:23,878 --> 05:50:26,400
stuff Ruby on Rails you've probably

7020
05:50:26,400 --> 05:50:30,540
never heard of it but um [ __ ] you

7021
05:50:30,540 --> 05:50:32,820
that was a shot at me yeah yeah but see

7022
05:50:32,820 --> 05:50:33,840
I think the funny thing is those

7023
05:50:33,840 --> 05:50:35,520
Frameworks have done really great things

7024
05:50:35,520 --> 05:50:37,940
then you go to

7025
05:50:42,360 --> 05:50:43,798
we spent four hours this morning talking

7026
05:50:43,798 --> 05:50:46,920
about PHP so we do talk about it

7027
05:50:46,920 --> 05:50:48,958
um but then you go to like node or

7028
05:50:48,958 --> 05:50:51,859
where it's not a whole

7029
05:50:54,420 --> 05:50:55,920
if you're building your own session

7030
05:50:55,920 --> 05:50:58,700
management system in your go or node app

7031
05:50:58,700 --> 05:51:00,840
probably not doing it right but that's

7032
05:51:00,840 --> 05:51:03,660
kind of things have become more

7033
05:51:03,660 --> 05:51:05,580
um kind of component component based

7034
05:51:05,580 --> 05:51:07,200
versus having a whole MVC framework and

7035
05:51:07,200 --> 05:51:09,240
I think that has reintroduced issues

7036
05:51:09,240 --> 05:51:11,700
that we solved with larger framework so

7037
05:51:11,700 --> 05:51:14,400
that's why I say it's uneven it's uneven

7038
05:51:14,400 --> 05:51:16,500
okay all right what about you Andrew

7039
05:51:16,500 --> 05:51:18,298
what's changed since you got into the

7040
05:51:18,298 --> 05:51:20,040
space

7041
05:51:20,040 --> 05:51:21,298
wow

7042
05:51:21,298 --> 05:51:24,180
um so I definitely would Echo I agree

7043
05:51:24,180 --> 05:51:26,820
about Frameworks that having made a

7044
05:51:26,820 --> 05:51:28,558
significant difference in fact I I would

7045
05:51:28,558 --> 05:51:30,600
argue that things like secure defaults

7046
05:51:30,600 --> 05:51:33,360
have done more to prevent you know

7047
05:51:33,360 --> 05:51:35,700
problems than any sort of advocacy that

7048
05:51:35,700 --> 05:51:37,620
we've done as an industry right like I

7049
05:51:37,620 --> 05:51:39,718
think is Microsoft rolls out things and

7050
05:51:39,718 --> 05:51:41,700
makes harder statements about what like

7051
05:51:41,700 --> 05:51:43,320
should happen in a framework or what

7052
05:51:43,320 --> 05:51:45,900
shouldn't happen in a framework uh you

7053
05:51:45,900 --> 05:51:48,540
know this general idea of make it sort

7054
05:51:48,540 --> 05:51:50,280
of hard to do the wrong thing and easy

7055
05:51:50,280 --> 05:51:52,500
to do the right thing has sort of become

7056
05:51:52,500 --> 05:51:54,240
the prevalent theory on some of these

7057
05:51:54,240 --> 05:51:56,280
more modern Frameworks and and I think

7058
05:51:56,280 --> 05:51:58,320
with that it makes the configuration

7059
05:51:58,320 --> 05:52:00,180
deployment and some of this a lot easier

7060
05:52:00,180 --> 05:52:02,400
for for companies and I think it makes

7061
05:52:02,400 --> 05:52:04,620
some of the assets like smaller right

7062
05:52:04,620 --> 05:52:07,440
but I'll say like you know I haven't pin

7063
05:52:07,440 --> 05:52:09,240
tested in in quite some time I was

7064
05:52:09,240 --> 05:52:11,700
joking with these guys yesterday that I

7065
05:52:11,700 --> 05:52:13,260
decided I'm teaching a class and I

7066
05:52:13,260 --> 05:52:14,638
thought I'd do some bug Bounty just for

7067
05:52:14,638 --> 05:52:16,500
fun and so like I'm pulling up websites

7068
05:52:16,500 --> 05:52:18,058
and I go okay I'll look at this one and

7069
05:52:18,058 --> 05:52:19,440
it was almost literally the same story

7070
05:52:19,440 --> 05:52:21,480
that you got I got one I'm like oh they

7071
05:52:21,480 --> 05:52:23,040
did a pretty good job I think there's an

7072
05:52:23,040 --> 05:52:24,840
evasion sequence maybe here but I don't

7073
05:52:24,840 --> 05:52:26,760
have the time to kind of play with it

7074
05:52:26,760 --> 05:52:29,040
and then I went to the next one and I

7075
05:52:29,040 --> 05:52:31,020
had like 11 vulnerabilities within

7076
05:52:31,020 --> 05:52:34,320
within four hours right and it was like

7077
05:52:34,320 --> 05:52:36,360
you know you run into the space where

7078
05:52:36,360 --> 05:52:37,980
the speed of technology and what it's

7079
05:52:37,980 --> 05:52:40,020
doing doesn't necessarily mean the speed

7080
05:52:40,020 --> 05:52:42,120
of adoption has kind of caught up to it

7081
05:52:42,120 --> 05:52:44,160
and so in the case of like the second

7082
05:52:44,160 --> 05:52:47,160
company although the they could be using

7083
05:52:47,160 --> 05:52:48,420
other Technologies I mean they're not

7084
05:52:48,420 --> 05:52:50,100
they don't have a consistent deployment

7085
05:52:50,100 --> 05:52:51,480
they don't they have a bigger attack

7086
05:52:51,480 --> 05:52:52,798
space

7087
05:52:52,798 --> 05:52:55,138
um things of that sort right and so

7088
05:52:55,138 --> 05:52:57,058
I don't know I would say that it for me

7089
05:52:57,058 --> 05:52:58,558
it kind of feels a lot like more of the

7090
05:52:58,558 --> 05:53:01,020
same you know it's definitely not as

7091
05:53:01,020 --> 05:53:03,058
simple I wouldn't say that it's that but

7092
05:53:03,058 --> 05:53:05,760
it's definitely it's it should it should

7093
05:53:05,760 --> 05:53:07,860
be more of all some regards than I think

7094
05:53:07,860 --> 05:53:10,138
it is at the moment yeah I mean

7095
05:53:10,138 --> 05:53:13,798
personally I would I would step into

7096
05:53:13,798 --> 05:53:16,200
it has gotten better right like I

7097
05:53:16,200 --> 05:53:19,860
definitely I I mean when we tested back

7098
05:53:19,860 --> 05:53:23,580
in octave or fishnet days every app had

7099
05:53:23,580 --> 05:53:25,980
some sort of SQL injection or some sort

7100
05:53:25,980 --> 05:53:28,320
of really severe vulnerability that we

7101
05:53:28,320 --> 05:53:30,420
would find in it nowadays it takes a lot

7102
05:53:30,420 --> 05:53:32,700
more to actually dig those up from my

7103
05:53:32,700 --> 05:53:36,900
perspective and it's usually edge cases

7104
05:53:36,900 --> 05:53:39,480
it's not like SQL injection in ninety

7105
05:53:39,480 --> 05:53:41,280
percent of the pages or 90 of the

7106
05:53:41,280 --> 05:53:43,740
application it's like oh we may find a

7107
05:53:43,740 --> 05:53:45,780
small like authorization error in one

7108
05:53:45,780 --> 05:53:47,760
location and you know maybe two or three

7109
05:53:47,760 --> 05:53:49,920
but it's not the entire application and

7110
05:53:49,920 --> 05:53:51,298
I think that goes back to the Frameworks

7111
05:53:51,298 --> 05:53:53,160
that you're talking about the secure by

7112
05:53:53,160 --> 05:53:54,900
default even though we haven't gotten to

7113
05:53:54,900 --> 05:53:57,600
the one true framework yet but what are

7114
05:53:57,600 --> 05:53:59,280
your thoughts Ken

7115
05:53:59,280 --> 05:54:01,440
yeah I think well that's a good question

7116
05:54:01,440 --> 05:54:03,360
I mean I guess it's a few things have

7117
05:54:03,360 --> 05:54:04,320
changed

7118
05:54:04,320 --> 05:54:06,480
um when I started you know and

7119
05:54:06,480 --> 05:54:07,500
especially when you're building a

7120
05:54:07,500 --> 05:54:09,058
Defender program it was all about the

7121
05:54:09,058 --> 05:54:11,100
bugs that you could find right so you're

7122
05:54:11,100 --> 05:54:13,200
right the idea of what we did was oh you

7123
05:54:13,200 --> 05:54:15,540
find bugs faster than the bad guys and

7124
05:54:15,540 --> 05:54:17,160
then over time you know I think when I

7125
05:54:17,160 --> 05:54:19,020
joined GitHub I've been there for about

7126
05:54:19,020 --> 05:54:20,878
five and a half years

7127
05:54:20,878 --> 05:54:22,798
um it was surprising to me that they

7128
05:54:22,798 --> 05:54:25,920
were like hey uh bug bounties are a good

7129
05:54:25,920 --> 05:54:28,740
thing submissions are a good thing we

7130
05:54:28,740 --> 05:54:30,240
enjoy when people submit critical

7131
05:54:30,240 --> 05:54:33,180
bounties to us you know that's that

7132
05:54:33,180 --> 05:54:34,558
probably doesn't sound like much to you

7133
05:54:34,558 --> 05:54:36,320
all that was wild to me because

7134
05:54:36,320 --> 05:54:39,000
essentially we were only as good as the

7135
05:54:39,000 --> 05:54:41,820
bugs that we could find say 12 years ago

7136
05:54:41,820 --> 05:54:43,260
13 years ago

7137
05:54:43,260 --> 05:54:46,260
and now it's like oh no no you have a

7138
05:54:46,260 --> 05:54:47,878
layered approach to your program so

7139
05:54:47,878 --> 05:54:48,900
you've got

7140
05:54:48,900 --> 05:54:51,240
your bug poundy program to find the the

7141
05:54:51,240 --> 05:54:53,400
really like odd Edge Casey chained

7142
05:54:53,400 --> 05:54:55,138
together vulnerabilities you've got your

7143
05:54:55,138 --> 05:54:56,940
tooling to help find some of the

7144
05:54:56,940 --> 05:54:58,558
low-hanging fruit

7145
05:54:58,558 --> 05:55:00,240
your security practitioners are

7146
05:55:00,240 --> 05:55:02,638
primarily there for advice right so a

7147
05:55:02,638 --> 05:55:04,440
lot of our web security people there you

7148
05:55:04,440 --> 05:55:05,820
know they're looking at PR's but they're

7149
05:55:05,820 --> 05:55:06,958
giving suggestions they're giving

7150
05:55:06,958 --> 05:55:09,780
technical architectural kind of guidance

7151
05:55:09,780 --> 05:55:12,718
and and all of that and uh the I guess

7152
05:55:12,718 --> 05:55:14,100
what I'm saying is the program has

7153
05:55:14,100 --> 05:55:16,680
become programs have become much more

7154
05:55:16,680 --> 05:55:18,718
robust for uh for application security

7155
05:55:18,718 --> 05:55:20,700
teams it's not just see if you can find

7156
05:55:20,700 --> 05:55:22,260
the bugs faster than the bad guys it's

7157
05:55:22,260 --> 05:55:24,058
like no there's different types of bugs

7158
05:55:24,058 --> 05:55:24,900
that you're going to be looking for

7159
05:55:24,900 --> 05:55:25,798
there's different ways we're going to

7160
05:55:25,798 --> 05:55:26,760
handle that we're going to build and

7161
05:55:26,760 --> 05:55:28,980
pave path things that like solve these

7162
05:55:28,980 --> 05:55:30,540
problems for developers or to your point

7163
05:55:30,540 --> 05:55:32,400
give like security defaults for

7164
05:55:32,400 --> 05:55:34,798
developers so all that's changed quite a

7165
05:55:34,798 --> 05:55:36,780
bit from you know where it was or it was

7166
05:55:36,780 --> 05:55:37,620
kind of like

7167
05:55:37,620 --> 05:55:39,718
we're handing people like classic ASP

7168
05:55:39,718 --> 05:55:42,058
code or PHP code and saying like hey

7169
05:55:42,058 --> 05:55:44,760
make this secure and if you don't like

7170
05:55:44,760 --> 05:55:46,740
oh well I guess we're just bad at our

7171
05:55:46,740 --> 05:55:48,780
job it's like it's an awful Outlook so

7172
05:55:48,780 --> 05:55:50,100
things have improved from that that

7173
05:55:50,100 --> 05:55:52,798
standpoint I think quite a bit

7174
05:55:52,798 --> 05:55:53,878
so

7175
05:55:53,878 --> 05:55:55,558
how much of that is just the fact that

7176
05:55:55,558 --> 05:55:57,420
you are engaged with a larger

7177
05:55:57,420 --> 05:55:58,740
organization that cares about security

7178
05:55:58,740 --> 05:56:01,440
though that's true yeah I mean I mean

7179
05:56:01,440 --> 05:56:03,120
you know coming from a Consulting

7180
05:56:03,120 --> 05:56:04,320
background

7181
05:56:04,320 --> 05:56:07,558
right Andrew specifically right like how

7182
05:56:07,558 --> 05:56:09,120
much of that are you seeing improvement

7183
05:56:09,120 --> 05:56:12,718
over time in the number of

7184
05:56:12,718 --> 05:56:14,340
I mean even vulnerabilities or

7185
05:56:14,340 --> 05:56:16,620
criticalities and across organizations

7186
05:56:16,620 --> 05:56:18,180
or is it better

7187
05:56:18,180 --> 05:56:20,100
I mean I think I think to Mike's point

7188
05:56:20,100 --> 05:56:22,378
before companies as a whole are taking

7189
05:56:22,378 --> 05:56:25,020
it more serious right do they have the

7190
05:56:25,020 --> 05:56:27,480
same resources as someone like a GitHub

7191
05:56:27,480 --> 05:56:29,520
with you know layered security and a

7192
05:56:29,520 --> 05:56:31,320
bunch of approaches and teams that

7193
05:56:31,320 --> 05:56:33,540
handled you know this I think that's

7194
05:56:33,540 --> 05:56:36,360
that's not as common right I think it's

7195
05:56:36,360 --> 05:56:38,700
it's some sort of mixture of the bunch I

7196
05:56:38,700 --> 05:56:40,020
know a lot of companies that have bug

7197
05:56:40,020 --> 05:56:42,180
Bounty programs but then they struggle

7198
05:56:42,180 --> 05:56:44,100
to handle the triage because they get so

7199
05:56:44,100 --> 05:56:46,020
many things in that they can't

7200
05:56:46,020 --> 05:56:47,940
necessarily process and manage all of it

7201
05:56:47,940 --> 05:56:49,558
themselves and there's a lot of noise

7202
05:56:49,558 --> 05:56:51,000
that comes out of the bug Bounty

7203
05:56:51,000 --> 05:56:52,798
programs a lot of false positives a lot

7204
05:56:52,798 --> 05:56:55,740
of whatever and so like some companies

7205
05:56:55,740 --> 05:56:57,660
have taken on these things for adoption

7206
05:56:57,660 --> 05:57:00,000
and then a lot of them are still kind of

7207
05:57:00,000 --> 05:57:02,100
kind of catching open to see sort of how

7208
05:57:02,100 --> 05:57:03,840
they can layer that together right it's

7209
05:57:03,840 --> 05:57:04,920
just

7210
05:57:04,920 --> 05:57:07,200
but as a whole everyone is improving

7211
05:57:07,200 --> 05:57:09,420
I'll say I'll say that

7212
05:57:09,420 --> 05:57:11,160
um but not everybody has the same level

7213
05:57:11,160 --> 05:57:12,900
of resources if that makes sense bro

7214
05:57:12,900 --> 05:57:14,340
like the biggest change is that people

7215
05:57:14,340 --> 05:57:16,320
know what appsec is well maybe not

7216
05:57:16,320 --> 05:57:18,058
everybody in this room understands that

7217
05:57:18,058 --> 05:57:20,520
term but you know what web security is

7218
05:57:20,520 --> 05:57:22,500
you know about General web security

7219
05:57:22,500 --> 05:57:24,180
flaws or at least you've heard the main

7220
05:57:24,180 --> 05:57:25,798
keywords you gotta remember when we

7221
05:57:25,798 --> 05:57:27,600
first came in here I had to convince the

7222
05:57:27,600 --> 05:57:28,920
Pentagon that like the way that people

7223
05:57:28,920 --> 05:57:30,240
were breaking in

7224
05:57:30,240 --> 05:57:32,340
was like through web like web security

7225
05:57:32,340 --> 05:57:33,900
issues they were like well we've got

7226
05:57:33,900 --> 05:57:35,820
firewalls like we're good we've got this

7227
05:57:35,820 --> 05:57:38,218
Stig that we follow we've got gold disc

7228
05:57:38,218 --> 05:57:41,340
we're good like I spent two years trying

7229
05:57:41,340 --> 05:57:43,260
to just explain to the dod like you know

7230
05:57:43,260 --> 05:57:44,580
there's more than just network security

7231
05:57:44,580 --> 05:57:46,260
issues right like there's other ways to

7232
05:57:46,260 --> 05:57:48,180
breach the perimeter so like to me

7233
05:57:48,180 --> 05:57:49,798
that's the hugest changes like

7234
05:57:49,798 --> 05:57:51,780
developers even know these keywords

7235
05:57:51,780 --> 05:57:54,298
these like SQL injection buzzwords you

7236
05:57:54,298 --> 05:57:55,860
know remote code execution things like

7237
05:57:55,860 --> 05:57:58,320
that that's a huge that's a huge leap

7238
05:57:58,320 --> 05:58:01,260
forward in a relatively small amount of

7239
05:58:01,260 --> 05:58:03,298
time I think I mean you all said that

7240
05:58:03,298 --> 05:58:04,378
you didn't you know know what

7241
05:58:04,378 --> 05:58:05,700
application security is but if you've

7242
05:58:05,700 --> 05:58:07,920
heard of little Bobby tables has anyone

7243
05:58:07,920 --> 05:58:10,558
okay I'm seeing some nods there right

7244
05:58:10,558 --> 05:58:12,480
but that's I mean that's how prevalent

7245
05:58:12,480 --> 05:58:14,520
that it's become like we actually have

7246
05:58:14,520 --> 05:58:16,680
Comics around it right about security

7247
05:58:16,680 --> 05:58:18,660
issues that we run into

7248
05:58:18,660 --> 05:58:21,600
on a periodic basis okay so that's good

7249
05:58:21,600 --> 05:58:23,400
so so where do you feel like the state

7250
05:58:23,400 --> 05:58:26,700
of application security is today is it

7251
05:58:26,700 --> 05:58:28,980
good is it is it bad is it

7252
05:58:28,980 --> 05:58:30,780
is it just okay I mean Mike you just

7253
05:58:30,780 --> 05:58:32,940
said it was up and down

7254
05:58:32,940 --> 05:58:35,458
so why is that

7255
05:58:35,458 --> 05:58:37,138
well I mean I think first off it's just

7256
05:58:37,138 --> 05:58:38,760
it's almost impossible to completely

7257
05:58:38,760 --> 05:58:41,040
solve you're never you're never going to

7258
05:58:41,040 --> 05:58:42,958
get to a point where anything a company

7259
05:58:42,958 --> 05:58:45,660
a cloud environment an on-premise

7260
05:58:45,660 --> 05:58:47,520
environment is completely secure there's

7261
05:58:47,520 --> 05:58:49,080
way too many variables there's way too

7262
05:58:49,080 --> 05:58:51,298
many systems there's way too much code I

7263
05:58:51,298 --> 05:58:53,280
mean look at like a node I go back to

7264
05:58:53,280 --> 05:58:56,100
node I'm sorry Ken but uh go to a node

7265
05:58:56,100 --> 05:58:58,558
program look at the node modules folder

7266
05:58:58,558 --> 05:59:00,540
that's like a billion lines of code I'm

7267
05:59:00,540 --> 05:59:02,218
not even joking it's an insane amount of

7268
05:59:02,218 --> 05:59:05,400
code so you can't reason no one can

7269
05:59:05,400 --> 05:59:07,320
reason about how all that code is always

7270
05:59:07,320 --> 05:59:08,700
going to work so there's um you know

7271
05:59:08,700 --> 05:59:11,340
tons and tons of different ways that

7272
05:59:11,340 --> 05:59:12,840
things can break

7273
05:59:12,840 --> 05:59:14,458
um so I don't think it's ever going to

7274
05:59:14,458 --> 05:59:17,160
be the point where things are secure so

7275
05:59:17,160 --> 05:59:19,200
great for job security everyone you're

7276
05:59:19,200 --> 05:59:21,660
good until you retire hopefully yeah so

7277
05:59:21,660 --> 05:59:24,420
that's good that's it because Mike just

7278
05:59:24,420 --> 05:59:27,138
said nothing will ever be secure

7279
05:59:27,138 --> 05:59:30,540
security nihilism security dialysis

7280
05:59:30,540 --> 05:59:32,940
no but I don't think you're wrong yeah I

7281
05:59:32,940 --> 05:59:37,160
mean AI is going to solve this but um

7282
05:59:38,280 --> 05:59:41,239
what was the original question

7283
05:59:42,120 --> 05:59:44,160
so current state is it's never going to

7284
05:59:44,160 --> 05:59:46,620
be completely solved but we should just

7285
05:59:46,620 --> 05:59:49,138
give up no no I think you make the the

7286
05:59:49,138 --> 05:59:51,540
whole point of our job is to make it

7287
05:59:51,540 --> 05:59:53,820
harder for people to exploit your

7288
05:59:53,820 --> 05:59:56,280
systems right so before they could walk

7289
05:59:56,280 --> 05:59:58,200
in and had that SQL injection dump your

7290
05:59:58,200 --> 06:00:00,480
database get you know user credentials

7291
06:00:00,480 --> 06:00:02,458
use those somewhere else that's super

7292
06:00:02,458 --> 06:00:04,620
easy now it's they have to work maybe

7293
06:00:04,620 --> 06:00:07,200
weeks maybe months to get in and that

7294
06:00:07,200 --> 06:00:08,520
reduces the number of people who can

7295
06:00:08,520 --> 06:00:10,138
just walk up to your website and dump

7296
06:00:10,138 --> 06:00:11,520
everything out

7297
06:00:11,520 --> 06:00:13,440
um so I think that's really the point of

7298
06:00:13,440 --> 06:00:15,660
our jobs is to just build up those those

7299
06:00:15,660 --> 06:00:19,579
barriers there's a question

7300
06:00:19,860 --> 06:00:22,458
harder

7301
06:00:29,160 --> 06:00:32,100
gonna restate that yeah so so you're

7302
06:00:32,100 --> 06:00:34,940
asking whether chat GPT has changed that

7303
06:00:34,940 --> 06:00:37,200
mechanism right like make it made it

7304
06:00:37,200 --> 06:00:39,740
more difficult

7305
06:00:43,500 --> 06:00:46,680
I mean having like logged into chat GPT

7306
06:00:46,680 --> 06:00:48,840
and actually like asked it to you know

7307
06:00:48,840 --> 06:00:50,520
write an exploit

7308
06:00:50,520 --> 06:00:53,100
um the the code that it generates may be

7309
06:00:53,100 --> 06:00:55,080
good from a generic perspective but it's

7310
06:00:55,080 --> 06:00:56,458
pretty awful when it really comes down

7311
06:00:56,458 --> 06:00:58,378
to it right like the understanding the

7312
06:00:58,378 --> 06:00:59,638
deep understanding that's required to

7313
06:00:59,638 --> 06:01:02,040
exploit a system at least that's

7314
06:01:02,040 --> 06:01:03,958
I mean that's what I've seen I don't

7315
06:01:03,958 --> 06:01:06,000
know who else I mean I mean I would say

7316
06:01:06,000 --> 06:01:08,400
it's like it's the same argument it's a

7317
06:01:08,400 --> 06:01:10,558
similar argument to like building tools

7318
06:01:10,558 --> 06:01:12,000
and giving it to people and being like

7319
06:01:12,000 --> 06:01:13,558
well if we release this in open source

7320
06:01:13,558 --> 06:01:15,000
like we're definitely gonna get owned

7321
06:01:15,000 --> 06:01:16,680
it's like no you still need a skill set

7322
06:01:16,680 --> 06:01:18,840
of the attacker right so I can give you

7323
06:01:18,840 --> 06:01:19,798
all the tools in the world but you're

7324
06:01:19,798 --> 06:01:20,820
still a script Kitty if you don't know

7325
06:01:20,820 --> 06:01:22,500
what you're doing sorry we got a

7326
06:01:22,500 --> 06:01:25,040
question right here

7327
06:01:27,900 --> 06:01:29,700
basically what ended happening was the

7328
06:01:29,700 --> 06:01:32,100
coder copied from stack Overflow and

7329
06:01:32,100 --> 06:01:33,600
they attacked it's copied to a lot of

7330
06:01:33,600 --> 06:01:35,160
different apps so the same vulnerability

7331
06:01:35,160 --> 06:01:37,558
was across I feel like with machine

7332
06:01:37,558 --> 06:01:39,298
learning now maybe a vulnerability that

7333
06:01:39,298 --> 06:01:41,458
you get with generated code is they they

7334
06:01:41,458 --> 06:01:42,900
brought it they don't understand it and

7335
06:01:42,900 --> 06:01:44,100
then they made a program that has that

7336
06:01:44,100 --> 06:01:46,980
vulnerability in it oh yeah

7337
06:01:46,980 --> 06:01:49,920
so yeah no you're absolutely right I

7338
06:01:49,920 --> 06:01:51,718
mean we joke about that from a code

7339
06:01:51,718 --> 06:01:54,718
review and a like recommendation for

7340
06:01:54,718 --> 06:01:57,540
building you know apps perspective that

7341
06:01:57,540 --> 06:02:00,000
oh developers just go to stack Overflow

7342
06:02:00,000 --> 06:02:02,280
and copy and paste code but then like

7343
06:02:02,280 --> 06:02:05,218
we're almost worse at it as apple as

7344
06:02:05,218 --> 06:02:06,718
security people because when we develop

7345
06:02:06,718 --> 06:02:08,940
it too what tool what do we do we go to

7346
06:02:08,940 --> 06:02:11,100
stack Overflow copy and paste code and

7347
06:02:11,100 --> 06:02:12,660
then just tweak it right or nowadays

7348
06:02:12,660 --> 06:02:15,058
we're just asking chat GPT go generate

7349
06:02:15,058 --> 06:02:18,420
me this or co-pilot and you know we

7350
06:02:18,420 --> 06:02:19,740
don't really understand all the

7351
06:02:19,740 --> 06:02:21,000
mechanisms and everything that's going

7352
06:02:21,000 --> 06:02:23,638
into it so I it probably will increase

7353
06:02:23,638 --> 06:02:25,920
that attack surface in that

7354
06:02:25,920 --> 06:02:28,200
from that perspective I mean I guess

7355
06:02:28,200 --> 06:02:30,718
that's what I've come around to for now

7356
06:02:30,718 --> 06:02:32,820
um all right you have another question

7357
06:02:32,820 --> 06:02:35,820
so

7358
06:02:35,940 --> 06:02:37,080
um

7359
06:02:37,080 --> 06:02:39,480
from the point of view of threat

7360
06:02:39,480 --> 06:02:42,058
intelligence we've started to see a lot

7361
06:02:42,058 --> 06:02:47,218
of supply chain attacks and I know that

7362
06:02:47,218 --> 06:02:49,860
there is a solution out there the

7363
06:02:49,860 --> 06:02:52,740
software bill of materials I'm wondering

7364
06:02:52,740 --> 06:02:56,520
have you all seen much adoption of

7365
06:02:56,520 --> 06:03:00,860
s-bomb in the tooling or best practices

7366
06:03:00,860 --> 06:03:03,378
anything like that

7367
06:03:03,378 --> 06:03:06,718
anyone want to address s-bombs

7368
06:03:06,718 --> 06:03:07,980
I know

7369
06:03:07,980 --> 06:03:10,378
I mean one way we have opinions right

7370
06:03:10,378 --> 06:03:12,540
like if you didn't tell we have opinions

7371
06:03:12,540 --> 06:03:13,620
right

7372
06:03:13,620 --> 06:03:15,718
um software bill of materials is

7373
06:03:15,718 --> 06:03:16,620
actually something that's been around

7374
06:03:16,620 --> 06:03:18,780
for a long time and is a great way to

7375
06:03:18,780 --> 06:03:20,458
actually enumerate what goes into an

7376
06:03:20,458 --> 06:03:23,580
application I mean the um we were just

7377
06:03:23,580 --> 06:03:26,400
talking about node as well like 95 of

7378
06:03:26,400 --> 06:03:28,080
the application is not custom code in

7379
06:03:28,080 --> 06:03:30,180
that case but to do a software bill of

7380
06:03:30,180 --> 06:03:32,340
materials properly you have to enumerate

7381
06:03:32,340 --> 06:03:34,320
okay all the dependencies the

7382
06:03:34,320 --> 06:03:36,180
dependencies of those dependencies the

7383
06:03:36,180 --> 06:03:38,160
dependency like as far as you possibly

7384
06:03:38,160 --> 06:03:40,620
can and deal with circular issues and

7385
06:03:40,620 --> 06:03:42,058
then the versions that are associated

7386
06:03:42,058 --> 06:03:44,760
with that it sounds great and we have

7387
06:03:44,760 --> 06:03:46,378
solutions that are out there like you

7388
06:03:46,378 --> 06:03:49,138
know some of the sneak and other vendors

7389
06:03:49,138 --> 06:03:52,798
that exist to try and assess the the

7390
06:03:52,798 --> 06:03:56,540
current state of those that that list

7391
06:03:56,540 --> 06:03:59,580
but in practice when I jump into it

7392
06:03:59,580 --> 06:04:00,900
talking about what I see on a daily

7393
06:04:00,900 --> 06:04:03,298
basis the code that we get I don't think

7394
06:04:03,298 --> 06:04:05,520
I've ever actually seen a s-bomb

7395
06:04:05,520 --> 06:04:08,520
associated with it right it's just it's

7396
06:04:08,520 --> 06:04:10,020
not something that comes up in web

7397
06:04:10,020 --> 06:04:11,280
applications I don't know if you see

7398
06:04:11,280 --> 06:04:13,320
anything different I mean we use you

7399
06:04:13,320 --> 06:04:15,000
know dependabot alerts right and then

7400
06:04:15,000 --> 06:04:16,740
that's how we find out about like any

7401
06:04:16,740 --> 06:04:18,420
issues with ourselves and to be fair

7402
06:04:18,420 --> 06:04:20,878
like I mean aren't lock files s-bombs

7403
06:04:20,878 --> 06:04:23,840
right like gemfile.lock like

7404
06:04:23,840 --> 06:04:26,160
package.json.lock these are true those

7405
06:04:26,160 --> 06:04:27,600
are locked in versions of all

7406
06:04:27,600 --> 06:04:29,520
dependencies sub dependencies and Sub

7407
06:04:29,520 --> 06:04:32,700
sub dependencies right so it is I guess

7408
06:04:32,700 --> 06:04:34,320
what I'm saying is the data is all there

7409
06:04:34,320 --> 06:04:36,058
it's always been there

7410
06:04:36,058 --> 06:04:38,638
we're just using uh some new term but

7411
06:04:38,638 --> 06:04:40,558
really the way we manage it is we we

7412
06:04:40,558 --> 06:04:43,138
have and I'll just share this like

7413
06:04:43,138 --> 06:04:46,320
each service has a an entry in our

7414
06:04:46,320 --> 06:04:48,240
service catalog and each service catalog

7415
06:04:48,240 --> 06:04:49,980
entry has a scorecard attached to it

7416
06:04:49,980 --> 06:04:51,958
which measures Health right so if you

7417
06:04:51,958 --> 06:04:53,520
haven't gone and you haven't like taken

7418
06:04:53,520 --> 06:04:55,500
care of your alerts so like you know

7419
06:04:55,500 --> 06:04:58,620
third-party supply chain risks then uh

7420
06:04:58,620 --> 06:05:00,718
your scorecard basically is low and then

7421
06:05:00,718 --> 06:05:02,280
you got to go talk to the execs and it's

7422
06:05:02,280 --> 06:05:03,660
part of our fundamentals program and you

7423
06:05:03,660 --> 06:05:06,000
have to go explain why you didn't patch

7424
06:05:06,000 --> 06:05:07,920
here or upgrade your libraries and and

7425
06:05:07,920 --> 06:05:09,780
all that fun stuff so

7426
06:05:09,780 --> 06:05:12,180
um yeah yeah so that's kind of how we've

7427
06:05:12,180 --> 06:05:13,740
been handling it so I think it's I think

7428
06:05:13,740 --> 06:05:15,600
it's ultimately yeah a good idea but

7429
06:05:15,600 --> 06:05:17,040
it's it's

7430
06:05:17,040 --> 06:05:18,958
some versions of it are already out we

7431
06:05:18,958 --> 06:05:20,940
just yeah haven't recognized that yeah

7432
06:05:20,940 --> 06:05:22,920
it's early stages still I don't think

7433
06:05:22,920 --> 06:05:25,138
it's it's completely in there yeah we've

7434
06:05:25,138 --> 06:05:27,000
got another one can you hear me okay yep

7435
06:05:27,000 --> 06:05:28,200
I was gonna say I love that you brought

7436
06:05:28,200 --> 06:05:30,058
up the execs because half of my

7437
06:05:30,058 --> 06:05:32,280
conversation is with you know going

7438
06:05:32,280 --> 06:05:33,840
through absec and the other half is

7439
06:05:33,840 --> 06:05:35,520
talking or Translating that to

7440
06:05:35,520 --> 06:05:38,580
leadership and the term that I see is

7441
06:05:38,580 --> 06:05:40,680
bubbling up is

7442
06:05:40,680 --> 06:05:43,500
resource allocation to our Tech debt

7443
06:05:43,500 --> 06:05:45,600
yeah

7444
06:05:45,600 --> 06:05:48,298
paying down Tech debt is

7445
06:05:48,298 --> 06:05:50,100
I mean I don't want to like hog the time

7446
06:05:50,100 --> 06:05:51,600
you guys speak up over there if you've

7447
06:05:51,600 --> 06:05:53,040
got something to say on this but I can

7448
06:05:53,040 --> 06:05:55,378
honestly say Tech debt is like um not

7449
06:05:55,378 --> 06:05:57,120
just from a security perspective it's

7450
06:05:57,120 --> 06:05:59,100
like always there's always friction

7451
06:05:59,100 --> 06:06:01,260
there where Engineers just I mean

7452
06:06:01,260 --> 06:06:02,638
security people fall under Engineers too

7453
06:06:02,638 --> 06:06:04,320
we're all Engineers we want to fix stuff

7454
06:06:04,320 --> 06:06:06,360
but the business is like only we can

7455
06:06:06,360 --> 06:06:08,100
only fix what the business allocates to

7456
06:06:08,100 --> 06:06:09,360
us like you said like resource

7457
06:06:09,360 --> 06:06:11,040
allocation and time wise and all of that

7458
06:06:11,040 --> 06:06:12,240
so

7459
06:06:12,240 --> 06:06:14,100
it says constant struggle my question

7460
06:06:14,100 --> 06:06:16,138
was more to you

7461
06:06:16,138 --> 06:06:20,160
or are you seeing that conversation I'm

7462
06:06:20,160 --> 06:06:21,840
seeing it personally but I was curious

7463
06:06:21,840 --> 06:06:24,058
if you guys were seeing that as well in

7464
06:06:24,058 --> 06:06:26,520
your conversations with uh when you come

7465
06:06:26,520 --> 06:06:28,440
back with your reports are you seeing

7466
06:06:28,440 --> 06:06:30,180
leadership kind of going hey we really

7467
06:06:30,180 --> 06:06:32,820
need to get a handle on did we allocate

7468
06:06:32,820 --> 06:06:34,860
the resources properly or

7469
06:06:34,860 --> 06:06:38,000
how can we better look at our current

7470
06:06:38,000 --> 06:06:42,660
state and like reallocate better in the

7471
06:06:42,660 --> 06:06:44,400
future yeah is that a conversation you

7472
06:06:44,400 --> 06:06:46,920
receive it's not one that I I'm

7473
06:06:46,920 --> 06:06:48,120
interested actually like we'll have

7474
06:06:48,120 --> 06:06:50,040
Andrew speak to that right is that

7475
06:06:50,040 --> 06:06:51,840
something that you see from an executive

7476
06:06:51,840 --> 06:06:54,360
perspective when reports are delivered

7477
06:06:54,360 --> 06:06:57,360
no but it's it's kind of along an

7478
06:06:57,360 --> 06:06:59,580
interesting sort of similar vein so like

7479
06:06:59,580 --> 06:07:01,920
as a as a pen tester my motivation is to

7480
06:07:01,920 --> 06:07:04,080
find cool stuff and then brag about it

7481
06:07:04,080 --> 06:07:07,020
because that makes me look cool right uh

7482
06:07:07,020 --> 06:07:09,718
and and hopefully it has big value

7483
06:07:09,718 --> 06:07:12,840
meaning impact Etc right and what I've

7484
06:07:12,840 --> 06:07:15,360
observed is that the developer who's

7485
06:07:15,360 --> 06:07:16,860
getting that report has the exact

7486
06:07:16,860 --> 06:07:18,840
opposite motivation to try to make it

7487
06:07:18,840 --> 06:07:20,878
seem like it's not really that big of a

7488
06:07:20,878 --> 06:07:22,558
deal like it's not that's easy like

7489
06:07:22,558 --> 06:07:23,638
that's not that's not how it really

7490
06:07:23,638 --> 06:07:26,760
works and I don't think it's because

7491
06:07:26,760 --> 06:07:28,260
they don't understand the value they

7492
06:07:28,260 --> 06:07:29,280
don't want to do it but I've actually

7493
06:07:29,280 --> 06:07:31,860
seen maintenance windows and resource

7494
06:07:31,860 --> 06:07:33,600
allocations tied directly to the

7495
06:07:33,600 --> 06:07:35,280
severity of a finding as it comes

7496
06:07:35,280 --> 06:07:38,218
through and so if I say something's like

7497
06:07:38,218 --> 06:07:40,558
a critical issue it's it's stop

7498
06:07:40,558 --> 06:07:41,878
everything we're doing that's billable

7499
06:07:41,878 --> 06:07:43,558
and then everybody has to jump on ship

7500
06:07:43,558 --> 06:07:46,200
if it's if I just say it's a medium and

7501
06:07:46,200 --> 06:07:47,760
it's like well I got a 30-day window

7502
06:07:47,760 --> 06:07:49,920
that I can go fix that or whatever right

7503
06:07:49,920 --> 06:07:52,680
and you see this allocation game between

7504
06:07:52,680 --> 06:07:55,260
time right because the problem with

7505
06:07:55,260 --> 06:07:57,298
fixing Tech debt which I would argue is

7506
06:07:57,298 --> 06:07:59,040
great and I don't disagree with that is

7507
06:07:59,040 --> 06:08:01,440
that unless you tie it to some sort of

7508
06:08:01,440 --> 06:08:03,480
business value proposition whether it's

7509
06:08:03,480 --> 06:08:05,878
to fix a bug or to increase features or

7510
06:08:05,878 --> 06:08:08,218
whatever it's kind of a harder sale

7511
06:08:08,218 --> 06:08:10,680
right at least it was my experience as a

7512
06:08:10,680 --> 06:08:12,540
developer it's like looks like hey boss

7513
06:08:12,540 --> 06:08:13,860
I know this is all messed up I want to

7514
06:08:13,860 --> 06:08:15,360
go fix it and then he goes why you're

7515
06:08:15,360 --> 06:08:16,558
like I don't have a good reason it just

7516
06:08:16,558 --> 06:08:19,500
bugs me you know that's not a reason

7517
06:08:19,500 --> 06:08:21,180
um even though it's true and even though

7518
06:08:21,180 --> 06:08:22,500
all the things like it may have

7519
06:08:22,500 --> 06:08:24,900
vulnerabilities it may be out of shape

7520
06:08:24,900 --> 06:08:26,580
it may not support the things we want to

7521
06:08:26,580 --> 06:08:29,400
do like you have to like communicate it

7522
06:08:29,400 --> 06:08:31,620
in terms of the value creation so I

7523
06:08:31,620 --> 06:08:33,840
don't hear that exact phrasing but I

7524
06:08:33,840 --> 06:08:35,520
definitely see the problem where people

7525
06:08:35,520 --> 06:08:37,680
are like well unless it's a high enough

7526
06:08:37,680 --> 06:08:39,600
risk I'm not going to allocate resources

7527
06:08:39,600 --> 06:08:41,280
or I'm going to let it sit or it's gonna

7528
06:08:41,280 --> 06:08:42,900
I'm gonna manage it from that end that's

7529
06:08:42,900 --> 06:08:45,660
that's where I see that more okay yeah I

7530
06:08:45,660 --> 06:08:48,660
I mean I could definitely

7531
06:08:48,660 --> 06:08:51,718
agree with that right like from a from

7532
06:08:51,718 --> 06:08:53,820
an external perspective as we go in I

7533
06:08:53,820 --> 06:08:55,320
don't think we always get to that level

7534
06:08:55,320 --> 06:08:57,920
but it does at least spur some of those

7535
06:08:57,920 --> 06:09:00,600
conversations and it really depends on

7536
06:09:00,600 --> 06:09:03,120
who we're doing that assessment work for

7537
06:09:03,120 --> 06:09:05,940
right at times it's it's the compliance

7538
06:09:05,940 --> 06:09:07,798
org as much as I'd always like it to be

7539
06:09:07,798 --> 06:09:09,360
the engineers and the developers that

7540
06:09:09,360 --> 06:09:11,700
I'm dealing with PCI was a huge driver

7541
06:09:11,700 --> 06:09:12,840
right like there's these other

7542
06:09:12,840 --> 06:09:15,600
Frameworks that push pen testing and

7543
06:09:15,600 --> 06:09:17,760
code reviews that

7544
06:09:17,760 --> 06:09:20,160
so I don't always get that that sort of

7545
06:09:20,160 --> 06:09:21,480
feedback and they just take the report

7546
06:09:21,480 --> 06:09:23,218
and they walk away and then we come back

7547
06:09:23,218 --> 06:09:24,718
a year later and they haven't fixed

7548
06:09:24,718 --> 06:09:26,638
anything right that's

7549
06:09:26,638 --> 06:09:28,920
yeah but that's the security nihilist in

7550
06:09:28,920 --> 06:09:30,780
me speaking so I don't know Mike what do

7551
06:09:30,780 --> 06:09:32,218
you see from that perspective I know

7552
06:09:32,218 --> 06:09:33,958
you're more embedded in some large or

7553
06:09:33,958 --> 06:09:35,878
wait some small organizations small

7554
06:09:35,878 --> 06:09:37,620
small landlords small and large okay

7555
06:09:37,620 --> 06:09:39,360
yeah yeah again I think it's

7556
06:09:39,360 --> 06:09:41,520
inconsistent I think

7557
06:09:41,520 --> 06:09:43,080
a little depressing when you do pen

7558
06:09:43,080 --> 06:09:45,240
testing and year over year you see same

7559
06:09:45,240 --> 06:09:47,520
bugs but then you have some customers

7560
06:09:47,520 --> 06:09:49,440
that you know they're like oh it's

7561
06:09:49,440 --> 06:09:51,180
critical critical or high we'll fix it

7562
06:09:51,180 --> 06:09:54,298
right now mediums six months lows we're

7563
06:09:54,298 --> 06:09:55,920
never going to talk about the lows but

7564
06:09:55,920 --> 06:09:57,600
then you have some places that I think

7565
06:09:57,600 --> 06:10:00,058
take more pride in it and even tackle

7566
06:10:00,058 --> 06:10:01,138
the woes

7567
06:10:01,138 --> 06:10:03,058
we do a lot of cloud security testing

7568
06:10:03,058 --> 06:10:04,860
and I actually find people address the

7569
06:10:04,860 --> 06:10:05,940
lows

7570
06:10:05,940 --> 06:10:07,680
as much as they address kind of the high

7571
06:10:07,680 --> 06:10:09,900
risk issues which that's probably some

7572
06:10:09,900 --> 06:10:11,340
different reasons for that but yeah if

7573
06:10:11,340 --> 06:10:14,100
you find like low web app issues those

7574
06:10:14,100 --> 06:10:16,620
just go into a black hole and rarely get

7575
06:10:16,620 --> 06:10:19,378
addressed it's it's not too often easy

7576
06:10:19,378 --> 06:10:20,940
those get fixed

7577
06:10:20,940 --> 06:10:21,540
um

7578
06:10:21,540 --> 06:10:23,340
because yeah there's other priorities

7579
06:10:23,340 --> 06:10:25,440
you know a low security issue is not

7580
06:10:25,440 --> 06:10:26,638
going to be as important as a new

7581
06:10:26,638 --> 06:10:29,040
feature going going out the door to make

7582
06:10:29,040 --> 06:10:31,980
more Revenue so yeah okay sad reality

7583
06:10:31,980 --> 06:10:34,680
are you all depressed from this yet yeah

7584
06:10:34,680 --> 06:10:36,600
you will be by the time we're done

7585
06:10:36,600 --> 06:10:38,638
that's uh that is our goal for today

7586
06:10:38,638 --> 06:10:40,680
okay so

7587
06:10:40,680 --> 06:10:42,958
you know

7588
06:10:42,958 --> 06:10:45,180
from that

7589
06:10:45,180 --> 06:10:46,798
um the other question I wanted to ask

7590
06:10:46,798 --> 06:10:48,240
since we've all been in the space for

7591
06:10:48,240 --> 06:10:51,298
quite a while was is there is there one

7592
06:10:51,298 --> 06:10:53,040
thing or a couple of things that you

7593
06:10:53,040 --> 06:10:56,638
wish someone had told you starting out

7594
06:10:56,638 --> 06:10:58,798
um just from the perspective that you

7595
06:10:58,798 --> 06:11:00,240
have now

7596
06:11:00,240 --> 06:11:02,700
okay you want to go first I mean man I

7597
06:11:02,700 --> 06:11:05,100
have a million things but I think

7598
06:11:05,100 --> 06:11:07,680
I had written this uh somewhere it's the

7599
06:11:07,680 --> 06:11:09,000
first thing not to start playing Lego

7600
06:11:09,000 --> 06:11:11,878
City Underground yeah it's undercover by

7601
06:11:11,878 --> 06:11:14,280
the way thank you very much all right uh

7602
06:11:14,280 --> 06:11:15,660
don't make money in front of me for my

7603
06:11:15,660 --> 06:11:18,000
Nintendo switch gameplay

7604
06:11:18,000 --> 06:11:19,558
um no uh

7605
06:11:19,558 --> 06:11:21,240
I think one of the things I had said

7606
06:11:21,240 --> 06:11:23,218
somewhere I don't remember where but it

7607
06:11:23,218 --> 06:11:25,138
was like uh just don't take things

7608
06:11:25,138 --> 06:11:27,958
personally and uh recognize that you're

7609
06:11:27,958 --> 06:11:29,340
just a part of the business right you're

7610
06:11:29,340 --> 06:11:30,420
just a element within the business I

7611
06:11:30,420 --> 06:11:31,860
think that was one of the that has

7612
06:11:31,860 --> 06:11:33,540
consistently been a hard thing to temper

7613
06:11:33,540 --> 06:11:36,900
is like the passion I have and you know

7614
06:11:36,900 --> 06:11:39,298
probably everybody in this room has for

7615
06:11:39,298 --> 06:11:41,580
their for their job and then you know

7616
06:11:41,580 --> 06:11:44,100
having that run up against like the dis

7617
06:11:44,100 --> 06:11:46,200
to your point earlier right about execs

7618
06:11:46,200 --> 06:11:47,760
and making decisions about what tech

7619
06:11:47,760 --> 06:11:50,040
what things to do and Tech debt to pay

7620
06:11:50,040 --> 06:11:52,080
down and all that that's that's honestly

7621
06:11:52,080 --> 06:11:52,860
been

7622
06:11:52,860 --> 06:11:54,240
um I just wish I could go back and say

7623
06:11:54,240 --> 06:11:55,680
to myself like don't worry you can give

7624
06:11:55,680 --> 06:11:56,878
them their advice they're still going to

7625
06:11:56,878 --> 06:11:58,260
give you money and like if they don't

7626
06:11:58,260 --> 06:11:59,700
take it you're still gonna keep that

7627
06:11:59,700 --> 06:12:01,378
money and you can just like keep going

7628
06:12:01,378 --> 06:12:03,900
so don't worry you'll be fine okay

7629
06:12:03,900 --> 06:12:06,660
all right what about you Andrew

7630
06:12:06,660 --> 06:12:09,240
somebody had taught me that I wish I'd

7631
06:12:09,240 --> 06:12:13,620
known then and now uh you know uh for me

7632
06:12:13,620 --> 06:12:15,718
the thing that I tell a lot of my new

7633
06:12:15,718 --> 06:12:17,878
pen testers because I wish someone had

7634
06:12:17,878 --> 06:12:19,378
said it to me I guess if that answers a

7635
06:12:19,378 --> 06:12:23,100
question is uh just because you're

7636
06:12:23,100 --> 06:12:24,780
highly trained to point out everything

7637
06:12:24,780 --> 06:12:26,638
that's wrong doesn't mean that it's

7638
06:12:26,638 --> 06:12:29,100
entirely broken right and that I think

7639
06:12:29,100 --> 06:12:31,440
is pen testers we actually have this

7640
06:12:31,440 --> 06:12:34,260
this really unfortunate habit of looking

7641
06:12:34,260 --> 06:12:36,058
at something like that's broken that's

7642
06:12:36,058 --> 06:12:37,980
broken that's broken that's neat but

7643
06:12:37,980 --> 06:12:40,980
probably broken right and and if you get

7644
06:12:40,980 --> 06:12:42,718
really good at it that's like literally

7645
06:12:42,718 --> 06:12:44,580
your job is to look at something and go

7646
06:12:44,580 --> 06:12:46,260
it shouldn't work like this it should

7647
06:12:46,260 --> 06:12:48,718
work like this and it can create a

7648
06:12:48,718 --> 06:12:51,298
nihilism that you may have noticed where

7649
06:12:51,298 --> 06:12:52,860
you look at the world as if it's

7650
06:12:52,860 --> 06:12:54,298
entirely broken but it's it's

7651
06:12:54,298 --> 06:12:55,920
interesting I always tell them like

7652
06:12:55,920 --> 06:12:57,480
that's actually a gift it's a blessing

7653
06:12:57,480 --> 06:12:59,580
right it's an opportunity for you to go

7654
06:12:59,580 --> 06:13:01,680
back to somebody and say Here's an

7655
06:13:01,680 --> 06:13:03,360
opportunity to make it better than it

7656
06:13:03,360 --> 06:13:06,000
was before and that little switch in how

7657
06:13:06,000 --> 06:13:07,558
you think about it yourself and how even

7658
06:13:07,558 --> 06:13:09,600
you communicate with people I think has

7659
06:13:09,600 --> 06:13:12,540
a lot of uh empathy built into it

7660
06:13:12,540 --> 06:13:14,458
because you know as a guy who was a

7661
06:13:14,458 --> 06:13:16,080
developer on the other side of the coin

7662
06:13:16,080 --> 06:13:18,000
like you know there's so many other

7663
06:13:18,000 --> 06:13:19,378
constraints and so many other

7664
06:13:19,378 --> 06:13:21,298
expectations so many other things pushed

7665
06:13:21,298 --> 06:13:23,340
on someone the last thing you want to do

7666
06:13:23,340 --> 06:13:24,660
is made to feel like you're stupid

7667
06:13:24,660 --> 06:13:26,280
because there's like a vulnerability or

7668
06:13:26,280 --> 06:13:28,620
something in the in the code and and the

7669
06:13:28,620 --> 06:13:31,080
reality is like if we take that approach

7670
06:13:31,080 --> 06:13:33,780
from the beginning and we just say like

7671
06:13:33,780 --> 06:13:35,940
I mean my job is to help you make this

7672
06:13:35,940 --> 06:13:37,798
more resilient or my job is to help you

7673
06:13:37,798 --> 06:13:39,780
I'd see the things that you couldn't see

7674
06:13:39,780 --> 06:13:42,600
yourself because I'm a specialist that

7675
06:13:42,600 --> 06:13:44,040
actually creates a better working

7676
06:13:44,040 --> 06:13:46,138
relationship with people I think and it

7677
06:13:46,138 --> 06:13:49,138
really changes the conversation uh

7678
06:13:49,138 --> 06:13:50,878
internally because you get really

7679
06:13:50,878 --> 06:13:52,320
depressed I mean you can look at it and

7680
06:13:52,320 --> 06:13:53,580
go this whole thing is never going to

7681
06:13:53,580 --> 06:13:54,958
work I'm going to go like live in

7682
06:13:54,958 --> 06:13:56,878
Montana and go fish with my friend like

7683
06:13:56,878 --> 06:13:58,500
you know what I mean like you know

7684
06:13:58,500 --> 06:13:59,878
there's a lot of people who really think

7685
06:13:59,878 --> 06:14:03,120
that's like a true story but you know uh

7686
06:14:03,120 --> 06:14:05,400
the world's not over right yeah okay

7687
06:14:05,400 --> 06:14:06,798
good yeah

7688
06:14:06,798 --> 06:14:09,180
it's valuable insight for sure what

7689
06:14:09,180 --> 06:14:10,558
about you Mike

7690
06:14:10,558 --> 06:14:13,138
uh I think and I think this might just

7691
06:14:13,138 --> 06:14:15,718
be true of our kind of culture is we we

7692
06:14:15,718 --> 06:14:18,058
love breaking things but to business

7693
06:14:18,058 --> 06:14:19,440
breaking things doesn't really matter

7694
06:14:19,440 --> 06:14:21,058
unless they fix things and become more

7695
06:14:21,058 --> 06:14:23,160
secure so I feel like

7696
06:14:23,160 --> 06:14:25,200
breaking things is fun you know like

7697
06:14:25,200 --> 06:14:27,058
picking a lock is fun designing a new

7698
06:14:27,058 --> 06:14:29,340
lock that's unpickable maybe not as much

7699
06:14:29,340 --> 06:14:30,780
fun to you

7700
06:14:30,780 --> 06:14:32,160
um so I think

7701
06:14:32,160 --> 06:14:34,798
changing your mindset at some point to

7702
06:14:34,798 --> 06:14:36,360
go from I'm just a hacker to break stuff

7703
06:14:36,360 --> 06:14:38,820
too like I can create scalable solutions

7704
06:14:38,820 --> 06:14:41,638
to solve this I like the root cause

7705
06:14:41,638 --> 06:14:43,440
um again I go to the cloud side where

7706
06:14:43,440 --> 06:14:44,340
it's like

7707
06:14:44,340 --> 06:14:46,080
if you have infrastructure as code

7708
06:14:46,080 --> 06:14:48,020
that's my buzzword

7709
06:14:48,020 --> 06:14:52,080
no more yeah you fix uh you fix

7710
06:14:52,080 --> 06:14:54,718
something in one place and that that

7711
06:14:54,718 --> 06:14:56,160
gets applied again and again and again

7712
06:14:56,160 --> 06:14:57,840
you've solved that issue in one place

7713
06:14:57,840 --> 06:15:00,480
versus someone going in and fixing one

7714
06:15:00,480 --> 06:15:02,458
xss here by adding output encoding and

7715
06:15:02,458 --> 06:15:04,980
out xss here doing output encoding like

7716
06:15:04,980 --> 06:15:06,600
switching your mind from just being like

7717
06:15:06,600 --> 06:15:09,180
ah this this bug is sweet this hack is

7718
06:15:09,180 --> 06:15:11,280
awesome here's like my attack chain two

7719
06:15:11,280 --> 06:15:13,200
okay how do I how do I solve this for

7720
06:15:13,200 --> 06:15:15,000
the company as a whole that's not always

7721
06:15:15,000 --> 06:15:17,400
possible but you know that's that's a

7722
06:15:17,400 --> 06:15:18,718
mindset that I think we have to shift to

7723
06:15:18,718 --> 06:15:21,058
because trying to become secure if

7724
06:15:21,058 --> 06:15:23,040
you're like onesie twosies bugs is just

7725
06:15:23,040 --> 06:15:26,100
never gonna never gonna work

7726
06:15:26,100 --> 06:15:27,718
I wish somebody also told me that

7727
06:15:27,718 --> 06:15:28,798
software developers are going to be

7728
06:15:28,798 --> 06:15:31,680
spinning up infrastructure just in

7729
06:15:31,680 --> 06:15:32,760
general that would have been a good

7730
06:15:32,760 --> 06:15:35,340
heads up well that's amazing

7731
06:15:35,340 --> 06:15:36,718
we didn't say what you were going to

7732
06:15:36,718 --> 06:15:38,480
money off of um

7733
06:15:38,480 --> 06:15:41,160
we're gonna stay gainfully employed yeah

7734
06:15:41,160 --> 06:15:43,200
I mean I think for me it would probably

7735
06:15:43,200 --> 06:15:44,638
be

7736
06:15:44,638 --> 06:15:47,040
um that relationships are more important

7737
06:15:47,040 --> 06:15:48,840
than Tech right

7738
06:15:48,840 --> 06:15:51,120
that this kind of goes to Andrew's Point

7739
06:15:51,120 --> 06:15:54,180
as well right as as you progress in your

7740
06:15:54,180 --> 06:15:56,520
career as you find vulnerabilities as

7741
06:15:56,520 --> 06:15:59,638
you find interesting classes of you know

7742
06:15:59,638 --> 06:16:02,940
as you grow the people that you interact

7743
06:16:02,940 --> 06:16:04,980
with both on the security team both as

7744
06:16:04,980 --> 06:16:07,558
developers is going to you know

7745
06:16:07,558 --> 06:16:09,660
influence where you go in your career

7746
06:16:09,660 --> 06:16:12,540
and that those relationships it's not

7747
06:16:12,540 --> 06:16:14,760
worth damaging those for a single

7748
06:16:14,760 --> 06:16:16,440
vulnerability a single like call out

7749
06:16:16,440 --> 06:16:18,660
because you were so cool and you tweeted

7750
06:16:18,660 --> 06:16:19,860
about it and all of a sudden that person

7751
06:16:19,860 --> 06:16:21,540
will never never talk to you again right

7752
06:16:21,540 --> 06:16:23,820
because they've been shamed

7753
06:16:23,820 --> 06:16:25,680
um and you like

7754
06:16:25,680 --> 06:16:27,360
yeah we get really excited as security

7755
06:16:27,360 --> 06:16:30,240
people that we found something shiny we

7756
06:16:30,240 --> 06:16:32,340
found a cool way to do something that

7757
06:16:32,340 --> 06:16:35,218
was unintended and forget that this may

7758
06:16:35,218 --> 06:16:38,100
be someone's 10-year project Blood Sweat

7759
06:16:38,100 --> 06:16:40,860
tears has gone into it and we just

7760
06:16:40,860 --> 06:16:42,958
called their baby ugly and not only ugly

7761
06:16:42,958 --> 06:16:44,400
but we're just gonna go take it out back

7762
06:16:44,400 --> 06:16:46,160
and beat it right

7763
06:16:46,160 --> 06:16:50,040
and so framing that conversation as okay

7764
06:16:50,040 --> 06:16:52,138
this is about relationships this is not

7765
06:16:52,138 --> 06:16:53,820
necessarily about code and about

7766
06:16:53,820 --> 06:16:55,080
Frameworks because those are going to

7767
06:16:55,080 --> 06:16:57,360
change over time I can't tell you the

7768
06:16:57,360 --> 06:16:59,340
number of different Frameworks and

7769
06:16:59,340 --> 06:17:02,160
languages and codes code that I've seen

7770
06:17:02,160 --> 06:17:05,458
in 15 years but I can tell you the

7771
06:17:05,458 --> 06:17:06,958
people that really have stood out and

7772
06:17:06,958 --> 06:17:09,000
what they have done and even some of

7773
06:17:09,000 --> 06:17:10,860
those that initially that there was an

7774
06:17:10,860 --> 06:17:13,260
antagonistic relationship with because I

7775
06:17:13,260 --> 06:17:15,298
came in with the wrong attitude some of

7776
06:17:15,298 --> 06:17:17,218
them are now you know some of my best

7777
06:17:17,218 --> 06:17:19,620
friends and like they've they've helped

7778
06:17:19,620 --> 06:17:21,900
me in my career recognize what's what's

7779
06:17:21,900 --> 06:17:23,218
really important when we're building

7780
06:17:23,218 --> 06:17:25,700
software

7781
06:17:25,980 --> 06:17:29,958
um oh we got a question yep

7782
06:17:37,080 --> 06:17:38,878
um a bunch of my friends who are

7783
06:17:38,878 --> 06:17:40,798
developers are like oh zero trust zero

7784
06:17:40,798 --> 06:17:43,020
trust that's how we get around this zero

7785
06:17:43,020 --> 06:17:45,718
trust uh and I was wondering

7786
06:17:45,718 --> 06:17:47,100
um what you guys thought about that

7787
06:17:47,100 --> 06:17:48,480
movement that I really haven't heard

7788
06:17:48,480 --> 06:17:49,558
much about after

7789
06:17:49,558 --> 06:17:51,240
the thing well that's because it's like

7790
06:17:51,240 --> 06:17:52,920
now negative one trust so we need to

7791
06:17:52,920 --> 06:17:55,920
have even less trust than we had before

7792
06:17:55,920 --> 06:17:58,320
it's a marketing term right like that's

7793
06:17:58,320 --> 06:18:00,480
uh yeah Gartner I think had something to

7794
06:18:00,480 --> 06:18:02,940
say about that yeah yeah

7795
06:18:02,940 --> 06:18:04,980
um I don't know so are you asking us to

7796
06:18:04,980 --> 06:18:07,020
Define zero trust I was wondering where

7797
06:18:07,020 --> 06:18:07,920
it went

7798
06:18:07,920 --> 06:18:10,320
another thing on the I thought it kind

7799
06:18:10,320 --> 06:18:11,580
of related this because one of my pen

7800
06:18:11,580 --> 06:18:12,958
Chester friends he's like when you talk

7801
06:18:12,958 --> 06:18:15,298
to a client never trust always verify

7802
06:18:15,298 --> 06:18:16,620
they tell you a bunch of crap you forget

7803
06:18:16,620 --> 06:18:18,120
it all and you just go in to see for

7804
06:18:18,120 --> 06:18:19,200
yourself because you never trust them

7805
06:18:19,200 --> 06:18:21,600
like well that's camp like that seems

7806
06:18:21,600 --> 06:18:22,980
like you really don't like your guy

7807
06:18:22,980 --> 06:18:24,840
you're working for you're like never

7808
06:18:24,840 --> 06:18:26,458
trust anything you say it's most of it's

7809
06:18:26,458 --> 06:18:27,480
garbage

7810
06:18:27,480 --> 06:18:29,280
the thing is there's there's all these

7811
06:18:29,280 --> 06:18:31,320
Solutions like just-in-time access

7812
06:18:31,320 --> 06:18:33,840
control and there's like um you know

7813
06:18:33,840 --> 06:18:36,540
with kubernetes you can have some levels

7814
06:18:36,540 --> 06:18:40,200
of uh egress and Ingress death you know

7815
06:18:40,200 --> 06:18:41,638
like what I'm trying to say like

7816
06:18:41,638 --> 06:18:43,740
internal firewall kind of like concept

7817
06:18:43,740 --> 06:18:45,240
like Network segregation that's what I'm

7818
06:18:45,240 --> 06:18:46,440
trying to say

7819
06:18:46,440 --> 06:18:47,458
um and so you have all these different

7820
06:18:47,458 --> 06:18:48,780
things but it really just all that stuff

7821
06:18:48,780 --> 06:18:50,340
relies on people doing things the right

7822
06:18:50,340 --> 06:18:52,798
way and so it's like you would need to

7823
06:18:52,798 --> 06:18:55,080
do it everywhere all the time and so how

7824
06:18:55,080 --> 06:18:56,760
realistic is that and it really does

7825
06:18:56,760 --> 06:18:58,138
come down to still the same people who

7826
06:18:58,138 --> 06:19:00,718
are introducing bugs authorization bugs

7827
06:19:00,718 --> 06:19:02,580
and code also being responsible for

7828
06:19:02,580 --> 06:19:04,378
implementing some of these protections

7829
06:19:04,378 --> 06:19:06,480
and so it's just I think I personally

7830
06:19:06,480 --> 06:19:08,458
think that's contributing to factor as

7831
06:19:08,458 --> 06:19:10,558
to why it's like not yeah it's not a

7832
06:19:10,558 --> 06:19:12,240
thing we've seen I think it's

7833
06:19:12,240 --> 06:19:14,340
interesting actually I think I think

7834
06:19:14,340 --> 06:19:16,500
that if you did some research into it

7835
06:19:16,500 --> 06:19:18,780
that a hyper obsession with something

7836
06:19:18,780 --> 06:19:20,760
like that is probably going to create

7837
06:19:20,760 --> 06:19:22,260
more bugs than it's actually going to

7838
06:19:22,260 --> 06:19:23,520
solve us actually I have a working

7839
06:19:23,520 --> 06:19:27,298
theory on this right so uh

7840
06:19:27,298 --> 06:19:28,740
I mean it sounds great right you think

7841
06:19:28,740 --> 06:19:30,480
about it from a defense perspective you

7842
06:19:30,480 --> 06:19:33,780
you shouldn't trust a so blindly right

7843
06:19:33,780 --> 06:19:35,160
or at the very least you don't want to

7844
06:19:35,160 --> 06:19:37,558
be in a spot where of reach of a web

7845
06:19:37,558 --> 06:19:39,120
server that's serving like cat pictures

7846
06:19:39,120 --> 06:19:41,520
means next thing I'm like employee data

7847
06:19:41,520 --> 06:19:42,718
and I've taken over your whole

7848
06:19:42,718 --> 06:19:44,218
everything like there's got to be a

7849
06:19:44,218 --> 06:19:46,680
space between this where there's

7850
06:19:46,680 --> 06:19:48,718
authorization control segregation

7851
06:19:48,718 --> 06:19:50,520
there's you know trust balances whatever

7852
06:19:50,520 --> 06:19:53,280
I don't disagree with that but like when

7853
06:19:53,280 --> 06:19:55,260
you hyper obsess on some of these things

7854
06:19:55,260 --> 06:19:56,820
and you rotate on it I think what

7855
06:19:56,820 --> 06:19:59,100
happens to Ken's point is it's so much

7856
06:19:59,100 --> 06:20:01,920
work that it actually introduces problem

7857
06:20:01,920 --> 06:20:03,480
and it actually delays business that's

7858
06:20:03,480 --> 06:20:05,160
actually the biggest issue because now

7859
06:20:05,160 --> 06:20:07,740
when business wants to change you got to

7860
06:20:07,740 --> 06:20:09,360
go back and do a whole bunch of rule set

7861
06:20:09,360 --> 06:20:10,980
stuff and it creates sort of an

7862
06:20:10,980 --> 06:20:13,920
animosity there but like when I used to

7863
06:20:13,920 --> 06:20:17,458
do software engineering uh there's this

7864
06:20:17,458 --> 06:20:18,958
thing that's somewhat obscure I don't

7865
06:20:18,958 --> 06:20:19,980
know how many people have heard of

7866
06:20:19,980 --> 06:20:23,218
domain driven design but it's this like

7867
06:20:23,218 --> 06:20:25,798
obsession with layers like it's like is

7868
06:20:25,798 --> 06:20:27,000
it everything's got a layer there's a

7869
06:20:27,000 --> 06:20:29,040
business object layer a data translation

7870
06:20:29,040 --> 06:20:31,798
layer a layer on top of that to hand it

7871
06:20:31,798 --> 06:20:33,958
in to certain controller there's a layer

7872
06:20:33,958 --> 06:20:35,638
on top of that in order to expose it to

7873
06:20:35,638 --> 06:20:37,680
a presentation tier and the presentation

7874
06:20:37,680 --> 06:20:39,360
here has more layers and layers and

7875
06:20:39,360 --> 06:20:40,378
layers right and there's all these like

7876
06:20:40,378 --> 06:20:42,660
little translations and and when you

7877
06:20:42,660 --> 06:20:44,280
think about it from a software and I

7878
06:20:44,280 --> 06:20:45,900
actually like it like and theoretically

7879
06:20:45,900 --> 06:20:47,280
it sounds great there's a lot of cool

7880
06:20:47,280 --> 06:20:49,138
things in it but it's a ton of work it's

7881
06:20:49,138 --> 06:20:51,718
a ton of work and so my experience is

7882
06:20:51,718 --> 06:20:53,458
unless you're like super bought in on it

7883
06:20:53,458 --> 06:20:55,620
what would happen is developers would

7884
06:20:55,620 --> 06:20:57,058
like circumvent it and they would like

7885
06:20:57,058 --> 06:20:58,620
pop little holes through the whole thing

7886
06:20:58,620 --> 06:21:00,120
because they were so tired of it they

7887
06:21:00,120 --> 06:21:02,280
were so like this is driving me nuts I'm

7888
06:21:02,280 --> 06:21:04,020
just going to write direct access to the

7889
06:21:04,020 --> 06:21:06,360
database and SQL like manually I don't

7890
06:21:06,360 --> 06:21:07,798
want to write the orm and I don't want

7891
06:21:07,798 --> 06:21:09,718
to write you know what I mean so it's

7892
06:21:09,718 --> 06:21:12,180
like that that the more work you create

7893
06:21:12,180 --> 06:21:14,700
you know I think I think you actually

7894
06:21:14,700 --> 06:21:17,280
could create more problems probably than

7895
06:21:17,280 --> 06:21:18,958
than you're solving in some respects

7896
06:21:18,958 --> 06:21:21,180
right it's gonna be like a balance yeah

7897
06:21:21,180 --> 06:21:23,218
so the more barriers the put that you

7898
06:21:23,218 --> 06:21:25,680
put up either as security or as a device

7899
06:21:25,680 --> 06:21:27,958
or you know in any of these Technologies

7900
06:21:27,958 --> 06:21:29,820
the more

7901
06:21:29,820 --> 06:21:32,040
ways people find around it to do their

7902
06:21:32,040 --> 06:21:34,320
job or because of it I mean anything you

7903
06:21:34,320 --> 06:21:36,298
say Canon will be used against you right

7904
06:21:36,298 --> 06:21:37,860
so if you're putting new tech in the way

7905
06:21:37,860 --> 06:21:39,240
I mean that Tech has vulnerabilities

7906
06:21:39,240 --> 06:21:40,798
you're putting new stuff out there that

7907
06:21:40,798 --> 06:21:42,958
stuff might be vulnerable I mean for my

7908
06:21:42,958 --> 06:21:45,180
end sometimes the defensive tools are a

7909
06:21:45,180 --> 06:21:46,558
great way to get in and then hide

7910
06:21:46,558 --> 06:21:48,900
because now I control the thing that was

7911
06:21:48,900 --> 06:21:50,340
telling you somebody was in there right

7912
06:21:50,340 --> 06:21:52,860
so it's like that's great it's great for

7913
06:21:52,860 --> 06:21:55,680
me yeah cool and then did we have one

7914
06:21:55,680 --> 06:21:57,120
other question yeah just a couple of

7915
06:21:57,120 --> 06:21:59,239
them

7916
06:21:59,580 --> 06:22:01,820
foreign

7917
06:22:03,440 --> 06:22:07,860
so uh with the rise of languages like

7918
06:22:07,860 --> 06:22:09,660
rust which handle memory on a different

7919
06:22:09,660 --> 06:22:14,700
level do we uh see possibly a Taming of

7920
06:22:14,700 --> 06:22:17,540
one surface like Network attacks versus

7921
06:22:17,540 --> 06:22:21,900
the rise of uh web attacks essentially

7922
06:22:21,900 --> 06:22:24,420
like well one vector starts to tame

7923
06:22:24,420 --> 06:22:27,058
itself another Vector Rises suddenly

7924
06:22:27,058 --> 06:22:29,218
you're starting to see the big thing is

7925
06:22:29,218 --> 06:22:31,440
like configuration issues and more just

7926
06:22:31,440 --> 06:22:33,540
establishment do we see possibly

7927
06:22:33,540 --> 06:22:38,760
attaining of these fields and Maybe

7928
06:22:38,760 --> 06:22:41,400
relaxed lifestyle I guess I think memory

7929
06:22:41,400 --> 06:22:43,378
management bones you'll see less of it

7930
06:22:43,378 --> 06:22:45,420
yes yes yeah like buffer flow stuff that

7931
06:22:45,420 --> 06:22:47,580
we saw in C plus plus we were just

7932
06:22:47,580 --> 06:22:49,020
talking about today gas pump code stuff

7933
06:22:49,020 --> 06:22:51,360
that we used to look at whatever

7934
06:22:51,360 --> 06:22:53,700
um yeah but in terms of like actually

7935
06:22:53,700 --> 06:22:55,378
interestingly

7936
06:22:55,378 --> 06:22:56,940
you know I won't go into it too much but

7937
06:22:56,940 --> 06:22:59,100
we were doing some research on on one of

7938
06:22:59,100 --> 06:23:01,558
the popular rust web Frameworks and they

7939
06:23:01,558 --> 06:23:02,638
re

7940
06:23:02,638 --> 06:23:05,940
they introduced weighted routing and

7941
06:23:05,940 --> 06:23:07,980
doing things in a way that we had never

7942
06:23:07,980 --> 06:23:09,840
seen before so

7943
06:23:09,840 --> 06:23:12,540
we got a little farther into it and we

7944
06:23:12,540 --> 06:23:13,920
think that there's maybe something there

7945
06:23:13,920 --> 06:23:15,718
with authorization issues but I guess

7946
06:23:15,718 --> 06:23:17,520
what I'm saying that is zooming out from

7947
06:23:17,520 --> 06:23:19,558
the technology

7948
06:23:19,558 --> 06:23:22,138
you know the specific like rust anytime

7949
06:23:22,138 --> 06:23:24,480
something new and actually Andrew we

7950
06:23:24,480 --> 06:23:25,500
were all talking about this yesterday

7951
06:23:25,500 --> 06:23:28,638
every time a new web framework comes out

7952
06:23:28,638 --> 06:23:31,558
they literally do zero homework it seems

7953
06:23:31,558 --> 06:23:33,718
like on any other web framework and what

7954
06:23:33,718 --> 06:23:36,000
was a problem and how to solve it so

7955
06:23:36,000 --> 06:23:38,100
every time it's like the same I did a

7956
06:23:38,100 --> 06:23:40,200
talk and with I think with Mike at apps

7957
06:23:40,200 --> 06:23:44,160
that Cali in 2013 2014 about how all the

7958
06:23:44,160 --> 06:23:47,218
Frameworks get it wrong in some way

7959
06:23:47,218 --> 06:23:49,260
you know some some form or some fashion

7960
06:23:49,260 --> 06:23:50,760
and so anyways that'd be my answer there

7961
06:23:50,760 --> 06:23:52,440
is that there are definitely going to be

7962
06:23:52,440 --> 06:23:55,500
new web security phones that pop up in

7963
06:23:55,500 --> 06:23:57,058
new weird ways just because of the way

7964
06:23:57,058 --> 06:23:58,558
they're doing things but um yeah

7965
06:23:58,558 --> 06:24:00,298
probably memory management stuff less so

7966
06:24:00,298 --> 06:24:02,580
yeah I mean we see that same thing in

7967
06:24:02,580 --> 06:24:04,920
the web three space like d-apps and the

7968
06:24:04,920 --> 06:24:07,080
crypto space they you know they're

7969
06:24:07,080 --> 06:24:08,280
they're all high and mighty because

7970
06:24:08,280 --> 06:24:10,138
they're oh well we we run blockchain

7971
06:24:10,138 --> 06:24:11,700
yeah and I'm like but you have injection

7972
06:24:11,700 --> 06:24:13,378
vulnerabilities like in your smart

7973
06:24:13,378 --> 06:24:15,900
contracts right built into them it's

7974
06:24:15,900 --> 06:24:17,940
like they just they ignored what we

7975
06:24:17,940 --> 06:24:19,620
learned for the past you know 30 years

7976
06:24:19,620 --> 06:24:22,100
right so

7977
06:24:22,100 --> 06:24:24,298
those are really good examples guys

7978
06:24:24,298 --> 06:24:25,920
thank you I was just kind of curious

7979
06:24:25,920 --> 06:24:27,298
because you mentioned the relationships

7980
06:24:27,298 --> 06:24:29,218
and how it's more important uh can you

7981
06:24:29,218 --> 06:24:31,260
guys give more examples of like you know

7982
06:24:31,260 --> 06:24:32,700
tough calls where you're like maybe this

7983
06:24:32,700 --> 06:24:34,200
won't work but you maybe had to bite

7984
06:24:34,200 --> 06:24:35,400
your tongue and not say anything other

7985
06:24:35,400 --> 06:24:37,200
times where you really thought it would

7986
06:24:37,200 --> 06:24:38,520
work and then maybe it didn't work out

7987
06:24:38,520 --> 06:24:39,840
in the in the way that you thought it

7988
06:24:39,840 --> 06:24:42,298
was uh because technology advances so

7989
06:24:42,298 --> 06:24:43,740
quickly it's hard to do all our research

7990
06:24:43,740 --> 06:24:44,820
right

7991
06:24:44,820 --> 06:24:48,558
yeah so I so examples of like

7992
06:24:48,558 --> 06:24:52,860
relationships relationship you know

7993
06:24:52,860 --> 06:24:56,400
yeah yeah so I mean one of the first

7994
06:24:56,400 --> 06:24:58,320
experiences personally that I had with

7995
06:24:58,320 --> 06:25:00,660
that with you know was it a bank you

7996
06:25:00,660 --> 06:25:02,878
know we're scanning internally figure

7997
06:25:02,878 --> 06:25:06,298
out that we can take over uh the The

7998
06:25:06,298 --> 06:25:08,400
Cisco guys really love to tell net right

7999
06:25:08,400 --> 06:25:10,680
really loves to tell that they probably

8000
06:25:10,680 --> 06:25:13,080
still do but

8001
06:25:13,080 --> 06:25:14,218
um you know

8002
06:25:14,218 --> 06:25:16,260
came up with this list of okay this is

8003
06:25:16,260 --> 06:25:17,820
stuff that we need you guys to fix and

8004
06:25:17,820 --> 06:25:19,138
we got a critical issue here because

8005
06:25:19,138 --> 06:25:21,120
anybody can sniff the sniff the traffic

8006
06:25:21,120 --> 06:25:23,340
and they can see your creds as they're

8007
06:25:23,340 --> 06:25:25,500
flowing back and forth and of course we

8008
06:25:25,500 --> 06:25:28,740
like we expose that to them in the

8009
06:25:28,740 --> 06:25:30,540
middle of a meeting with like our boss

8010
06:25:30,540 --> 06:25:33,540
and their boss and their boss's boss and

8011
06:25:33,540 --> 06:25:36,660
the reaction to that was just basically

8012
06:25:36,660 --> 06:25:37,980
they turned around on us and we're like

8013
06:25:37,980 --> 06:25:39,860
well are you Cisco Security Experts

8014
06:25:39,860 --> 06:25:42,480
right like it was very antagonistic and

8015
06:25:42,480 --> 06:25:44,458
it took probably three or four years to

8016
06:25:44,458 --> 06:25:46,320
repair that relationship because of that

8017
06:25:46,320 --> 06:25:48,660
10 second you know or that like half

8018
06:25:48,660 --> 06:25:50,638
hour meeting that we had

8019
06:25:50,638 --> 06:25:51,718
um that's that's one of the most

8020
06:25:51,718 --> 06:25:54,180
negative experiences that I had granted

8021
06:25:54,180 --> 06:25:56,100
it was very early in my career right

8022
06:25:56,100 --> 06:25:57,660
some of the first like penetration

8023
06:25:57,660 --> 06:25:59,878
testing that we had done I mean it was a

8024
06:25:59,878 --> 06:26:01,860
new team at a new bank and like they had

8025
06:26:01,860 --> 06:26:03,120
never experienced this sort of

8026
06:26:03,120 --> 06:26:06,480
antagonistic testing that was going on

8027
06:26:06,480 --> 06:26:07,920
um that's mine I don't know do you have

8028
06:26:07,920 --> 06:26:09,840
any other experiences with people in

8029
06:26:09,840 --> 06:26:11,218
that yeah I brought in an idiot

8030
06:26:11,218 --> 06:26:13,320
contractor at LivingSocial to do a

8031
06:26:13,320 --> 06:26:15,420
threat model and and he did one of the

8032
06:26:15,420 --> 06:26:17,700
worst performances I've ever seen I sat

8033
06:26:17,700 --> 06:26:20,218
in with him and our CTO and it was just

8034
06:26:20,218 --> 06:26:22,378
three of us and the world's most awkward

8035
06:26:22,378 --> 06:26:24,600
conversation as he jumbled through a

8036
06:26:24,600 --> 06:26:27,120
whole lot of nothing and I just was

8037
06:26:27,120 --> 06:26:29,520
happy that the CTO liked me and that was

8038
06:26:29,520 --> 06:26:31,200
just an awful time because I felt

8039
06:26:31,200 --> 06:26:32,940
horrible and I learned from that you

8040
06:26:32,940 --> 06:26:34,440
really have to manage your contractors

8041
06:26:34,440 --> 06:26:36,120
you never put them in front of execs

8042
06:26:36,120 --> 06:26:37,500
before you've you know vetted their

8043
06:26:37,500 --> 06:26:39,540
material I was younger I was less

8044
06:26:39,540 --> 06:26:42,360
experienced but the relationship saved

8045
06:26:42,360 --> 06:26:44,100
that and and you know we had a good

8046
06:26:44,100 --> 06:26:46,138
relation working relationship for as

8047
06:26:46,138 --> 06:26:48,298
long as the company existed which wasn't

8048
06:26:48,298 --> 06:26:51,360
super long but I I had an engagement

8049
06:26:51,360 --> 06:26:53,458
early on in my career that I think is

8050
06:26:53,458 --> 06:26:56,520
like what I hope that that it you know

8051
06:26:56,520 --> 06:26:58,260
we try to move towards with people right

8052
06:26:58,260 --> 06:27:01,080
which is uh

8053
06:27:01,080 --> 06:27:03,360
whenever we talk about a contract or a

8054
06:27:03,360 --> 06:27:05,100
Consulting engagement I always try to

8055
06:27:05,100 --> 06:27:07,138
ask the question like why am I here but

8056
06:27:07,138 --> 06:27:08,520
I know what I'm supposed to do that's

8057
06:27:08,520 --> 06:27:10,378
the easier part of the contract but like

8058
06:27:10,378 --> 06:27:12,600
why why do they ask me why why am I

8059
06:27:12,600 --> 06:27:13,740
coming in is that they don't have

8060
06:27:13,740 --> 06:27:16,260
resources don't whatever because the

8061
06:27:16,260 --> 06:27:18,120
answer to that question is going to tell

8062
06:27:18,120 --> 06:27:20,280
you a lot about the relationship that

8063
06:27:20,280 --> 06:27:21,600
you're going to have with people right

8064
06:27:21,600 --> 06:27:23,878
from the beginning right and in this

8065
06:27:23,878 --> 06:27:26,400
particular engagement the they were told

8066
06:27:26,400 --> 06:27:28,378
they have to bring us in they didn't

8067
06:27:28,378 --> 06:27:30,958
want us there they thought this was

8068
06:27:30,958 --> 06:27:33,000
going to be like a scary thing where we

8069
06:27:33,000 --> 06:27:34,500
were going to make them look bad and it

8070
06:27:34,500 --> 06:27:36,600
was going to be used against them and of

8071
06:27:36,600 --> 06:27:38,458
course that's not my job my job is to

8072
06:27:38,458 --> 06:27:40,138
like you to think objectively and tell

8073
06:27:40,138 --> 06:27:41,820
you you know what's right what's wrong

8074
06:27:41,820 --> 06:27:42,840
Etc

8075
06:27:42,840 --> 06:27:46,378
and so we I was out in Boston and met

8076
06:27:46,378 --> 06:27:48,600
these guys and we talked through the

8077
06:27:48,600 --> 06:27:50,160
situation it was so like they were

8078
06:27:50,160 --> 06:27:51,600
escorting us literally around the

8079
06:27:51,600 --> 06:27:53,638
building we sat in like a private little

8080
06:27:53,638 --> 06:27:55,260
place and one of their one of their team

8081
06:27:55,260 --> 06:27:56,940
members just sat there and like stared

8082
06:27:56,940 --> 06:27:58,878
at us for the entire engagement

8083
06:27:58,878 --> 06:28:02,520
and uh and so what we did was we just

8084
06:28:02,520 --> 06:28:04,320
started talking to him about the process

8085
06:28:04,320 --> 06:28:05,638
we just said well this what we're going

8086
06:28:05,638 --> 06:28:07,320
to do this is why we're doing it this is

8087
06:28:07,320 --> 06:28:10,320
how it goes and we and we compromised

8088
06:28:10,320 --> 06:28:12,180
the whole system right so like worst

8089
06:28:12,180 --> 06:28:14,400
case scenario it was like this is how we

8090
06:28:14,400 --> 06:28:16,080
did it this is what we did and not only

8091
06:28:16,080 --> 06:28:17,638
you did that but you basically can't

8092
06:28:17,638 --> 06:28:19,260
secure it there's no way to fix this

8093
06:28:19,260 --> 06:28:20,580
type of problem

8094
06:28:20,580 --> 06:28:23,218
and but the the care and the taking him

8095
06:28:23,218 --> 06:28:25,378
to lunch and the talking and the walking

8096
06:28:25,378 --> 06:28:27,120
them through it to make it like clear

8097
06:28:27,120 --> 06:28:28,500
over and over and over again that we're

8098
06:28:28,500 --> 06:28:29,820
not I'm not going to say this is your

8099
06:28:29,820 --> 06:28:32,280
fault this is just the reality of design

8100
06:28:32,280 --> 06:28:34,138
decisions like if you give someone a

8101
06:28:34,138 --> 06:28:35,820
physical computer it's their computer

8102
06:28:35,820 --> 06:28:38,400
right and I can do a lot of this stuff

8103
06:28:38,400 --> 06:28:40,860
and so that relationship like uh not

8104
06:28:40,860 --> 06:28:42,600
even just on that engagement from

8105
06:28:42,600 --> 06:28:44,280
literally I hate you and I don't want

8106
06:28:44,280 --> 06:28:46,558
you here to you know this went really

8107
06:28:46,558 --> 06:28:48,660
well thank you for your help they

8108
06:28:48,660 --> 06:28:49,980
actually brought us in a year later

8109
06:28:49,980 --> 06:28:51,718
because they spent an entire year

8110
06:28:51,718 --> 06:28:54,660
prototyping a whole new design just to

8111
06:28:54,660 --> 06:28:56,040
see if they could kind of like beat us

8112
06:28:56,040 --> 06:28:57,718
like it was like they they turned it

8113
06:28:57,718 --> 06:29:00,058
into excitement and so like that's an

8114
06:29:00,058 --> 06:29:01,980
example for me relationally where it's

8115
06:29:01,980 --> 06:29:04,020
like you gotta understand where they're

8116
06:29:04,020 --> 06:29:05,520
coming from to meet them where they're

8117
06:29:05,520 --> 06:29:07,378
at to walk them through that process and

8118
06:29:07,378 --> 06:29:09,298
help them through it and I did break

8119
06:29:09,298 --> 06:29:11,600
their other design to you just

8120
06:29:11,600 --> 06:29:14,100
of course actually I did it accidentally

8121
06:29:14,100 --> 06:29:15,660
that was my favorite part of that story

8122
06:29:15,660 --> 06:29:17,458
I was just messing around and I like

8123
06:29:17,458 --> 06:29:19,020
realized that something was wrong

8124
06:29:19,020 --> 06:29:21,360
through rebooting it out of sequence and

8125
06:29:21,360 --> 06:29:24,138
it was like yes I gotcha

8126
06:29:24,138 --> 06:29:26,940
good well and I know we only have I

8127
06:29:26,940 --> 06:29:27,900
think we're supposed to be done five

8128
06:29:27,900 --> 06:29:30,780
minutes before right okay yeah Okay so

8129
06:29:30,780 --> 06:29:33,240
we've got about seven minutes left I

8130
06:29:33,240 --> 06:29:34,740
want to focus on the future a little bit

8131
06:29:34,740 --> 06:29:38,480
right so what is it that you want to see

8132
06:29:38,480 --> 06:29:41,940
in security or application security or

8133
06:29:41,940 --> 06:29:43,458
Cloud security mic

8134
06:29:43,458 --> 06:29:45,780
in the next you know in the short term

8135
06:29:45,780 --> 06:29:47,820
in the next two to five years

8136
06:29:47,820 --> 06:29:50,400
I'm going to start a golf yeah go for it

8137
06:29:50,400 --> 06:29:52,980
go back to my buzzword uh infrastructure

8138
06:29:52,980 --> 06:29:54,780
is code I'm just kidding

8139
06:29:54,780 --> 06:29:56,218
wait no no you can't say that anymore

8140
06:29:56,218 --> 06:29:58,680
yes

8141
06:29:58,680 --> 06:30:00,480
no I mean I think when you when you do

8142
06:30:00,480 --> 06:30:02,218
do a lot of cloud work you see people

8143
06:30:02,218 --> 06:30:05,280
doing formal Declarations of what

8144
06:30:05,280 --> 06:30:06,958
so you write terraform you write cloud

8145
06:30:06,958 --> 06:30:08,218
formation

8146
06:30:08,218 --> 06:30:10,200
um if you're unfortunate enough to do a

8147
06:30:10,200 --> 06:30:11,700
lot of azure you you know use their

8148
06:30:11,700 --> 06:30:13,100
languages

8149
06:30:13,100 --> 06:30:16,020
but you you get into the mindset okay

8150
06:30:16,020 --> 06:30:17,940
this is I'm writing down what I want and

8151
06:30:17,940 --> 06:30:19,500
then that gets created obviously there's

8152
06:30:19,500 --> 06:30:21,058
edge cases obviously is there there's

8153
06:30:21,058 --> 06:30:23,540
relationships that might be unexpected

8154
06:30:23,540 --> 06:30:26,580
so on the cloud security World actually

8155
06:30:26,580 --> 06:30:28,500
think it's really it's almost easy to do

8156
06:30:28,500 --> 06:30:29,878
security because you're saying okay I

8157
06:30:29,878 --> 06:30:31,680
want this tell me if it's not this and

8158
06:30:31,680 --> 06:30:33,480
then I will go fix that appsec is

8159
06:30:33,480 --> 06:30:35,218
different because it's a much it can be

8160
06:30:35,218 --> 06:30:37,260
a much more complex environment but I do

8161
06:30:37,260 --> 06:30:40,080
hope and I think actually cloud is

8162
06:30:40,080 --> 06:30:42,360
somewhat enabling this through things

8163
06:30:42,360 --> 06:30:44,218
like API gateways and again formal

8164
06:30:44,218 --> 06:30:46,260
Declaration of infrastructure former

8165
06:30:46,260 --> 06:30:47,700
Declaration of like routes things like

8166
06:30:47,700 --> 06:30:50,160
that if you can write those things down

8167
06:30:50,160 --> 06:30:51,900
if you can architect it write it down

8168
06:30:51,900 --> 06:30:54,298
then you have your tools validate that

8169
06:30:54,298 --> 06:30:57,480
that is true AWS just released their

8170
06:30:57,480 --> 06:31:00,240
verified authorization or permissions I

8171
06:31:00,240 --> 06:31:01,558
think it's called and you can actually

8172
06:31:01,558 --> 06:31:03,958
write you write a formal definition of

8173
06:31:03,958 --> 06:31:05,940
your authentication flow then you can

8174
06:31:05,940 --> 06:31:07,798
write rules against that to make sure

8175
06:31:07,798 --> 06:31:09,378
it's doing what you think it's doing

8176
06:31:09,378 --> 06:31:12,240
there's a ton of this in the terraform

8177
06:31:12,240 --> 06:31:14,040
world where you can write security rules

8178
06:31:14,040 --> 06:31:15,840
against your terraform to make your make

8179
06:31:15,840 --> 06:31:17,400
sure it's doing what you think it's

8180
06:31:17,400 --> 06:31:19,080
doing so I think we

8181
06:31:19,080 --> 06:31:23,280
I think that's the only way to really

8182
06:31:23,280 --> 06:31:25,440
fix things at scale in the abstract

8183
06:31:25,440 --> 06:31:27,260
world is having more formal

8184
06:31:27,260 --> 06:31:30,000
Declaration of what we want and then

8185
06:31:30,000 --> 06:31:31,500
validating that versus being like well

8186
06:31:31,500 --> 06:31:32,400
I'm going to write a bunch of code you

8187
06:31:32,400 --> 06:31:33,240
guys are going to tell me what's wrong

8188
06:31:33,240 --> 06:31:34,680
with it then I'm going to go fix that

8189
06:31:34,680 --> 06:31:36,840
thing like it has to be a system that is

8190
06:31:36,840 --> 06:31:38,780
built to a spec versus like

8191
06:31:38,780 --> 06:31:44,239
unfortunately for artistic you know um

8192
06:31:47,840 --> 06:31:51,120
GMO free yeah I mean development that's

8193
06:31:51,120 --> 06:31:53,840
engineering like

8194
06:31:54,718 --> 06:31:57,298
This and like you know it's

8195
06:31:57,298 --> 06:31:59,700
you have to it's engineering and systems

8196
06:31:59,700 --> 06:32:01,080
you have to have a design then you check

8197
06:32:01,080 --> 06:32:03,600
that design it can't be free form all

8198
06:32:03,600 --> 06:32:05,580
the time so I'm hoping that appsec

8199
06:32:05,580 --> 06:32:07,200
becomes more of that way and I think

8200
06:32:07,200 --> 06:32:09,420
we're getting there to a degree

8201
06:32:09,420 --> 06:32:11,940
um but yeah that's my hope okay all

8202
06:32:11,940 --> 06:32:13,680
right Andrew

8203
06:32:13,680 --> 06:32:15,718
two to five years two to five years I

8204
06:32:15,718 --> 06:32:18,540
mean I think I think continuous

8205
06:32:18,540 --> 06:32:21,540
assessment the future of pen testing I I

8206
06:32:21,540 --> 06:32:23,760
don't I know it sounds self-serving

8207
06:32:23,760 --> 06:32:25,500
because our company sells continuous pen

8208
06:32:25,500 --> 06:32:26,820
testing if you're looking for I don't

8209
06:32:26,820 --> 06:32:29,040
work there and I agree but I think I

8210
06:32:29,040 --> 06:32:31,980
think this constant monitoring awareness

8211
06:32:31,980 --> 06:32:35,458
of an external perimeter and Rapid

8212
06:32:35,458 --> 06:32:37,558
deployment of eyeballs of qualified

8213
06:32:37,558 --> 06:32:40,138
people against change sets is going to

8214
06:32:40,138 --> 06:32:41,760
be the only way we can handle things at

8215
06:32:41,760 --> 06:32:43,500
scale I don't think I think the point in

8216
06:32:43,500 --> 06:32:46,920
time methodology is fantastic for things

8217
06:32:46,920 --> 06:32:48,420
like you were saying like really formal

8218
06:32:48,420 --> 06:32:49,798
stuff where it's the first time maybe

8219
06:32:49,798 --> 06:32:51,540
I've done it and maybe it's great for

8220
06:32:51,540 --> 06:32:53,340
the initial design and I'm putting it

8221
06:32:53,340 --> 06:32:55,620
out there or maybe something like a

8222
06:32:55,620 --> 06:32:57,180
product that's going out the door and

8223
06:32:57,180 --> 06:32:58,798
you don't get the ability to constantly

8224
06:32:58,798 --> 06:33:01,680
monitor in the same fashion but I think

8225
06:33:01,680 --> 06:33:04,138
I think continuous solution or

8226
06:33:04,138 --> 06:33:05,700
continuous testing and assessment is

8227
06:33:05,700 --> 06:33:08,100
going to put us in a spot where we're

8228
06:33:08,100 --> 06:33:10,320
better positioned to address challenges

8229
06:33:10,320 --> 06:33:13,378
in a more relevant time frame in a way

8230
06:33:13,378 --> 06:33:17,218
that actually get things closer like you

8231
06:33:17,218 --> 06:33:18,540
know if you think about pen tests in

8232
06:33:18,540 --> 06:33:20,458
general I do it once maybe once a year

8233
06:33:20,458 --> 06:33:22,138
for certain customers well it's like

8234
06:33:22,138 --> 06:33:24,780
from the moment I leave and the moment

8235
06:33:24,780 --> 06:33:26,760
you touch keyboard on that thing then

8236
06:33:26,760 --> 06:33:28,378
the entire year it could have a

8237
06:33:28,378 --> 06:33:29,700
vulnerability and nobody's going to see

8238
06:33:29,700 --> 06:33:31,260
it for another year right and nobody's

8239
06:33:31,260 --> 06:33:33,780
even gonna get get their hands on it but

8240
06:33:33,780 --> 06:33:36,360
if you have a system that says you know

8241
06:33:36,360 --> 06:33:37,980
we're watching we're monitoring we know

8242
06:33:37,980 --> 06:33:40,260
when changes are pushed or whatever and

8243
06:33:40,260 --> 06:33:42,600
then it changes like someone could take

8244
06:33:42,600 --> 06:33:44,100
a look at it someone can provide

8245
06:33:44,100 --> 06:33:46,260
feedback someone could say Yes No Maybe

8246
06:33:46,260 --> 06:33:49,138
So and I genuinely believe that is the

8247
06:33:49,138 --> 06:33:50,940
only way we're going to get to any sense

8248
06:33:50,940 --> 06:33:52,798
of the fractional world or the scale

8249
06:33:52,798 --> 06:33:54,600
that's happening against us yeah because

8250
06:33:54,600 --> 06:33:55,980
Change Control is just a point in time

8251
06:33:55,980 --> 06:33:57,780
you get your one-time assessment and

8252
06:33:57,780 --> 06:33:59,040
then it's like how much code gets

8253
06:33:59,040 --> 06:34:01,320
developed later that you never I totally

8254
06:34:01,320 --> 06:34:03,120
agree like pull requests are like really

8255
06:34:03,120 --> 06:34:04,200
where

8256
06:34:04,200 --> 06:34:05,878
vulnerabilities get introduced right but

8257
06:34:05,878 --> 06:34:08,400
who's what who's watching PR's every day

8258
06:34:08,400 --> 06:34:09,900
I mean we have tooling right but like

8259
06:34:09,900 --> 06:34:12,120
what human being has eyeballs on it

8260
06:34:12,120 --> 06:34:15,958
really only software devs

8261
06:34:15,958 --> 06:34:18,058
okay so Ken two to five years what do

8262
06:34:18,058 --> 06:34:19,500
you want to see

8263
06:34:19,500 --> 06:34:21,480
where's Sean where's my man Sean are you

8264
06:34:21,480 --> 06:34:23,340
still in Sean that's what I want to see

8265
06:34:23,340 --> 06:34:25,440
Sean is a software engineer who came to

8266
06:34:25,440 --> 06:34:27,360
our course on the second day of the

8267
06:34:27,360 --> 06:34:29,218
conference and sat there for four hours

8268
06:34:29,218 --> 06:34:30,840
and went through as we droned on about

8269
06:34:30,840 --> 06:34:32,878
how to do secure code review that's what

8270
06:34:32,878 --> 06:34:34,138
I want to see more of in two to five

8271
06:34:34,138 --> 06:34:36,298
years is folks like you and honestly I

8272
06:34:36,298 --> 06:34:37,558
think we

8273
06:34:37,558 --> 06:34:39,540
have a lot of opinions about this but I

8274
06:34:39,540 --> 06:34:41,700
think there was a definitely I don't

8275
06:34:41,700 --> 06:34:43,260
know if it's gatekeeping or anything

8276
06:34:43,260 --> 06:34:45,780
like that but it's more of just uh I

8277
06:34:45,780 --> 06:34:48,000
think appsec was like this Niche thing

8278
06:34:48,000 --> 06:34:49,500
and like you know you have to know

8279
06:34:49,500 --> 06:34:50,820
because you got to know code you got to

8280
06:34:50,820 --> 06:34:52,200
know like the security Concepts all this

8281
06:34:52,200 --> 06:34:53,940
fun stuff like that right so my point is

8282
06:34:53,940 --> 06:34:56,340
I'm gonna wrap this up real quick uh is

8283
06:34:56,340 --> 06:34:57,718
just that um

8284
06:34:57,718 --> 06:34:59,940
I think we have to start looking at it

8285
06:34:59,940 --> 06:35:01,080
and Andrew and I were talking about this

8286
06:35:01,080 --> 06:35:03,480
yesterday start looking at it as more of

8287
06:35:03,480 --> 06:35:06,240
a trade that can be taught in a

8288
06:35:06,240 --> 06:35:08,580
repeatable way and then arm the masses

8289
06:35:08,580 --> 06:35:10,080
with that information and then we build

8290
06:35:10,080 --> 06:35:11,580
it we built an army of people whether

8291
06:35:11,580 --> 06:35:13,620
it's software Engineers or it's it's uh

8292
06:35:13,620 --> 06:35:15,480
you know whatever practice security

8293
06:35:15,480 --> 06:35:17,760
practitioners yeah

8294
06:35:17,760 --> 06:35:19,798
I always want to say well you know my

8295
06:35:19,798 --> 06:35:21,540
son always tells me it's not that deep

8296
06:35:21,540 --> 06:35:23,760
right yeah yeah that like it's really

8297
06:35:23,760 --> 06:35:26,760
not as complex as we you know as we make

8298
06:35:26,760 --> 06:35:28,200
it out to be and I want it to be more

8299
06:35:28,200 --> 06:35:30,180
approachable you know we've had

8300
06:35:30,180 --> 06:35:32,280
discussions of people on the podcast

8301
06:35:32,280 --> 06:35:35,218
um what's our bucket that is it Meraki

8302
06:35:35,218 --> 06:35:37,740
or that was it used to be a circus

8303
06:35:37,740 --> 06:35:40,138
performer and now she does security work

8304
06:35:40,138 --> 06:35:41,638
right yeah

8305
06:35:41,638 --> 06:35:44,280
um and it's like

8306
06:35:44,280 --> 06:35:46,500
security is everyone's

8307
06:35:46,500 --> 06:35:50,100
is everyone's problem not just ours and

8308
06:35:50,100 --> 06:35:52,200
I think we're starting to recognize that

8309
06:35:52,200 --> 06:35:54,600
like we push out and other people are

8310
06:35:54,600 --> 06:35:56,218
getting involved we get more and more

8311
06:35:56,218 --> 06:35:58,680
interest more and more

8312
06:35:58,680 --> 06:35:59,298
um

8313
06:35:59,298 --> 06:36:02,280
interactions with the wider Community I

8314
06:36:02,280 --> 06:36:04,260
mean the day that I can get you know my

8315
06:36:04,260 --> 06:36:07,740
father to do to use 2fa or MFA like

8316
06:36:07,740 --> 06:36:09,360
that's going to be great you know

8317
06:36:09,360 --> 06:36:12,000
because I push it on him now but the day

8318
06:36:12,000 --> 06:36:13,920
that he asks me how to do something like

8319
06:36:13,920 --> 06:36:16,320
that is is going to be a good day and I

8320
06:36:16,320 --> 06:36:18,840
know it's coming but until the awareness

8321
06:36:18,840 --> 06:36:20,458
is there I just don't think we're going

8322
06:36:20,458 --> 06:36:22,138
to solve it but it all feeds into the

8323
06:36:22,138 --> 06:36:24,718
formal verification this uh like the

8324
06:36:24,718 --> 06:36:27,000
idea of continuously watching continuous

8325
06:36:27,000 --> 06:36:29,820
delivery of penetration tests and then

8326
06:36:29,820 --> 06:36:31,558
the people that are involved I couldn't

8327
06:36:31,558 --> 06:36:33,718
figure out her name sorry oh that's okay

8328
06:36:33,718 --> 06:36:35,760
it's it's one of the past episodes if

8329
06:36:35,760 --> 06:36:37,320
you if you want to know like let us know

8330
06:36:37,320 --> 06:36:39,180
and

8331
06:36:39,180 --> 06:36:41,040
um okay so I think we're about out of

8332
06:36:41,040 --> 06:36:43,020

cool well welcome to getting into the

8425
06:50:18,540 --> 06:50:21,780
reads this talk I appreciate you coming

8426
06:50:21,780 --> 06:50:24,600
up here and spending time making that

8427
06:50:24,600 --> 06:50:26,638
long Trek from the hall

8428
06:50:26,638 --> 06:50:27,958
but

8429
06:50:27,958 --> 06:50:31,080
what is this talk about right this talk

8430
06:50:31,080 --> 06:50:33,000
is simply about

8431
06:50:33,000 --> 06:50:35,100
these little things these are read

8432
06:50:35,100 --> 06:50:37,378
sensors if you've never seen one of

8433
06:50:37,378 --> 06:50:38,940
these these are one of the most prolific

8434
06:50:38,940 --> 06:50:43,320
items used in physical security for

8435
06:50:43,320 --> 06:50:46,260
detecting Intruders unfortunately as

8436
06:50:46,260 --> 06:50:48,840
we'll learn in the talk that they don't

8437
06:50:48,840 --> 06:50:51,000
always do the greatest of jobs

8438
06:50:51,000 --> 06:50:53,160
now people have tried to make it done

8439
06:50:53,160 --> 06:50:55,378
better or they've tried to you know

8440
06:50:55,378 --> 06:50:58,440
improve it and make it more secure but

8441
06:50:58,440 --> 06:51:01,320
what if your attacker has advanced

8442
06:51:01,320 --> 06:51:02,400
tooling

8443
06:51:02,400 --> 06:51:05,458
right what if they are persistent and

8444
06:51:05,458 --> 06:51:07,740
they don't just be calm defeated because

8445
06:51:07,740 --> 06:51:11,100
they go and you know they you you added

8446
06:51:11,100 --> 06:51:13,680
a few extra steps into it what if they

8447
06:51:13,680 --> 06:51:17,280
are motivated to get into what they want

8448
06:51:17,280 --> 06:51:19,440
to get into

8449
06:51:19,440 --> 06:51:21,420
what are you going to do as a Defender

8450
06:51:21,420 --> 06:51:23,100
right

8451
06:51:23,100 --> 06:51:25,620
luckily for me that's not my problem my

8452
06:51:25,620 --> 06:51:27,360
problem is finding the ways to break

8453
06:51:27,360 --> 06:51:30,958
into things right so

8454
06:51:30,958 --> 06:51:33,420
what we're going to discuss is some of

8455
06:51:33,420 --> 06:51:36,478
the flaws that we run into with read

8456
06:51:36,478 --> 06:51:39,240
sensors we're also going to be

8457
06:51:39,240 --> 06:51:41,340
discussing some of the mitigations that

8458
06:51:41,340 --> 06:51:43,440
companies have tried to do to protect

8459
06:51:43,440 --> 06:51:45,718
against those flaws and then we're going

8460
06:51:45,718 --> 06:51:48,058
to break those mitigations as well right

8461
06:51:48,058 --> 06:51:51,000
so there is no winning here for the

8462
06:51:51,000 --> 06:51:53,218
Defenders not just kidding there is some

8463
06:51:53,218 --> 06:51:55,740
yeah that's okay you can boo it that's

8464
06:51:55,740 --> 06:51:56,638
fine

8465
06:51:56,638 --> 06:51:58,500
um there is winning

8466
06:51:58,500 --> 06:52:00,180
um we'll get to that at the very end of

8467
06:52:00,180 --> 06:52:01,080
course

8468
06:52:01,080 --> 06:52:03,058
I think it's a one single line bullet

8469
06:52:03,058 --> 06:52:06,240
point uh

8470
06:52:06,900 --> 06:52:10,860
so who are we myself up here I am Drew

8471
06:52:10,860 --> 06:52:12,780
redshift Porter uh I run a company

8472
06:52:12,780 --> 06:52:14,940
called Red Mesa and I am the President

8473
06:52:14,940 --> 06:52:17,400
and board member of a company named red

8474
06:52:17,400 --> 06:52:20,638
team Alliance and this talk is actually

8475
06:52:20,638 --> 06:52:23,100
out from our research done at Red Team

8476
06:52:23,100 --> 06:52:24,718
Alliance uh some people think I know

8477
06:52:24,718 --> 06:52:26,340
about physical security signals

8478
06:52:26,340 --> 06:52:28,200
intelligence and not having a soul

8479
06:52:28,200 --> 06:52:31,620
because I'm a ginger and uh my

8480
06:52:31,620 --> 06:52:34,620
co-presenter here hello everyone

8481
06:52:34,620 --> 06:52:36,660
uh I'm babik

8482
06:52:36,660 --> 06:52:38,280
I do things

8483
06:52:38,280 --> 06:52:40,440
I like Hardware I like locks I like

8484
06:52:40,440 --> 06:52:42,000
physical security and I've been doing it

8485
06:52:42,000 --> 06:52:44,458
for a long time so long that people

8486
06:52:44,458 --> 06:52:46,440
started paying me to teach them how to

8487
06:52:46,440 --> 06:52:48,958
do similar things hence covert entry

8488
06:52:48,958 --> 06:52:51,420
instructor but this is something that as

8489
06:52:51,420 --> 06:52:52,860
Drew mentioned we're both very deeply

8490
06:52:52,860 --> 06:52:54,360
passionate about

8491
06:52:54,360 --> 06:52:56,940
um because it's one of the one of the

8492
06:52:56,940 --> 06:52:59,100
greatest examples of you know when you

8493
06:52:59,100 --> 06:53:02,638
figure something out it has a like like

8494
06:53:02,638 --> 06:53:04,620
very real world impact that you can

8495
06:53:04,620 --> 06:53:07,138
touch and you know for for me that's

8496
06:53:07,138 --> 06:53:08,760
really cool

8497
06:53:08,760 --> 06:53:12,718
yeah so let's let's get into the reads

8498
06:53:12,718 --> 06:53:15,120
what is a read switch before you read

8499
06:53:15,120 --> 06:53:17,040
this slide deck close your eyes pretend

8500
06:53:17,040 --> 06:53:19,260
you didn't see it how many people knew

8501
06:53:19,260 --> 06:53:21,600
what a read switch is if someone said a

8502
06:53:21,600 --> 06:53:25,138
read switch Okay cool so that is less

8503
06:53:25,138 --> 06:53:29,239
than I was thinking but that's fine

8504
06:53:30,000 --> 06:53:31,440
but if he was

8505
06:53:31,440 --> 06:53:34,020
he was a magnetic read switch would have

8506
06:53:34,020 --> 06:53:35,760
without a felt more familiar even though

8507
06:53:35,760 --> 06:53:38,100
it's really not that different

8508
06:53:38,100 --> 06:53:41,160
what about what about a window sensor

8509
06:53:41,160 --> 06:53:44,100
does that everyone know okay yeah

8510
06:53:44,100 --> 06:53:46,320
so you actually already know what these

8511
06:53:46,320 --> 06:53:48,718
sensors are or at least you know the

8512
06:53:48,718 --> 06:53:50,580
technology that's in them

8513
06:53:50,580 --> 06:53:52,920
so a retwitch is an electromechanical

8514
06:53:52,920 --> 06:53:56,580
switch that when you apply a magnetic

8515
06:53:56,580 --> 06:53:58,320
field around it will create it to either

8516
06:53:58,320 --> 06:54:00,620
open or close right

8517
06:54:00,620 --> 06:54:04,860
this is technology from the 1940s and

8518
06:54:04,860 --> 06:54:08,280
we're still using it every day in

8519
06:54:08,280 --> 06:54:10,378
physical security and you might think

8520
06:54:10,378 --> 06:54:12,660
wow that's really dumb good thing that

8521
06:54:12,660 --> 06:54:15,240
doesn't happen very often

8522
06:54:15,240 --> 06:54:17,360
or maybe you're not thinking that

8523
06:54:17,360 --> 06:54:21,058
another area where we're relying on

8524
06:54:21,058 --> 06:54:23,400
literally decades-old technology every

8525
06:54:23,400 --> 06:54:26,100
day who's ever heard of the term we Gand

8526
06:54:26,100 --> 06:54:29,160
is that a word or name that okay

8527
06:54:29,160 --> 06:54:31,500
um who can tell me ballpark within the

8528
06:54:31,500 --> 06:54:34,500
same decade when was weekend invented

8529
06:54:34,500 --> 06:54:36,058
anyone

8530
06:54:36,058 --> 06:54:39,600
1990 1940s 1940s let's take the average

8531
06:54:39,600 --> 06:54:42,478
ish right uh mid 70s John Richard Wigan

8532
06:54:42,478 --> 06:54:45,600
patented hey there we go uh patented

8533
06:54:45,600 --> 06:54:48,180
weekend uh wire which led to the Wigan

8534
06:54:48,180 --> 06:54:51,360
protocol which now still today most

8535
06:54:51,360 --> 06:54:53,520
Access Control readers like your card

8536
06:54:53,520 --> 06:54:56,100
readers and control panels still use

8537
06:54:56,100 --> 06:54:58,080
we're trying to move away from it but

8538
06:54:58,080 --> 06:54:59,940
this is literal decades old technology

8539
06:54:59,940 --> 06:55:03,660
that is still in use in part similar to

8540
06:55:03,660 --> 06:55:05,900
read switches because of consistency

8541
06:55:05,900 --> 06:55:08,638
reliability and cost these things

8542
06:55:08,638 --> 06:55:10,440
absolutely Drive the physical security

8543
06:55:10,440 --> 06:55:12,360
industry and it plugs the physical

8544
06:55:12,360 --> 06:55:15,058
security industry as well right and this

8545
06:55:15,058 --> 06:55:17,638
is why we can do items and make us look

8546
06:55:17,638 --> 06:55:19,558
really cool to our clients right but

8547
06:55:19,558 --> 06:55:21,478
we're just like wow we're destroying

8548
06:55:21,478 --> 06:55:22,920
something that was developed like

8549
06:55:22,920 --> 06:55:25,138
decades ago they weren't thinking about

8550
06:55:25,138 --> 06:55:26,580
this necessarily when they were

8551
06:55:26,580 --> 06:55:29,400
developing this technology

8552
06:55:29,400 --> 06:55:31,558
so if you want to see a read switch in

8553
06:55:31,558 --> 06:55:36,360
action this is one that was taken apart

8554
06:55:36,360 --> 06:55:38,878
um and then that Gap that you see in

8555
06:55:38,878 --> 06:55:40,860
there was actually spread out large to

8556
06:55:40,860 --> 06:55:43,860
show texture uh yeah it's like a

8557
06:55:43,860 --> 06:55:44,940
Cheez-It

8558
06:55:44,940 --> 06:55:46,138
um

8559
06:55:46,138 --> 06:55:49,500
that Gap I enlarged it by getting one of

8560
06:55:49,500 --> 06:55:51,298
my wife's hair and slipping it through

8561
06:55:51,298 --> 06:55:53,280
that Gap so if you're looking what

8562
06:55:53,280 --> 06:55:56,100
you're looking at is a video at 234

8563
06:55:56,100 --> 06:55:59,760
magnification right now so it might look

8564
06:55:59,760 --> 06:56:02,160
really big but it's really small and an

8565
06:56:02,160 --> 06:56:04,020
actual and when it's actually deployed

8566
06:56:04,020 --> 06:56:07,620
it is even smaller than that right again

8567
06:56:07,620 --> 06:56:09,840
I had to take a human hair to widen that

8568
06:56:09,840 --> 06:56:11,820
Gap so that you can actually see the

8569
06:56:11,820 --> 06:56:14,638
accurate that that moving read in there

8570
06:56:14,638 --> 06:56:18,180
my magnifying uh camera didn't go far

8571
06:56:18,180 --> 06:56:20,218
enough to record the actual one we're

8572
06:56:20,218 --> 06:56:21,240
talking

8573
06:56:21,240 --> 06:56:23,760
we're talking you know less than

8574
06:56:23,760 --> 06:56:26,100
thousandths of an inch thick here but

8575
06:56:26,100 --> 06:56:28,260
this is a super reliable mechanism I

8576
06:56:28,260 --> 06:56:30,840
mean nor the these contacts are in a

8577
06:56:30,840 --> 06:56:35,638
sealed vacuum vial of glass vial that is

8578
06:56:35,638 --> 06:56:39,240
never exposed uh to oxidation uh you

8579
06:56:39,240 --> 06:56:40,798
don't have a lot of the problems that

8580
06:56:40,798 --> 06:56:42,600
you have with normal types of contacts

8581
06:56:42,600 --> 06:56:44,100
and switches which is

8582
06:56:44,100 --> 06:56:47,340
why it's so prevalent like it's it's one

8583
06:56:47,340 --> 06:56:49,320
of the most reliable switching

8584
06:56:49,320 --> 06:56:52,500
mechanisms that are in use for all the

8585
06:56:52,500 --> 06:56:54,120
more advanced technology that we have

8586
06:56:54,120 --> 06:56:56,520
today even for the high security stuff

8587
06:56:56,520 --> 06:56:58,620
that's that's out there nothing comes

8588
06:56:58,620 --> 06:57:00,240
close to the Simplicity and reliability

8589
06:57:00,240 --> 06:57:04,680
of the humble magnetic Reed switch

8590
06:57:04,680 --> 06:57:07,080
so we're going to cover two terms which

8591
06:57:07,080 --> 06:57:09,780
are important in the uh when it comes to

8592
06:57:09,780 --> 06:57:11,280
read switches

8593
06:57:11,280 --> 06:57:13,200
when you hear these terms you're going

8594
06:57:13,200 --> 06:57:14,520
to think about it and then you'll be

8595
06:57:14,520 --> 06:57:15,900
like that doesn't make any sense that's

8596
06:57:15,900 --> 06:57:17,878
okay we feel the same way and we teach

8597
06:57:17,878 --> 06:57:20,100
classes on this right so don't don't

8598
06:57:20,100 --> 06:57:23,638
fret if you're confused by this

8599
06:57:23,638 --> 06:57:26,160
normally open what normally open means

8600
06:57:26,160 --> 06:57:30,000
is in its default State that's the read

8601
06:57:30,000 --> 06:57:32,700
switch the two arms are against or away

8602
06:57:32,700 --> 06:57:34,080
from each other

8603
06:57:34,080 --> 06:57:36,360
right then you have a traveling magnet

8604
06:57:36,360 --> 06:57:38,820
maybe on a door or something else maybe

8605
06:57:38,820 --> 06:57:40,500
it's on a conveyor belt right Reed

8606
06:57:40,500 --> 06:57:42,180
switches aren't just used for physical

8607
06:57:42,180 --> 06:57:44,878
security they're used in a wide range of

8608
06:57:44,878 --> 06:57:46,680
applications because of that reliability

8609
06:57:46,680 --> 06:57:48,718
and that cost factor that bobik was just

8610
06:57:48,718 --> 06:57:51,600
talking about but for our for our

8611
06:57:51,600 --> 06:57:53,400
demonstrations and for our practicality

8612
06:57:53,400 --> 06:57:56,340
it's going to be on a door but you have

8613
06:57:56,340 --> 06:57:59,340
a traveling magnet and then that itself

8614
06:57:59,340 --> 06:58:01,378
is what is going to make that Reed

8615
06:58:01,378 --> 06:58:04,260
switch closed so in its secure state

8616
06:58:04,260 --> 06:58:07,920
right it is going to be closed and that

8617
06:58:07,920 --> 06:58:11,000
is normally open

8618
06:58:11,400 --> 06:58:14,160
then we have normally closed so normally

8619
06:58:14,160 --> 06:58:17,520
closed itself is the read switch and its

8620
06:58:17,520 --> 06:58:20,700
normal State uh is closed and this is

8621
06:58:20,700 --> 06:58:23,700
done because there is a permanent magnet

8622
06:58:23,700 --> 06:58:26,280
that is attached near that Reed switch

8623
06:58:26,280 --> 06:58:29,540
itself and then a the traveling magnet

8624
06:58:29,540 --> 06:58:32,700
either eliminates that the other

8625
06:58:32,700 --> 06:58:36,420
magnetic wave or that that field or a

8626
06:58:36,420 --> 06:58:38,400
counteract it and it allows the switch

8627
06:58:38,400 --> 06:58:41,160
to become open

8628
06:58:41,160 --> 06:58:44,520
um and this is a normally closed read

8629
06:58:44,520 --> 06:58:45,660
switch

8630
06:58:45,660 --> 06:58:47,280
you're going to be like okay that makes

8631
06:58:47,280 --> 06:58:48,298
sense and then you're going to think

8632
06:58:48,298 --> 06:58:50,458
about it like a day later unless you've

8633
06:58:50,458 --> 06:58:51,540
got a photographic memory you're gonna

8634
06:58:51,540 --> 06:58:53,520
be like this doesn't make sense so like

8635
06:58:53,520 --> 06:58:56,520
for example right now uh

8636
06:58:56,520 --> 06:58:58,920
is this sensor that we have installed

8637
06:58:58,920 --> 06:59:00,840
here uh on this

8638
06:59:00,840 --> 06:59:03,900
safe is it in the normal state or in the

8639
06:59:03,900 --> 06:59:06,180
activated state

8640
06:59:06,180 --> 06:59:09,900
right so normal in the electrical terms

8641
06:59:09,900 --> 06:59:12,660
here is referring to the switch by

8642
06:59:12,660 --> 06:59:14,940
itself without the presence of any

8643
06:59:14,940 --> 06:59:17,760
external thing widget magnet whatever

8644
06:59:17,760 --> 06:59:21,420
you want to call it even though when

8645
06:59:21,420 --> 06:59:23,820
used in an application such as a door

8646
06:59:23,820 --> 06:59:26,040
the normal state of the door is

8647
06:59:26,040 --> 06:59:28,620
generally closed right so it's it's a

8648
06:59:28,620 --> 06:59:30,900
very frustrating and difficult thing and

8649
06:59:30,900 --> 06:59:33,780
just like all confusing things

8650
06:59:33,780 --> 06:59:35,940
like the industry gets it wrong or

8651
06:59:35,940 --> 06:59:38,700
different all the time as well so that's

8652
06:59:38,700 --> 06:59:41,160
how it's generally supposed to be but

8653
06:59:41,160 --> 06:59:43,378
that doesn't mean that the random vendor

8654
06:59:43,378 --> 06:59:45,540
that you're talking to or packaging that

8655
06:59:45,540 --> 06:59:47,878
you grab followed the same thing because

8656
06:59:47,878 --> 06:59:49,440
it's just another human at some point

8657
06:59:49,440 --> 06:59:52,680
writing the documentation so you kind of

8658
06:59:52,680 --> 06:59:54,240
have to double check everything if you

8659
06:59:54,240 --> 06:59:56,700
care about the electrical behavior of

8660
06:59:56,700 --> 06:59:58,200
something

8661
06:59:58,200 --> 07:00:00,478
now where do you find read switches what

8662
07:00:00,478 --> 07:00:02,160
where do you think where have you ran

8663
07:00:02,160 --> 07:00:04,020
into read switches before now that you

8664
07:00:04,020 --> 07:00:05,400
know what they are and some of the

8665
07:00:05,400 --> 07:00:07,200
technology that they're been Windows

8666
07:00:07,200 --> 07:00:10,378
sensors Good callback perfect answer 10

8667
07:00:10,378 --> 07:00:14,100
out of 10 would answer that again yeah

8668
07:00:14,100 --> 07:00:16,620
a coffee shop oh yeah sounds like a cool

8669
07:00:16,620 --> 07:00:19,798
coffee shop uh

8670
07:00:19,798 --> 07:00:21,360
did you see the safe here in the coffee

8671
07:00:21,360 --> 07:00:22,978
shop too

8672
07:00:22,978 --> 07:00:24,840
isn't it safe is it safe in the room

8673
07:00:24,840 --> 07:00:27,000
with you all right

8674
07:00:27,000 --> 07:00:28,860
um any other places

8675
07:00:28,860 --> 07:00:30,240
that you've seen it doesn't have to

8676
07:00:30,240 --> 07:00:31,740
necessarily be physical security right

8677
07:00:31,740 --> 07:00:33,600
right

8678
07:00:33,600 --> 07:00:35,638
a donut shops like devices instead of

8679
07:00:35,638 --> 07:00:38,298
places yeah

8680
07:00:41,218 --> 07:00:42,900
interesting

8681
07:00:42,900 --> 07:00:45,540
okay

8682
07:00:45,540 --> 07:00:48,540
was it uh it was a automated uh

8683
07:00:48,540 --> 07:00:52,440
originating machine yeah

8684
07:00:59,058 --> 07:01:03,978
nice yeah anyone else yep

8685
07:01:04,138 --> 07:01:06,000
lock out on a soldering iron oh yeah

8686
07:01:06,000 --> 07:01:07,558
interesting I haven't seen magnetic ones

8687
07:01:07,558 --> 07:01:09,540
but that makes sense isn't isn't the the

8688
07:01:09,540 --> 07:01:12,718
jbc's his contact oh okay yeah

8689
07:01:12,718 --> 07:01:14,700
he has the fancy soldering station I

8690
07:01:14,700 --> 07:01:17,760
have the heiko one yeah but you have

8691
07:01:17,760 --> 07:01:21,900
that scope oh yeah yes anyway uh okay so

8692
07:01:21,900 --> 07:01:24,600
let's play a game does it contain a read

8693
07:01:24,600 --> 07:01:26,040
switch

8694
07:01:26,040 --> 07:01:28,378
yes who says no

8695
07:01:28,378 --> 07:01:31,378
okay yeah we're catching on here

8696
07:01:31,378 --> 07:01:33,958
doesn't contain a read switch

8697
07:01:33,958 --> 07:01:35,520
probably

8698
07:01:35,520 --> 07:01:37,798
how about this one

8699
07:01:37,798 --> 07:01:39,840
all right how about this one

8700
07:01:39,840 --> 07:01:42,780
yeah yeah okay this guy over here with a

8701
07:01:42,780 --> 07:01:44,840
probably yeah

8702
07:01:44,840 --> 07:01:46,580
maybe

8703
07:01:46,580 --> 07:01:51,558
oh no it depends I'm mostly certain

8704
07:01:51,600 --> 07:01:53,458
could be

8705
07:01:53,458 --> 07:01:55,378
all right

8706
07:01:55,378 --> 07:01:58,558
oh now we're throwing curveballs to you

8707
07:01:58,558 --> 07:02:01,260
this is a

8708
07:02:01,260 --> 07:02:03,718
what do we have here

8709
07:02:03,718 --> 07:02:05,878
we have a widget yeah so these are

8710
07:02:05,878 --> 07:02:08,820
contacts that you press right does it

8711
07:02:08,820 --> 07:02:10,978
contain a read switch

8712
07:02:10,978 --> 07:02:14,340
oh yeah here we go

8713
07:02:14,340 --> 07:02:17,360
does it contain a box

8714
07:02:18,058 --> 07:02:20,400
so we see

8715
07:02:20,400 --> 07:02:23,160
this right here right we see this little

8716
07:02:23,160 --> 07:02:24,200
uh

8717
07:02:24,200 --> 07:02:27,120
dispensing uh switch

8718
07:02:27,120 --> 07:02:30,320
smart I would have uh

8719
07:02:31,920 --> 07:02:35,218
as I awkwardly use a light that is not

8720
07:02:35,218 --> 07:02:37,440
good for this application

8721
07:02:37,440 --> 07:02:39,180
so what we're referring to is this

8722
07:02:39,180 --> 07:02:42,298
little switch right there

8723
07:02:42,298 --> 07:02:44,760
and if you can't tell in the video it is

8724
07:02:44,760 --> 07:02:45,840
a

8725
07:02:45,840 --> 07:02:47,700
kind of spring-loaded plunger looking

8726
07:02:47,700 --> 07:02:49,200
thing

8727
07:02:49,200 --> 07:02:51,120
if we press on it

8728
07:02:51,120 --> 07:02:52,500
right

8729
07:02:52,500 --> 07:02:56,100
but Reed switches are magnetic right so

8730
07:02:56,100 --> 07:03:00,000
what happens if we put a pile of death

8731
07:03:00,000 --> 07:03:03,840
in a metal box is uh is so is this

8732
07:03:03,840 --> 07:03:06,718
yes magnetic read switch or no

8733
07:03:06,718 --> 07:03:08,878
no

8734
07:03:08,878 --> 07:03:10,620
well

8735
07:03:10,620 --> 07:03:12,958
so no because most of the time you're

8736
07:03:12,958 --> 07:03:13,860
dealing when you're dealing with a

8737
07:03:13,860 --> 07:03:15,900
momentary switch it is indeed just

8738
07:03:15,900 --> 07:03:19,080
electrical contacts however

8739
07:03:19,080 --> 07:03:21,420
what's interesting here is because of

8740
07:03:21,420 --> 07:03:23,160
the reliability

8741
07:03:23,160 --> 07:03:26,280
you hate this demo use weaker magnets

8742
07:03:26,280 --> 07:03:28,760
oh

8743
07:03:31,260 --> 07:03:33,420
as he grabs the ones that peel your

8744
07:03:33,420 --> 07:03:35,718
fingers like grapes

8745
07:03:35,718 --> 07:03:38,458
you can just use the weaker magnets I

8746
07:03:38,458 --> 07:03:40,680
forgot about them because of that so

8747
07:03:40,680 --> 07:03:42,540
remember that magnetic read switches are

8748
07:03:42,540 --> 07:03:45,180
what cheap and reliable like because

8749
07:03:45,180 --> 07:03:47,700
it's in a sealed vial it never oxidizes

8750
07:03:47,700 --> 07:03:49,798
so what's going on in a lot of these

8751
07:03:49,798 --> 07:03:52,320
plunger style applications is there is

8752
07:03:52,320 --> 07:03:54,180
actually a little tiny magnet in the top

8753
07:03:54,180 --> 07:03:56,340
of the plunger and a little magnetic

8754
07:03:56,340 --> 07:03:58,680
Reed switch in the bottom and so it is

8755
07:03:58,680 --> 07:04:00,240
actually a magnetic create switch it's

8756
07:04:00,240 --> 07:04:03,478
just all in one module uh and those are

8757
07:04:03,478 --> 07:04:06,540
very reliable right you can cycle those

8758
07:04:06,540 --> 07:04:08,458
thousands of times thousands and

8759
07:04:08,458 --> 07:04:10,080
thousands of times and there'll be no

8760
07:04:10,080 --> 07:04:12,120
degradation and you can tell we have the

8761
07:04:12,120 --> 07:04:14,878
magnet it gets closer and on our volt

8762
07:04:14,878 --> 07:04:16,558
meter it's shorting out right so it's

8763
07:04:16,558 --> 07:04:18,958
making contact without pressing it we

8764
07:04:18,958 --> 07:04:20,580
can press it they do the same thing or

8765
07:04:20,580 --> 07:04:22,680
we could just move the magnet there now

8766
07:04:22,680 --> 07:04:24,180
why don't we see that more often than

8767
07:04:24,180 --> 07:04:25,920
more things because it's it can only

8768
07:04:25,920 --> 07:04:28,320
carry a very low amount of current right

8769
07:04:28,320 --> 07:04:31,080
if we're just sensing like if a small

8770
07:04:31,080 --> 07:04:32,700
amount of current is able to flow

8771
07:04:32,700 --> 07:04:36,058
through a circuit for uh sensor purposes

8772
07:04:36,058 --> 07:04:38,218
that's not a big deal but if you want to

8773
07:04:38,218 --> 07:04:39,840
start using it for like lights or

8774
07:04:39,840 --> 07:04:41,700
appliances you can't do that it just

8775
07:04:41,700 --> 07:04:44,958
won't be able to carry that current

8776
07:04:45,360 --> 07:04:49,020
so we do now know this is this has a

8777
07:04:49,020 --> 07:04:51,298
read switch in it how about this does

8778
07:04:51,298 --> 07:04:53,280
this have a read switch in it

8779
07:04:53,280 --> 07:04:56,340
maybe yeah possibly right

8780
07:04:56,340 --> 07:05:00,058
yes it has a read switch in it right

8781
07:05:00,058 --> 07:05:01,920
um it looks like a bolt this would be

8782
07:05:01,920 --> 07:05:04,798
used more in a industrial setting not

8783
07:05:04,798 --> 07:05:06,840
necessarily for physical security in any

8784
07:05:06,840 --> 07:05:08,218
capacity

8785
07:05:08,218 --> 07:05:09,900
um I mean I guess if you wanted to have

8786
07:05:09,900 --> 07:05:12,058
a very covert looking uh switch

8787
07:05:12,058 --> 07:05:15,000
somewhere this could work but you can

8788
07:05:15,000 --> 07:05:16,920
install this in something that you need

8789
07:05:16,920 --> 07:05:18,780
that has like a belt on it right let's

8790
07:05:18,780 --> 07:05:22,320
say a Your you have a you know an RC

8791
07:05:22,320 --> 07:05:25,260
tank right and it has you want to see

8792
07:05:25,260 --> 07:05:27,540
how fast it's going you can determine

8793
07:05:27,540 --> 07:05:28,978
that speed by getting the length of the

8794
07:05:28,978 --> 07:05:30,240
track and putting a sensor on it and

8795
07:05:30,240 --> 07:05:31,920
then every single time that magnet pass

8796
07:05:31,920 --> 07:05:34,500
or the magnet passes the sensor

8797
07:05:34,500 --> 07:05:36,180
um it will you know be able to help you

8798
07:05:36,180 --> 07:05:38,100
with that yes

8799
07:05:38,100 --> 07:05:41,420
nation is the full X

8800
07:05:41,458 --> 07:05:43,558
actually no

8801
07:05:43,558 --> 07:05:46,920
it is just their to look like a sensor

8802
07:05:46,920 --> 07:05:49,020
it has zero structural Integrity most

8803
07:05:49,020 --> 07:05:50,878
that bolt is hollowed out and filled

8804
07:05:50,878 --> 07:05:52,378
with epoxy

8805
07:05:52,378 --> 07:05:53,638
yep

8806
07:05:53,638 --> 07:05:57,260
don't be building houses with this

8807
07:05:57,298 --> 07:05:58,860
all right does it have a reed switch in

8808
07:05:58,860 --> 07:06:00,978
it

8809
07:06:01,200 --> 07:06:03,420
yes right oh we got some answers

8810
07:06:03,420 --> 07:06:06,840
changing yeah good yeah also yes

8811
07:06:06,840 --> 07:06:10,080
which ancient laptop ancient laptop yes

8812
07:06:10,080 --> 07:06:11,100
right

8813
07:06:11,100 --> 07:06:13,378
yep when you close your lid yep right

8814
07:06:13,378 --> 07:06:15,540
newer laptops don't use read switches

8815
07:06:15,540 --> 07:06:18,360
right but they still have a they have a

8816
07:06:18,360 --> 07:06:19,740
different mechanism that works the same

8817
07:06:19,740 --> 07:06:20,760
way

8818
07:06:20,760 --> 07:06:22,200
flip phones

8819
07:06:22,200 --> 07:06:25,798
yeah okay old flip phones I guess I

8820
07:06:25,798 --> 07:06:27,360
don't yeah new I guess there are newer

8821
07:06:27,360 --> 07:06:30,718
flip phones too yes I uh come full

8822
07:06:30,718 --> 07:06:32,458
circle yeah I've uh I've joined the

8823
07:06:32,458 --> 07:06:34,860
Apple team so you know I'd uh I don't

8824
07:06:34,860 --> 07:06:36,600
know anything but just brick phones now

8825
07:06:36,600 --> 07:06:39,120
so we went from don't you hate like

8826
07:06:39,120 --> 07:06:42,120
bending your phone open to wouldn't you

8827
07:06:42,120 --> 07:06:44,820
love to bend your screen again

8828
07:06:44,820 --> 07:06:46,260
cool

8829
07:06:46,260 --> 07:06:48,000
okay how about this does this have a

8830
07:06:48,000 --> 07:06:50,600
read switch in it

8831
07:06:53,940 --> 07:06:56,340
possibly no it's a shower head what the

8832
07:06:56,340 --> 07:06:59,298
[ __ ] come on people

8833
07:07:02,458 --> 07:07:06,180
yeah maybe your shower head has a reed

8834
07:07:06,180 --> 07:07:08,638
switch in it but for us yeah for us

8835
07:07:08,638 --> 07:07:11,000
plebians we do not have that

8836
07:07:11,000 --> 07:07:14,458
detecting unauthorized shower use it's

8837
07:07:14,458 --> 07:07:16,620
critical for when the robber is wearing

8838
07:07:16,620 --> 07:07:20,120
a suit of magnets uh

8839
07:07:21,120 --> 07:07:24,120
so how do we find these things right we

8840
07:07:24,120 --> 07:07:26,700
we know read switches all over the place

8841
07:07:26,700 --> 07:07:29,718
so what do we look for

8842
07:07:29,820 --> 07:07:32,100
are you going to be searching for the

8843
07:07:32,100 --> 07:07:34,558
read switch itself

8844
07:07:34,558 --> 07:07:36,298
now what are you going to be searching

8845
07:07:36,298 --> 07:07:38,218
for

8846
07:07:38,218 --> 07:07:39,840
yeah it's some type of magnetic field

8847
07:07:39,840 --> 07:07:44,100
right it is the magnet not the it's not

8848
07:07:44,100 --> 07:07:46,558
the sensor but it is the object the

8849
07:07:46,558 --> 07:07:48,958
plastic item or the plastic covered item

8850
07:07:48,958 --> 07:07:51,600
in the door that you will be sensing

8851
07:07:51,600 --> 07:07:54,000
right so does that mean that we can

8852
07:07:54,000 --> 07:07:56,940
pinpoint locations for read switches

8853
07:07:56,940 --> 07:07:58,740
and we can get close enough right

8854
07:07:58,740 --> 07:08:00,540
luckily Reed switches are like hand

8855
07:08:00,540 --> 07:08:03,360
grenades so with that we just have to

8856
07:08:03,360 --> 07:08:04,740
end that close enough it's good to be

8857
07:08:04,740 --> 07:08:06,478
close it's it's fine to be close enough

8858
07:08:06,478 --> 07:08:08,580
yeah or horseshoes I think I don't know

8859
07:08:08,580 --> 07:08:10,740
that's the joke I think we can skip over

8860
07:08:10,740 --> 07:08:12,478
it yeah I don't I don't we've lost it

8861
07:08:12,478 --> 07:08:14,280
we've lost it I don't I don't play

8862
07:08:14,280 --> 07:08:16,680
horseshoes

8863
07:08:16,680 --> 07:08:19,260
so it's a magnetic component that is the

8864
07:08:19,260 --> 07:08:22,138
actual item right but it's important to

8865
07:08:22,138 --> 07:08:23,878
detect with care

8866
07:08:23,878 --> 07:08:25,920
and this is because when we introduce

8867
07:08:25,920 --> 07:08:28,440
other magnetic fields into something

8868
07:08:28,440 --> 07:08:30,478
that is supposed to sense something

8869
07:08:30,478 --> 07:08:32,940
where a magnetic field is there we can

8870
07:08:32,940 --> 07:08:35,520
inadvertently cause an alarm

8871
07:08:35,520 --> 07:08:37,558
and this has happened to a few people

8872
07:08:37,558 --> 07:08:39,000
that we know this has happened to us

8873
07:08:39,000 --> 07:08:41,820
many times right it it happens we have

8874
07:08:41,820 --> 07:08:43,860
better ways to sense things

8875
07:08:43,860 --> 07:08:46,320
um so that you don't have to risk that

8876
07:08:46,320 --> 07:08:47,520
and we're going to cover those here in

8877
07:08:47,520 --> 07:08:48,660
one second

8878
07:08:48,660 --> 07:08:50,400
but the first way the simplest way to

8879
07:08:50,400 --> 07:08:51,900
search for things is using a device

8880
07:08:51,900 --> 07:08:54,660
called a search poll right this is a

8881
07:08:54,660 --> 07:08:58,320
gyroscopic or a floating gyroscopic it

8882
07:08:58,320 --> 07:09:00,780
looks gyroscopic just to be clear it is

8883
07:09:00,780 --> 07:09:04,260
not um it uh it floats it lets you point

8884
07:09:04,260 --> 07:09:06,000
for the magnet YouTube comments on the

8885
07:09:06,000 --> 07:09:08,760
stream actually yeah but actually yeah

8886
07:09:08,760 --> 07:09:10,500
sorry yeah

8887
07:09:10,500 --> 07:09:15,058
um the uh the magnet can uh can move and

8888
07:09:15,058 --> 07:09:17,820
360 degree motion though so it can point

8889
07:09:17,820 --> 07:09:20,580
fairly accurately where that particular

8890
07:09:20,580 --> 07:09:22,920
magnet that you're trying to detect is

8891
07:09:22,920 --> 07:09:26,218
it's a super cheap super simple tool uh

8892
07:09:26,218 --> 07:09:27,780
I love that it can point in three

8893
07:09:27,780 --> 07:09:30,840
directions so it kind of tells you both

8894
07:09:30,840 --> 07:09:32,700
the orientation and the position of the

8895
07:09:32,700 --> 07:09:34,080
magnet

8896
07:09:34,080 --> 07:09:35,340
um

8897
07:09:35,340 --> 07:09:39,200
yeah we have a box of goodies

8898
07:09:42,478 --> 07:09:44,820
so if we go

8899
07:09:44,820 --> 07:09:47,760
you can see this device right here when

8900
07:09:47,760 --> 07:09:52,080
I go over to the magnet it points to

8901
07:09:52,080 --> 07:09:55,138
that magnet right so again I'm pointing

8902
07:09:55,138 --> 07:09:57,420
to the sensor it does nothing on the

8903
07:09:57,420 --> 07:10:00,478
sensor if you see it doesn't move

8904
07:10:00,478 --> 07:10:02,400
now if I point to the magnet there's no

8905
07:10:02,400 --> 07:10:04,378
winning sorry there is no winning on

8906
07:10:04,378 --> 07:10:06,540
this nope

8907
07:10:06,540 --> 07:10:08,400
maybe we get closer

8908
07:10:08,400 --> 07:10:10,680
pray to the demo Gods increase our

8909
07:10:10,680 --> 07:10:12,478
sensor size who knows actually closer

8910
07:10:12,478 --> 07:10:15,020
made it worse

8911
07:10:15,540 --> 07:10:18,180
but if you see this this device you can

8912
07:10:18,180 --> 07:10:21,058
see the carriage moving right

8913
07:10:21,058 --> 07:10:24,920
in there it's pointing to that magnet

8914
07:10:26,940 --> 07:10:29,820
here it's more obvious on the side here

8915
07:10:29,820 --> 07:10:31,138
perfect

8916
07:10:31,138 --> 07:10:32,940
see how it's kind of rotating

8917
07:10:32,940 --> 07:10:35,940
as I move down and then the polarity

8918
07:10:35,940 --> 07:10:38,359
switches

8919
07:10:38,700 --> 07:10:40,500
so you can search with that but again

8920
07:10:40,500 --> 07:10:42,600
you're introducing another magnetic

8921
07:10:42,600 --> 07:10:43,860
field while you're doing this even

8922
07:10:43,860 --> 07:10:46,020
though that magnet is super tiny right

8923
07:10:46,020 --> 07:10:48,660
and it's not a powerful magnet you are

8924
07:10:48,660 --> 07:10:51,240
introducing another field

8925
07:10:51,240 --> 07:10:52,920
so if you want to do this without

8926
07:10:52,920 --> 07:10:55,920
introducing such a strong field you can

8927
07:10:55,920 --> 07:10:58,320
use something like

8928
07:10:58,320 --> 07:11:00,780
switch back to the presentation

8929
07:11:00,780 --> 07:11:03,540
a compass right

8930
07:11:03,540 --> 07:11:04,798
now

8931
07:11:04,798 --> 07:11:06,600
when you have a compass like this this

8932
07:11:06,600 --> 07:11:09,420
is the standard recommended Boy Scout

8933
07:11:09,420 --> 07:11:11,100
Compass that's like if you need to go

8934
07:11:11,100 --> 07:11:12,780
buy one that's what you go look for just

8935
07:11:12,780 --> 07:11:14,940
look up Boy Scouts of America Compass

8936
07:11:14,940 --> 07:11:18,240
right and on Amazon and you'll find

8937
07:11:18,240 --> 07:11:20,160
compasses for you know in between 10 to

8938
07:11:20,160 --> 07:11:22,878
14 say all pretty much the same

8939
07:11:22,878 --> 07:11:25,798
you don't keep it in this state

8940
07:11:25,798 --> 07:11:27,660
this looks a little weird especially if

8941
07:11:27,660 --> 07:11:28,860
you're carrying this on you while you're

8942
07:11:28,860 --> 07:11:31,680
on an engagement you can pop that center

8943
07:11:31,680 --> 07:11:33,780
part out so you lose a lot of that

8944
07:11:33,780 --> 07:11:35,580
plastic and then you can actually pop

8945
07:11:35,580 --> 07:11:37,200
the top ring off so it's a little bit

8946
07:11:37,200 --> 07:11:39,298
smaller as well the only thing that you

8947
07:11:39,298 --> 07:11:41,520
care about is the fluid inside it

8948
07:11:41,520 --> 07:11:44,820
and the arm that will point to North so

8949
07:11:44,820 --> 07:11:46,378
it's a little plastic Capsule that's

8950
07:11:46,378 --> 07:11:48,298
sealed so you can pull that out you can

8951
07:11:48,298 --> 07:11:51,360
use it and because it's so weak

8952
07:11:51,360 --> 07:11:53,520
it will still detect other magnetic

8953
07:11:53,520 --> 07:11:56,580
fields because you know earth right but

8954
07:11:56,580 --> 07:12:00,420
it won't trigger accidentally very high

8955
07:12:00,420 --> 07:12:02,520
security sensors and that's always the

8956
07:12:02,520 --> 07:12:04,440
risk right there's there's always a

8957
07:12:04,440 --> 07:12:06,058
gamble with any kind of defeat with any

8958
07:12:06,058 --> 07:12:08,458
kind of security right we're always kind

8959
07:12:08,458 --> 07:12:09,900
of playing this game of like what are

8960
07:12:09,900 --> 07:12:11,820
the chances that we can successfully

8961
07:12:11,820 --> 07:12:14,580
defend and from the attacker's side also

8962
07:12:14,580 --> 07:12:16,558
what are the chances that our attack is

8963
07:12:16,558 --> 07:12:18,478
going to be successful there is not a

8964
07:12:18,478 --> 07:12:20,360
single Hack That is ever truly 100

8965
07:12:20,360 --> 07:12:22,558
there's always something that can go

8966
07:12:22,558 --> 07:12:26,520
wrong and in with this like there's a

8967
07:12:26,520 --> 07:12:28,200
lot of variability so you want to reduce

8968
07:12:28,200 --> 07:12:30,958
that when possible

8969
07:12:30,958 --> 07:12:34,260
and then for the final way that we

8970
07:12:34,260 --> 07:12:35,820
recommend that you look for

8971
07:12:35,820 --> 07:12:37,920
compasses is a and I'm going to mess

8972
07:12:37,920 --> 07:12:40,860
this up don't worry not German uh a

8973
07:12:40,860 --> 07:12:44,100
Gauss meter Gauss Gauss meter here we go

8974
07:12:44,100 --> 07:12:47,239
this is why we're a team

8975
07:12:47,280 --> 07:12:50,940
now a Gauss meter is great because it

8976
07:12:50,940 --> 07:12:53,940
will not introduce a field

8977
07:12:53,940 --> 07:12:57,000
um it can tell you the polarity very

8978
07:12:57,000 --> 07:12:59,280
easily and accurately and it can give

8979
07:12:59,280 --> 07:13:01,860
you a determination of the type of

8980
07:13:01,860 --> 07:13:03,540
magnet that you're going to be trying to

8981
07:13:03,540 --> 07:13:05,878
compete against this will also let you

8982
07:13:05,878 --> 07:13:09,120
know if you can what size of magnet that

8983
07:13:09,120 --> 07:13:11,400
you need to do when it comes to

8984
07:13:11,400 --> 07:13:13,620
defeating higher security sensors as

8985
07:13:13,620 --> 07:13:15,360
well because there's a range that is

8986
07:13:15,360 --> 07:13:16,520
acceptable

8987
07:13:16,520 --> 07:13:19,260
strength it gives you a number that

8988
07:13:19,260 --> 07:13:21,540
shows you the field strength

8989
07:13:21,540 --> 07:13:23,280
we'll pull that one out later yeah at

8990
07:13:23,280 --> 07:13:25,320
the end

8991
07:13:25,320 --> 07:13:29,520
now bypassing these particular sensors

8992
07:13:29,520 --> 07:13:31,740
let's talk about the common commercial

8993
07:13:31,740 --> 07:13:33,660
building read switch right these are

8994
07:13:33,660 --> 07:13:36,180
flush mount sensors in the door if you

8995
07:13:36,180 --> 07:13:37,320
ever look on the side of the door you

8996
07:13:37,320 --> 07:13:39,120
see a little white black gray or brown

8997
07:13:39,120 --> 07:13:41,340
circle usually that's the four most

8998
07:13:41,340 --> 07:13:44,638
common colors you can take a gander that

8999
07:13:44,638 --> 07:13:46,558
that is probably some type a door

9000
07:13:46,558 --> 07:13:49,080
contact sensor right that's the uh

9001
07:13:49,080 --> 07:13:51,120
access control system know that the door

9002
07:13:51,120 --> 07:13:54,660
is open and it lets individually you

9003
07:13:54,660 --> 07:13:56,280
know if that door was not open properly

9004
07:13:56,280 --> 07:13:58,378
it lets the security team know that the

9005
07:13:58,378 --> 07:14:00,600
door was forced open

9006
07:14:00,600 --> 07:14:04,440
there are four what I will call good

9007
07:14:04,440 --> 07:14:06,478
locations to install these

9008
07:14:06,478 --> 07:14:08,400
um uh you can install anywhere you want

9009
07:14:08,400 --> 07:14:09,840
on your door but these are the most

9010
07:14:09,840 --> 07:14:11,340
recommended in fact if you want your

9011
07:14:11,340 --> 07:14:13,500
building to have the hold like a UL

9012
07:14:13,500 --> 07:14:15,718
rating on some parts that are around

9013
07:14:15,718 --> 07:14:18,120
physical security you must install in

9014
07:14:18,120 --> 07:14:20,820
these locations so it's going to be the

9015
07:14:20,820 --> 07:14:22,320
if you look on that door the first

9016
07:14:22,320 --> 07:14:24,958
screen Stars the upper outside on the

9017
07:14:24,958 --> 07:14:27,360
opposite side of the hinges right it

9018
07:14:27,360 --> 07:14:28,620
also you don't have to be on the top of

9019
07:14:28,620 --> 07:14:29,580
the door you can be on the side of the

9020
07:14:29,580 --> 07:14:31,978
door over by the Locking set as well and

9021
07:14:31,978 --> 07:14:34,080
then on the floor as well the problem

9022
07:14:34,080 --> 07:14:36,240
with the on the floor one is depending

9023
07:14:36,240 --> 07:14:38,520
on where you're at if people are bumping

9024
07:14:38,520 --> 07:14:39,900
things in the door frames you can

9025
07:14:39,900 --> 07:14:41,940
actually break the sensor right so it's

9026
07:14:41,940 --> 07:14:43,920
generally not recommended if you have

9027
07:14:43,920 --> 07:14:45,900
rolling carts if you're in a hospital or

9028
07:14:45,900 --> 07:14:48,298
anything like that to have sensors there

9029
07:14:48,298 --> 07:14:49,920
what are some of the things that

9030
07:14:49,920 --> 07:14:51,478
determine where you might have to put a

9031
07:14:51,478 --> 07:14:52,620
sensor

9032
07:14:52,620 --> 07:14:54,600
any thoughts

9033
07:14:54,600 --> 07:14:55,978
what's that

9034
07:14:55,978 --> 07:14:57,780
wiring yeah where's your wire come in

9035
07:14:57,780 --> 07:15:00,478
that's really the main thing is like how

9036
07:15:00,478 --> 07:15:01,978
much of a pain in the butt is it to

9037
07:15:01,978 --> 07:15:04,620
connect a wire to that position in some

9038
07:15:04,620 --> 07:15:05,940
cases it's going to be along the side

9039
07:15:05,940 --> 07:15:07,440
some cases it's going to be along the

9040
07:15:07,440 --> 07:15:10,558
top but the most common location is

9041
07:15:10,558 --> 07:15:12,180
going to be that very top green star

9042
07:15:12,180 --> 07:15:15,240
that you see on the top right side of

9043
07:15:15,240 --> 07:15:17,718
that frame

9044
07:15:17,878 --> 07:15:20,100
so for our first demo let's look at

9045
07:15:20,100 --> 07:15:23,580
bypassing a read switch right let's play

9046
07:15:23,580 --> 07:15:26,040
pray to the demo Gods we have

9047
07:15:26,040 --> 07:15:29,298
five other demos

9048
07:15:29,760 --> 07:15:31,500
we're doing it live

9049
07:15:31,500 --> 07:15:33,000
we also have recordings of some of these

9050
07:15:33,000 --> 07:15:34,978
demos but it's just not as fun recorded

9051
07:15:34,978 --> 07:15:37,260
right you're like is that stage that

9052
07:15:37,260 --> 07:15:41,040
looks like it's stage so

9053
07:15:41,040 --> 07:15:43,260
we hear the annoying sound that means we

9054
07:15:43,260 --> 07:15:46,940
are in the uh safe state in there

9055
07:15:46,940 --> 07:15:49,320
the connection it is a single read

9056
07:15:49,320 --> 07:15:51,240
switch on this particular one

9057
07:15:51,240 --> 07:15:54,260
okay I can switch it maybe

9058
07:15:54,260 --> 07:15:56,700
it's fine okay

9059
07:15:56,700 --> 07:15:58,798
I take away the magnet and the sound

9060
07:15:58,798 --> 07:16:02,160
goes off this is because the sensor in

9061
07:16:02,160 --> 07:16:05,400
there is normally open right we have a

9062
07:16:05,400 --> 07:16:09,058
sensor which in its secure state

9063
07:16:09,058 --> 07:16:10,860
will be closed it will be really

9064
07:16:10,860 --> 07:16:13,558
annoying and then if you take away the

9065
07:16:13,558 --> 07:16:15,718
magnet this is when the alarm or the

9066
07:16:15,718 --> 07:16:17,820
alarm system or the visual access

9067
07:16:17,820 --> 07:16:19,620
control system knows the door has been

9068
07:16:19,620 --> 07:16:22,080
open yeah these are not devices that

9069
07:16:22,080 --> 07:16:24,958
like use packets like they're not

9070
07:16:24,958 --> 07:16:27,840
intelligent it's literally

9071
07:16:27,840 --> 07:16:32,580
a current sensing Loop uh

9072
07:16:33,600 --> 07:16:35,458
so quiet all of a sudden

9073
07:16:35,458 --> 07:16:36,840
huh got quite

9074
07:16:36,840 --> 07:16:39,320
huh

9075
07:16:40,860 --> 07:16:44,820
so now what we have on this is

9076
07:16:44,820 --> 07:16:46,798
um we're going to put this here and

9077
07:16:46,798 --> 07:16:49,340
we're going to introduce a another field

9078
07:16:49,340 --> 07:16:52,798
this is a sensor here we go here is a

9079
07:16:52,798 --> 07:16:55,020
little sleeve that we printed out 3D

9080
07:16:55,020 --> 07:16:57,360
printed we will be releasing these

9081
07:16:57,360 --> 07:16:59,940
designs a little bit later like later

9082
07:16:59,940 --> 07:17:01,920
this week this upcoming week that's

9083
07:17:01,920 --> 07:17:06,180
happening but let me put this on here

9084
07:17:06,180 --> 07:17:09,058
and then take away the magnet right as

9085
07:17:09,058 --> 07:17:10,740
simple as that

9086
07:17:10,740 --> 07:17:13,798
um now this is aligned already I have

9087
07:17:13,798 --> 07:17:16,500
this as the um

9088
07:17:16,500 --> 07:17:19,260
polar aligned as what I have the PA for

9089
07:17:19,260 --> 07:17:21,298
now you wouldn't leave this just 3D

9090
07:17:21,298 --> 07:17:23,760
printed as black you would paint this in

9091
07:17:23,760 --> 07:17:26,700
a silver in a silver type color or

9092
07:17:26,700 --> 07:17:28,440
whatever color the sensor is itself

9093
07:17:28,440 --> 07:17:30,958
right that you're going against so

9094
07:17:30,958 --> 07:17:32,458
um you don't because this is obvious

9095
07:17:32,458 --> 07:17:34,440
right that there is something covering

9096
07:17:34,440 --> 07:17:36,900
that sensor someone even not really

9097
07:17:36,900 --> 07:17:39,540
alert will say hey there is a problem

9098
07:17:39,540 --> 07:17:41,280
here

9099
07:17:41,280 --> 07:17:44,218
um and that is uh in itself something

9100
07:17:44,218 --> 07:17:45,718
you don't want when you're making covert

9101
07:17:45,718 --> 07:17:48,120
or surreptitious entry

9102
07:17:48,120 --> 07:17:49,978
yeah I'll shut that off let me turn that

9103
07:17:49,978 --> 07:17:52,160
off

9104
07:17:54,718 --> 07:17:57,240
all right

9105
07:17:57,240 --> 07:18:00,360
demo success so that is a single read

9106
07:18:00,360 --> 07:18:02,700
switch sensor meaning inside that giant

9107
07:18:02,700 --> 07:18:05,280
block aluminum is just one single read

9108
07:18:05,280 --> 07:18:06,478
switch

9109
07:18:06,478 --> 07:18:09,180
now if you're going against the what as

9110
07:18:09,180 --> 07:18:11,458
we said the common read switch sensor

9111
07:18:11,458 --> 07:18:13,920
that is the flush mount one are you

9112
07:18:13,920 --> 07:18:15,958
going to be 3D printing something you

9113
07:18:15,958 --> 07:18:17,940
could and we do have like you know 3D

9114
07:18:17,940 --> 07:18:19,260
prints that we've done for them before

9115
07:18:19,260 --> 07:18:24,000
uh for it but I am but a simple man and

9116
07:18:24,000 --> 07:18:25,920
I like things that are easily repeatable

9117
07:18:25,920 --> 07:18:28,378
3D prints are easily repeatable but I

9118
07:18:28,378 --> 07:18:30,298
like things that also don't look like

9119
07:18:30,298 --> 07:18:32,280
they're specialized tools and one of

9120
07:18:32,280 --> 07:18:33,478
those items

9121
07:18:33,478 --> 07:18:37,798
is we're going to use tape right

9122
07:18:37,798 --> 07:18:40,320
tell me the difference

9123
07:18:40,320 --> 07:18:42,058
do you notice what's the difference

9124
07:18:42,058 --> 07:18:43,740
between these two photos this one and

9125
07:18:43,740 --> 07:18:45,360
this one

9126
07:18:45,360 --> 07:18:48,740
gaffer tape on what one

9127
07:18:49,260 --> 07:18:51,240
on both of them but who wore it better

9128
07:18:51,240 --> 07:18:52,860
yeah

9129
07:18:52,860 --> 07:18:56,520
right one is obvious right we know that

9130
07:18:56,520 --> 07:18:57,958
that sensor is covered and if you look

9131
07:18:57,958 --> 07:19:00,360
at the sensor right it's that it's a

9132
07:19:00,360 --> 07:19:02,580
like a grayish brown color right the

9133
07:19:02,580 --> 07:19:05,638
designer really was happy that day it's

9134
07:19:05,638 --> 07:19:07,558
actually hard to see it on the screen uh

9135
07:19:07,558 --> 07:19:09,600
you can see how ugly it is on the you

9136
07:19:09,600 --> 07:19:12,000
know on the laptop but if you look at

9137
07:19:12,000 --> 07:19:12,780
this

9138
07:19:12,780 --> 07:19:15,900
you have a black strip of tape and then

9139
07:19:15,900 --> 07:19:17,760
you have a black dot and these dots are

9140
07:19:17,760 --> 07:19:20,340
called sticky dots and

9141
07:19:20,340 --> 07:19:22,200
um it's something I've been using for

9142
07:19:22,200 --> 07:19:24,718
over a decade now

9143
07:19:24,718 --> 07:19:27,298
um the reason why I needed to find

9144
07:19:27,298 --> 07:19:28,978
something for them is we needed to make

9145
07:19:28,978 --> 07:19:31,500
entry into a non-permissible area so

9146
07:19:31,500 --> 07:19:33,298
they were doing like bag scans and items

9147
07:19:33,298 --> 07:19:35,520
so we couldn't just have big magnets

9148
07:19:35,520 --> 07:19:37,200
with us that we could just stick and

9149
07:19:37,200 --> 07:19:38,638
leave on the side of the door it would

9150
07:19:38,638 --> 07:19:41,218
be notice very quickly in this

9151
07:19:41,218 --> 07:19:44,160
environment so these sticky dots they

9152
07:19:44,160 --> 07:19:46,138
just look like tape and then you can

9153
07:19:46,138 --> 07:19:49,260
have smaller magnets uh used with them

9154
07:19:49,260 --> 07:19:52,320
we recommend your magnet be no thicker

9155
07:19:52,320 --> 07:19:56,400
than 1 16 of an inch 1 32 of an inch is

9156
07:19:56,400 --> 07:19:59,298
an ideal size and no bigger than

9157
07:19:59,298 --> 07:20:02,760
three-fourths of an inch in diameter we

9158
07:20:02,760 --> 07:20:07,440
use 5 16 in diameter with a n52 rare

9159
07:20:07,440 --> 07:20:09,478
earth magnet rating on that and the

9160
07:20:09,478 --> 07:20:11,760
reason is because we can quickly scroll

9161
07:20:11,760 --> 07:20:14,700
those away and whatever we're wearing or

9162
07:20:14,700 --> 07:20:17,400
whatever we have on our back and they

9163
07:20:17,400 --> 07:20:19,798
can go through bag scanners and not draw

9164
07:20:19,798 --> 07:20:22,200
attention

9165
07:20:22,200 --> 07:20:25,378
so let's do our second demo right don't

9166
07:20:25,378 --> 07:20:27,420
tase me bro

9167
07:20:27,420 --> 07:20:30,260
um well

9168
07:20:31,740 --> 07:20:33,840
who wants a volunteer to be taped no not

9169
07:20:33,840 --> 07:20:37,218
so we're not we're not

9170
07:20:37,620 --> 07:20:40,760
that's the cactus con after event right

9171
07:20:40,760 --> 07:20:44,298
cactuscon after Dark

9172
07:20:45,780 --> 07:20:48,620
so I have

9173
07:20:51,718 --> 07:20:54,120
my read switch here let me switch back

9174
07:20:54,120 --> 07:20:55,378
to my camera

9175
07:20:55,378 --> 07:20:57,958
I might read switch here well Drew sets

9176
07:20:57,958 --> 07:20:59,940
that up let's remember that what's

9177
07:20:59,940 --> 07:21:02,580
inside of a little uh single read

9178
07:21:02,580 --> 07:21:05,040
contact we have two Thin strips of wire

9179
07:21:05,040 --> 07:21:07,740
that are carrying a very small amount of

9180
07:21:07,740 --> 07:21:09,600
current and I mentioned earlier that was

9181
07:21:09,600 --> 07:21:11,878
very important what happens when you put

9182
07:21:11,878 --> 07:21:15,058
too much current or too high of a

9183
07:21:15,058 --> 07:21:19,080
voltage through a very small wire

9184
07:21:19,080 --> 07:21:21,660
yeah it turned it it what it starts

9185
07:21:21,660 --> 07:21:23,820
welding right so

9186
07:21:23,820 --> 07:21:26,580
what was discovered is that there are

9187
07:21:26,580 --> 07:21:29,040
different circumstances where these Reed

9188
07:21:29,040 --> 07:21:32,100
switches if they were if the door was

9189
07:21:32,100 --> 07:21:35,458
closed and a event happened where it was

9190
07:21:35,458 --> 07:21:38,540
subjected to high voltage for example

9191
07:21:38,540 --> 07:21:41,180
lightning or

9192
07:21:41,180 --> 07:21:44,100
intentional use of like something like a

9193
07:21:44,100 --> 07:21:46,558
you know taser or something similar then

9194
07:21:46,558 --> 07:21:48,298
these contacts were actually weld

9195
07:21:48,298 --> 07:21:51,058
together such that it was basically

9196
07:21:51,058 --> 07:21:53,638
always closed what was normally open

9197
07:21:53,638 --> 07:21:56,638
becomes always closed so that's what

9198
07:21:56,638 --> 07:21:58,320
Drew is going to do a quick demo of here

9199
07:21:58,320 --> 07:22:00,120
I'm just going to show you that is not

9200
07:22:00,120 --> 07:22:01,920
permanently closed yet so I have it

9201
07:22:01,920 --> 07:22:04,138
hooked up I put the magnet in there okay

9202
07:22:04,138 --> 07:22:06,780
then we have that right so now what I'm

9203
07:22:06,780 --> 07:22:09,138
going to do

9204
07:22:10,020 --> 07:22:13,160
a magnet got it no it's fine

9205
07:22:13,680 --> 07:22:16,798
oh yeah you gotta close it

9206
07:22:16,798 --> 07:22:19,378
close so right now the door is closed

9207
07:22:19,378 --> 07:22:23,660
it's in its secured state

9208
07:22:24,000 --> 07:22:26,520
and we're going to simulate a high

9209
07:22:26,520 --> 07:22:29,058
voltage event

9210
07:22:39,298 --> 07:22:42,860
that was so on purpose

9211
07:22:43,500 --> 07:22:46,020
great demo drew the secret demo we told

9212
07:22:46,020 --> 07:22:49,340
no one even ourselves about

9213
07:22:49,500 --> 07:22:52,160
today we learned everything

9214
07:22:52,160 --> 07:22:56,218
uh so thankfully everything recovered

9215
07:22:56,218 --> 07:22:58,740
I don't want to do it again

9216
07:22:58,740 --> 07:23:01,138
so let's see if that worked

9217
07:23:01,138 --> 07:23:03,978
uh

9218
07:23:05,160 --> 07:23:07,558
it did not it did not okay here I will

9219
07:23:07,558 --> 07:23:10,260
let's do it away

9220
07:23:10,260 --> 07:23:13,100
yeah hold it

9221
07:23:13,978 --> 07:23:16,820
I like her

9222
07:23:20,218 --> 07:23:22,378
all right stay away from the mic

9223
07:23:22,378 --> 07:23:26,478
yeah I'll shut off my mic just in case

9224
07:23:28,200 --> 07:23:31,638
this is where we learn about fire

9225
07:23:35,340 --> 07:23:40,218
no you gotta have a bigger Arc yeah

9226
07:23:51,558 --> 07:23:53,700
oh yeah hey

9227
07:23:53,700 --> 07:23:56,120
hey

9228
07:23:59,760 --> 07:24:03,440
that's not even the hard demo

9229
07:24:04,520 --> 07:24:07,020
are you saying thank you to her for

9230
07:24:07,020 --> 07:24:08,120
saying you should hold it

9231
07:24:08,120 --> 07:24:11,400
[Laughter]

9232
07:24:11,400 --> 07:24:12,660
all right

9233
07:24:12,660 --> 07:24:14,820
here

9234
07:24:14,820 --> 07:24:17,280
so magnet orientation right does it does

9235
07:24:17,280 --> 07:24:19,520
it matter on single read switches

9236
07:24:19,520 --> 07:24:22,080
60 of the time it matters all the time

9237
07:24:22,080 --> 07:24:25,138
right uh

9238
07:24:25,138 --> 07:24:27,780
the answer is legitimately sometimes it

9239
07:24:27,780 --> 07:24:29,458
matters if you have a strong enough

9240
07:24:29,458 --> 07:24:32,940
field and you are going against a single

9241
07:24:32,940 --> 07:24:35,940
read switch you might be able to do it

9242
07:24:35,940 --> 07:24:38,760
and I'm talking you know nine times out

9243
07:24:38,760 --> 07:24:39,958
of ten you're going to be good to go

9244
07:24:39,958 --> 07:24:42,240
right but it's that one time the client

9245
07:24:42,240 --> 07:24:43,500
will remember

9246
07:24:43,500 --> 07:24:45,000
so

9247
07:24:45,000 --> 07:24:47,400
um it does matter heavily when there are

9248
07:24:47,400 --> 07:24:50,040
more than one switch in there so we have

9249
07:24:50,040 --> 07:24:52,740
three switches up on the safe here so

9250
07:24:52,740 --> 07:24:55,260
you have to have everything correctly

9251
07:24:55,260 --> 07:24:58,558
correctly oriented there for that best

9252
07:24:58,558 --> 07:25:01,440
practice be aware of the orientation in

9253
07:25:01,440 --> 07:25:04,138
the polarization and just

9254
07:25:04,138 --> 07:25:07,620
match it with your defeat device just to

9255
07:25:07,620 --> 07:25:10,218
be extra safe

9256
07:25:10,320 --> 07:25:12,620
let's talk about high security sensors

9257
07:25:12,620 --> 07:25:16,500
and indicators this is classified under

9258
07:25:16,500 --> 07:25:17,120
UL

9259
07:25:17,120 --> 07:25:21,240
634 level one level one there's a level

9260
07:25:21,240 --> 07:25:24,120
two which is what I would call and I

9261
07:25:24,120 --> 07:25:25,620
think you would agree legitimate high

9262
07:25:25,620 --> 07:25:29,340
security sensors level one used to be

9263
07:25:29,340 --> 07:25:31,378
the gold standard this is what used to

9264
07:25:31,378 --> 07:25:34,138
be on the doors that held nuclear codes

9265
07:25:34,138 --> 07:25:37,020
this is the sensors that they have you

9266
07:25:37,020 --> 07:25:39,478
know on the coke Vault that actually

9267
07:25:39,478 --> 07:25:41,580
doesn't hold the coke recipe that's held

9268
07:25:41,580 --> 07:25:43,458
on a server if you wanted it basically

9269
07:25:43,458 --> 07:25:45,840
these are standards that are written

9270
07:25:45,840 --> 07:25:49,860
saying if you have a device it has to be

9271
07:25:49,860 --> 07:25:51,420
resistant to the following types of

9272
07:25:51,420 --> 07:25:52,798
attacks and here's how we're going to

9273
07:25:52,798 --> 07:25:56,638
test it it's a very like detailed

9274
07:25:56,638 --> 07:25:59,458
overly specific standard and it's better

9275
07:25:59,458 --> 07:26:02,580
than nothing but it's imperfect so level

9276
07:26:02,580 --> 07:26:05,100
one tries to create some resistance

9277
07:26:05,100 --> 07:26:07,080
against someone just taking a big magnet

9278
07:26:07,080 --> 07:26:09,360
and slapping me on the side uh someone

9279
07:26:09,360 --> 07:26:10,740
trying to defeat it through a couple of

9280
07:26:10,740 --> 07:26:13,020
other methods but it's it's a weaker

9281
07:26:13,020 --> 07:26:16,020
standard and in full transparency I

9282
07:26:16,020 --> 07:26:19,680
don't know if bms's are still compliant

9283
07:26:19,680 --> 07:26:21,180
with level one I have to check the

9284
07:26:21,180 --> 07:26:22,860
current standards yeah I I think they

9285
07:26:22,860 --> 07:26:24,718
are but I thought they might have gone

9286
07:26:24,718 --> 07:26:26,638
out of favor but they used to be at

9287
07:26:26,638 --> 07:26:28,378
least let's see what these type of

9288
07:26:28,378 --> 07:26:30,780
switches look like this is an x-ray of

9289
07:26:30,780 --> 07:26:32,638
one of those switches right what do we

9290
07:26:32,638 --> 07:26:35,400
have we have five Reed switches in this

9291
07:26:35,400 --> 07:26:37,440
particular sensor this is One sensor

9292
07:26:37,440 --> 07:26:39,478
this is that sensor you see on this safe

9293
07:26:39,478 --> 07:26:41,340
this is what it looks like when you

9294
07:26:41,340 --> 07:26:44,280
X-ray it so we have five items that we

9295
07:26:44,280 --> 07:26:47,400
have to defeat with our attack the first

9296
07:26:47,400 --> 07:26:50,160
three are going to be the

9297
07:26:50,160 --> 07:26:53,040
um polary polar sensitive read switches

9298
07:26:53,040 --> 07:26:55,320
in the front right so they're going to

9299
07:26:55,320 --> 07:26:57,120
have different configurations we have

9300
07:26:57,120 --> 07:26:58,740
two poles we have three switches we can

9301
07:26:58,740 --> 07:27:01,320
have a total of whatever right

9302
07:27:01,320 --> 07:27:03,120
um the next one is going to be an

9303
07:27:03,120 --> 07:27:06,420
anti-pry so even if you can defeat those

9304
07:27:06,420 --> 07:27:07,798
three you don't want to be have someone

9305
07:27:07,798 --> 07:27:10,260
take the sensor off and then that fifth

9306
07:27:10,260 --> 07:27:12,660
sensor is going to be anti-tamper which

9307
07:27:12,660 --> 07:27:14,580
is if someone introduces a foreign

9308
07:27:14,580 --> 07:27:17,218
magnetic field it will then still alert

9309
07:27:17,218 --> 07:27:19,920
and say hey someone is tampering with

9310
07:27:19,920 --> 07:27:22,978
this device now getting through all

9311
07:27:22,978 --> 07:27:24,660
these switches by holding five

9312
07:27:24,660 --> 07:27:26,760
individual magnets gets you carpal

9313
07:27:26,760 --> 07:27:29,100
tunnel so

9314
07:27:29,100 --> 07:27:32,280
why not why not uh you know make it

9315
07:27:32,280 --> 07:27:33,900
easier on yourself

9316
07:27:33,900 --> 07:27:36,840
but I talked about these three switches

9317
07:27:36,840 --> 07:27:38,580
here and there are two polarizations

9318
07:27:38,580 --> 07:27:40,080
let's talk about a little bit of dirty

9319
07:27:40,080 --> 07:27:42,840
secret right three polarized magnetic

9320
07:27:42,840 --> 07:27:44,820
sensors with two poles

9321
07:27:44,820 --> 07:27:47,160
and that should get us a possible eight

9322
07:27:47,160 --> 07:27:50,218
combinations right uh two to the power

9323
07:27:50,218 --> 07:27:51,718
of three equals eight right everyone

9324
07:27:51,718 --> 07:27:54,180
agrees I did it out on paper just to

9325
07:27:54,180 --> 07:27:57,478
make sure I wasn't dumb uh it was a

9326
07:27:57,478 --> 07:27:59,520
group activity about an hour before this

9327
07:27:59,520 --> 07:28:02,638
time we struggled yeah just to be honest

9328
07:28:02,638 --> 07:28:03,958
yeah definitely we're on The Struggle

9329
07:28:03,958 --> 07:28:06,058
Bus on that one uh

9330
07:28:06,058 --> 07:28:07,680
um which means we have six usable

9331
07:28:07,680 --> 07:28:09,478
because if you just have every single

9332
07:28:09,478 --> 07:28:11,040
sensor be north north north or south

9333
07:28:11,040 --> 07:28:12,080
South South

9334
07:28:12,080 --> 07:28:15,058
defeats the purpose of this right

9335
07:28:15,058 --> 07:28:16,920
um spoilers there's only two

9336
07:28:16,920 --> 07:28:19,320
combinations that are actually sold as

9337
07:28:19,320 --> 07:28:20,940
far as we know

9338
07:28:20,940 --> 07:28:22,798
um those two combinations is going to be

9339
07:28:22,798 --> 07:28:26,580
north south north and south north south

9340
07:28:26,580 --> 07:28:30,298
so your defeat device when you are

9341
07:28:30,298 --> 07:28:32,700
applying a defeat to these sensors only

9342
07:28:32,700 --> 07:28:34,740
have to contain one of those two

9343
07:28:34,740 --> 07:28:37,620
configurations right so a set of

9344
07:28:37,620 --> 07:28:39,540
carrying six devices with you you now

9345
07:28:39,540 --> 07:28:42,680
only have to carry two

9346
07:28:42,718 --> 07:28:45,360
and what we have is the defeat sleeve

9347
07:28:45,360 --> 07:28:48,840
so the defeat sleeve is uh

9348
07:28:48,840 --> 07:28:51,360
a handy device there are there are

9349
07:28:51,360 --> 07:28:52,620
people who have came up with different

9350
07:28:52,620 --> 07:28:54,798
sleeves I used to make these with

9351
07:28:54,798 --> 07:28:57,058
Plexiglas I would bend it with like fire

9352
07:28:57,058 --> 07:28:58,978
I would then Dremel holes in it put

9353
07:28:58,978 --> 07:29:00,958
magnets in it and it was really

9354
07:29:00,958 --> 07:29:03,240
cumbersome and even then you would have

9355
07:29:03,240 --> 07:29:05,340
to you would have to get it perfect on

9356
07:29:05,340 --> 07:29:06,780
placement

9357
07:29:06,780 --> 07:29:08,878
um because you know the bending by hand

9358
07:29:08,878 --> 07:29:11,100
is imperfect to be clear we're talking

9359
07:29:11,100 --> 07:29:12,840
about gluing thin magnets to thin

9360
07:29:12,840 --> 07:29:14,700
plastic but it sounds cooler if we say

9361
07:29:14,700 --> 07:29:17,280
defeat sleeve that's right yes also

9362
07:29:17,280 --> 07:29:20,700
industry term uh so

9363
07:29:20,700 --> 07:29:22,798
um with this with our new classic

9364
07:29:22,798 --> 07:29:24,478
creation

9365
07:29:24,478 --> 07:29:28,740
um we uh you can't the other magic about

9366
07:29:28,740 --> 07:29:31,558
this is you can't just put three magnets

9367
07:29:31,558 --> 07:29:32,878
in there and then it's going to work

9368
07:29:32,878 --> 07:29:34,740
every single time because we have that

9369
07:29:34,740 --> 07:29:36,600
anti-tamper switch in there right so

9370
07:29:36,600 --> 07:29:38,580
we're introducing a magnetic field but

9371
07:29:38,580 --> 07:29:41,280
we need to make sure that we distort

9372
07:29:41,280 --> 07:29:43,260
that our magnetic field enough to where

9373
07:29:43,260 --> 07:29:46,440
it doesn't go against the uh anti-tamper

9374
07:29:46,440 --> 07:29:49,500
in there so on that we also end inserted

9375
07:29:49,500 --> 07:29:52,200
a very thin piece of stainless steel or

9376
07:29:52,200 --> 07:29:56,218
Steel in there this is not that's not

9377
07:29:56,218 --> 07:29:59,280
the one oh of course these are the ones

9378
07:29:59,280 --> 07:30:01,860
here you go when you're deploying them

9379
07:30:01,860 --> 07:30:03,478
on your site make sure they don't have

9380
07:30:03,478 --> 07:30:05,340
the RTA logo on them

9381
07:30:05,340 --> 07:30:07,740
or do depending on what you're going for

9382
07:30:07,740 --> 07:30:09,058
yeah

9383
07:30:09,058 --> 07:30:11,638
you do you okay

9384
07:30:11,638 --> 07:30:14,820
but let's defeat this safe

9385
07:30:14,820 --> 07:30:20,120
so earlier we attached a a device

9386
07:30:20,120 --> 07:30:22,860
that you saw running

9387
07:30:22,860 --> 07:30:24,718
and that actually happens to be an auto

9388
07:30:24,718 --> 07:30:27,298
dialer so it Brute Force the combination

9389
07:30:27,298 --> 07:30:29,180
at least it claims to have

9390
07:30:29,180 --> 07:30:32,040
and uh yeah it does look like it stopped

9391
07:30:32,040 --> 07:30:34,978
so uh you did first we got it oh yeah

9392
07:30:34,978 --> 07:30:38,478
don't open it don't open it yet

9393
07:30:44,700 --> 07:30:46,260
I'll let me I'm going to repeat it since

9394
07:30:46,260 --> 07:30:48,478
you don't have a mic near you so uh as

9395
07:30:48,478 --> 07:30:50,100
Drew was explaining uh these three

9396
07:30:50,100 --> 07:30:52,558
lights basically are monitoring all

9397
07:30:52,558 --> 07:30:54,958
those different switches inside this

9398
07:30:54,958 --> 07:30:57,420
sensor so in order for it to remain

9399
07:30:57,420 --> 07:31:00,180
secure all three of those need to remain

9400
07:31:00,180 --> 07:31:02,820
the lit they can't change state so

9401
07:31:02,820 --> 07:31:05,400
success in this example is going to look

9402
07:31:05,400 --> 07:31:08,520
like us opening the door and none of

9403
07:31:08,520 --> 07:31:11,280
these lights changing

9404
07:31:11,280 --> 07:31:14,580
so let me put the sensor on it so Drew

9405
07:31:14,580 --> 07:31:16,020
you can see that

9406
07:31:16,020 --> 07:31:18,058
this used to be a problem when you were

9407
07:31:18,058 --> 07:31:19,378
having to do this

9408
07:31:19,378 --> 07:31:22,400
was it as

9409
07:31:22,680 --> 07:31:24,660
and before you get too excited I think

9410
07:31:24,660 --> 07:31:26,820
you did you didn't empty this right I

9411
07:31:26,820 --> 07:31:29,958
did empty yeah sorry

9412
07:31:36,600 --> 07:31:39,680
yep no it's empty

9413
07:31:54,900 --> 07:31:57,740
stabs us

9414
07:31:59,638 --> 07:32:02,360
when we do stuff

9415
07:32:03,200 --> 07:32:04,860
[Music]

9416
07:32:04,860 --> 07:32:08,180
but it looks good doesn't it

9417
07:32:14,280 --> 07:32:16,760
so now

9418
07:32:16,760 --> 07:32:20,218
yeah sorry

9419
07:32:20,218 --> 07:32:23,218
so now we have the sensor on here and oh

9420
07:32:23,218 --> 07:32:24,780
this is the this is the dummy sensor

9421
07:32:24,780 --> 07:32:26,780
don't worry about that one

9422
07:32:26,780 --> 07:32:29,940
now we have the real sensor on here and

9423
07:32:29,940 --> 07:32:32,100
it defeats it while this is open now

9424
07:32:32,100 --> 07:32:34,340
there are two other LEDs on here right

9425
07:32:34,340 --> 07:32:37,978
and uh that is for anti-pry so if I were

9426
07:32:37,978 --> 07:32:39,900
to take this off those LEDs take off

9427
07:32:39,900 --> 07:32:41,400
right and you might be wondering why

9428
07:32:41,400 --> 07:32:43,740
does that matter because one common way

9429
07:32:43,740 --> 07:32:45,718
to defeat this if it is the surface

9430
07:32:45,718 --> 07:32:48,478
mounted sensor like this

9431
07:32:48,478 --> 07:32:50,820
oh no you locked it I sure did oh there

9432
07:32:50,820 --> 07:32:54,718
you go there we go is okay what if

9433
07:32:54,718 --> 07:32:56,878
what if I just move both at the same

9434
07:32:56,878 --> 07:32:58,978
time right so if I were to pry this off

9435
07:32:58,978 --> 07:33:00,360
and then open the door I would just move

9436
07:33:00,360 --> 07:33:02,638
it with the door so to detect that kind

9437
07:33:02,638 --> 07:33:04,378
of manipulation they have an anti-price

9438
07:33:04,378 --> 07:33:07,200
sensor but the way that this is designed

9439
07:33:07,200 --> 07:33:10,260
that gets defeated as well

9440
07:33:10,260 --> 07:33:12,718
now uh yes

9441
07:33:12,718 --> 07:33:15,660
and you can see if we were to pull it

9442
07:33:15,660 --> 07:33:17,520
off if you take it off

9443
07:33:17,520 --> 07:33:18,718
you take it off with that you have to

9444
07:33:18,718 --> 07:33:21,320
add the other magnet

9445
07:33:22,138 --> 07:33:25,138
you have to add this guy

9446
07:33:25,138 --> 07:33:27,540
this is the most difficult demo of all

9447
07:33:27,540 --> 07:33:28,860
that which is why Drew is going to do it

9448
07:33:28,860 --> 07:33:31,160
okay

9449
07:33:35,580 --> 07:33:37,320
you have to use specially designed

9450
07:33:37,320 --> 07:33:38,760
magnets so you can't just have one that

9451
07:33:38,760 --> 07:33:40,138
has like north and south on the bottom

9452
07:33:40,138 --> 07:33:42,058
it has to be a 50 50 split and that is

9453
07:33:42,058 --> 07:33:43,920
called a what is that called I need the

9454
07:33:43,920 --> 07:33:46,280
other one uh

9455
07:33:46,280 --> 07:33:48,660
diametrically polarized yeah he's the

9456
07:33:48,660 --> 07:33:50,280
smart one in the group okay that's why

9457
07:33:50,280 --> 07:33:52,740
he says the words sounds smart I don't

9458
07:33:52,740 --> 07:33:56,100
know all right so I have now put this on

9459
07:33:56,100 --> 07:33:58,340
here

9460
07:34:00,180 --> 07:34:02,878
and we can remove the sensor right

9461
07:34:02,878 --> 07:34:06,478
and if we take this yeah well okay I'm

9462
07:34:06,478 --> 07:34:10,260
sorry I moved I move the sleeve uh but

9463
07:34:10,260 --> 07:34:12,180
if we take this now

9464
07:34:12,180 --> 07:34:15,840
and if we go now I've moved everything

9465
07:34:15,840 --> 07:34:16,798
off

9466
07:34:16,798 --> 07:34:18,360
um you have to be careful of your

9467
07:34:18,360 --> 07:34:20,820
orientation of this and the orientation

9468
07:34:20,820 --> 07:34:22,558
will determine what your orientation of

9469
07:34:22,558 --> 07:34:25,080
these three so if it's South north south

9470
07:34:25,080 --> 07:34:27,000
which this one is then you need the

9471
07:34:27,000 --> 07:34:28,378
north facing the back if it's the

9472
07:34:28,378 --> 07:34:29,700
opposite then you need to sell facing

9473
07:34:29,700 --> 07:34:30,540
the back

9474
07:34:30,540 --> 07:34:32,580
Okay so

9475
07:34:32,580 --> 07:34:35,298
on that

9476
07:34:36,298 --> 07:34:40,340
we only have like two more slides

9477
07:34:41,100 --> 07:34:43,680
these the drawings for these the SEL

9478
07:34:43,680 --> 07:34:45,660
files will be publicly available we're

9479
07:34:45,660 --> 07:34:46,558
going to release all them and we're

9480
07:34:46,558 --> 07:34:47,760
going to tell you what type of magnets

9481
07:34:47,760 --> 07:34:49,798
you need to put in it as well as the

9482
07:34:49,798 --> 07:34:51,840
metal that you need to have on this so

9483
07:34:51,840 --> 07:34:53,878
that you can just a set of it used to be

9484
07:34:53,878 --> 07:34:56,458
a pain to defeat these items uh now it

9485
07:34:56,458 --> 07:34:58,020
literally is you just slap this on and

9486
07:34:58,020 --> 07:35:00,058
it's good to go

9487
07:35:00,058 --> 07:35:02,100
uh response time if you're doing

9488
07:35:02,100 --> 07:35:03,718
research in this you might see that

9489
07:35:03,718 --> 07:35:05,820
there are magnetic flux relations that

9490
07:35:05,820 --> 07:35:09,000
you detect your your alarm panel is not

9491
07:35:09,000 --> 07:35:10,798
going to detect those fluctuations as

9492
07:35:10,798 --> 07:35:13,440
fast right or this talk is not about

9493
07:35:13,440 --> 07:35:16,080
defeating Loops but that is what that is

9494
07:35:16,080 --> 07:35:17,400
about

9495
07:35:17,400 --> 07:35:21,478
so in summary is the world on fire no

9496
07:35:21,478 --> 07:35:23,160
the world's not on fire

9497
07:35:23,160 --> 07:35:25,020
understand the limitations of the

9498
07:35:25,020 --> 07:35:26,580
equipment that you're installing and

9499
07:35:26,580 --> 07:35:29,580
understand that there are other

9500
07:35:29,580 --> 07:35:31,320
technology if you actually do need a

9501
07:35:31,320 --> 07:35:33,718
high security sensor you look for that

9502
07:35:33,718 --> 07:35:37,920
UL 634 level 2 type of sensor right

9503
07:35:37,920 --> 07:35:39,660
thank you for joining us for our talk

come on up

9551
07:48:27,180 --> 07:48:29,180
here

9552
07:48:39,298 --> 07:48:43,520
right I think we're on

9553
07:48:45,718 --> 07:48:48,420
all right you guys welcome to closing

9554
07:48:48,420 --> 07:48:50,580
ceremonies while we're waiting to

9555
07:48:50,580 --> 07:48:52,860
actually officially begin closing

9556
07:48:52,860 --> 07:48:55,798
ceremonies I figure while we're to kill

9557
07:48:55,798 --> 07:48:57,478
some time we have a lot of lost and

9558
07:48:57,478 --> 07:49:00,478
found my

9559
07:49:00,478 --> 07:49:04,798
my favorite is the sock

9560
07:49:04,798 --> 07:49:07,820
yeah okay

9561
07:49:07,978 --> 07:49:10,080
so and I

9562
07:49:10,080 --> 07:49:13,340
I think it's clean

9563
07:49:16,978 --> 07:49:19,680
it's not like I stuck it in my mouth or

9564
07:49:19,680 --> 07:49:21,600
anything

9565
07:49:21,600 --> 07:49:23,700
come on you guys

9566
07:49:23,700 --> 07:49:26,478
thank you

9567
07:49:28,940 --> 07:49:33,478
[Laughter]

9568
07:49:33,478 --> 07:49:36,540
I was gonna say I can smell it

9569
07:49:36,540 --> 07:49:40,080
so and let you know if it's clean but I

9570
07:49:40,080 --> 07:49:42,660
think we might need just a couple more

9571
07:49:42,660 --> 07:49:45,298
minutes but I do appreciate your

9572
07:49:45,298 --> 07:49:48,958
patience and we're gonna do a new raffle

9573
07:49:48,958 --> 07:49:50,580
and we've got a lot of things to raffle

9574
07:49:50,580 --> 07:49:54,020
off a lot of windows

9575
07:49:54,660 --> 07:49:57,660

07:49:58,060 --> 07:50:01,159
[Applause]

9577
07:50:08,878 --> 07:50:11,520
I am not under duress I actually agreed

9578
07:50:11,520 --> 07:50:12,840
to do this

9579
07:50:12,840 --> 07:50:16,878
uh so let's see how it goes

9580
07:50:17,760 --> 07:50:19,920
thank you everyone for coming to

9581
07:50:19,920 --> 07:50:23,600
cactuscon 11.

9582
07:50:26,638 --> 07:50:28,920
I can't clap it's not letting me clap

9583
07:50:28,920 --> 07:50:31,558
but that's the best we can do okay

9584
07:50:31,558 --> 07:50:33,478
uh I want to start off first again by

9585
07:50:33,478 --> 07:50:35,280
thanking everybody for coming uh both

9586
07:50:35,280 --> 07:50:37,138
here in person and online in Discord hey

9587
07:50:37,138 --> 07:50:38,340
everybody hope you all can see how

9588
07:50:38,340 --> 07:50:39,898
ridiculous I look

9589
07:50:39,898 --> 07:50:41,520
um yeah so first thing I want to do is

9590
07:50:41,520 --> 07:50:42,718
uh let's I'm gonna show some pictures

9591
07:50:42,718 --> 07:50:44,280
Let's uh look at some pictures of this

9592
07:50:44,280 --> 07:50:46,200
year uh some of these are from our our

9593
07:50:46,200 --> 07:50:47,458
staff and our volunteers some I

9594
07:50:47,458 --> 07:50:48,660
shamelessly stole from people's Twitter

9595
07:50:48,660 --> 07:50:51,240
so uh if you see a picture I took uh

9596
07:50:51,240 --> 07:50:53,660
thank you

9597
07:50:56,218 --> 07:50:58,798
so this is uh this is Kevin our caxicon

9598
07:50:58,798 --> 07:51:01,740

see oh good okay so well first of all

9763
07:58:09,000 --> 07:58:10,558
some of you all know that we started as

9764
07:58:10,558 --> 07:58:13,138
Phoenix b-sides 2012 I don't have those

9765
07:58:13,138 --> 07:58:14,340
numbers in front of me so this is

9766
07:58:14,340 --> 07:58:16,920
starting in 2013. uh we were at Dave and

9767
07:58:16,920 --> 07:58:20,160
Buster's in Tempe with 205 attendees who

9768
07:58:20,160 --> 07:58:21,420
was there

9769
07:58:21,420 --> 07:58:23,100
nice

9770
07:58:23,100 --> 07:58:26,780
that's almost all of them I think

9771
07:58:26,780 --> 07:58:29,760
2014 at the Crown Plaza San Marcos who

9772
07:58:29,760 --> 07:58:32,120
was there

9773
07:58:32,160 --> 07:58:37,940
awesome 2015 ASU 423 attendees

9774
07:58:39,478 --> 07:58:42,180
Phoenix Convention Center 733 attendees

9775
07:58:42,180 --> 07:58:43,378
this is when it started shaping up

9776
07:58:43,378 --> 07:58:46,020
numbers getting bigger

9777
07:58:46,020 --> 07:58:48,240
all right 2017 is the first year we

9778
07:58:48,240 --> 07:58:52,080
broke a thousand attendees 1126.

9779
07:58:52,080 --> 07:58:55,020
it's a good one 2018 was our first year

9780
07:58:55,020 --> 07:58:59,520
here we had 1342 attendees

9781
07:58:59,520 --> 07:59:02,160
uh 2019 at the Mesa Convention Center

9782
07:59:02,160 --> 07:59:05,580
1312 attendees

9783
07:59:05,580 --> 07:59:08,458
2021 we went virtual those most you all

9784
07:59:08,458 --> 07:59:10,320
probably know we did not do a con in

9785
07:59:10,320 --> 07:59:13,440
2020 uh that was not because of covet it

9786
07:59:13,440 --> 07:59:14,940
was because of our shifting schedule we

9787
07:59:14,940 --> 07:59:16,440
had planned we used to do cons around I

9788
07:59:16,440 --> 07:59:18,240
think November we moved to February so

9789
07:59:18,240 --> 07:59:19,920
we pushed it back and it made it skip a

9790
07:59:19,920 --> 07:59:21,540
year so we can honestly say we were

9791
07:59:21,540 --> 07:59:22,920
probably the only con that didn't have

9792
07:59:22,920 --> 07:59:26,057
to cancel in 2020.

9793
07:59:28,138 --> 07:59:33,978
uh see 2022 at the Delta hotel

9794
07:59:36,360 --> 07:59:39,718
oh I skipped 2021 didn't I oh no yeah uh

9795
07:59:39,718 --> 07:59:42,660
did I say that one 2021 Discord this was

9796
07:59:42,660 --> 07:59:44,040
the year we were completely on Discord

9797
07:59:44,040 --> 07:59:47,700
uh and we had 1 461 virtual attendees

9798
07:59:47,700 --> 07:59:50,100
how many all attended that

9799
07:59:50,100 --> 07:59:51,660
that was a fun one I love that one and

9800
07:59:51,660 --> 07:59:54,058
then yeah the last year at the Delta

9801
07:59:54,058 --> 07:59:56,760
hotel we had 1285 combined attendees

9802
07:59:56,760 --> 07:59:59,520
include around 500 in person and 785 on

9803
07:59:59,520 --> 08:00:01,820
Discord

9804
08:00:02,478 --> 08:00:06,079
can I get a drum roll

9805
08:00:06,898 --> 08:00:11,040
all right so for cactuscon 11 we had 573

9806
08:00:11,040 --> 08:00:12,360
on Discord

9807
08:00:12,360 --> 08:00:14,580
and these numbers are this is 573 people

9808
08:00:14,580 --> 08:00:15,958
who are only on Discord and not here

9809
08:00:15,958 --> 08:00:16,978
because I know a lot of you all were in

9810
08:00:16,978 --> 08:00:19,340
both we had 1

9811
08:00:19,340 --> 08:00:24,138
376 people here in the convention center

9812
08:00:29,040 --> 08:00:32,280
Let's see we had

9813
08:00:32,280 --> 08:00:36,440
where are we at we had one bagpipe band

9814
08:00:38,100 --> 08:00:40,440
oh that was supposed to play why is it

9815
08:00:40,440 --> 08:00:42,540
not playing I gotta use my mouse here

9816
08:00:42,540 --> 08:00:44,740
there we go

9817
08:00:44,740 --> 08:00:48,469
[Applause]

9818
08:00:51,800 --> 08:00:56,059
[Music]

9819
08:01:03,718 --> 08:01:05,040
this is the first time I think we've

9820
08:01:05,040 --> 08:01:08,240
ever read a bagpipe band here

9821
08:01:08,398 --> 08:01:09,780
this might be the first time we've ever

9822
08:01:09,780 --> 08:01:11,760
had live music at cactuscon

9823
08:01:11,760 --> 08:01:13,150
no okay

9824
08:01:13,150 --> 08:01:15,058
[Music]

9825
08:01:15,058 --> 08:01:17,280
all right which brings us to a grand

9826
08:01:17,280 --> 08:01:19,100
total

9827
08:01:19,100 --> 08:01:23,717
1949 attendees for cactuscon 11.

9828
08:01:29,580 --> 08:01:32,100
I stand corrected the in-person numbers

9829
08:01:32,100 --> 08:01:35,600
have been revised upward

9830
08:01:37,580 --> 08:01:41,100
1435 in person which brings us to over 2

9831
08:01:41,100 --> 08:01:44,220
000 total attendees for the first time

9832
08:01:44,220 --> 08:01:47,409
[Applause]

9833
08:01:48,898 --> 08:01:51,420
even just in person this is the largest

9834
08:01:51,420 --> 08:01:54,500
Cactus con we've ever had

9835
08:01:56,398 --> 08:01:57,718
all right but we can't forget our

9836
08:01:57,718 --> 08:01:59,520
Discord folks so some stats from Discord

9837
08:01:59,520 --> 08:02:03,298
or 813 users in the Discord server

9838
08:02:03,298 --> 08:02:06,058
we had eight volunteer moderators

9839
08:02:06,058 --> 08:02:08,398
we had 585 users check in with the bot

9840
08:02:08,398 --> 08:02:10,740
in Discord which is kind of confusing uh

9841
08:02:10,740 --> 08:02:11,940
and sounds like we had a couple hundred

9842
08:02:11,940 --> 08:02:14,160
who are in Virtual linecon which sounds

9843
08:02:14,160 --> 08:02:16,740
boring because there's no open chat and

9844
08:02:16,740 --> 08:02:18,058
virtual icon I don't know what happened

9845
08:02:18,058 --> 08:02:19,820
there uh

9846
08:02:19,820 --> 08:02:22,200
3288 messages were sent in Discord over

9847
08:02:22,200 --> 08:02:24,898
the last two days uh our team fielded 34

9848
08:02:24,898 --> 08:02:28,020
help tickets uh two people tried to send

9849
08:02:28,020 --> 08:02:29,458
the example ticket to the bot to check

9850
08:02:29,458 --> 08:02:31,699
in

9851
08:02:32,760 --> 08:02:34,378
and surprisingly nobody tried to send

9852
08:02:34,378 --> 08:02:36,920
the bot a link

9853
08:02:37,378 --> 08:02:39,420
uh and I did not update this number but

9854
08:02:39,420 --> 08:02:42,600
I believe it was 6 000 lines of code

9855
08:02:42,600 --> 08:02:45,360
that made all of our Bots uh and all of

9856
08:02:45,360 --> 08:02:47,760
our other uh automation that managed

9857
08:02:47,760 --> 08:02:49,260
everything in Discord and also on our

9858
08:02:49,260 --> 08:02:51,420
video streams all that automation so six

9859
08:02:51,420 --> 08:02:53,398
thousand lines of codes between the the

9860
08:02:53,398 --> 08:02:55,860
dev team we have so uh yeah Discord is

9861
08:02:55,860 --> 08:02:58,398
great this year

9862
08:03:01,200 --> 08:03:02,700
and I hope the Discord people are still

9863
08:03:02,700 --> 08:03:03,660
watching because we might have some

9864
08:03:03,660 --> 08:03:05,760
giveaways just for Discord people while

9865
08:03:05,760 --> 08:03:09,058
we're here okay uh okay Cactus Con kids

9866
08:03:09,058 --> 08:03:11,160
who got to experience capsicum kids do

9867
08:03:11,160 --> 08:03:12,540
we have any of the kids in here what'd

9868
08:03:12,540 --> 08:03:14,840
y'all think

9869
08:03:15,298 --> 08:03:17,218
this year for those who don't know we

9870
08:03:17,218 --> 08:03:19,558
always do a amazing event Cactus Con

9871

08:03:21,898 --> 08:03:25,260
Saturdays uh for ages 8 to 18.

9873
08:03:25,260 --> 08:03:26,820
um Kevin is just knocked out of the park

9874
08:03:26,820 --> 08:03:28,740
every year we'd do this we haven't had

9875
08:03:28,740 --> 08:03:29,638
it the last couple years because of

9876
08:03:29,638 --> 08:03:31,620
covid we brought it this back this year

9877
08:03:31,620 --> 08:03:33,240
with a limited event where we had two

9878
08:03:33,240 --> 08:03:34,860

and our speaker operations

9891
08:04:02,100 --> 08:04:03,958

9892
08:04:03,958 --> 08:04:06,298
you off the stage

9893
08:04:06,298 --> 08:04:07,320

9897
08:04:15,000 --> 08:04:16,620
submitting to the cfp and for coming to

9898
08:04:16,620 --> 08:04:18,718
speak we had two awesome Keynotes this

9899
08:04:18,718 --> 08:04:20,700
year Paola shakaria and talked about AI

9900
08:04:20,700 --> 08:04:22,080
something that's obviously changing the

9901
08:04:22,080 --> 08:04:23,878
landscape in which we work and shared de

9902
08:04:23,878 --> 08:04:25,920
grippo gave an amazing keynote today as

9903
08:04:25,920 --> 08:04:26,760
well

9904
08:04:26,760 --> 08:04:30,478
uh so we love numbers around here so uh

9905
08:04:30,478 --> 08:04:33,058
out of the all of the the submissions

9906
08:04:33,058 --> 08:04:35,160
that were put in through sessionize we

9907
08:04:35,160 --> 08:04:38,760
had 111 total submissions uh 66 were

9908
08:04:38,760 --> 08:04:41,100
hour-long talks 26 were the half hour

9909
08:04:41,100 --> 08:04:43,680
talks we had 19 workshops to choose from

9910
08:04:43,680 --> 08:04:47,360
it is very hard

9911
08:04:47,458 --> 08:04:49,320
come here Cactus I was gonna say that's

9912
08:04:49,320 --> 08:04:51,420
in addition to separate call for papers

9913
08:04:51,420 --> 08:04:52,740
by The Villages this does not even

9914
08:04:52,740 --> 08:04:55,260
include the village golfer papers true

9915
08:04:55,260 --> 08:04:58,798
true so it it is so hard to choose it's

9916
08:04:58,798 --> 08:05:00,540
so hard to choose the quality this year

9917
08:05:00,540 --> 08:05:02,638
was just unprecedented and a lot of

9918
08:05:02,638 --> 08:05:04,080
people who were on the cfp review board

9919
08:05:04,080 --> 08:05:06,000
commented on it so you must have all

9920
08:05:06,000 --> 08:05:08,700
watched our talk from last year about

9921
08:05:08,700 --> 08:05:10,920
how to do a good job

9922
08:05:10,920 --> 08:05:14,218
um we accepted 41 talks and workshops

9923
08:05:14,218 --> 08:05:17,280
with 50 total speakers thank you all so

9924
08:05:17,280 --> 08:05:18,840
much

9925
08:05:18,840 --> 08:05:21,298
and we had things split pretty well

9926
08:05:21,298 --> 08:05:23,100
between introductory and intermediate

9927
08:05:23,100 --> 08:05:24,478
levels which is kind of what we're

9928
08:05:24,478 --> 08:05:25,740
hoping for for this Con so that's

9929
08:05:25,740 --> 08:05:26,760
awesome

9930
08:05:26,760 --> 08:05:29,398
I could not or would not want to do this

9931
08:05:29,398 --> 08:05:31,500
without sessionize I have to evangelize

9932
08:05:31,500 --> 08:05:33,840
for a moment this is the platform that

9933
08:05:33,840 --> 08:05:36,718
we use to run our cfp to put together

9934
08:05:36,718 --> 08:05:40,020
the schedule it has apis that fit into

9935
08:05:40,020 --> 08:05:43,798
the Bots that fit into the website that

9936
08:05:43,798 --> 08:05:46,978
hacker tracker ties into as well if you

9937
08:05:46,978 --> 08:05:49,378
need to run a cfp I would very much

9938
08:05:49,378 --> 08:05:51,000
recommend to use sessionize for it

9939
08:05:51,000 --> 08:05:52,020
because it makes your life so much

9940
08:05:52,020 --> 08:05:53,520
easier and it's free because we're a

9941
08:05:53,520 --> 08:05:57,240
free con woohoo uh yeah so I will hand

9942
08:05:57,240 --> 08:06:01,378
this back over to the cactus

9943
08:06:01,378 --> 08:06:03,558
foreign

9944
08:06:07,378 --> 08:06:09,958
and I will hand it over to Mark to talk

9945
08:06:09,958 --> 08:06:12,120
about our badges this year do we have

9946
08:06:12,120 --> 08:06:14,760
Mark to talk about badges

9947
08:06:14,760 --> 08:06:18,079
Mark and Eric perfect

9948
08:06:24,540 --> 08:06:25,978
here's our software developer and his

9949
08:06:25,978 --> 08:06:28,100
assistant

9950
08:06:28,798 --> 08:06:30,540
so let's see I didn't prepare any

9951
08:06:30,540 --> 08:06:32,160
numbers so now I'm feeling like out of

9952
08:06:32,160 --> 08:06:34,440
place uh I was in a talk again just real

9953
08:06:34,440 --> 08:06:36,958
quick this uh this was the idea for the

9954
08:06:36,958 --> 08:06:39,120
badge that started in 2019 I was going

9955
08:06:39,120 --> 08:06:41,700
to build a model home that you could

9956
08:06:41,700 --> 08:06:43,558
take out of the box and use I don't know

9957
08:06:43,558 --> 08:06:45,718
who is disappointed you didn't have that

9958
08:06:45,718 --> 08:06:47,218
much to do with soldering on your badge

9959
08:06:47,218 --> 08:06:48,420
and who loves that it worked out of the

9960
08:06:48,420 --> 08:06:49,978
bag I don't know raise your hand if you

9961
08:06:49,978 --> 08:06:51,420
like that it worked when you turned it

9962
08:06:51,420 --> 08:06:53,218
on

9963
08:06:53,218 --> 08:06:55,260
but we'll see

9964
08:06:55,260 --> 08:06:57,120
um anyhow the model home was a home

9965
08:06:57,120 --> 08:06:59,280
automation theme but uh again this

9966
08:06:59,280 --> 08:07:01,260
started in 2019 when computer chips were

9967
08:07:01,260 --> 08:07:03,000
easy to get the Raspberry Pi was going

9968
08:07:03,000 --> 08:07:04,200
to be really cool there's going to be a

9969
08:07:04,200 --> 08:07:05,940
foundation for home automation and you

9970
08:07:05,940 --> 08:07:07,680
could model this home after your own

9971
08:07:07,680 --> 08:07:10,860
home but this thing was so hard to build

9972
08:07:10,860 --> 08:07:13,260
every time I would do a design and place

9973
08:07:13,260 --> 08:07:15,540
an order that chip was out of stock so I

9974
08:07:15,540 --> 08:07:17,458
had research and there's two million of

9975
08:07:17,458 --> 08:07:18,958
this chip I'm going to redesign with

9976
08:07:18,958 --> 08:07:21,180
this chip I'll finish in a week it takes

9977
08:07:21,180 --> 08:07:22,320
three weeks when you think it's gonna

9978
08:07:22,320 --> 08:07:24,298
take a week and that chip would be out

9979
08:07:24,298 --> 08:07:25,620
of stock and this happened like five

9980
08:07:25,620 --> 08:07:27,660
times before I told the board guys I

9981
08:07:27,660 --> 08:07:28,920
don't know that we can build the badges

9982
08:07:28,920 --> 08:07:31,680
it's just not possible and was asked to

9983
08:07:31,680 --> 08:07:33,120
reach out to badge Pirates I met those

9984
08:07:33,120 --> 08:07:35,100
guys at Defcon shout out to badge

9985
08:07:35,100 --> 08:07:36,898
Pirates they were they came here on

9986
08:07:36,898 --> 08:07:39,478
their own dime to help us out uh We've

9987
08:07:39,478 --> 08:07:41,218
fixed our problems have supported us all

9988
08:07:41,218 --> 08:07:43,080
the way we've collaborated to get this

9989
08:07:43,080 --> 08:07:45,000
done and they're responsible for getting

9990
08:07:45,000 --> 08:07:47,100
the hardware done which is beautiful to

9991
08:07:47,100 --> 08:07:48,780
work on that and then of course it's all

9992
08:07:48,780 --> 08:07:51,420
about the software right so our youngest

9993
08:07:51,420 --> 08:07:52,920
software developer here wrote a couple

9994
08:07:52,920 --> 08:07:55,920
lines around code and charged what 450

9995
08:07:55,920 --> 08:07:57,840
batteries put batteries in a charger

9996
08:07:57,840 --> 08:07:59,340
waited for the green light swap the

9997
08:07:59,340 --> 08:08:01,500
batteries out half hour battery like

9998
08:08:01,500 --> 08:08:04,680
lots of batteries hard worker up till 2

9999
08:08:04,680 --> 08:08:06,000
am in the morning or whatever on

10000
08:08:06,000 --> 08:08:07,700
Thursday

10001
08:08:07,700 --> 08:08:11,820
or whatever but uh over to uh software

10002
08:08:11,820 --> 08:08:13,260
I'll just speak quickly about software

10003
08:08:13,260 --> 08:08:14,100
Mark

10004
08:08:14,100 --> 08:08:15,420
um help program some of this offers for

10005
08:08:15,420 --> 08:08:18,298
the badge and uses it uh we built using

10006
08:08:18,298 --> 08:08:21,958
some Services called mqtt that allows a

10007
08:08:21,958 --> 08:08:24,058
message to be transmitted just about

10008
08:08:24,058 --> 08:08:25,398
anywhere in the world almost

10009
08:08:25,398 --> 08:08:27,780
instantaneously then sent back to the

10010
08:08:27,780 --> 08:08:30,420
badges like we posted Eric posted a

10011
08:08:30,420 --> 08:08:32,760
video of hitting the button you could be

10012
08:08:32,760 --> 08:08:35,458
in Singapore right now hit the button it

10013
08:08:35,458 --> 08:08:37,378
lights up oh yeah turn your badge on

10014
08:08:37,378 --> 08:08:38,520
yeah yeah you have a badge turn it on

10015
08:08:38,520 --> 08:08:40,020
right now

10016
08:08:40,020 --> 08:08:42,058
if you saw batteries

10017
08:08:42,058 --> 08:08:44,100
we'll wait for it to reset and then uh

10018
08:08:44,100 --> 08:08:45,298
it is

10019
08:08:45,298 --> 08:08:48,120
nearly instantaneous party mode

10020
08:08:48,120 --> 08:08:49,558
about a hundred

10021
08:08:49,558 --> 08:08:52,920
bytes of Json went to U.S West AWS Us

10022
08:08:52,920 --> 08:08:54,478
West in Virginia and then came right

10023
08:08:54,478 --> 08:08:57,240
back to all your badges and

10024
08:08:57,240 --> 08:09:00,360
that fast so or you can hack the

10025
08:09:00,360 --> 08:09:01,798
platform

10026
08:09:01,798 --> 08:09:04,500
yeah we left some open spots or some

10027
08:09:04,500 --> 08:09:06,120
open vulnerabilities in the software

10028
08:09:06,120 --> 08:09:07,680
that a few folks found if you noticed

10029
08:09:07,680 --> 08:09:08,820
your badge was acting a little weird

10030
08:09:08,820 --> 08:09:09,958
earlier today that's because someone

10031
08:09:09,958 --> 08:09:12,440
found it

10032
08:09:12,958 --> 08:09:14,638
how long are we leaving the servers up

10033
08:09:14,638 --> 08:09:16,040
on the back end

10034
08:09:16,040 --> 08:09:19,378
uh do you want to pay for it I will

10035
08:09:19,378 --> 08:09:21,718
defer to uh

10036
08:09:21,718 --> 08:09:23,638
a couple weeks

10037
08:09:23,638 --> 08:09:25,978
we'll work it out there you go a couple

10038
08:09:25,978 --> 08:09:28,397
weeks

10039
08:09:33,180 --> 08:09:35,958
source code to the badges

10040
08:09:36,660 --> 08:09:39,240
of the mic so um as soon as Skyler

10041
08:09:39,240 --> 08:09:41,280
toggles the security on that I think

10042
08:09:41,280 --> 08:09:42,958
that repo will be available that'll

10043
08:09:42,958 --> 08:09:44,760
cover all the software we've got

10044
08:09:44,760 --> 08:09:46,138
terraform code that covers all the

10045
08:09:46,138 --> 08:09:48,000
infrastructure registration server you

10046
08:09:48,000 --> 08:09:49,860
can understand how security inserts and

10047
08:09:49,860 --> 08:09:51,660
all that was put together and maybe find

10048
08:09:51,660 --> 08:09:53,760
our holes if you look at the source and

10049
08:09:53,760 --> 08:09:56,160
we'll get the hardware designs on that

10050
08:09:56,160 --> 08:09:58,080
same repo probably in a hardware folder

10051
08:09:58,080 --> 08:10:00,298
as fast as we can coordinate make sure

10052
08:10:00,298 --> 08:10:03,739
we're uploading the most recent version

10053
08:10:04,440 --> 08:10:06,660
um before you leave the con if you want

10054
08:10:06,660 --> 08:10:09,420
the very latest software on your badge

10055
08:10:09,420 --> 08:10:12,180
I'll cover that real quick if you uh if

10056
08:10:12,180 --> 08:10:15,898
you tap the reset button on your badge

10057
08:10:15,898 --> 08:10:18,298
and about a half second later hold

10058
08:10:18,298 --> 08:10:19,860
the button the boot Button on the other

10059
08:10:19,860 --> 08:10:22,978
side until the green LED glows on the

10060
08:10:22,978 --> 08:10:24,840
left eye

10061
08:10:24,840 --> 08:10:26,218
we'll see if we can crash the update

10062
08:10:26,218 --> 08:10:28,620
server

10063
08:10:28,620 --> 08:10:30,660
that will verify whether you've got the

10064
08:10:30,660 --> 08:10:32,520
very latest firmware reflash your badge

10065
08:10:32,520 --> 08:10:34,138
you'll see both LEDs

10066
08:10:34,138 --> 08:10:35,638
blink a little bit and then you'll leave

10067
08:10:35,638 --> 08:10:37,558
the con with the the very very latest I

10068
08:10:37,558 --> 08:10:40,200
don't know when our last updates were

10069
08:10:40,200 --> 08:10:41,940
Carter's badge is updating he got the

10070
08:10:41,940 --> 08:10:43,200
green light I probably killed my battery

10071
08:10:43,200 --> 08:10:45,120
or killed it by bouncing it on all the

10072
08:10:45,120 --> 08:10:46,378
other

10073
08:10:46,378 --> 08:10:49,440
badges but um if you have any ideas for

10074
08:10:49,440 --> 08:10:52,020
future badges hunt me down Eric is the

10075
08:10:52,020 --> 08:10:54,360
handle might be spelled with a c also I

10076
08:10:54,360 --> 08:10:55,860
don't crash airplanes I might crash your

10077
08:10:55,860 --> 08:10:58,378
computer I live in Minneapolis I'm also

10078
08:10:58,378 --> 08:10:59,940
here in Phoenix but would love to

10079
08:10:59,940 --> 08:11:01,978
collaborate people have great ideas and

10080
08:11:01,978 --> 08:11:04,620
we'll integrate that into the theme of

10081
08:11:04,620 --> 08:11:06,240
the batch next year

10082

all right next I'm going to call up

10241
08:19:02,040 --> 08:19:03,540
Andrew to are you going to talk from

10242
08:19:03,540 --> 08:19:05,458
there are you coming up yeah I'm just

10243
08:19:05,458 --> 08:19:06,660
going to come up talk about our

10244
08:19:06,660 --> 08:19:09,200
financials

10245
08:19:12,058 --> 08:19:14,820
it's on it's on do I have to press

10246
08:19:14,820 --> 08:19:16,500
buttons

10247
08:19:16,500 --> 08:19:17,700
hello

10248
08:19:17,700 --> 08:19:19,458
oh look the pie chart looks pretty good

10249
08:19:19,458 --> 08:19:21,718
uh for the folks who don't know me I'm

10250
08:19:21,718 --> 08:19:23,760
Andrew I'm on the board I helped start

10251
08:19:23,760 --> 08:19:27,298
this several years ago in uh the pathway

10252
08:19:27,298 --> 08:19:29,398
that we were talking about I've kind of

10253
08:19:29,398 --> 08:19:31,378
slowly surely taken on less and less

10254
08:19:31,378 --> 08:19:33,360
responsibility here in the conference

10255
08:19:33,360 --> 08:19:36,600
and so now my job is to make sure people

10256
08:19:36,600 --> 08:19:38,878
don't spend too much money because we

10257
08:19:38,878 --> 08:19:40,020
have to have money to spend it

10258
08:19:40,020 --> 08:19:41,820
apparently whoops

10259
08:19:41,820 --> 08:19:42,660
um

10260
08:19:42,660 --> 08:19:45,718
cactuscon is a non-profit nobody is

10261
08:19:45,718 --> 08:19:47,218
doing this because we're looking to make

10262
08:19:47,218 --> 08:19:50,100
money we're not trying to uh you know

10263
08:19:50,100 --> 08:19:51,898
get rich quick and whatever this really

10264
08:19:51,898 --> 08:19:54,000
is all about the Arizona community we

10265
08:19:54,000 --> 08:19:55,680
keep nothing as Christine said before

10266
08:19:55,680 --> 08:19:57,898
we're all volunteers and in anything

10267
08:19:57,898 --> 08:20:00,420
that we get goes directly into the

10268
08:20:00,420 --> 08:20:02,760
conference or it goes to sort of prepay

10269
08:20:02,760 --> 08:20:04,680
to get us into the next venue for the

10270
08:20:04,680 --> 08:20:06,840
next year and it's sort of brought over

10271
08:20:06,840 --> 08:20:09,360
and so we take a little bit of time to

10272
08:20:09,360 --> 08:20:11,040
kind of work our way backwards and just

10273
08:20:11,040 --> 08:20:13,320
sort of share some of the financials so

10274
08:20:13,320 --> 08:20:15,420
you can kind of see what it takes to put

10275
08:20:15,420 --> 08:20:17,840
something kind of like this together

10276
08:20:17,840 --> 08:20:20,520
at a high level we've had an amazing

10277
08:20:20,520 --> 08:20:22,920
amount of support from sponsors and

10278
08:20:22,920 --> 08:20:25,920
partners this year in general as you can

10279
08:20:25,920 --> 08:20:27,600
see kind of on the board we've had a lot

10280
08:20:27,600 --> 08:20:29,040
of new names we have a lot of old names

10281
08:20:29,040 --> 08:20:31,798
we've had Partners who've been with us

10282
08:20:31,798 --> 08:20:33,780
almost literally since the beginning of

10283
08:20:33,780 --> 08:20:36,240
cactuscon I think stack and Lou now

10284
08:20:36,240 --> 08:20:38,100
Bishop fox has actually been the one

10285
08:20:38,100 --> 08:20:39,718
that's been consistently every single

10286
08:20:39,718 --> 08:20:41,520
year we've held it has helped sponsor

10287
08:20:41,520 --> 08:20:44,160
and we've helped us grow to kind of

10288
08:20:44,160 --> 08:20:45,898
where we are and so with that we raised

10289
08:20:45,898 --> 08:20:49,558
88 000 this year from just sponsors

10290
08:20:49,558 --> 08:20:51,718
Partnerships in the community here in

10291
08:20:51,718 --> 08:20:53,458
Arizona so big thank you to them of

10292
08:20:53,458 --> 08:20:55,579
course

10293
08:21:00,360 --> 08:21:03,120
we we then kind of introduced this idea

10294
08:21:03,120 --> 08:21:04,620
of community sponsors because people

10295
08:21:04,620 --> 08:21:06,840
kept coming to us and say look I don't

10296
08:21:06,840 --> 08:21:08,458
have thousands of dollars but I want to

10297
08:21:08,458 --> 08:21:09,958
put something into the conference I want

10298
08:21:09,958 --> 08:21:11,820
to support it and so we came up with

10299
08:21:11,820 --> 08:21:13,740
Community sponsors and so this is a

10300
08:21:13,740 --> 08:21:16,320
completely optional nobody's forcing

10301
08:21:16,320 --> 08:21:18,298
anyone to do this way just to support

10302
08:21:18,298 --> 08:21:21,058
the conference and it typically kind of

10303
08:21:21,058 --> 08:21:22,740
comes with like a shirt or in some cases

10304
08:21:22,740 --> 08:21:24,360
in the past it's come with badges things

10305
08:21:24,360 --> 08:21:27,360
like that this year we raised almost

10306
08:21:27,360 --> 08:21:29,340
three thousand dollars just from the

10307
08:21:29,340 --> 08:21:31,500
community sponsors alone so what a

10308
08:21:31,500 --> 08:21:33,420
fantastic support for the people who

10309
08:21:33,420 --> 08:21:34,740
were able to jump in and help us out

10310
08:21:34,740 --> 08:21:37,100
with that

10311
08:21:40,740 --> 08:21:43,080
and then and then finally we sell things

10312
08:21:43,080 --> 08:21:45,058
right we sell the shirts and we sell

10313
08:21:45,058 --> 08:21:47,100
some of the badges this year and we have

10314
08:21:47,100 --> 08:21:48,840
some stuff that we give away come from

10315
08:21:48,840 --> 08:21:51,120
that end and so with that

10316
08:21:51,120 --> 08:21:53,280
um and this is just the online sales I

10317
08:21:53,280 --> 08:21:55,378
actually haven't counted the money in

10318
08:21:55,378 --> 08:21:58,200
cash in person yet but we've done almost

10319
08:21:58,200 --> 08:22:00,420
thirteen thousand dollars and just sort

10320
08:22:00,420 --> 08:22:03,120
of Swag this year for badges shirts Etc

10321
08:22:03,120 --> 08:22:05,340
which is which is fantastic so the total

10322
08:22:05,340 --> 08:22:06,478
is over a little bit over a hundred and

10323
08:22:06,478 --> 08:22:08,820
three thousand dollars uh in earnings

10324
08:22:08,820 --> 08:22:11,580
kind of for this year uh of which we

10325
08:22:11,580 --> 08:22:13,500
basically spent as you can see almost

10326
08:22:13,500 --> 08:22:15,478
all of it right

10327
08:22:15,478 --> 08:22:17,340
um to put in a conference like this

10328
08:22:17,340 --> 08:22:19,320
obviously the biggest expense is the

10329
08:22:19,320 --> 08:22:22,138
venue and and the AV Equipment as we

10330
08:22:22,138 --> 08:22:24,120
started adding in the streaming and

10331
08:22:24,120 --> 08:22:25,740
bringing this to a bigger broader

10332
08:22:25,740 --> 08:22:28,520
digital audience that comes at a cost

10333
08:22:28,520 --> 08:22:31,798
and uh that's the single largest expense

10334
08:22:31,798 --> 08:22:35,280
for for this year kind of coming into it

10335
08:22:35,280 --> 08:22:37,378
um swag and merch obviously we get it

10336
08:22:37,378 --> 08:22:39,120
and we sell it but there's an upfront

10337
08:22:39,120 --> 08:22:41,520
cost and so a little bit about 8 000

10338
08:22:41,520 --> 08:22:44,700
kind of coming into it art and signage

10339
08:22:44,700 --> 08:22:46,378
we spend a lot of time with our artists

10340
08:22:46,378 --> 08:22:48,718
we bring in a new artist every year and

10341
08:22:48,718 --> 08:22:50,100
we have a theme it's like the first

10342
08:22:50,100 --> 08:22:51,540
thing we're going to talk about as soon

10343
08:22:51,540 --> 08:22:53,218
as we get back together is what do we

10344
08:22:53,218 --> 08:22:55,020
want to do for next year and then we

10345
08:22:55,020 --> 08:22:57,180
start to look for an artist sometimes

10346
08:22:57,180 --> 08:22:59,340
local sometimes not to put something

10347
08:22:59,340 --> 08:23:01,080
together and make that the theme for the

10348
08:23:01,080 --> 08:23:02,700
year and it's it's been great I mean the

10349
08:23:02,700 --> 08:23:04,680
art this year is so fantastic I think

10350
08:23:04,680 --> 08:23:07,020
this is great thanks to Skyler for kind

10351
08:23:07,020 --> 08:23:09,080
of helping us put that together as well

10352
08:23:09,080 --> 08:23:11,120
arts and science things that sort

10353
08:23:11,120 --> 08:23:13,860
operations is just sort of the things

10354
08:23:13,860 --> 08:23:15,780
that allow us to be here so we bring in

10355
08:23:15,780 --> 08:23:17,520
people we fly them in we put them in

10356
08:23:17,520 --> 08:23:19,558
hotel rooms and more or less this is

10357
08:23:19,558 --> 08:23:21,440
about three thousand dollars this year

10358
08:23:21,440 --> 08:23:24,120
we started we have an accounting slash

10359
08:23:24,120 --> 08:23:27,120
legal fees uh thing that happens and so

10360
08:23:27,120 --> 08:23:28,260
that was a little bit of an expense

10361
08:23:28,260 --> 08:23:29,820
coming into this year and then the

10362
08:23:29,820 --> 08:23:32,218
badges brought us to about ten thousand

10363
08:23:32,218 --> 08:23:33,718
dollars so it looks like we don't have

10364
08:23:33,718 --> 08:23:36,240
any money it's over 98 000 against the

10365
08:23:36,240 --> 08:23:38,340
103 but we actually have money from last

10366
08:23:38,340 --> 08:23:40,320
year that offset it so we're gonna come

10367
08:23:40,320 --> 08:23:42,058
come into the next year probably with

10368
08:23:42,058 --> 08:23:44,040
about thirty thousand I think all said

10369
08:23:44,040 --> 08:23:46,378
and done to prep and start us getting

10370
08:23:46,378 --> 08:23:48,898
ready for the next event so

10371
08:23:48,898 --> 08:23:50,340
um this is just the way that we do it

10372
08:23:50,340 --> 08:23:52,020
it's really difficult to run an all-free

10373
08:23:52,020 --> 08:23:53,878
conference it's difficult to do it all

10374
08:23:53,878 --> 08:23:55,200
with volunteers that's one of the ways

10375
08:23:55,200 --> 08:23:57,180
we make that happen but you know we

10376
08:23:57,180 --> 08:23:58,978
wanted to share this is this is where

10377
08:23:58,978 --> 08:24:00,240
we're at and this is what we do and this

10378
08:24:00,240 --> 08:24:02,040
is how we kind of continue to make make

10379
08:24:02,040 --> 08:24:05,350
this for you all to come so thank you

10380
08:24:05,350 --> 08:24:08,579
[Applause]

10381
08:24:11,218 --> 08:24:13,860

10382
08:24:13,860 --> 08:24:15,298

10386
08:24:20,580 --> 08:24:23,160
all right um I just want to take just

10387
08:24:23,160 --> 08:24:25,200
five seconds to give a shout out to the

10388

steps up uh we have just such a great

10404
08:25:07,138 --> 08:25:10,200
group and I think most of our volunteers

10405
08:25:10,200 --> 08:25:12,840
have been with us a very long time uh

10406
08:25:12,840 --> 08:25:14,280
all the way to I believe we have a

10407
08:25:14,280 --> 08:25:15,718
couple this year who've never been to an

10408

10419

08:25:52,320 --> 08:25:53,700

10422
08:25:53,700 --> 08:25:55,920
without sponsors we had a number of

10423
08:25:55,920 --> 08:25:57,958

10424

10429
08:26:13,500 --> 08:26:15,780
whole idea behind having a partner and

10430
08:26:15,780 --> 08:26:17,398
being a partner with cactuscon is that

10431
08:26:17,398 --> 08:26:19,558
throughout the year we try to maintain a

10432
08:26:19,558 --> 08:26:21,898
partnership instant term partner and so

10433
08:26:21,898 --> 08:26:23,398
we try to have this ongoing

10434
08:26:23,398 --> 08:26:25,920
communication and we are very very

10435

08:45:37,138 --> 08:45:39,478
depending on the course you select so

10876
08:45:39,478 --> 08:45:41,458
there are four or five six day courses

10877
08:45:41,458 --> 08:45:43,500
you can take one of the Sans SEC courses

10878
08:45:43,500 --> 08:45:45,840
a management level course or digital

10879
08:45:45,840 --> 08:45:47,520
forensics and incident response courses

10880
08:45:47,520 --> 08:45:50,340
which I've heard are kind of awesome and

10881
08:45:50,340 --> 08:45:52,798
so this is an on-demand course so the

10882
08:45:52,798 --> 08:45:54,718
heads up is an on-demand course you can

10883
08:45:54,718 --> 08:45:56,940
choose which course you would like

10884
08:45:56,940 --> 08:46:01,520
if you win all right let's do it

10885
08:46:02,040 --> 08:46:04,940
there's a big one

10886
08:46:05,218 --> 08:46:08,700
the value is anywhere from 6500 to 8 500

10887
08:46:08,700 --> 08:46:10,878
bucks

10888
08:46:13,920 --> 08:46:15,478

get a chance to mention her so

10919
08:47:59,430 --> 08:48:02,999
[Applause]

10920
08:48:03,420 --> 08:48:05,160
like she said Christine stepped in last

10921
08:48:05,160 --> 08:48:06,718
