1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,940
round trip time or zero rtt which is a

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:05,160
performance optimization feature and

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:08,880
what that does it enables the client to

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,340
Recon that's reconnecting to a server to

5
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:14,400
be able to send encrypted data uh back

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,379
to the server without need without

7
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:18,480
needing prior interactive handshake so

8
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:19,920
it kind of eliminates that and while

9
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,300
this is a great enhancement for

10
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:24,720
performance and um avoiding latency that

11
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,279
can come that can be used as a

12
00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:28,080
vulnerability if used

13
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,539
um a certain way so how can that be

14
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:33,600
vulnerable well the TLs 1.3 will

15
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,280
generate a new set of keys for each

16
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,040
handshake and the pre-shared key cannot

17
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:39,600
be refreshed without a trip but remember

18
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,540
this is a zero round trip time so when

19
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:44,219
that's when that client sends that

20
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:45,540
packet the server will already

21
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:47,579
authenticate it and if it gets sent

22
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:50,700
through again zero zero handshakes so if

23
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:52,440
it gets sent again or replayed by an

24
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,480
attacker it will be authenticated and

25
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,739
will go through just like an original

26
00:00:55,739 --> 00:00:57,780
request if you haven't already thought

27
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:59,820
about what can go wrong with that

28
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:01,739
um basically one of the main

29
00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:04,080
vulnerabilities on here is that the the

30
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,479
the replay packet will be recognized as

31
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:08,220
the legitimate one and

32
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:09,780
that can be used in a replay attack

33
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:11,159
let's walk through the steps of how that

34
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:13,320
works so hacker intercept initial

35
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:14,880
connection client and server we can

36
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,280
capture that in Wireshark and after that

37
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,880
we um

38
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:22,380
the hacker will replay the initial

39
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:24,360
connection let's say we're making a

40
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,920
purchase buying something at a

41
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,200
restaurant the food the server will

42
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,460
recognize the initial connection as

43
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:31,200
legitimate so at that point we already

44
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,759
know the client we know who it's coming

45
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,799
from it's authenticated if it's coming

46
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:37,740
again we didn't have any around uh any

47
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:39,720
um handshakes on any Ryan trip round

48
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,820
trips so what that means is that once

49
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:43,560
it's sent again the server will be like

50
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:47,340
well I know you so here is the um here's

51
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:49,020
the payment we'll go through again at

52
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:50,460
this point we have a duplicate payment

53
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:53,159
in the system now while that can be used

54
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:55,320
to replace packets and get to what we

55
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,759
want because once we get a duplicate

56
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:59,159
payment we get free food or a duplicate

57
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:01,200
order there are a lot of fraud detection

58
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,180
mechanisms in place especially from

59
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:05,579
financial institutions uh some of them

60
00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:07,079
include duplicate transaction detection

61
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:08,940
so automatically when something with the

62
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:10,679
same exact amount at the same exact time

63
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:13,560
goes through that can just uh disregard

64
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,959
it but sometimes it can be a card

65
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:18,300
verification value tokenization or IP

66
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:20,160
address and geolocation this is actually

67
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,620
an important one because say you're

68
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:24,780
making or a customer is making a

69
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:26,760
purchase at a restaurant in Phoenix the

70
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,500
attacker can be remotely replaying that

71
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,720
attack in Texas that's obviously going

72
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,459
to erase some suspicion and the bank

73
00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:34,319
might just block that because of that

74
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:37,080
discrepancy between the geolocation of

75
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,920
the initial transaction and the replay

76
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,300
the two-factor authentication also

77
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:45,120
includes when the bank will send you a

78
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,680
text message saying hey is this you

79
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,180
trying to authorize this duplicate

80
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:49,019
payment

81
00:02:49,019 --> 00:02:51,000
but um

82
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,400
how do we take all this information and

83
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,019
execute it into getting the free food

84
00:02:55,019 --> 00:02:57,420
which is also our goal first we select a

85
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:59,700
Target restaurant of course we'd want to

86
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,500
select a restaurant that we like

87
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,360
um the food there and also one of those

88
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,400
where you go and pay uh it's a

89
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,840
self-service restaurant where you go and

90
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,580
pay yourself for the food once we do

91
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:10,620
that we start hiking hacking the Wi-Fi

92
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:12,720
such as with the process that Ryan

93
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,700
explained and then we start capturing

94
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:16,140
Network traffic this is not only

95
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:17,879
important to see what's going on but

96
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:19,680
also to kind of make sure that we're on

97
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,440
the right network Wi-Fi network because

98
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,000
sometimes they'll have multiple networks

99
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,260
and we want to make sure we're on the

100
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:27,480
one where the pus is connected to see

101
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:30,480
that as shown on the screenshot we um we

102
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:34,560
saw a clover packet Clover is a part of

103
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,659
the POS terminal system which reads the

104
00:03:36,659 --> 00:03:39,360
card information so once we see that we

105
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,980
know we're on the right Wi-Fi network

106
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:44,940
then we proceed and check out uh what

107
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:46,200
happens next right

108
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,299
okay so eavesdrop's customer name and

109
00:03:48,299 --> 00:03:50,580
number this is the part where we um

110
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:52,440
listen to a customer ordering food we

111
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,879
like that food we listen to their name

112
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:55,260
write it down because we'll need it

113
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:58,920
later then uh once the order uh once we

114
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,480
have captured all those packets in

115
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,940
Wireshark we will have to save them in a

116
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:05,760
new um in a new file or a new PCAT file

117
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,140
the reason why is because we don't want

118
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:08,580
to replay the whole traffic that's been

119
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:12,180
going through between in that Network so

120
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:14,400
we will save that range usually to make

121
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,199
a transaction go through there is not

122
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:18,298
one single packet there's a range of

123
00:04:18,298 --> 00:04:20,279
packets so we can transfer over all

124
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:22,740
those packets into a new into a new file

125
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:25,020
to replay later using TCP root light

126
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:27,000
what that will do is they will allow the

127
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,180
payment to be duplicated and

128
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:32,040
um the order to go through again which

129
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,960
is what we want once that goes through

130
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,460
then they will call the name of the

131
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:38,280
customer that we impersonated and we can

132
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,860
just go collect the food

133
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:43,320
so how did we do like we said our

134
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,479
overall goal was to try this in a home

135
00:04:45,479 --> 00:04:47,520
lab setting get it working and then go

136
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,139
into an actual restaurant and try it out

137
00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:51,960
so at our home lab Wi-Fi worked well

138
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,820
right uh that was all the videos that we

139
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,440
showed you were able to very easily try

140
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,840
it multiple times with success

141
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,400
the POS bypassing was a little bit

142
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,080
harder to test but we were able to find

143
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:03,300
instances of that TLS 1.3 replay attack

144
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:05,040
vulnerability and actually exploit it in

145
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,600
the wild we were not able to actually

146
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,120
test it on an official POS system as

147
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,639
short of creating a fake business and

148
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:13,320
convincing a sales team there's no other

149
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,479
way to ideally get a license and then

150
00:05:15,479 --> 00:05:18,540
test it on a local instance but in

151
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:20,220
theory that means we can get free food

152
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:22,919
now in real life it's never as easy as

153
00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:25,259
it seems and believe it or not not many

154
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:27,360
restaurants are open to the idea of us

155
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,860
going around and poking in their Network

156
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:31,080
to try to find vulnerabilities so at the

157
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,280
end of the day we were only able to get

158
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,139
one restaurant to give us permission and

159
00:05:34,139 --> 00:05:35,940
even then it was a pretty limited scope

160
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:38,400
and timeline that we had so when we did

161
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,740
it wi-fi hacking works well we were able

162
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:43,020
to use Wi-Fi capture a handshake and

163
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:45,180
then we were able to run our customized

164
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:46,740
word list to get the right password

165
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:48,360
which was just the restaurant name

166
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,919
followed by a number

167
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:51,300
then from there we did some more

168
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:52,500
enumeration found some other things that

169
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,120
would be interesting were to be in scope

170
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,520
such as the actual access to the admin

171
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,320
side of the router having a nice little

172
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,940
hint on their password about having two

173
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:01,500
kids so if you did some more osin may

174
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,759
have been able to crack that as well but

175
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:05,100
it was not in scope so

176
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:07,500
what about the POS bypassing well

177
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,300
unfortunately while we were able to

178
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:11,100
confirm we were on the right Network and

179
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:13,860
we found specifically a clover instance

180
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:15,840
packet of being run so we know we're on

181
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,880
the right one we were not able to test

182
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,919
the TLs 1.3 replay vulnerability as

183
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:21,600
during the short time frame that we had

184
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,639
for testing this restaurant we were not

185
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:25,979
aware of it and any other instances of

186
00:06:25,979 --> 00:06:29,220
trying to bypass the POS did fail on RN

187
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:31,620
so while we did not get free food we

188
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:33,419
still have a potential exploit that we

189
00:06:33,419 --> 00:06:34,500
want to be trying and we're going to be

190
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,300
actively trying to utilize in the future

191
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:38,699
with other restaurants that we're still

192
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:39,720
working on trying to get permission to

193
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:42,479
do so legally

194
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:44,580
awesome and that's the wrap regarding

195
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:46,500
our research I'm not sure if we have

196
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:47,819
more time for questions but thanks

197
00:06:47,819 --> 00:06:49,800
everyone for being here we have two

198
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,060
minutes okay we can take a couple

199
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:52,979
questions here uh if we have more

200
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:54,180
questions we'll be hanging out in the

201
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:55,979
hallway or you can ask us on the Discord

202
00:06:55,979 --> 00:06:58,319
Channel as well

203
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:00,979
thanks everyone

204
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:06,659
[Applause]

205
00:08:42,779 --> 00:08:47,600
what's up guys next speaker I think so

206
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,339
yes sir

207
00:08:50,339 --> 00:08:52,080
it's a pretty common name you may want

208
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,860
to drop a last name

209
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:07,560
I was in a group one time where I was

210
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:08,760
the only one there who was the Special

211
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:11,300
Forces

212
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:23,359
like that was the dude's real name

213
00:09:27,899 --> 00:09:30,860
foreign

214
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:55,320
and I go crazy anytime I actually have

215
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,700
to sit in front of a mic instead of

216
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:58,320
being wired up

217
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,600
it's not I said I go crazy anytime I

218
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,860
have to like sit in front of a mic

219
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:04,560
instead of being wired up I've got two

220
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,000
handhelds

221
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,740
no no no it's like karaoke

222
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:14,240
thank you

223
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:46,519
foreign

00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,200
foreign

225
00:13:24,779 --> 00:13:27,019
foreign

226
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:38,880
got it

227
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,940
all right good morning everyone

228
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:44,339
into Maya talk best practices and

229
00:13:44,339 --> 00:13:46,260
Lessons Learned From setting up multiple

230
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:49,320
oscent units that is a big title my name

231
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,660
is Matt Edmondson I just recently

232
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:53,579
retired after over 21 years with federal

233
00:13:53,579 --> 00:13:56,100
law enforcement I have founded multiple

234
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:57,839
osync units for the United States

235
00:13:57,839 --> 00:13:59,519
government both in the Tactical level

236
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:01,920
and at the headquarters level I am the

237
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,899
Sands instructor and also the author of

238
00:14:03,899 --> 00:14:08,339
the new Sans SEC 497 oscent course

239
00:14:08,339 --> 00:14:10,079
are you back

240
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:11,579
consulted with a bunch of multiple

241
00:14:11,579 --> 00:14:13,560
Fortune 500 companies spoke a black cat

242
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:16,260
spoke a wired yada yada yada

243
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:17,700
I'm going to talk about a few things

244
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:19,260
today we're going to talk about some

245
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:21,300
recent changes that have been going on

246
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:22,860
in oh since the past couple years some

247
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:24,180
of you may have already experienced if

248
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:25,980
not and you do oh sent you most

249
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:27,899
certainly will we'll talk a little bit

250
00:14:27,899 --> 00:14:29,880
about operational security opsec because

251
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,079
that's something that's so important to

252
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:32,880
people and we'll talk about a little bit

253
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,560
about persistent monitoring there at the

254
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,380
very end the Genesis of where this talk

255
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:39,480
a lot of the material came out of was a

256
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:42,420
few months ago out of the blue got an

257
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:44,699
email asking me if I would be willing to

258
00:14:44,699 --> 00:14:47,339
fly to the east coast to Quantico and

259
00:14:47,339 --> 00:14:50,160
present on starting an osync unit to the

260
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,260
heads of security for a bunch of Fortune

261
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:54,360
500 companies most of them Fortune 100

262
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:57,540
and ciso csos Etc

263
00:14:57,540 --> 00:15:00,000
sounds amazing yeah let's do it and you

264
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,040
go there and it was like going to be a

265
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,660
pretty big room and you're expecting

266
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:05,220
people to be polite and you're expecting

267
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:07,199
people to pay attention but they were

268
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:09,000
just super engaged and I saw a bunch of

269
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,980
people taking notes like asking

270
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:13,740
questions after the fact like oh Santa's

271
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:15,480
definitely growing like it really really

272
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,699
is everyone realizes it right it's skill

273
00:15:17,699 --> 00:15:18,660
sets of the thing a lot of people

274
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:20,820
realized that they needed before but

275
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,260
maybe they weren't calling it o sent

276
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:25,139
right but there's definitely a a strong

277
00:15:25,139 --> 00:15:27,540
demand for that what do I mean when I

278
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:29,459
say what's been changing at Ocean the

279
00:15:29,459 --> 00:15:31,220
past couple years right

280
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:33,600
historically if you think about oh sent

281
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,079
oscent rules have been relatively well

282
00:15:37,079 --> 00:15:38,940
defined and consistent right law

283
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:40,079
enforcement

284
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:42,480
short-term quick hit I'm looking at an

285
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,040
individual a group of individuals right

286
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:47,220
I want to degrade disrupt dismantle

287
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:49,139
right can I actually arrest someone can

288
00:15:49,139 --> 00:15:50,880
I break up this organization that's what

289
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,399
it is usually quick hit intelligence

290
00:15:53,399 --> 00:15:55,199
like Department of Defense you normally

291
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:56,399
think of more

292
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:58,440
kind of holistically maybe instead of

293
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,180
looking at an individual or group I'm

294
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:02,220
looking at a country you know a region

295
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:03,899
of the world an industry something like

296
00:16:03,899 --> 00:16:05,000
that

297
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,339
CTI units for the private sector

298
00:16:08,339 --> 00:16:10,440
companies right things indicators of

299
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,120
compromise a lot of technical people in

300
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:14,220
here deal with no doubt right what are

301
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:16,139
the ttps who are the main threats to my

302
00:16:16,139 --> 00:16:18,420
industry certain things like that

303
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:19,920
and people usually describe the

304
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,019
different rules like that and you

305
00:16:22,019 --> 00:16:23,459
describe it like if it's buckets of

306
00:16:23,459 --> 00:16:25,019
paints like this is the law enforcement

307
00:16:25,019 --> 00:16:26,820
bucket this is the private sector bucket

308
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:29,519
this isn't that bucket

309
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:31,199
but in the real world it doesn't look

310
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:33,300
like that on the left it looks like that

311
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:35,160
on the right and it has been for the

312
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,959
past few years now this has been going

313
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:38,880
on for a while right and I've seen it

314
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,699
from both sides of the coin right like I

315
00:16:41,699 --> 00:16:42,959
have a decent amount of private sector

316
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:44,940
experience for Consulting my wife ran

317
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:46,740
sniper threat intelligence for a fortune

318
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:48,300
hundred company right so you have a

319
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:50,339
pretty good purview of a lot of

320
00:16:50,339 --> 00:16:52,019
different ways

321
00:16:52,019 --> 00:16:53,759
and so I've seen law enforcement

322
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:56,160
analysts that weren't technical at all

323
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,320
and it's no knock on them there's hadn't

324
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,639
been trained that wasn't really their

325
00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:01,560
specialty but now they're doing things

326
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:03,660
like researching IP addresses

327
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:05,520
trying to figure out if it's a VPN where

328
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,839
in the world it's coming from just

329
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:08,220
looking at technical things that they

330
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:09,900
don't fully understand

331
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:12,559
and from the flip side right what I saw

332
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:15,359
firsthand was private sector companies

333
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:17,459
especially a couple years ago we had a

334
00:17:17,459 --> 00:17:18,780
lot of civil unrest here in the country

335
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:20,640
that are all of a sudden doing like a

336
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,260
force protection mission

337
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:23,760
right like I can remember my wife

338
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:26,040
getting phone calls like hey I've been

339
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,780
in the office building now for 16 hours

340
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:30,419
but I don't think it's safe to leave or

341
00:17:30,419 --> 00:17:32,880
hey I just got off the subway I can see

342
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,740
the office from here but it doesn't look

343
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:36,299
like it's safe to actually go in there

344
00:17:36,299 --> 00:17:38,580
right and all of a sudden like there was

345
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:40,080
some code that I wrote for persistent

346
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,460
monitoring that I used in the government

347
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:44,460
and I know of at least two Fortune 500

348
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:45,840
companies during that time period

349
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,760
they're running that code trying to keep

350
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,500
an eye on situational awareness was it

351
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,480
safe for their people right or threats

352
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,760
against Executives you know Anonymous

353
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,260
threats and trying to track down who it

354
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:57,419
is all those types of things and so we

355
00:17:57,419 --> 00:17:59,160
see law enforcement people

356
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:01,320
doing more technical work

357
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:03,299
we see non-you know private sector

358
00:18:03,299 --> 00:18:04,860
people now doing roles traditionally

359
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:07,020
filled by law enforcement and really

360
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:08,640
like I said it's all kind of blending

361
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,620
together

362
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:12,840
and this is the last slide on that topic

363
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,360
but why is it important right why does

364
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,620
it matter

365
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:18,419
when I was driving on Quantico a couple

366
00:18:18,419 --> 00:18:21,059
months ago I got very close to where I

367
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:23,700
was going on base and I drove by here

368
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:26,039
and I stopped pulled over my rental car

369
00:18:26,039 --> 00:18:28,320
got out and I snapped a picture of it

370
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:32,520
that is the long range rifle range there

371
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,860
on Quantico and I kind of thought like

372
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:36,240
wow you know I remember when I was a

373
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,980
little kid reading a book by a guy named

374
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:40,740
Carlos Hathcock and he was one of the uh

375
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:43,140
one of the most decorated snipers in

376
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:44,940
American military history he was in

377
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:47,400
Vietnam and there's a story from that

378
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,080
book that always stuck with me I don't

379
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:50,340
remember a ton from that book but I

380
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:52,799
always remembered this one story and the

381
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,720
story was

382
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,280
there was a mission that he thought was

383
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:58,380
very very dangerous and he was close to

384
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:00,059
being able to get out of there but he

385
00:19:00,059 --> 00:19:01,679
didn't feel like it was safe to send

386
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:03,299
anyone else in he thought he was the one

387
00:19:03,299 --> 00:19:04,860
who had the best chance to do it so he

388
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:06,539
felt right that he would go

389
00:19:06,539 --> 00:19:08,700
and so he's going there and he's

390
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:10,500
stalking his Target and he's out here by

391
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:13,440
himself right Vietnam no one else around

392
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,080
just hiding in the grass for a couple of

393
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,220
days

394
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:19,440
and he's just slow at his tired he

395
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,360
hasn't slept in a couple of days and

396
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,640
he's hungry and he's thirsty but he's

397
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,500
still got a couple hundred more yards to

398
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,059
where he's planned on taking the shot

399
00:19:27,059 --> 00:19:28,140
from

400
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:31,140
but he got close and at that point he's

401
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:32,160
like

402
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,200
damn it I can make it from here

403
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,419
I've made the shot from here before like

404
00:19:36,419 --> 00:19:39,240
I can do this consistently I'm just

405
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:41,340
gonna take it from here and he was

406
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:43,200
having this internal struggle with

407
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,679
himself as far as

408
00:19:46,679 --> 00:19:47,940
what are you doing

409
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:49,679
right yes you probably could make it

410
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:52,559
from here but you're hungry you're

411
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:55,140
thirsty you're exhausted mentally and

412
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:57,900
physically you made that plan when you

413
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:59,280
were well rested

414
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,780
well fed

415
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:02,400
you know didn't have these problems

416
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,679
going on stick to the plan that you made

417
00:20:04,679 --> 00:20:06,840
when you were thinking clearly

418
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:09,480
not the plan now when you haven't slept

419
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:11,760
in two days and you're exhausted

420
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,039
and it's kind of a similar thing right

421
00:20:14,039 --> 00:20:15,240
it's a similar thing when I was doing

422
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,980
I've done a lot of digital forensics in

423
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:19,620
my career as well too I hate doing

424
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:22,020
something for the first time when it

425
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:23,400
matters

426
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,380
right and that's true in oscent that's

427
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:27,539
true in digital forensics like can I

428
00:20:27,539 --> 00:20:29,820
practice first can I have something like

429
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:31,020
what I'm going to do and have a chance

430
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:33,660
to kind of go through that and so always

431
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:35,280
think of like things that you maybe

432
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,799
haven't dealt with yet but you think you

433
00:20:37,799 --> 00:20:39,299
might have to deal with right that's why

434
00:20:39,299 --> 00:20:40,980
it's so good to do things like tabletop

435
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:42,000
that's why it's good to come to

436
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,320
conferences like this and kind of talk

437
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:44,520
to other people and hear what other

438
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,380
people are having to deal with

439
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:48,059
because like I said if you haven't dealt

440
00:20:48,059 --> 00:20:49,320
with it yet at some point you probably

441
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,240
will and if you've kind of prepared for

442
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,919
it done some research practiced it a

443
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:54,299
little bit it'll just make you so much

444
00:20:54,299 --> 00:20:56,280
more confident it'll make your work

445
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:58,320
better it'll make you less stressed

446
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,600
there's just a lot of things going and I

447
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,940
realize that's not always easy but I

448
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:04,980
realize that we're all busy we're all

449
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:06,840
swamped and so it's tough to like man I

450
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,280
don't really have time to work on these

451
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,660
other things and try to practice and try

452
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:11,700
to improve my skills because I'm just

453
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:13,020
swamped at things that I absolutely have

454
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:15,000
to do before I can go home at night and

455
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,799
I've been there before and I get it but

456
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:18,240
just at least in the back of your mind

457
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,740
right we're always trying to work on

458
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:21,240
these things that we think we may have

459
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,980
to face at some point and get prepared

460
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:24,780
for it and we'll talk about some actual

461
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:26,700
things to possibly prepare get ready for

462
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:30,320
and the rest of this presentation

463
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:33,000
so best practices for starting up an O

464
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,620
sent

465
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:37,080
it's kind of worth me I think taking a

466
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:39,120
second at this point yeah thank you

467
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,400
I have Mayhem Lauren

468
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,580
I didn't set out to be an ocean person

469
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:46,799
right I was law enforcement I was doing

470
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:48,840
digital forensics kind of specialized in

471
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:52,740
that I started um I kind of wanted to I

472
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:55,080
had an interesting incident response and

473
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:57,059
just kind of the way my mind worked I

474
00:21:57,059 --> 00:21:58,919
thought well shoot before I learned for

475
00:21:58,919 --> 00:22:00,539
evidence of people hacking I myself

476
00:22:00,539 --> 00:22:02,700
should learn how to hack so I started

477
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:04,380
doing that taking classes went got my

478
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:06,419
oscp you know doing some offensive style

479
00:22:06,419 --> 00:22:07,400
work

480
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,960
and as I started doing that and I got

481
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,640
better he realized that like the most

482
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,380
important phase is reconnaissance and

483
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:15,360
it's not even close that information

484
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,820
that you gather drives everything else

485
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:19,620
that you're doing

486
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:21,419
and so this is going to sound like the

487
00:22:21,419 --> 00:22:23,720
stupidest

488
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:27,299
it's like man there

489
00:22:27,299 --> 00:22:29,280
and applied to what in the day job and

490
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,720
what some of my co-workers in the day

491
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:33,179
job do and so I wrote this tiny little

492
00:22:33,179 --> 00:22:35,159
stupid like one and a half page white

493
00:22:35,159 --> 00:22:36,240
paper

494
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,039
basically calling out listen we have

495
00:22:38,039 --> 00:22:39,840
enough people here now

496
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:42,659
and my analysts and no disrespect to

497
00:22:42,659 --> 00:22:44,100
them they hadn't been trained for it

498
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:46,380
what they were basically calling Osan

499
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:47,820
right they were very very good at using

500
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:49,679
government systems of record but then

501
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:50,940
they would do like

502
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:53,100
three four minutes of Google searching

503
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:55,620
and call that ocean right I did the yo

504
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:57,720
Sin and so I basically wrote like a one

505
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,400
and a half page white paper and shotted

506
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,200
up my chain of command and said hey we

507
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,000
have enough people now we should

508
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,520
probably carve off a few people to

509
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:08,100
become true ocent experts and really

510
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:09,480
understand because of some of the stuff

511
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:11,340
that I've seen from my technical work I

512
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:12,720
realized there was a lot of potential

513
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:13,679
there

514
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:15,299
didn't think anything would happen from

515
00:23:15,299 --> 00:23:17,159
it about a week later I got notified

516
00:23:17,159 --> 00:23:18,480
that they were pulling me out of digital

517
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,240
forensics to go start up an Osa unit so

518
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,679
I didn't even want to run it I didn't

519
00:23:22,679 --> 00:23:24,299
even want to get involved with it with

520
00:23:24,299 --> 00:23:26,880
myself it just kind of happened right it

521
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,380
just kind of happened and so knowing

522
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:30,299
that and starting it up

523
00:23:30,299 --> 00:23:31,620
you know what are some of the things

524
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:33,960
that I uh that I did right and what are

525
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,280
some of the things frankly that I did

526
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,260
wrong one of the things I did right was

527
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:39,600
I started working with legal from the

528
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,700
very beginning both starting up a unit

529
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:43,740
at the local tactical level and then

530
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:45,299
later on a few years later at the

531
00:23:45,299 --> 00:23:48,179
national level of Washington DC my first

532
00:23:48,179 --> 00:23:51,120
meetings were with legal or with privacy

533
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,740
I'm gonna be honest like I pulled some

534
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:55,140
shady stuff more shady or honestly off

535
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:56,820
work than at work

536
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:59,340
but not so shady that I ever demanded a

537
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:01,440
full-time lawyer like I never pulled so

538
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,120
many hijinks that a lawyer's full-time

539
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,679
job was to keep me out of hot water

540
00:24:04,679 --> 00:24:06,539
thankfully

541
00:24:06,539 --> 00:24:09,360
it was close it was close a few times

542
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:12,120
but what I did do is I'm like listen I

543
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:14,100
don't want a lawyer full-time but give

544
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:16,380
me two lawyers who can spend a little

545
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:18,000
bit of time to become familiar with me

546
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,280
and my team and what we're doing and the

547
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:23,100
reason is that is huge because then when

548
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:25,260
I need a quick opinion I actually stand

549
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:26,400
a chance

550
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,740
right actually extend a chance this

551
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:29,700
picture right here is from an

552
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:31,440
international airport when I was doing

553
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,059
digital forensics a lot I got a phone

554
00:24:33,059 --> 00:24:35,400
call one day from another agency hey can

555
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,919
you get to this international airport by

556
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:39,360
this time and you can if you leave

557
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,640
basically right now we have a high value

558
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,260
Target it's going to be getting off a

559
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:44,880
plane we can give you about five minutes

560
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,980
alone with their devices what devices do

561
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:49,820
they have don't know

562
00:24:50,039 --> 00:24:51,659
okay

563
00:24:51,659 --> 00:24:53,280
and basically to the point of where I

564
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,419
only needed to leave in like the next

565
00:24:54,419 --> 00:24:55,860
two hours if I was going to make this

566
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:57,600
happen

567
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,880
if I didn't have two lawyers that were

568
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:02,340
familiar with me and what I did

569
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:05,280
and I just called like the duty pager oh

570
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,860
gear God there's no chance right who are

571
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:08,820
you again

572
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:10,380
what's your name

573
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:12,600
what's the name of your unit what do you

574
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,159
do

575
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:16,320
who are you under again

576
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,000
okay one more time what's your name like

577
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,919
I don't stand a prayer right but by

578
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:21,120
having that

579
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,860
Rapport already built up in the

580
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:24,419
confidence hey this is what I was just

581
00:25:24,419 --> 00:25:25,919
to ask this is you asked me what do you

582
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:27,539
think yeah I think it's fine to do this

583
00:25:27,539 --> 00:25:29,760
this and this just don't do this Roger

584
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,919
that take off and I'll do it right and

585
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:33,480
post it up shop in a back room under

586
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:35,700
construction took that picture I haven't

587
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,260
showed it to anyone until like a couple

588
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:38,520
months ago it's the first time I ever

589
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:39,779
like I'm like wait a second I think I

590
00:25:39,779 --> 00:25:41,640
still have that on my phone right but

591
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,860
this is why quick opinions matter trying

592
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:45,600
to trying to build that relationship

593
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:48,059
before you need it right there are some

594
00:25:48,059 --> 00:25:50,220
things that I absolutely hate and I

595
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:51,840
don't use that word lightly and one of

596
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:55,020
the worst ones how much do you hate the

597
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:56,940
first time you meet someone having to

598
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:58,860
ask them for something

599
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:00,840
right you just go up to someone man like

600
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:01,799
what's your name

601
00:26:01,799 --> 00:26:04,080
Chris hey Chris oh nice to meet you oh

602
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,640
man yeah I talked to him for a second

603
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,620
and he's like wow this mat seems like a

604
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:09,900
great guy hey Chris real quick can you

605
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:11,520
uh can you go do this thing for me real

606
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,260
quick and instantly right what happens

607
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:14,940
he goes from thinking yeah that man

608
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:16,500
seems like a great guy to that son of a

609
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:18,000
 was only talking to me because he

610
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,279
wanted me to go do something right yeah

611
00:26:20,279 --> 00:26:23,240
he set me up

612
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:25,260
all right but nah seriously building

613
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:26,700
that Rapport having that relationship

614
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:28,380
before you need it if possible once

615
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:31,860
again is important is important right

616
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:34,320
it's important to work with legal

617
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,419
but it's also important to be very very

618
00:26:36,419 --> 00:26:40,080
careful and to try not to let them if at

619
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,580
all possible and sometimes it's outside

620
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:43,860
of your control and I get that

621
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:46,799
don't put more constraints

622
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:49,919
on yourself than the law does

623
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:52,080
if at all possible if at all possible

624
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,279
Right

625
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:56,159
and you got to be safe safe policy wise

626
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:58,740
and legal wise right but there are some

627
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:00,659
key decisions that you can make and this

628
00:27:00,659 --> 00:27:01,500
is one of the things that I was

629
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:02,700
hammering home when I was speaking to

630
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:05,159
those Executives a couple months ago

631
00:27:05,159 --> 00:27:07,440
about things like violating terms and

632
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,600
services right how many Facebook

633
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:10,679
accounts are you allowed to have

634
00:27:10,679 --> 00:27:11,840
according to their terms and services

635
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:14,700
one what name does it have to be your

636
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:17,580
real name right from an opsec

637
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:19,020
perspective anyone want to go

638
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:20,520
investigate a target with their real

639
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:22,559
personal account

640
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:25,380
I've done it I don't recommend it I've

641
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:26,580
done it when I had to it's a whole

642
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:29,240
different story over drinks all right

643
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:31,320
there's some stories you got to get me

644
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:33,779
liquored up for but not too much but uh

645
00:27:33,779 --> 00:27:35,760
but not seriously right from an opposite

646
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,799
perspective that's a bad thing and so

647
00:27:37,799 --> 00:27:40,260
I've seen places like their terms and

648
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:42,120
services says we can't do that so we

649
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,260
can't do that

650
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:45,240
oh great guess what you just hamstrung

651
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:46,740
yourself next time you have some

652
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:48,059
information posted there that you need

653
00:27:48,059 --> 00:27:50,580
to go check out what are you going to do

654
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:52,919
and the worst part about that is people

655
00:27:52,919 --> 00:27:54,720
still go do it they just use their

656
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,100
personal accounts

657
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:57,539
right I remember one time a buddy of

658
00:27:57,539 --> 00:27:59,100
mine went with some Mucky muck for the

659
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:00,900
Department of Homeland Security down to

660
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:02,700
a facility in Florida

661
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:04,919
and he saw people working there that

662
00:28:04,919 --> 00:28:06,299
were researching Targets on their

663
00:28:06,299 --> 00:28:09,000
personal phones and he's like I can't

664
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,320
believe what I'm seeing like don't these

665
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,659
people know that's a poor idea

666
00:28:12,659 --> 00:28:15,720
yeah yeah SOB they do but you haven't

667
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,520
given them an alternative

668
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,020
right you haven't given an alternative

669
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:20,640
and God bless them they're trying to do

670
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:21,720
their job

671
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:23,760
right so be very very careful about not

672
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,380
violate saying that you're not going to

673
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:26,880
violate terms and services because that

674
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,140
can have some ramifications that

675
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:30,559
sometimes people don't anticipate

676
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:33,900
acquiring and utilizing breach data

677
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:36,059
right people have some very very strong

678
00:28:36,059 --> 00:28:37,740
opinions on this

679
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:39,539
I was listening to a podcast with an

680
00:28:39,539 --> 00:28:41,700
ocean expert a couple months ago

681
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:44,580
and they said why at the very end of the

682
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:46,500
podcast interview the host asked them

683
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:48,600
well what do you think about using

684
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:51,360
breach data I would never use breach

685
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,580
data right I don't see any difference

686
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:55,500
between using breach data and buying

687
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:57,659
stolen property

688
00:28:57,659 --> 00:29:00,000
the host is like yeah I agree and I was

689
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,919
sitting there like really Queen

690
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:05,520
like seriously like and I didn't think

691
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:06,779
less of them

692
00:29:06,779 --> 00:29:09,900
I thought man what a hike maybe a narrow

693
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:11,940
field of experience

694
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:13,740
right anyone here I remember about a

695
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:16,380
year ago when koalas got popped

696
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:18,539
yeah word spread that there was client

697
00:29:18,539 --> 00:29:20,220
vulnerability scans sitting there on the

698
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:22,140
dark web

699
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:24,480
yeah I got contacted by a number of

700
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,520
companies private and public sector

701
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:28,919
wanted me to go hey can you go grab that

702
00:29:28,919 --> 00:29:30,240
data and let us know what's in there

703
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,640
right what is our exposure in there

704
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:35,820
right MGM gets popped I remember a large

705
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:37,440
company reaching out hey we some of our

706
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,399
Executives think they might have

707
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:40,200
sensitive information in there can you

708
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,640
grab a copy of that and see what of our

709
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,679
information is on there right there is

710
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:46,020
all of these very very in my opinion and

711
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:47,940
once again this is my opinion there's

712
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:49,380
sometimes and I'll say it's my opinion

713
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:50,340
and just kind of leave it off there

714
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:51,720
sometimes I'll say it's my opinion but

715
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:54,360
I'm right right it's my opinion but I'm

716
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:56,820
right there are some very valid reasons

717
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:58,620
to look at this stuff sometimes and so

718
00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:00,059
knowing that and kind of anticipating

719
00:30:00,059 --> 00:30:02,220
and being able to explain cool if you

720
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:03,600
shut this off this is what we were

721
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:04,980
potentially losing

722
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:07,200
right just just know that right try to

723
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,120
fight for it if at all possible and the

724
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,679
same vein visiting the dark web I know

725
00:30:10,679 --> 00:30:11,940
places that aren't allowed to do that

726
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:14,820
well once again it's all fun and games

727
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:17,820
until supposedly data of yours of data

728
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:19,140
people you've been dealing with right

729
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:21,179
and you want to remember like the uh Law

730
00:30:21,179 --> 00:30:23,460
Firm that got popped data posted on the

731
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:25,860
dark web saying hey they don't pay the

732
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:27,299
ransom within about two weeks we're

733
00:30:27,299 --> 00:30:28,799
going to start unlocking these files

734
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:30,059
let's see what you've been talking about

735
00:30:30,059 --> 00:30:31,860
with your clients

736
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:34,559
right like stuff gets real scary real

737
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:37,279
quick sometimes

738
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:40,320
and the last topic on this right if the

739
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:42,539
scope of your team's research is going

740
00:30:42,539 --> 00:30:44,460
to include looking at employees make

741
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:46,740
sure HR is involved right it seems

742
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:48,480
should be fairly obvious but I think

743
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,799
it's worth taking a few seconds to

744
00:30:49,799 --> 00:30:51,360
mention right you may be the one doing

745
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,340
all the technical work but HR is

746
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:54,659
actually the one driving and I've been

747
00:30:54,659 --> 00:30:55,980
caught up with this a few times I've

748
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:58,080
never been in my entire career I was

749
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:00,539
never Internal Affairs or anything like

750
00:31:00,539 --> 00:31:02,700
that but sometimes they would need me to

751
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:04,260
do the technical work that I could do

752
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:05,700
and it's like great I'll do the

753
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:07,260
technical work but I'm following your

754
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:08,760
directions right you're the one driving

755
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:11,039
right now

756
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:12,779
all right

757
00:31:12,779 --> 00:31:15,679
up sec

758
00:31:16,919 --> 00:31:19,320
it is the most challenging topics to

759
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:20,640
discuss right I put one of the most

760
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:21,720
because I don't like to speak in

761
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:25,760
absolutes but it really really truly is

762
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:28,140
and I think too

763
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:30,899
this is one area where a lot of quote

764
00:31:30,899 --> 00:31:33,120
unquote ocean experts have done the

765
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,220
industry a great disservice

766
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:36,840
and I've seen it firsthand at

767
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:38,820
conferences like oset conferences you go

768
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:40,740
there and you see someone who's kind of

769
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:42,720
Twitter famous and then you'll see

770
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,580
someone who's eager and they want to get

771
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:45,779
into it and they come up and talk to

772
00:31:45,779 --> 00:31:47,820
them and they're like oh hey I'm trying

773
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:49,080
to break in you know I wanted to do

774
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:50,399
these things but I want to make sure I'm

775
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:51,720
doing it safe

776
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,340
and all of a sudden the person who's

777
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:55,200
quite a Twitter famous the quote unquote

778
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:58,620
experts just starts rattling off like oh

779
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:00,480
you got to use at least three vpns you

780
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,220
got to use this you got to use this you

781
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:03,899
got to use disposable VMS you got to go

782
00:32:03,899 --> 00:32:06,299
pay cash for a laptop at Best Buy make

783
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:07,740
sure you're wearing a fake mustache you

784
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:10,260
gotta do this and I seriously and they

785
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:14,159
start rattling off like 17 things

786
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:17,039
not the way humans are wired

787
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:18,659
or wired if I give Chris a list of 17

788
00:32:18,659 --> 00:32:20,159
things to do you know how many is going

789
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:22,200
to do

790
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:24,779
maybe one maybe giving yourself a lot of

791
00:32:24,779 --> 00:32:27,240
credit there well look yeah a lot of

792
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:28,679
credit yeah he already has the mustache

793
00:32:28,679 --> 00:32:30,000
he checks that one right off the list

794
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,220
right it doesn't even need the fake you

795
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:33,419
might have to shave it then just to

796
00:32:33,419 --> 00:32:35,039
throw them off

797
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:36,779
but seriously right that's not the way

798
00:32:36,779 --> 00:32:38,880
human brings are wired like two things

799
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:42,480
do those come back like two more right I

800
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,399
have seen ridiculous opsec when it was

801
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:46,140
needed I remember one time I had a buddy

802
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:47,820
of mine was working a um one of the old

803
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:50,880
anonymous hackers one of those cases and

804
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,919
it was to the point of they had rented a

805
00:32:52,919 --> 00:32:55,500
fake up they had rented a created an LLC

806
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:58,200
a fake LLC rented an apartment under

807
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,100
that

808
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:00,539
had a computer internet connection

809
00:33:00,539 --> 00:33:03,059
everything in this llc's name and they

810
00:33:03,059 --> 00:33:06,360
were using two vpns out of that and in

811
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:08,159
the first VPN they were connecting to

812
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:10,080
the one closest to them they had a

813
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,460
confidential informant that worked in

814
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:12,720
that company so if they ever got any

815
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,220
indication that someone was researching

816
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:16,260
them they were going to look them up

817
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:18,360
you want to talk about tradecraft and I

818
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:20,100
could go on about that that was some

819
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:24,440
trade craft that is also overkill for

820
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:28,019
99.9999 of the people in the world right

821
00:33:28,019 --> 00:33:30,539
it really really is and so that's what

822
00:33:30,539 --> 00:33:32,279
makes opsec

823
00:33:32,279 --> 00:33:34,380
so tricky to deal with because there's

824
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:36,059
always these people out there oh more

825
00:33:36,059 --> 00:33:38,039
and more and more and more it's not the

826
00:33:38,039 --> 00:33:40,140
more is a bad thing but just level set

827
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:42,840
right and if you think about what opsec

828
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:44,279
is right you can look up different

829
00:33:44,279 --> 00:33:46,860
definitions things like that

830
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:48,480
but at the end of the day it's a risk

831
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,399
management framework right it's all the

832
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:51,899
steps that you're taking to try to

833
00:33:51,899 --> 00:33:53,399
reduce risk

834
00:33:53,399 --> 00:33:55,200
but a lot of people in here know can you

835
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,880
ever eliminate risk

836
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,200
can't

837
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:00,419
right you can take the steps reasonable

838
00:34:00,419 --> 00:34:03,360
steps to reduce it as much as you can

839
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:05,640
yeah one open mouth

840
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:07,679
at the end of the day though

841
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:09,599
you got to accept that risk or don't and

842
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:11,760
don't do the job right but those are

843
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,139
your two options at that point so you

844
00:34:13,139 --> 00:34:15,599
try to minimize it

845
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:17,580
when I first started my oscent unit when

846
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:19,080
I was pulled out of there I was told

847
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:20,339
you're starting up a unit and you have

848
00:34:20,339 --> 00:34:22,619
no budget no budget for training no

849
00:34:22,619 --> 00:34:24,300
budget for tools no budget for anything

850
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:26,699
this is gonna sound like a joke and it

851
00:34:26,699 --> 00:34:28,619
kind of is and it kind of isn't

852
00:34:28,619 --> 00:34:31,800
one nice thing about having no budget it

853
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:34,500
makes your decisions really really easy

854
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:37,500
yeah what tool am I going to buy I

855
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:39,179
wasted zero seconds on that problem

856
00:34:39,179 --> 00:34:43,379
right I figured out what I could do

857
00:34:43,379 --> 00:34:45,359
I figured out what I couldn't do that I

858
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:47,460
needed to do and I figured out how to

859
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:49,139
build a tool to do it

860
00:34:49,139 --> 00:34:50,699
right the same way I kind of got sucked

861
00:34:50,699 --> 00:34:52,679
into like

862
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:54,899
ocean I kind of got sucked into coding I

863
00:34:54,899 --> 00:34:56,159
never set out to be a computer program

864
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:57,599
I'm not like I am not a computer

865
00:34:57,599 --> 00:34:59,700
programmer like I write computer code

866
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:01,260
that is functional and works and helps

867
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:03,119
me and my friends and everyone at work

868
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:04,260
looks at it and they're like oh my God

869
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:05,160
you're

870
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:07,260
my wife who's an actual engineer looks

871
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:08,580
at it and like your code is crap I'm

872
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:09,240
like

873
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:10,640
I know

874
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:13,200
just hanging my head in shame yeah I

875
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:16,560
know just don't tell anyone right but it

876
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,540
got the job done right and so you learn

877
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:20,099
it's one of the things that I had to

878
00:35:20,099 --> 00:35:21,660
deal with several times in my career

879
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:23,460
unfortunately was um

880
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:26,220
people making purchasing decisions

881
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:28,440
that weren't Technical and the problem

882
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:29,640
with that is

883
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:31,920
people making decisions on what to buy

884
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,660
when they don't understand what we can

885
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:35,760
do without anything

886
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:38,460
right and you end up with this oh my God

887
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:41,400
this brochure is so glossy the sales

888
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:43,500
people were so nice this lunch was so

889
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:45,839
good and this tool can do 17 things and

890
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:47,339
I'm sitting there like I can do those 17

891
00:35:47,339 --> 00:35:48,839
now

892
00:35:48,839 --> 00:35:50,700
right versus some small company that can

893
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:52,800
only do two things but damn it I really

894
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,359
need one of those like one of those

895
00:35:54,359 --> 00:35:56,640
would be a huge huge game changer right

896
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:59,040
so kind of fighting for that is a tough

897
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:01,500
but like I said understanding when you

898
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:03,180
have nothing in no budget you really

899
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:04,800
understand what matters and you really

900
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,240
understand how to get some bang for your

901
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:08,700
buck and so there's a lot of cheap dirty

902
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:10,560
tricks that I would figure out out of

903
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:13,260
necessity frankly

904
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:15,180
and if you thought this guy seems a

905
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:17,820
little immature you're right

906
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:19,740
thing about opsec and we kind of talked

907
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:23,400
about this a second ago it's a spectrum

908
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:26,160
that it really really is on the left

909
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:29,640
hand side we have no opsec whatsoever

910
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:31,980
like none right people using personal

911
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:34,740
devices personal laptops right got

912
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:37,140
Chrome open got your Gmail in one Tab

913
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:38,700
and you're researching the target next

914
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:40,980
tab over right just things that are

915
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:43,140
generally considered pretty poor idea

916
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:44,640
all right we want to kind of avoid this

917
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:46,800
and then on the far right right this is

918
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,540
where we have the pay cash for the

919
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:51,119
laptop multiple vpns all of these types

920
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:53,820
of things it's crazy crazy stuff I used

921
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:55,260
to tell people when I was a teacher I've

922
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:56,700
traveled all over the world for the

923
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:58,680
government teaching us it and I tell

924
00:36:58,680 --> 00:36:59,880
them like when I would kind of explain

925
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:03,000
it as a spectrum I'd tell them listen

926
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,680
we're never going to get here

927
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:06,540
in my career I'm like listen I only got

928
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:08,040
a few years left I am never going to get

929
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:09,359
here and I know it

930
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:12,000
right but we can get close

931
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,859
without a ton of effort honestly and

932
00:37:13,859 --> 00:37:15,900
without a ton of money right we can get

933
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:19,320
close fairly easily and fairly cheaply

934
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:21,960
let's talk about how but before we talk

935
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:24,420
about how one more about the why

936
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:27,440
this is a crazy story

937
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:31,380
if you're visiting Twitter

938
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:33,420
Facebook sites like that you're giving

939
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:35,820
away your IP address to them all right

940
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:39,000
maybe you'd care maybe you don't

941
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,040
but if you leave those sites right if

942
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,240
you click on a link somewhere else

943
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:44,099
you're giving up your IP address to

944
00:37:44,099 --> 00:37:45,599
whoever posted that link potentially

945
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:47,579
right and we know this we all use Link

946
00:37:47,579 --> 00:37:49,800
shorteners every day like Bentley and

947
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:52,260
other types of Link shorteners there is

948
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:54,599
some that will let you track the IP

949
00:37:54,599 --> 00:37:56,339
addresses and some basic browser

950
00:37:56,339 --> 00:37:58,440
information of whoever clicks on those

951
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:00,540
links and you can start to track that

952
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:01,680
right

953
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,839
I've seen this weaponized a few times

954
00:38:03,839 --> 00:38:05,940
but by a mile my favorite and my

955
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:07,440
favorite because I wasn't involved in it

956
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,000
I wasn't the one who got burned in him

957
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,980
there was an individual who thought that

958
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:13,020
law enforcement might be researching

959
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:13,740
them

960
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:16,020
they were right

961
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:17,820
so what they did is they've been posting

962
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:20,520
content to Facebook now what they did

963
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:22,500
they threw like a little party something

964
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,420
like that and they're like oh yeah I was

965
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:26,040
down here at this party last weekend

966
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:28,560
here's some pictures but instead of

967
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,300
posting the pictures on Facebook they

968
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:32,220
posted the picture somewhere else

969
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:33,720
and they use one of these link

970
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:35,460
shorteners on Facebook oh yeah you can

971
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:37,859
click here to view the pictures

972
00:38:37,859 --> 00:38:40,560
they were then monitoring the IP address

973
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,300
of everyone who was clicking through

974
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:44,160
those to look at the pictures

975
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:45,780
and you're like wow how did you know

976
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:47,160
that did you end up arresting him and I

977
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:49,200
told you no no no no they were calling

978
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,660
people out on their Facebook

979
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:53,820
oh yeah law enforcement agency would

980
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:54,960
click on the link to go look at the

981
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,700
picture and like 15 minutes later they

982
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:57,780
were getting called out on their

983
00:38:57,780 --> 00:38:59,880
Facebook page oh it looks like the

984
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:01,320
Department of Justice is looking at my

985
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:03,500
picture

986
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:05,700
oh looks like this agency isn't like

987
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:07,260
this was like oh my God I'm just sitting

988
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:08,400
there like with a bucket of popcorn

989
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:09,599
because I wasn't clicking on the bike

990
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:11,220
right like

991
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:14,540
as a casual Observer this is amazing

992
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:18,119
and I'm here for it right like oh looks

993
00:39:18,119 --> 00:39:19,380
like the Department of Defense is in

994
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:21,060
here okay yeah like seriously they're

995
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:22,859
calling out the a more agencies are

996
00:39:22,859 --> 00:39:24,359
going and you're like oh my God what are

997
00:39:24,359 --> 00:39:25,800
you doing stop clicking on the link

998
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,660
right they were clicking on the link

999
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:29,300
just to see what all the fuss was about

1000
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:32,280
right but they weren't managing their

1001
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:33,300
attribution

1002
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:34,800
right they weren't fired up a tour

1003
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,660
browser they weren't using some type of

1004
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:37,980
other service they weren't using

1005
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:39,240
anything to try to manage their

1006
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:41,339
attribution they were just going from

1007
00:39:41,339 --> 00:39:43,020
their normal work browser that comes

1008
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:44,520
back to Department of Homeland Security

1009
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:46,560
or Department of Justice or whatever it

1010
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:48,180
is right so we want to be careful with

1011
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:50,160
this that's why managing your

1012
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:52,380
attribution can be very very important I

1013
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:55,140
have seen some sites run by absolute

1014
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:58,980
wackos I mean people that just tinfoil

1015
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:02,300
had like crazy crazy

1016
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:04,200
and there are certain sections of the

1017
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:06,480
site where if you go there it claims

1018
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:09,000
that hey we just logged your IP address

1019
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,099
and we monitor that and it wasn't like

1020
00:40:11,099 --> 00:40:12,420
something that was built into WordPress

1021
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:14,099
or a plug-in or something like that was

1022
00:40:14,099 --> 00:40:16,619
modified who knows if they actually do

1023
00:40:16,619 --> 00:40:18,420
or Not Right But like I said I've seen

1024
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:19,680
some people that don't look like they

1025
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:21,900
could tie their shoes that at least

1026
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:23,820
claim that they do this so we want to be

1027
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:25,380
careful it's not hard to do right it's

1028
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:27,900
not hard to do

1029
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:30,119
what are some of the kind of best values

1030
00:40:30,119 --> 00:40:33,420
in opsec if you have no budget

1031
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:37,079
whatsoever it's Tor right it really

1032
00:40:37,079 --> 00:40:39,300
really is just fire up a tour browser is

1033
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:42,000
tour perfect no it's slow as heck you

1034
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,160
get to capture every three seconds and

1035
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:46,440
captures are getting worse right spiral

1036
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:48,300
galaxy the horse with the white hooves

1037
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:49,920
like captures are getting ridiculous

1038
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:53,220
nowadays they are what Tor does a good

1039
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:55,079
job some of you may have heard a story

1040
00:40:55,079 --> 00:40:56,940
it was uh God it was just a couple years

1041
00:40:56,940 --> 00:40:59,940
ago there was an individual

1042
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:03,240
like just an absolute scumbag of a human

1043
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:04,740
being that I hesitate to even call a

1044
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:07,740
human that was harassing young ladies

1045
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:09,599
online on Facebook

1046
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:13,320
and this went on for way way too long

1047
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:15,300
law enforcement was working it Facebook

1048
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:17,400
was working it but they didn't know

1049
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:19,020
where the person was because the person

1050
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:20,940
was using Tor to protect themselves they

1051
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:22,440
were using Tails if you're familiar with

1052
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:23,760
Tails where you can like boot up a

1053
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:26,160
little USB with Tor on it so this went

1054
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:27,900
on for over a year and this guy was

1055
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:29,520
doing horrible things he was basically

1056
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:31,320
convincing these girls that he had nude

1057
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:33,060
pictures of them and unless they sent

1058
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:34,560
him more nude pictures that he was going

1059
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:35,940
to kill their family and things like

1060
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:38,660
that and it would escalate from there

1061
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:41,520
eventually Facebook got so fed up with

1062
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:43,619
this what did they do they went to a

1063
00:41:43,619 --> 00:41:46,260
security team a security researcher and

1064
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:47,820
they paid I want to say I forgot it was

1065
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:50,820
like like low to mid five figures like

1066
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:54,420
20 to 50 000 like that range for a

1067
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:56,160
vulnerability in the video player

1068
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:58,380
entails

1069
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:00,300
that gave that vulnerability to law

1070
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:02,820
enforcement that exploit law enforcement

1071
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:04,800
crafted up a video had one of the

1072
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,480
victims shoot it to him he played it

1073
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:08,220
gave away his true IP address they went

1074
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:09,480
and arrested him

1075
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:12,060
Kudos right everyone is happy

1076
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:16,099
that guy is off the streets everyone

1077
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:17,820
but from an Optics perspective that was

1078
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:19,140
a weird case

1079
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:20,579
right because all of a sudden Facebook

1080
00:42:20,579 --> 00:42:22,440
which is already battling massive

1081
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:24,119
privacy concerns which is hilarious

1082
00:42:24,119 --> 00:42:25,560
people getting like pissed off at

1083
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:26,820
Facebook like did you pay for your

1084
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:28,020
account like how do you think they make

1085
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:30,420
money right but already a company that

1086
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:31,980
you're just battling some of these

1087
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:34,079
massive privacy concerns

1088
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:35,820
and how they do that and how they get an

1089
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:37,140
exploit and give it to federal law

1090
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:38,640
enforcement to use it against one of

1091
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:41,280
their users like like I said everyone's

1092
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:42,660
happy is off the street but it was just

1093
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:44,160
kind of a weird case from an Optics

1094
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:45,900
perspective and so

1095
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:48,000
people take that and they argue about

1096
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,619
the morality of it and I'm like listen

1097
00:42:49,619 --> 00:42:51,359
I'm not the morality police I would be

1098
00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:52,859
the horrible morality please I would

1099
00:42:52,859 --> 00:42:54,720
tell you do you Chris as long as it's

1100
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:55,800
not hurting anyone else you do whatever

1101
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:59,119
the heck you want man I don't even care

1102
00:42:59,220 --> 00:43:00,599
you know what I got from that story

1103
00:43:00,599 --> 00:43:02,220
though

1104
00:43:02,220 --> 00:43:04,079
everyone was trying to catch this dude

1105
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:05,460
for over a year but they couldn't

1106
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:07,619
because of Thor

1107
00:43:07,619 --> 00:43:09,720
right when people think like Tor is

1108
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:11,400
horribly fundamentally broken Tor has

1109
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:13,140
issues right denial of service right now

1110
00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:15,119
on tour is out of control haven't seen

1111
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:17,460
dread formed what two months now but

1112
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:19,859
like nah it does a pretty good job it

1113
00:43:19,859 --> 00:43:21,240
really really does and I see so many

1114
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:24,180
people oh it's broken like is it

1115
00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:26,160
I think so right I don't really think so

1116
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:27,900
nothing's perfect but it's pretty darn

1117
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:31,800
good and it's free if you have money

1118
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:35,040
and want to use a VPN do it which one do

1119
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:37,740
you want to use pay for it right that's

1120
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:39,780
really the biggest advice I got you

1121
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:41,760
start tracking down the financials of

1122
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:45,240
free VPN providers it is insane a bunch

1123
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:47,040
come out of China which is hilarious

1124
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:48,300
because China doesn't even let their

1125
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:50,819
people use vpns so think about that they

1126
00:43:50,819 --> 00:43:53,819
don't let their citizens use vpns but

1127
00:43:53,819 --> 00:43:55,560
they can start at VPN companies to sell

1128
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:57,660
to other people right kind of makes you

1129
00:43:57,660 --> 00:43:58,800
wonder what they're doing with some of

1130
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:00,780
that information uh decent percentage

1131
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:02,460
come back to Pakistan which always kind

1132
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:03,660
of floored me

1133
00:44:03,660 --> 00:44:06,300
but um they're just garbage too they

1134
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:08,339
just really really are get your accounts

1135
00:44:08,339 --> 00:44:09,660
suspended

1136
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:12,240
like very very quickly I remember one

1137
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:15,180
time when I was in DC hearing a rash of

1138
00:44:15,180 --> 00:44:17,460
out of one part of the country all of a

1139
00:44:17,460 --> 00:44:18,720
sudden getting a ton of reports that

1140
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:20,579
people's social media accounts were

1141
00:44:20,579 --> 00:44:23,339
getting suspended at an alarm and rate

1142
00:44:23,339 --> 00:44:25,200
right and their stock puppet accounts

1143
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:26,640
just can suspended suspend to suspend

1144
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:28,560
I'm like wow I have a buddy of mine down

1145
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:29,700
there that kind of knows what he's doing

1146
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:31,319
let me call up Jeremy so I call him up

1147
00:44:31,319 --> 00:44:32,760
and I'm like Jeremy like what's going on

1148
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:35,099
he's like

1149
00:44:35,099 --> 00:44:37,079
there's this VPN that's both paid in

1150
00:44:37,079 --> 00:44:39,180
free but a free VPN called TunnelBear

1151
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:41,280
anyone use TunnelBear I will give

1152
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:43,819
TunnelBear credit right here right now

1153
00:44:43,819 --> 00:44:46,440
TunnelBear has the best graphics I have

1154
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:49,200
ever seen in a VPN it really really does

1155
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:50,700
right there's like this cartoon bear

1156
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:52,560
that looks all fun and you're like

1157
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:54,180
tunnel bear I want to come out of the

1158
00:44:54,180 --> 00:44:57,540
Ukraine it's like and it jumps in this

1159
00:44:57,540 --> 00:45:01,140
green tube like Super Mario Brothers and

1160
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:02,760
the map moves to wherever it's coming

1161
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:04,560
out of and then the bear emerges and

1162
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:05,640
you're coming out of there and you're

1163
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:07,560
like this is amazing I love tunnel bear

1164
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:09,540
it's great but once again it's a free

1165
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:11,400
VPN service you know what type of people

1166
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:13,640
use a free VPN service

1167
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:16,260
yeah it's like the Cantina from Star

1168
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:18,240
Wars it is a wretched Hive of scum and

1169
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:21,119
villain right and so all of a sudden

1170
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:24,180
your Facebook profile has a shelf like a

1171
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:26,099
shelf life of cottage cheese at room

1172
00:45:26,099 --> 00:45:28,800
temperature right don't be surprised so

1173
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:30,540
pay for a VPN use one that has

1174
00:45:30,540 --> 00:45:31,800
commercials

1175
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:33,780
some people use protons some people use

1176
00:45:33,780 --> 00:45:35,640
Nord grade I wouldn't try to talk anyone

1177
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:38,460
out of that me personally I use one

1178
00:45:38,460 --> 00:45:40,200
called private internet access some of

1179
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:43,680
y'all may use it too I like Pia there

1180
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:45,960
are a lot of VPN providers that claim

1181
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:48,060
they keep no logs right there was one

1182
00:45:48,060 --> 00:45:49,859
called hide my ass that claimed they

1183
00:45:49,859 --> 00:45:52,140
kept no logs they got drug into federal

1184
00:45:52,140 --> 00:45:53,880
court and ordered to produce logs

1185
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:56,940
magically they had logs like seriously

1186
00:45:56,940 --> 00:45:58,859
they rolled over in like three seconds

1187
00:45:58,859 --> 00:46:01,020
right they folded up like a cheap lawn

1188
00:46:01,020 --> 00:46:02,520
chair you stole from the front of a

1189
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:04,920
Kmart and it just instantly produced

1190
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:06,240
logs

1191
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:08,760
private internet access has been drug in

1192
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:10,440
in order to produce logs several times

1193
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:12,000
and they have always failed to do so

1194
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,740
they haven't been jerk weasels about it

1195
00:46:13,740 --> 00:46:15,119
like they haven't flipped anyone off

1196
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:18,359
they just show up we have no logs all

1197
00:46:18,359 --> 00:46:19,500
right we have no logs and there was

1198
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:20,940
actually something about two months ago

1199
00:46:20,940 --> 00:46:22,920
where Nord kind of got beat up a little

1200
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:25,740
bit for uh some privacy concerns and

1201
00:46:25,740 --> 00:46:27,000
then uh

1202
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,099
and then like that same week like it had

1203
00:46:29,099 --> 00:46:30,240
already happened it wasn't like they

1204
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:33,000
timed it but that same week Pia private

1205
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,800
internet access they announced that they

1206
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:36,960
had Deloitte come in and do an audit and

1207
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:39,300
actually verify that no we audited them

1208
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:40,740
and it looks like they keep no logs

1209
00:46:40,740 --> 00:46:42,839
that's important right

1210
00:46:42,839 --> 00:46:46,020
and it's not that I do like I try to

1211
00:46:46,020 --> 00:46:47,819
minimize the number of felonies I commit

1212
00:46:47,819 --> 00:46:50,400
on any given day

1213
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:52,440
and I say minimize because I'm a realist

1214
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:54,060
right let's be honest sometimes stuff

1215
00:46:54,060 --> 00:46:56,339
needs to get done

1216
00:46:56,339 --> 00:46:58,380
and so it's not even that I'm necessary

1217
00:46:58,380 --> 00:47:01,700
you're like dude this guy is Shady

1218
00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:05,579
he was not lying right it's not even

1219
00:47:05,579 --> 00:47:07,500
that I'm trying to avoid being arrested

1220
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:09,359
or anything like that I just don't want

1221
00:47:09,359 --> 00:47:11,040
logs of what I do

1222
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:13,200
right there was a I have terabytes of

1223
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:14,640
breach data like for a lot of different

1224
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:17,040
reasons there was a there was a VPN

1225
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:19,079
provider that got popped last year

1226
00:47:19,079 --> 00:47:21,060
and all that information came out in a

1227
00:47:21,060 --> 00:47:22,980
breach right because they had had logs

1228
00:47:22,980 --> 00:47:24,960
and so now here was people who were

1229
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:26,819
trusting this VPN provider to keep them

1230
00:47:26,819 --> 00:47:28,319
safe

1231
00:47:28,319 --> 00:47:30,240
and now like all their information is

1232
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:32,579
right there their true IP address like

1233
00:47:32,579 --> 00:47:33,839
if they were using it on a mobile device

1234
00:47:33,839 --> 00:47:36,480
things like the IMEI and some of the

1235
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:38,160
selectors off the phone all right there

1236
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:40,140
right and so that's what I want like

1237
00:47:40,140 --> 00:47:42,480
data eventually has a way of finding its

1238
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:44,339
way out there and so that's what I'm

1239
00:47:44,339 --> 00:47:45,720
trying to avoid that's why I want

1240
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:49,160
someone that doesn't keep logs sir

1241
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:53,060
it says they tried to not

1242
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:02,040
yeah it's a great question so the

1243
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:03,480
question is that he was the gentleman

1244
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:05,160
was saying his VPN provider saying that

1245
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:07,680
they try not to keep logs but sometimes

1246
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:09,359
they have to because of the countries

1247
00:48:09,359 --> 00:48:11,460
that they're in and everyone for the

1248
00:48:11,460 --> 00:48:13,500
most part if they actually care abide by

1249
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:15,420
those logs but there are some countries

1250
00:48:15,420 --> 00:48:17,819
where they actually do not have to right

1251
00:48:17,819 --> 00:48:20,220
what uh we saw a few years ago we saw

1252
00:48:20,220 --> 00:48:22,200
thank you we saw a few years ago we saw

1253
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:25,020
Russia pass a law that all of a sudden

1254
00:48:25,020 --> 00:48:26,520
like monitoring kind of need to be in

1255
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:28,140
place and instantly within like a week

1256
00:48:28,140 --> 00:48:30,540
several VPN providers private internet

1257
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:32,160
access and I have no stock in them right

1258
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:33,300
I'm just saying they were one of them

1259
00:48:33,300 --> 00:48:34,920
they pulled their pulled all their nodes

1260
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:36,359
out of there because they weren't

1261
00:48:36,359 --> 00:48:37,980
willing to do that and so yeah that is

1262
00:48:37,980 --> 00:48:39,660
something to pay attention to right it

1263
00:48:39,660 --> 00:48:41,640
absolutely is

1264
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:45,180
so like I said tour is free vpns aren't

1265
00:48:45,180 --> 00:48:46,800
that much I think I paid like 50 bucks

1266
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:48,540
for mine for two or three years or

1267
00:48:48,540 --> 00:48:50,460
something like that virtual machines

1268
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:53,220
right totally free VM workstation player

1269
00:48:53,220 --> 00:48:55,680
it's free get a new bun through ISO set

1270
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:57,540
it up now you have a nice little sandbox

1271
00:48:57,540 --> 00:48:59,099
separate from what you do it just gives

1272
00:48:59,099 --> 00:49:00,839
you an extra kind of layer of security

1273
00:49:00,839 --> 00:49:04,319
right and so once again a VPN

1274
00:49:04,319 --> 00:49:06,119
a virtual machine are these things 100

1275
00:49:06,119 --> 00:49:08,220
foolproof no but think of how much

1276
00:49:08,220 --> 00:49:10,740
better off you are with not much money

1277
00:49:10,740 --> 00:49:12,839
and not much effort just by using things

1278
00:49:12,839 --> 00:49:16,880
like this right it's not Magic

1279
00:49:16,980 --> 00:49:19,500
when you go to set up an account

1280
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:21,900
on sites like Facebook and Twitter you

1281
00:49:21,900 --> 00:49:23,700
need to give it a phone number right

1282
00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:26,640
this gets a lot of people years ago like

1283
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:28,380
a decade ago

1284
00:49:28,380 --> 00:49:30,119
if you told me hey can you set up 20

1285
00:49:30,119 --> 00:49:33,060
Facebook accounts today no problem yeah

1286
00:49:33,060 --> 00:49:35,280
because there was all these like

1287
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:37,440
completely free apps that I could use

1288
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:39,839
like text plus Talkatone text now to get

1289
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:42,240
these just just free BS VoIP numbers

1290
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:44,940
confirm the text message they sent I now

1291
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:46,440
have a Facebook number that doesn't work

1292
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:48,480
anymore not even Google Voice works

1293
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:49,740
anymore that was kind of one of the last

1294
00:49:49,740 --> 00:49:52,020
holdouts right you actually need a real

1295
00:49:52,020 --> 00:49:55,859
honest to God phone number now and once

1296
00:49:55,859 --> 00:49:57,540
again this is where so many people mess

1297
00:49:57,540 --> 00:49:58,319
up

1298
00:49:58,319 --> 00:50:01,079
because they're under the gun

1299
00:50:01,079 --> 00:50:03,180
they need to answer this question right

1300
00:50:03,180 --> 00:50:04,319
now

1301
00:50:04,319 --> 00:50:05,880
they don't have an account on this site

1302
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:07,859
and they need to set one up I'll just

1303
00:50:07,859 --> 00:50:09,180
use my personal number

1304
00:50:09,180 --> 00:50:10,800
like whatever I'm not going to use my

1305
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:11,940
real name I'm not going to use anything

1306
00:50:11,940 --> 00:50:13,500
else I'll use the email setup I'll just

1307
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:15,720
use my personal number it's all fun and

1308
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:17,460
games until the breach data comes out 18

1309
00:50:17,460 --> 00:50:19,859
months later

1310
00:50:19,859 --> 00:50:21,960
was that Bernard Berner Works some I

1311
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:23,339
didn't have burner work the last time I

1312
00:50:23,339 --> 00:50:25,260
tried it on a Facebook but I have used

1313
00:50:25,260 --> 00:50:27,300
burner on a few other things Facebook to

1314
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:28,920
their credit is really really good at

1315
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:30,599
this stuff like they really are as far

1316
00:50:30,599 --> 00:50:32,460
as detecting BS phone numbers and things

1317
00:50:32,460 --> 00:50:35,400
like this if you want I've heard

1318
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:37,140
burner's good yeah all of a sudden you

1319
00:50:37,140 --> 00:50:39,480

yeah yeah hey how's your mother who says

1321
00:50:42,780 --> 00:50:45,420
I have a mother yeah

1322
00:50:45,420 --> 00:50:46,160
yeah

1323
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:49,140
if you need a prepaid number there are

1324
00:50:49,140 --> 00:50:50,520
some really really good options here in

1325
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:52,020
the U.S we're very he was talking about

1326
00:50:52,020 --> 00:50:53,400
laws varying from country to country

1327
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:55,200
with vpns you want to see laws very

1328
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:57,780
wildly about prepaid phones this is

1329
00:50:57,780 --> 00:50:59,040
America

1330
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:01,500
this is the land of freedom and I can go

1331
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:03,300
down to the Circle K right after this

1332
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:06,059
talk slap down forty dollars of cash and

1333
00:51:06,059 --> 00:51:09,059
leave with a prepaid phone like God and

1334
00:51:09,059 --> 00:51:13,559
mother nature intended all right

1335
00:51:13,559 --> 00:51:15,839
I can do the same thing in the UK I can

1336
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:17,520
do the same thing in like Amsterdam

1337
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:19,440
right you go over to Germany not so much

1338
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:21,119
right they want to see some ID they want

1339
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:22,740
to start seeing some things like that so

1340
00:51:22,740 --> 00:51:24,300
here in the US we're fortunate it's

1341
00:51:24,300 --> 00:51:26,099
actually very very easy to do these

1342
00:51:26,099 --> 00:51:27,900
things a couple of my favorite options

1343
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:29,700
number one is the one on the right mint

1344
00:51:29,700 --> 00:51:32,040
mobile right the cell phone service more

1345
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:33,359
people know about it now because Ryan

1346
00:51:33,359 --> 00:51:34,980
Reynolds right has all the commercials

1347
00:51:34,980 --> 00:51:37,920
or whatever fifteen dollars a month for

1348
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:39,960
mint Mobile SIM card that sounds

1349
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:41,940
extremely reasonable but their whole

1350
00:51:41,940 --> 00:51:44,880
shtick is like listen we don't want to

1351
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:46,380
send you a phone you probably have a

1352
00:51:46,380 --> 00:51:48,780
phone so just we'll send you a SIM card

1353
00:51:48,780 --> 00:51:51,000
you can use our service well how do I

1354
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,319
know if you have good reception at my

1355
00:51:52,319 --> 00:51:54,599
house don't even worry about that listen

1356
00:51:54,599 --> 00:51:56,280
I don't want you to waste fifteen

1357
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:57,720
dollars of your hard-earned money and

1358
00:51:57,720 --> 00:51:59,040
then be disappointed so here's what

1359
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:00,540
we're going to do we have these SIM

1360
00:52:00,540 --> 00:52:02,400
cards that are only 99 Cents and they're

1361
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:03,540
good for a week

1362
00:52:03,540 --> 00:52:04,500
foreign

1363
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:06,300
that doesn't sound like the shadiest

1364
00:52:06,300 --> 00:52:08,099
thing you've ever heard of in your life

1365
00:52:08,099 --> 00:52:09,300
right

1366
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:11,280
they're usually five dollars but they're

1367
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:13,260
like always on sale for 99 cents and

1368
00:52:13,260 --> 00:52:16,020
what's funny is it's limit one

1369
00:52:16,020 --> 00:52:19,040
at a time

1370
00:52:20,059 --> 00:52:23,520
so if you look there on my Amazon I

1371
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:26,720
purchased those eight times

1372
00:52:26,940 --> 00:52:28,740
that's not counting all the ones I paid

1373
00:52:28,740 --> 00:52:30,780
for at cash at Target and Best Buy like

1374
00:52:30,780 --> 00:52:32,700
any other self-respecting drug dealer

1375
00:52:32,700 --> 00:52:34,879
right

1376
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:37,319
and so this will give you a disposable

1377
00:52:37,319 --> 00:52:39,960
phone number that's good for a week set

1378
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:41,339
up your accounts and everything's good

1379
00:52:41,339 --> 00:52:43,800
for a buck it's amazing right if you

1380
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:46,079
need a phone or if you actually want to

1381
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:47,579
keep this number for a while because you

1382
00:52:47,579 --> 00:52:49,380
actually want these profiles to live off

1383
00:52:49,380 --> 00:52:51,420
and not lose them potentially look at

1384
00:52:51,420 --> 00:52:53,040
that on eBay TracFone straight from

1385
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:55,079
TracFone himself not even like Bob's

1386
00:52:55,079 --> 00:52:57,359
totally trustworthy phones or anything

1387
00:52:57,359 --> 00:53:00,660
69 for an Android phone and a Year's

1388
00:53:00,660 --> 00:53:02,099
worth of service

1389
00:53:02,099 --> 00:53:03,540
and all you need is the text messages

1390
00:53:03,540 --> 00:53:05,220
right all you need is a text message

1391
00:53:05,220 --> 00:53:07,079
just to come on in all right so we have

1392
00:53:07,079 --> 00:53:08,819
options here in the US where it's very

1393
00:53:08,819 --> 00:53:12,980
very easy to do this style of work

1394
00:53:13,380 --> 00:53:16,440
if you try to give Facebook

1395
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:18,660
or more and more social media sites now

1396
00:53:18,660 --> 00:53:21,540
a picture from you know this person does

1397
00:53:21,540 --> 00:53:23,220
not exist they're getting really good at

1398
00:53:23,220 --> 00:53:25,079
detecting that was AI generated right

1399
00:53:25,079 --> 00:53:27,839
the process that they do is called a gan

1400
00:53:27,839 --> 00:53:29,760
right generative adversarial Network

1401
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:31,619
generative because they uh because they

1402
00:53:31,619 --> 00:53:33,540
actually make something adversarial

1403
00:53:33,540 --> 00:53:35,040
because it's basically two computer

1404
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:37,559
programs pitted against each other

1405
00:53:37,559 --> 00:53:40,079
right and then you know comes out with

1406
00:53:40,079 --> 00:53:41,940
this fake face but there's certain

1407
00:53:41,940 --> 00:53:43,619
Telltale right the most famous one being

1408
00:53:43,619 --> 00:53:45,720
the eyes the eyes are always in the same

1409
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:48,000
spot on all these pictures and so like I

1410
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,099
said these now are going to get flagged

1411
00:53:50,099 --> 00:53:52,200
out as that's not your real face I'm

1412
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:54,359
going to suspend your account well there

1413
00:53:54,359 --> 00:53:56,099
are face swap apps out there there are

1414
00:53:56,099 --> 00:53:57,480
face swap sites where you can take a

1415
00:53:57,480 --> 00:53:58,980
real picture like that handsome

1416
00:53:58,980 --> 00:54:00,359
Gentleman on the left hand of the right

1417
00:54:00,359 --> 00:54:03,660
side mix it in with any other picture in

1418
00:54:03,660 --> 00:54:05,220
this case I even mixed in with a gan

1419
00:54:05,220 --> 00:54:08,520
still looks largely like me

1420
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:11,579
but it's different enough now but since

1421
00:54:11,579 --> 00:54:13,140
the base

1422
00:54:13,140 --> 00:54:16,079
wasn't generated by like I have you know

1423
00:54:16,079 --> 00:54:17,400
this person does not exist something

1424
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:19,380
like that you see the eyes are offset

1425
00:54:19,380 --> 00:54:21,359
and still has the characteristics of a

1426
00:54:21,359 --> 00:54:23,460
real person like all of these things out

1427
00:54:23,460 --> 00:54:25,559
there like we can detect fake faces no

1428
00:54:25,559 --> 00:54:27,000
you can't

1429
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,859
they detected the image was generated

1430
00:54:28,859 --> 00:54:31,260
using that Gan methodology

1431
00:54:31,260 --> 00:54:33,119
and so if you start off with a real base

1432
00:54:33,119 --> 00:54:34,380
and then just kind of morph something

1433
00:54:34,380 --> 00:54:35,819
into it you can end up with a very real

1434
00:54:35,819 --> 00:54:38,220
looking picture that still isn't going

1435
00:54:38,220 --> 00:54:40,200
to get flagged right totally free

1436
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:41,700
totally free

1437
00:54:41,700 --> 00:54:44,160
all right last things we'll talk about

1438
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:46,040
right here and then we'll end up

1439
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:48,119
persistent monitoring right something

1440
00:54:48,119 --> 00:54:50,960
very very important brand reputation

1441
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:53,819
executive protection potential Insider

1442
00:54:53,819 --> 00:54:56,339
threats either uh intentional or

1443
00:54:56,339 --> 00:54:58,260
otherwise plenty of stories in that one

1444
00:54:58,260 --> 00:55:00,480
right there initial access for sale

1445
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:02,460
right more and more now you're seeing

1446
00:55:02,460 --> 00:55:04,200
data Steeler logs become a thing right

1447
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:05,700
and these places are getting hacked

1448
00:55:05,700 --> 00:55:07,980
because someone just bought a cookie or

1449
00:55:07,980 --> 00:55:09,780
someone bought some creds from some of

1450
00:55:09,780 --> 00:55:11,339
the data Steeler logs right and you're

1451
00:55:11,339 --> 00:55:12,720
just basically buying initial access

1452
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:14,700
right there those marketplaces are out

1453
00:55:14,700 --> 00:55:16,559
there and they're kind of crazy and so

1454
00:55:16,559 --> 00:55:17,760
monitoring

1455
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:19,859
right seeing Haze or anything out here

1456
00:55:19,859 --> 00:55:22,740
that could be me or my organization is

1457
00:55:22,740 --> 00:55:25,619
very very useful it's extremely

1458
00:55:25,619 --> 00:55:27,480
important and it doesn't have to be

1459
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:30,420
expensive right Google Alerts are free

1460
00:55:30,420 --> 00:55:31,980
and you can have like a thousand of them

1461
00:55:31,980 --> 00:55:34,140
now it's amazing right I remember one

1462
00:55:34,140 --> 00:55:36,240
time I had a student who uh

1463
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:38,400
they were with a Big Ten research

1464
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:39,960
University and they came up like hey I

1465
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:40,920
want to pick your brain on something

1466
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:42,359
like yeah they're like I'm really

1467
00:55:42,359 --> 00:55:43,680
concerned with intellectual property

1468
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:45,780
theft and I'm like like your students

1469
00:55:45,780 --> 00:55:47,220
pirating stuff he's like no I don't care

1470
00:55:47,220 --> 00:55:48,960
about that he's like I care about we

1471
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:51,059
have these research Labs with some very

1472
00:55:51,059 --> 00:55:52,680
very viable research and I'm concerned

1473
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:54,359
about people leaking them out and that's

1474
00:55:54,359 --> 00:55:55,800
a big thing right research linking out

1475
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:57,180
to foreign countries Etc that was

1476
00:55:57,180 --> 00:55:58,319
something that I had to deal with in the

1477
00:55:58,319 --> 00:55:59,280
government

1478
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:01,500
and he's like I just have a very very

1479
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:03,119
small team and I don't really feel like

1480
00:56:03,119 --> 00:56:04,559
I can do anything I don't know what to

1481
00:56:04,559 --> 00:56:05,880
do and I'm like shoot start off with

1482
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:08,160
some Google Alerts where I go talk to

1483
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:09,599
some people there at the labs that have

1484
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:11,520
some key terms think of some good

1485
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:13,260
criteria you can get very very specific

1486
00:56:13,260 --> 00:56:14,819
with Google searches right with Google

1487
00:56:14,819 --> 00:56:17,160
Dorking and actually set up some Google

1488
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:19,740
Alerts it's totally free right so that's

1489
00:56:19,740 --> 00:56:22,079
one way Twitter API Keys they're free

1490
00:56:22,079 --> 00:56:23,880
and they're amazing all right you can do

1491
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:25,740
some amazing things I gave a talk at the

1492
00:56:25,740 --> 00:56:28,380
essence Summit two years ago about

1493
00:56:28,380 --> 00:56:30,000
basically a Twitter bot kind of

1494
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,920
monitoring 24 7. it wasn't just looking

1495
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:34,020
for keywords it actually had some logic

1496
00:56:34,020 --> 00:56:35,880
I kind of joked when I did that that if

1497
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:37,859
I was trying to like sell the product I

1498
00:56:37,859 --> 00:56:38,940
would claim it was artificial

1499
00:56:38,940 --> 00:56:40,440
intelligence and machine learning it's

1500
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:42,599
actually just a bunch of lists right but

1501
00:56:42,599 --> 00:56:44,040
just going through with like kind of a

1502
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:47,339
good logical process and alerting on

1503
00:56:47,339 --> 00:56:48,780
things that actually matter you can do

1504
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:50,220
this for free with a little bit of

1505
00:56:50,220 --> 00:56:51,720
effort and that talk and code is all

1506
00:56:51,720 --> 00:56:53,160
still out there there are commercial

1507
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:55,020
options like Flashpoint if you have a

1508
00:56:55,020 --> 00:56:56,460
budget that are amazing but some people

1509
00:56:56,460 --> 00:56:57,540
don't

1510
00:56:57,540 --> 00:57:00,420
but one of the best kept secrets and my

1511
00:57:00,420 --> 00:57:01,980
wife actually turned me onto how amazing

1512
00:57:01,980 --> 00:57:03,720
these were about a month ago something I

1513
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:05,339
was aware of but she was like whoa yeah

1514
00:57:05,339 --> 00:57:06,780
I know you're aware of it but check this

1515
00:57:06,780 --> 00:57:07,559
out

1516
00:57:07,559 --> 00:57:09,720
these Google programmable search engines

1517
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:12,300
right and what these are is they're

1518
00:57:12,300 --> 00:57:14,400
basically designed for imagine if you

1519
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:15,599
come up with some really really good

1520
00:57:15,599 --> 00:57:18,180
Google query and it's like yeah this

1521
00:57:18,180 --> 00:57:20,460
query you're going to search doc Spin

1522
00:57:20,460 --> 00:57:22,140
and you're going to search you know

1523
00:57:22,140 --> 00:57:24,059
paste bin and these four different other

1524
00:57:24,059 --> 00:57:27,660
sites with these keywords and so now all

1525
00:57:27,660 --> 00:57:29,220
I have to do I can leave that query

1526
00:57:29,220 --> 00:57:31,559
exactly the same and all I have to do is

1527
00:57:31,559 --> 00:57:33,300
put in whatever name I'm looking for

1528
00:57:33,300 --> 00:57:36,420
right what these personal search engines

1529
00:57:36,420 --> 00:57:38,640
do is basically let you take that query

1530
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:41,040
and kind of freeze it say hey I would

1531
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:42,720
like to save this query off and so now

1532
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:44,040
the next time I need to do it I don't

1533
00:57:44,040 --> 00:57:46,440
have to retype that entire query I can

1534
00:57:46,440 --> 00:57:47,700
just click on this link and all that

1535
00:57:47,700 --> 00:57:49,800
other criteria is built in and now I

1536
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:51,359
just put in the name and it's also

1537
00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:52,559
designed and then you can share it with

1538
00:57:52,559 --> 00:57:53,579
your friends share it with your

1539
00:57:53,579 --> 00:57:54,900
co-workers hey I've got this really

1540
00:57:54,900 --> 00:57:56,520
great query that searches for this here

1541
00:57:56,520 --> 00:57:58,319
you go and I can share it and that's

1542
00:57:58,319 --> 00:57:59,700
great and I was aware of that

1543
00:57:59,700 --> 00:58:01,980
functionality and it's like yeah it's

1544
00:58:01,980 --> 00:58:04,079
moderately interesting but if you look

1545
00:58:04,079 --> 00:58:05,339
at this I don't know the font's a little

1546
00:58:05,339 --> 00:58:06,540
small there

1547
00:58:06,540 --> 00:58:08,760
you can search for specific sites or

1548
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:10,380
Pages great that's kind of how it's

1549
00:58:10,380 --> 00:58:12,780
designed or you can search the entire

1550
00:58:12,780 --> 00:58:13,800
web

1551
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:16,440
down at the bottom what is the point of

1552
00:58:16,440 --> 00:58:18,960
searching the entire web like like not

1553
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:20,700
just use Google thing right instead of

1554
00:58:20,700 --> 00:58:23,220
these programmable search engines

1555
00:58:23,220 --> 00:58:25,619
the reason why is this

1556
00:58:25,619 --> 00:58:27,839
you can actually API this up

1557
00:58:27,839 --> 00:58:29,520
you can set up a search for the entire

1558
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:30,359
web

1559
00:58:30,359 --> 00:58:32,460
add on whatever criteria you want or

1560
00:58:32,460 --> 00:58:34,380
leave it as empty and wide open as you

1561
00:58:34,380 --> 00:58:36,660
want and look at that 10 000 queries per

1562
00:58:36,660 --> 00:58:37,559
day

1563
00:58:37,559 --> 00:58:41,099
nice Json results you can script this so

1564
00:58:41,099 --> 00:58:42,960
you can have keywords criteria whatever

1565
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:44,700
it is you want and automatic alert

1566
00:58:44,700 --> 00:58:46,619
emails when you see it and you can start

1567
00:58:46,619 --> 00:58:48,599
adding in more logic potentially than

1568
00:58:48,599 --> 00:58:50,040
you could on like a Google alerts or

1569
00:58:50,040 --> 00:58:52,680
start cataloging things there is a ton

1570
00:58:52,680 --> 00:58:55,020
of potential here right like you see

1571
00:58:55,020 --> 00:58:57,299
search engine optimization like the SEO

1572
00:58:57,299 --> 00:58:59,880
tools like charging a ton of money just

1573
00:58:59,880 --> 00:59:01,200
trying to like catalog Google search

1574
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:02,940
results and certain things like that you

1575
00:59:02,940 --> 00:59:04,740
can do it for free right here using

1576
00:59:04,740 --> 00:59:07,380
these programmable search engines

1577
00:59:07,380 --> 00:59:10,859
here's a little bit of python code

1578
00:59:10,859 --> 00:59:12,660
to kind of go through

1579
00:59:12,660 --> 00:59:15,780
a list of Search terms and give you

1580
00:59:15,780 --> 00:59:17,700
results from these and you're like

1581
00:59:17,700 --> 00:59:20,339
that's great but I can't code

1582
00:59:20,339 --> 00:59:21,839
you know what

1583
00:59:21,839 --> 00:59:24,720
I was interviewing someone last week

1584
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:26,099
they said they had done a little bit of

1585
00:59:26,099 --> 00:59:28,440
pen testing and I said okay you've done

1586
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:29,579
a little bit of pen testing I'm like

1587
00:59:29,579 --> 00:59:32,040
assuming you know your Python's okay you

1588
00:59:32,040 --> 00:59:34,260
know what they said no but I have chat

1589
00:59:34,260 --> 00:59:38,099
GPT I swear to God not even making that

1590
00:59:38,099 --> 00:59:41,760
up not even making that up no but I have

1591
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:44,160
chat GPD I'm like respect right it's all

1592
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:46,079
fun and games though until chat GPT goes

1593
00:59:46,079 --> 00:59:47,160
down because you don't have that paid

1594
00:59:47,160 --> 00:59:50,099
membership right that code yeah I did

1595
00:59:50,099 --> 00:59:51,900
not write that code

1596
00:59:51,900 --> 00:59:54,000
give me some python code to use Google

1597
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:55,619
programmable search in this API to

1598
00:59:55,619 --> 00:59:57,780
search for term and report results here

1599
00:59:57,780 --> 01:00:00,559
we go tested it works like a chap

1600
01:00:00,559 --> 01:00:03,299
works like an absolute champ and now you

1601
01:00:03,299 --> 01:00:04,680
can just start adding things yeah if you

1602
01:00:04,680 --> 01:00:06,180
haven't played with chat GPT to write

1603
01:00:06,180 --> 01:00:09,240
your code yeah like it's kind of amazing

1604
01:00:09,240 --> 01:00:11,579
it really really kind of is right so

1605
01:00:11,579 --> 01:00:13,559
yeah programmable search engines like I

1606
01:00:13,559 --> 01:00:14,819
said if you're interested at all in

1607
01:00:14,819 --> 01:00:16,859
scripting that type of stuff check them

1608
01:00:16,859 --> 01:00:17,880
out they're kind of like a little cheat

1609
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:20,339
code and I am now officially out of time

1610
01:00:20,339 --> 01:00:22,020
thank you very much for coming if you

1611
01:00:22,020 --> 01:00:23,819
have any questions I'm six foot four I'm

1612
01:00:23,819 --> 01:00:25,619
tough to miss find me thank you all

1613
01:00:25,619 --> 01:00:27,340

1657
01:13:36,840 --> 01:13:40,280
I appreciate somebody's words

1658
01:13:42,900 --> 01:13:44,760
the problem is I want to walk I walk

1659
01:13:44,760 --> 01:13:48,719
yeah because I tend to want

1660
01:13:48,719 --> 01:13:52,620
off stage right are you attractive

1661
01:13:52,620 --> 01:13:56,040
yeah we're on track two tomorrow I think

1662
01:13:56,040 --> 01:13:57,900
track one and part three has mics that

1663
01:13:57,900 --> 01:13:59,699
you can walk around with this one not as

1664
01:13:59,699 --> 01:14:01,879
much

1665
01:14:02,640 --> 01:14:04,500
I do like that they blocked my view of

1666
01:14:04,500 --> 01:14:06,480
my my slides because I tend to point at

1667
01:14:06,480 --> 01:14:08,520
them and help anyone

1668
01:14:08,520 --> 01:14:10,520
um

1669
01:14:13,640 --> 01:14:16,020
my clicker will like allow me to like

1670
01:14:16,020 --> 01:14:18,960
come in on stuff but it'd be good

1671
01:14:18,960 --> 01:14:20,520
just waiting for a cue here because

1672
01:14:20,520 --> 01:14:23,420
we're a few minutes over it

1673
01:14:26,640 --> 01:14:29,000
well

1674
01:14:32,280 --> 01:14:35,719
yeah a sand destruction

1675
01:15:40,620 --> 01:15:43,340
you know

1676
01:15:49,500 --> 01:15:51,739
foreign

1677
01:16:35,040 --> 01:16:37,760
to talk fast

1678
01:16:38,100 --> 01:16:40,140
I've got a ton of slides too so I'm

1679
01:16:40,140 --> 01:16:42,719
already worried about times we'll see

1680
01:16:42,719 --> 01:16:44,840
you just laugh and roll yeah

1681
01:16:44,840 --> 01:16:48,140
let me go

1682
01:16:49,500 --> 01:16:50,940
it's a nice thing about like not having

1683
01:16:50,940 --> 01:16:52,920
a script is like you can speed up and

1684
01:16:52,920 --> 01:16:55,080
cut out the portions and you build

1685
01:16:55,080 --> 01:16:56,699
everything and literally you just have

1686
01:16:56,699 --> 01:17:00,320
to like talk faster

1687
01:17:02,520 --> 01:17:05,000
no

1688
01:17:05,460 --> 01:17:09,140
I I did check in back there

1689
01:17:11,940 --> 01:17:13,739
can you just give me a thumbs up and get

1690
01:17:13,739 --> 01:17:17,419
started I made a fancy introduction

1691
01:17:19,580 --> 01:17:21,600
I'll just stand up here until I see a

1692
01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:23,840
thumbs up

1693
01:17:26,699 --> 01:17:28,980
no we got

1694
01:17:28,980 --> 01:17:32,580
we have Cozy Bear turbine panda

1695
01:17:32,580 --> 01:17:35,580
imagine

1696
01:17:36,360 --> 01:17:37,500
yeah

1697
01:17:37,500 --> 01:17:39,540
I've got a little Cozy Bear that I can

1698
01:17:39,540 --> 01:17:42,019
go to my desk

1699
01:17:44,760 --> 01:17:46,800
I've seen the big ones

1700
01:17:46,800 --> 01:17:50,420
insane I don't know how much those costs

1701
01:17:50,420 --> 01:17:52,679
a little bit no it wouldn't fit right

1702
01:17:52,679 --> 01:17:53,880
yeah

1703
01:17:53,880 --> 01:17:56,040
I barely got this new oh you got a strap

1704
01:17:56,040 --> 01:17:57,659
into the power plant like a like a

1705
01:17:57,659 --> 01:17:58,980
shuttle right that's how you have to get

1706
01:17:58,980 --> 01:18:01,218
it home

1707
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:07,739
good morning Cactus cons

1708
01:18:07,739 --> 01:18:09,420
um today you have Ryan Thompson talk

1709
01:18:09,420 --> 01:18:11,460
about a peek inside an adversary toolkit

1710
01:18:11,460 --> 01:18:14,290
please welcome him to the stage

1711
01:18:14,290 --> 01:18:19,860
[Applause]

1712
01:18:19,860 --> 01:18:22,080
all right so I speak a lot of people in

1713
01:18:22,080 --> 01:18:23,100
the back of the room we've got some

1714
01:18:23,100 --> 01:18:24,719
seats up front I know that's always an

1715
01:18:24,719 --> 01:18:26,520
awkward call to action but uh we're

1716
01:18:26,520 --> 01:18:27,900
gonna be sharing some screenshots here

1717
01:18:27,900 --> 01:18:29,159
that

1718
01:18:29,159 --> 01:18:31,080
um I would love to make larger uh but

1719
01:18:31,080 --> 01:18:32,580
there's only so much room on the slide

1720
01:18:32,580 --> 01:18:34,620
and so if you are interested in being

1721
01:18:34,620 --> 01:18:35,820
able to read that the back of the room

1722
01:18:35,820 --> 01:18:37,199
is probably not the best place for that

1723
01:18:37,199 --> 01:18:39,060
so just want to get that out of the way

1724
01:18:39,060 --> 01:18:41,520
thank you all for coming to my talk

1725
01:18:41,520 --> 01:18:43,679
um I want to talk a little bit about who

1726
01:18:43,679 --> 01:18:45,780
I am who I am right why am I up here why

1727
01:18:45,780 --> 01:18:47,940
am I talking to you guys uh well I'm a

1728
01:18:47,940 --> 01:18:50,699
security researcher crowdstrike and uh

1729
01:18:50,699 --> 01:18:51,900
in the past I've done some threat

1730
01:18:51,900 --> 01:18:54,239
hunting I've done some instruction uh

1731
01:18:54,239 --> 01:18:56,159
I've also dabbled a little bit with some

1732
01:18:56,159 --> 01:18:58,140
Cloud uh Cloud infrastructure security

1733
01:18:58,140 --> 01:19:00,179
and so what you'll notice up here is

1734
01:19:00,179 --> 01:19:02,400
there's not a ton of red teaming so if

1735
01:19:02,400 --> 01:19:04,800
we go back one slide we're taking a peek

1736
01:19:04,800 --> 01:19:07,080
inside the adversary toolkit we're not

1737
01:19:07,080 --> 01:19:08,159
going to rummage around we're not going

1738
01:19:08,159 --> 01:19:09,900
to get super super deep and so if you

1739
01:19:09,900 --> 01:19:11,219
are a red team and you think man I'm

1740
01:19:11,219 --> 01:19:13,560
going to learn a new tactic probably not

1741
01:19:13,560 --> 01:19:15,060
the right talk so let's get that out of

1742
01:19:15,060 --> 01:19:18,000
the way real quick but what I do want to

1743
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:19,920
showcase is from a blue side we don't

1744
01:19:19,920 --> 01:19:21,659
get to look at how the adversaries are

1745
01:19:21,659 --> 01:19:23,280
leveraging their tools so that's the

1746
01:19:23,280 --> 01:19:25,320
focus of this talk

1747
01:19:25,320 --> 01:19:26,760
so with that said we're going to take a

1748
01:19:26,760 --> 01:19:28,560
look at the context for the the data and

1749
01:19:28,560 --> 01:19:29,880
the tools we're going to be using today

1750
01:19:29,880 --> 01:19:31,920
we're going to dive through four tools

1751
01:19:31,920 --> 01:19:33,140
those tools are going to be any desk

1752
01:19:33,140 --> 01:19:36,900
engrock sliver C2 and fscan and we'll

1753
01:19:36,900 --> 01:19:39,980
wrap it up with a quick summary

1754
01:19:40,860 --> 01:19:43,739
so work for crowdstrike right I support

1755
01:19:43,739 --> 01:19:45,480
the OverWatch team which is our threat

1756
01:19:45,480 --> 01:19:47,520
hunting service and so there's Telemetry

1757
01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:50,280
that's generated from endpoints the

1758
01:19:50,280 --> 01:19:51,900
process is much more complicated than

1759
01:19:51,900 --> 01:19:53,820
this but our Hunters are looking at that

1760
01:19:53,820 --> 01:19:55,440
data and most importantly they're

1761
01:19:55,440 --> 01:19:58,380
notifying the client this happens pretty

1762
01:19:58,380 --> 01:20:00,480
quickly as quickly as we can

1763
01:20:00,480 --> 01:20:03,420
and there's the the data that comes out

1764
01:20:03,420 --> 01:20:05,460
the other side are very much ioc focused

1765
01:20:05,460 --> 01:20:07,380
and hey we found these things here's the

1766
01:20:07,380 --> 01:20:09,540
the call to action for the client

1767
01:20:09,540 --> 01:20:11,340
so you can imagine that those

1768
01:20:11,340 --> 01:20:12,540
notifications you couldn't very much

1769
01:20:12,540 --> 01:20:15,960
query and pull stats and metrics out of

1770
01:20:15,960 --> 01:20:18,239
and so that's where my team comes in we

1771
01:20:18,239 --> 01:20:19,679
get handed the intrusions after the

1772
01:20:19,679 --> 01:20:21,239
hunters find them and we do a

1773
01:20:21,239 --> 01:20:23,040
post-mortem analysis on those we

1774
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:24,719
normalize that data and we're able to

1775
01:20:24,719 --> 01:20:26,820
pull stats and Trends and so get a

1776
01:20:26,820 --> 01:20:28,260
little image up there of the threat

1777
01:20:28,260 --> 01:20:30,480
Hunter report my team is responsible for

1778
01:20:30,480 --> 01:20:32,400
for generating that and kind of pulling

1779
01:20:32,400 --> 01:20:34,260
those stats together

1780
01:20:34,260 --> 01:20:36,960
so when I when I tell people that I look

1781
01:20:36,960 --> 01:20:38,520
at all the intrusions that are happening

1782
01:20:38,520 --> 01:20:40,980
from e-crime and targeted a nation state

1783
01:20:40,980 --> 01:20:42,600
they say great I want to know the top

1784
01:20:42,600 --> 01:20:45,659
tools what what are the adversars using

1785
01:20:45,659 --> 01:20:46,980
and I hate to break it to you it's not

1786
01:20:46,980 --> 01:20:48,900
very exciting when we look at the top

1787
01:20:48,900 --> 01:20:51,840
Tools in 2020 it's Mimi cats it's Cobalt

1788
01:20:51,840 --> 01:20:54,900
strike PS exec right proctom and so from

1789
01:20:54,900 --> 01:20:56,640
year to year surprise surprise it

1790
01:20:56,640 --> 01:20:58,320
doesn't change all that much

1791
01:20:58,320 --> 01:20:59,820
and so everyone immediately wants to

1792
01:20:59,820 --> 01:21:01,020
know I need to know that you're the top

1793
01:21:01,020 --> 01:21:02,460
five the top ten that's going to make a

1794
01:21:02,460 --> 01:21:04,860
great BuzzFeed list right and inherently

1795
01:21:04,860 --> 01:21:06,480
it's just not very interesting and so

1796
01:21:06,480 --> 01:21:07,800
this year we decided to do something a

1797
01:21:07,800 --> 01:21:08,820
little bit different

1798
01:21:08,820 --> 01:21:11,640
and we broke up our tools into three

1799
01:21:11,640 --> 01:21:14,159
classifications Mainstay which is

1800
01:21:14,159 --> 01:21:15,840
historically what would be a top five or

1801
01:21:15,840 --> 01:21:17,760
top ten list those have been around for

1802
01:21:17,760 --> 01:21:19,500
a while and are used very heavily

1803
01:21:19,500 --> 01:21:21,420
we have trending they're not new to the

1804
01:21:21,420 --> 01:21:23,760
environment but we're seeing usage uh

1805
01:21:23,760 --> 01:21:26,640
increase right and the last one is

1806
01:21:26,640 --> 01:21:29,040
emerging this isn't to say that the tool

1807
01:21:29,040 --> 01:21:30,420
is brand new but it's the first time

1808
01:21:30,420 --> 01:21:32,760
we're seeing it in our data sets

1809
01:21:32,760 --> 01:21:34,380
So speaking of that

1810
01:21:34,380 --> 01:21:36,840
let's provide some some caveats I'm

1811
01:21:36,840 --> 01:21:38,100
going to go back one slide real quick so

1812
01:21:38,100 --> 01:21:39,540
this gentleman can get a picture I got

1813
01:21:39,540 --> 01:21:40,739
you

1814
01:21:40,739 --> 01:21:42,480
uh I'm also going to post these slides

1815
01:21:42,480 --> 01:21:45,259
on LinkedIn so

1816
01:21:46,020 --> 01:21:47,940
all right a little bit of context about

1817
01:21:47,940 --> 01:21:49,260
what we're talking talking about today

1818
01:21:49,260 --> 01:21:52,020
the first thing the the first Keyhole or

1819
01:21:52,020 --> 01:21:53,880
aperture that we're looking through

1820
01:21:53,880 --> 01:21:56,460
these are based on OverWatch intrusion

1821
01:21:56,460 --> 01:21:58,560
so obviously it's only customers of

1822
01:21:58,560 --> 01:22:01,080
OverWatch uh only ones that are being

1823
01:22:01,080 --> 01:22:02,760
caught by our threat hunters and it may

1824
01:22:02,760 --> 01:22:04,380
be not caught necessarily by the product

1825
01:22:04,380 --> 01:22:07,080
or the automated detections and then

1826
01:22:07,080 --> 01:22:09,300
even more specific we're looking at

1827
01:22:09,300 --> 01:22:11,100
Hands-On intrusions so if there's

1828
01:22:11,100 --> 01:22:12,540
automated malware that's being dropped

1829
01:22:12,540 --> 01:22:13,860
that's not really an interest for our

1830
01:22:13,860 --> 01:22:15,239
team we're looking for interactive

1831
01:22:15,239 --> 01:22:16,320
sessions

1832
01:22:16,320 --> 01:22:17,400
so

1833
01:22:17,400 --> 01:22:19,500
the next caveat we cannot get

1834
01:22:19,500 --> 01:22:20,880
screenshots from our clients and if we

1835
01:22:20,880 --> 01:22:22,080
could I wouldn't be sharing them with

1836
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:22,860
you

1837
01:22:22,860 --> 01:22:24,900
all the things up here are from a lab

1838
01:22:24,900 --> 01:22:26,520
and so I just want to get that out of

1839
01:22:26,520 --> 01:22:27,900
the way we're not sharing anything we're

1840
01:22:27,900 --> 01:22:29,580
not leaking anything I wish we had the

1841
01:22:29,580 --> 01:22:31,800
capability to get this level of access

1842
01:22:31,800 --> 01:22:35,159
from a screenshot perspective we don't

1843
01:22:35,159 --> 01:22:37,980
final piece we are focused on adversary

1844
01:22:37,980 --> 01:22:39,600
intent and so we see a lot of these

1845
01:22:39,600 --> 01:22:41,280
tools ran we see them attempted to be

1846
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:43,080
used for certain things sometimes

1847
01:22:43,080 --> 01:22:44,340
they're blocked by Windows Defender

1848
01:22:44,340 --> 01:22:46,460
sometimes they're blocked by Falcon

1849
01:22:46,460 --> 01:22:49,140
we're not interested in that that's very

1850
01:22:49,140 --> 01:22:50,580
very complicated when we start talking

1851
01:22:50,580 --> 01:22:54,540
about the different protection policies

1852
01:22:54,540 --> 01:22:55,739
that are in place for some of these

1853
01:22:55,739 --> 01:22:57,600
sensors and some of these products I'm

1854
01:22:57,600 --> 01:22:58,860
focused on what is the adversary

1855
01:22:58,860 --> 01:23:01,800
intending to do with this tool so with

1856
01:23:01,800 --> 01:23:03,300
that said

1857
01:23:03,300 --> 01:23:05,460
here are the four tools again any desk

1858
01:23:05,460 --> 01:23:08,520
and grok sliver and afscan and so let's

1859
01:23:08,520 --> 01:23:11,420
go ahead and hop into it

1860
01:23:11,940 --> 01:23:14,520
any desk for anyone who's used it any

1861
01:23:14,520 --> 01:23:16,920
desk is just a remote access tool right

1862
01:23:16,920 --> 01:23:19,620
the idea is that you have a host maybe

1863
01:23:19,620 --> 01:23:21,300
at home maybe a desktop and you want to

1864
01:23:21,300 --> 01:23:23,159
access that on the go you've installed

1865
01:23:23,159 --> 01:23:24,840
an agent there you install an agent on

1866
01:23:24,840 --> 01:23:27,060
your laptop essentially it's it's a

1867
01:23:27,060 --> 01:23:29,640
really really easy RDP it can Traverse

1868
01:23:29,640 --> 01:23:30,960
over over the network you can password

1869
01:23:30,960 --> 01:23:32,880
protect it and that's kind of the

1870
01:23:32,880 --> 01:23:34,199
functionality of this tool there are

1871
01:23:34,199 --> 01:23:35,760
plenty of Alternatives out there but any

1872
01:23:35,760 --> 01:23:37,920
desk is the one that we see most

1873
01:23:37,920 --> 01:23:41,120
prevalently in our data set

1874
01:23:42,239 --> 01:23:44,940
so it's a Mainstay tool what can they do

1875
01:23:44,940 --> 01:23:48,000
with it well we see attackers using it

1876
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:49,560
for persistence as well as exfiltration

1877
01:23:49,560 --> 01:23:52,560
and the benefits of it is it's not some

1878
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:55,080
script that somebody ran or created and

1879
01:23:55,080 --> 01:23:56,820
it's on GitHub and you just download it

1880
01:23:56,820 --> 01:23:58,980
and it's not signed right it's an

1881
01:23:58,980 --> 01:24:00,840
official tool it's officially supported

1882
01:24:00,840 --> 01:24:02,460
and so it's likely going to bypass a lot

1883
01:24:02,460 --> 01:24:03,540
of AV

1884
01:24:03,540 --> 01:24:06,719
so that's why we see people using it

1885
01:24:06,719 --> 01:24:08,640
installation is super easy you don't

1886
01:24:08,640 --> 01:24:09,780
need to take these down it's in their

1887
01:24:09,780 --> 01:24:12,420
documentation but it's super easy

1888
01:24:12,420 --> 01:24:14,520
um they're able to run it from a command

1889
01:24:14,520 --> 01:24:15,960
line go ahead and use a dash install

1890
01:24:15,960 --> 01:24:18,060
start with windows so install it as a

1891
01:24:18,060 --> 01:24:18,960
service

1892
01:24:18,960 --> 01:24:20,640
update disabled so they're not getting

1893
01:24:20,640 --> 01:24:22,320
pestered about updates and then do it

1894
01:24:22,320 --> 01:24:24,420
silently right so pretty straightforward

1895
01:24:24,420 --> 01:24:26,880
nothing crazy there and then once you

1896
01:24:26,880 --> 01:24:29,400
get it installed in order to access it

1897
01:24:29,400 --> 01:24:32,820
remotely from another machine for for

1898
01:24:32,820 --> 01:24:34,140
that other machine to initiate you have

1899
01:24:34,140 --> 01:24:35,940
to set a password and so these are the

1900
01:24:35,940 --> 01:24:38,640
two major commands we see ran from there

1901
01:24:38,640 --> 01:24:39,600
unfortunately we don't have a lot of

1902
01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:40,739
visibility into what they're using the

1903
01:24:40,739 --> 01:24:43,140
tool for so I installed it and we're

1904
01:24:43,140 --> 01:24:43,920
like we're going to take a look at

1905
01:24:43,920 --> 01:24:46,980
what's possible within a desk

1906
01:24:46,980 --> 01:24:49,380
so real quick we have two different

1907
01:24:49,380 --> 01:24:51,239
hosts here and I've tried a designate

1908
01:24:51,239 --> 01:24:52,920
those best I can in the blue outline you

1909
01:24:52,920 --> 01:24:54,420
have the victim host in the red outline

1910
01:24:54,420 --> 01:24:56,280
you have the attacker host once again

1911
01:24:56,280 --> 01:24:58,560
slides have very limited space so I'm

1912
01:24:58,560 --> 01:24:59,820
trying to do the best I can with the

1913
01:24:59,820 --> 01:25:02,360
space I have

1914
01:25:02,400 --> 01:25:04,199
first of all once you get it set up and

1915
01:25:04,199 --> 01:25:06,480
you launch any desk and connect to a

1916
01:25:06,480 --> 01:25:08,340
host there will be a notification for

1917
01:25:08,340 --> 01:25:09,960
the victim there's gonna be something

1918
01:25:09,960 --> 01:25:11,460
that will flash on this screen briefly

1919
01:25:11,460 --> 01:25:13,140
and there will be a notification icon

1920
01:25:13,140 --> 01:25:15,540
now I'm hoping everyone in this in this

1921
01:25:15,540 --> 01:25:17,640
room would notice that jump on it and go

1922
01:25:17,640 --> 01:25:18,960
investigate it

1923
01:25:18,960 --> 01:25:22,140
some end users may not and so once you

1924
01:25:22,140 --> 01:25:23,940
get that access then you have a full GUI

1925
01:25:23,940 --> 01:25:25,860
and you have full interactive access to

1926
01:25:25,860 --> 01:25:27,300
that system depending on how it's

1927
01:25:27,300 --> 01:25:31,880
configured so no surprises so far

1928
01:25:32,880 --> 01:25:35,520
next up once you have established that

1929
01:25:35,520 --> 01:25:36,719
you've set the password and you can

1930
01:25:36,719 --> 01:25:38,280
access it you can actually go into a

1931
01:25:38,280 --> 01:25:40,739
file browser so no more interacting with

1932
01:25:40,739 --> 01:25:42,659
the GUI you have direct access to the

1933
01:25:42,659 --> 01:25:44,219
file system of your machine and their

1934
01:25:44,219 --> 01:25:46,679
machine side by side you have the upload

1935
01:25:46,679 --> 01:25:48,179
capability to say I'm going to select

1936
01:25:48,179 --> 01:25:50,760
this file on my my host and send it to

1937
01:25:50,760 --> 01:25:52,739
the victim host or you have the ability

1938
01:25:52,739 --> 01:25:54,719
to say hey that that file right there

1939
01:25:54,719 --> 01:25:56,400
that I found I want to go and grab that

1940
01:25:56,400 --> 01:25:57,960
so you can see that happening here on

1941
01:25:57,960 --> 01:25:59,280
the right hand side the attacker is

1942
01:25:59,280 --> 01:26:01,560
navigating to a Secrets folder

1943
01:26:01,560 --> 01:26:03,420
navigating to the desktop on their

1944
01:26:03,420 --> 01:26:05,520
folder or on their machine and clicking

1945
01:26:05,520 --> 01:26:07,440
download

1946
01:26:07,440 --> 01:26:09,060
and we can see that file has been

1947
01:26:09,060 --> 01:26:11,040
brought over inconveniently put in the

1948
01:26:11,040 --> 01:26:12,300
bottom right but it's been brought over

1949
01:26:12,300 --> 01:26:14,460
and now we have access to that and so

1950
01:26:14,460 --> 01:26:16,199
that's a way yes there is a blinking

1951
01:26:16,199 --> 01:26:17,820
notification there's no interactions

1952
01:26:17,820 --> 01:26:19,800
Windows Explorer isn't opening at all

1953
01:26:19,800 --> 01:26:21,420
and they have full access just kind of

1954
01:26:21,420 --> 01:26:24,080
browse through that

1955
01:26:25,380 --> 01:26:26,880
the other thing that I noticed is that

1956
01:26:26,880 --> 01:26:29,340
there's a sync clipboard capability so

1957
01:26:29,340 --> 01:26:31,440
on my host or my attacker machine you'll

1958
01:26:31,440 --> 01:26:32,820
notice that my clipboard is filled with

1959
01:26:32,820 --> 01:26:34,679
nonsense text

1960
01:26:34,679 --> 01:26:37,380
but once I connected this victim host I

1961
01:26:37,380 --> 01:26:39,659
can actually go through there and say by

1962
01:26:39,659 --> 01:26:41,340
the way I would like to go synchronize

1963
01:26:41,340 --> 01:26:43,560
our clipboards so at this point I'm

1964
01:26:43,560 --> 01:26:44,820
still really not touching that other

1965
01:26:44,820 --> 01:26:47,460
machine sure the notification is there

1966
01:26:47,460 --> 01:26:49,380
but now we just kind of play the waiting

1967
01:26:49,380 --> 01:26:51,420
game we can watch that that user we can

1968
01:26:51,420 --> 01:26:53,040
see what they're doing let's say I don't

1969
01:26:53,040 --> 01:26:55,260
know maybe they want to log into a bank

1970
01:26:55,260 --> 01:26:57,300
they can open up that and let's say

1971
01:26:57,300 --> 01:26:58,739
they're practicing really good hygiene

1972
01:26:58,739 --> 01:27:00,900
maybe they're using one pass so they

1973
01:27:00,900 --> 01:27:02,159
grab it

1974
01:27:02,159 --> 01:27:03,900
put it into the browser and go and

1975
01:27:03,900 --> 01:27:05,639
authenticate well because we're

1976
01:27:05,639 --> 01:27:07,560
synchronizing clipboards that is now on

1977
01:27:07,560 --> 01:27:09,540
the clipboard of the attacker machine

1978
01:27:09,540 --> 01:27:11,820
and so I would love to say that I have

1979
01:27:11,820 --> 01:27:13,860
absolute proof that this is being used

1980
01:27:13,860 --> 01:27:16,320
um we don't all the any desk commands

1981
01:27:16,320 --> 01:27:18,120
and and all the communications are

1982
01:27:18,120 --> 01:27:19,620
encrypted so all we know is it's being

1983
01:27:19,620 --> 01:27:20,820
installed and I know this is a

1984
01:27:20,820 --> 01:27:22,080
capability

1985
01:27:22,080 --> 01:27:25,080
now this is a highly intensive probably

1986
01:27:25,080 --> 01:27:27,060
super targeted approach right you have

1987
01:27:27,060 --> 01:27:28,500
to wait until a user puts something on

1988
01:27:28,500 --> 01:27:30,480
their clipboard unlikely but not

1989
01:27:30,480 --> 01:27:32,900
impossible

1990
01:27:33,659 --> 01:27:36,360
so the problem with using uh legitimate

1991
01:27:36,360 --> 01:27:38,699
tools something like any desk is that it

1992
01:27:38,699 --> 01:27:40,920
Crea it creates an uninstall option so

1993
01:27:40,920 --> 01:27:43,199
we see that here it's listed in the apps

1994
01:27:43,199 --> 01:27:44,820
and we have the ability to uninstall it

1995
01:27:44,820 --> 01:27:46,380
that's pretty typical we've all seen

1996
01:27:46,380 --> 01:27:48,300
this and interacted with it what you may

1997
01:27:48,300 --> 01:27:51,179
not know is all that's tucked away

1998
01:27:51,179 --> 01:27:53,820
inside of the registry so I went in and

1999
01:27:53,820 --> 01:27:57,000
I changed uh display version to hackers

2000
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:59,880
and instead of showing uh I don't know

2001
01:27:59,880 --> 01:28:01,280
what the version was before I think it's

2002
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:04,380
ad717 I can change that to hackers or

2003
01:28:04,380 --> 01:28:06,300
whatever value I really want another

2004
01:28:06,300 --> 01:28:07,560
interesting piece that I learned in

2005
01:28:07,560 --> 01:28:09,420
digging through the registry is that

2006
01:28:09,420 --> 01:28:11,100
there's an uninstalled string so when

2007
01:28:11,100 --> 01:28:13,139
you click that uninstall button this is

2008
01:28:13,139 --> 01:28:14,880
what this is the command that's ran it's

2009
01:28:14,880 --> 01:28:16,500
that can be changed to anything

2010
01:28:16,500 --> 01:28:19,080
but most importantly from evasion

2011
01:28:19,080 --> 01:28:22,199
perspective what do we want uh to do as

2012
01:28:22,199 --> 01:28:23,520
an attacker we want to hide that

2013
01:28:23,520 --> 01:28:25,920
entirely so we can either clear all the

2014
01:28:25,920 --> 01:28:29,520
values out of this registry key or

2015
01:28:29,520 --> 01:28:33,780
we can simply go in and remove a display

2016
01:28:33,780 --> 01:28:35,280
name so that's the command that's being

2017
01:28:35,280 --> 01:28:36,659
ran along the top I'm only going to

2018
01:28:36,659 --> 01:28:38,040
Target one value and I'm going to clear

2019
01:28:38,040 --> 01:28:39,360
it out

2020
01:28:39,360 --> 01:28:41,159
and so when we run this

2021
01:28:41,159 --> 01:28:43,199
and update everything it's going to take

2022
01:28:43,199 --> 01:28:45,300
a few seconds here for me to refresh the

2023
01:28:45,300 --> 01:28:48,000
screens what you'll find is the display

2024
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:49,500
name on the right hand side is going to

2025
01:28:49,500 --> 01:28:51,900
disappear when I update my registry View

2026
01:28:51,900 --> 01:28:53,880
we noticed it's gone now it goes display

2027
01:28:53,880 --> 01:28:55,920
icon to display version and then when I

2028
01:28:55,920 --> 01:28:57,480
refresh it over here

2029
01:28:57,480 --> 01:29:00,300
any desk no longer populates this is a

2030
01:29:00,300 --> 01:29:01,980
Technique we see happening happening

2031
01:29:01,980 --> 01:29:03,900
often and so once again the idea here is

2032
01:29:03,900 --> 01:29:05,400
that we're just trying to hide the fact

2033
01:29:05,400 --> 01:29:08,780
that it exists for later use

2034
01:29:11,580 --> 01:29:14,100
so what do we do about this

2035
01:29:14,100 --> 01:29:15,780
um I put application white listing up

2036
01:29:15,780 --> 01:29:17,159
here knowing that's very much like a

2037
01:29:17,159 --> 01:29:18,360
draw the rest of the owl type

2038
01:29:18,360 --> 01:29:20,639
recommendation it's it's very difficult

2039
01:29:20,639 --> 01:29:22,320
to to implement but that that is

2040
01:29:22,320 --> 01:29:24,060
absolutely an option

2041
01:29:24,060 --> 01:29:26,520
we can block certain ports

2042
01:29:26,520 --> 01:29:27,900
um now keep in mind that the only

2043
01:29:27,900 --> 01:29:29,639
downside to this is that if this is used

2044
01:29:29,639 --> 01:29:31,980
for localhost Discovery so if you were

2045
01:29:31,980 --> 01:29:33,540
to install any desk on one machine on

2046
01:29:33,540 --> 01:29:35,699
your local network and install it on

2047
01:29:35,699 --> 01:29:37,080
another they're going to try to

2048
01:29:37,080 --> 01:29:40,620
communicate over these you know 50 000

2049
01:29:40,620 --> 01:29:42,840
level ports and so you can block that

2050
01:29:42,840 --> 01:29:44,699
local Discovery I think the best way to

2051
01:29:44,699 --> 01:29:48,139
do is to Black Hole a.net dot any desk

2052
01:29:48,139 --> 01:29:50,699
because even if it's installed

2053
01:29:50,699 --> 01:29:52,860
that service cannot connect to the nades

2054
01:29:52,860 --> 01:29:56,719
network and therefore attackers get

2055
01:29:57,719 --> 01:30:00,540
so up next is ungrock this one was kind

2056
01:30:00,540 --> 01:30:02,699
of interesting to me this is a I don't

2057
01:30:02,699 --> 01:30:04,320
know I I think more of a fun thing to

2058
01:30:04,320 --> 01:30:05,639
look at from

2059
01:30:05,639 --> 01:30:08,219
um how easy it is and how much of an

2060
01:30:08,219 --> 01:30:10,620
impact it has so what is it

2061
01:30:10,620 --> 01:30:12,719
in Greg is reverse proxy

2062
01:30:12,719 --> 01:30:14,520
um kind of offers itself as a tunneling

2063
01:30:14,520 --> 01:30:16,560
service there are tons of Alternatives

2064
01:30:16,560 --> 01:30:19,620
out there and what's Wild is how easy it

2065
01:30:19,620 --> 01:30:20,639
is to use

2066
01:30:20,639 --> 01:30:23,400
so when we look at I think one of my

2067
01:30:23,400 --> 01:30:24,360
favorite things I just went and browse

2068
01:30:24,360 --> 01:30:25,440
their website

2069
01:30:25,440 --> 01:30:27,600
this is what uh

2070
01:30:27,600 --> 01:30:28,920
oops there we go this is what their

2071
01:30:28,920 --> 01:30:30,480
their website looks like

2072
01:30:30,480 --> 01:30:32,699
it's in it this is the marketing it's

2073
01:30:32,699 --> 01:30:34,260
like oh we're going to enable SSH access

2074
01:30:34,260 --> 01:30:35,820
with one command we're gonna put

2075
01:30:35,820 --> 01:30:37,620
localhost on the internet we're gonna

2076
01:30:37,620 --> 01:30:39,060
connect to networks without pain which

2077
01:30:39,060 --> 01:30:40,320
hopefully for everyone in this room

2078
01:30:40,320 --> 01:30:42,300
sounds like a nightmare

2079
01:30:42,300 --> 01:30:44,639
from a different perspective though this

2080
01:30:44,639 --> 01:30:47,100
is exactly what developers want to do in

2081
01:30:47,100 --> 01:30:48,840
a lot of cases just to to get something

2082
01:30:48,840 --> 01:30:50,580
up and running and to test it to make

2083
01:30:50,580 --> 01:30:52,739
sure that it's a viable product and so

2084
01:30:52,739 --> 01:30:54,179
that's how they're they're positioning

2085
01:30:54,179 --> 01:30:55,980
this I took a lot of these I said you

2086
01:30:55,980 --> 01:30:57,239
know I could probably make a vendor ad

2087
01:30:57,239 --> 01:30:59,280
pretty easily by just changing the

2088
01:30:59,280 --> 01:31:01,739
background and moving those same lines

2089
01:31:01,739 --> 01:31:02,580
over

2090
01:31:02,580 --> 01:31:04,440
and that's exactly right it's a

2091
01:31:04,440 --> 01:31:05,820
different perspective

2092
01:31:05,820 --> 01:31:08,060
um the one thing I will say about ngrok

2093
01:31:08,060 --> 01:31:09,840
adversaries don't put the proper

2094
01:31:09,840 --> 01:31:12,420
Protections in place but ngark allows

2095
01:31:12,420 --> 01:31:14,040
you to so if you wanted to use enggar

2096
01:31:14,040 --> 01:31:16,020
legitimately you can do SSO you can do

2097
01:31:16,020 --> 01:31:19,500
saml you can do MFA and so those

2098
01:31:19,500 --> 01:31:21,239
capabilities exist

2099
01:31:21,239 --> 01:31:22,560
I have a series obvious that aren't

2100
01:31:22,560 --> 01:31:24,179
doing that so let's let's take a look at

2101
01:31:24,179 --> 01:31:26,340
how it works

2102
01:31:26,340 --> 01:31:28,199
we we've seen this for a while but it's

2103
01:31:28,199 --> 01:31:31,020
starting to see more use really these

2104
01:31:31,020 --> 01:31:32,460
adversaries whether they're nation state

2105
01:31:32,460 --> 01:31:33,960
whether they're e-crime they've got run

2106
01:31:33,960 --> 01:31:36,120
books and over time they learn about new

2107
01:31:36,120 --> 01:31:37,080
tools and they add them to the

2108
01:31:37,080 --> 01:31:38,880
repertoire and so this is absolutely one

2109
01:31:38,880 --> 01:31:39,960
of those that we're seeing starting to

2110
01:31:39,960 --> 01:31:42,360
Trend upwards we're seeing it used for

2111
01:31:42,360 --> 01:31:44,159
command and control and then x-fill so

2112
01:31:44,159 --> 01:31:46,139
I'll show both examples of those and

2113
01:31:46,139 --> 01:31:47,340
once again the benefits for the

2114
01:31:47,340 --> 01:31:48,900
adversary are absolutely the same as any

2115
01:31:48,900 --> 01:31:52,139
desk it's a legitimate application

2116
01:31:52,139 --> 01:31:54,360
so I want to break down how it works I

2117
01:31:54,360 --> 01:31:55,560
didn't want to put in a whole lot of

2118
01:31:55,560 --> 01:31:57,540
theory slides but I think it's important

2119
01:31:57,540 --> 01:31:59,340
to know what's happening here so an

2120
01:31:59,340 --> 01:32:00,900
adversary usually can't reach out to a

2121
01:32:00,900 --> 01:32:03,420
specific host because well there may be

2122
01:32:03,420 --> 01:32:04,800
a firewall in place blocking that

2123
01:32:04,800 --> 01:32:07,199
connection that host may actually not

2124
01:32:07,199 --> 01:32:09,540
have a public IP maybe it's netted and

2125
01:32:09,540 --> 01:32:10,860
so there's no way for them to directly

2126
01:32:10,860 --> 01:32:14,340
access that host for the most part

2127
01:32:14,340 --> 01:32:18,060
and so how engrock works is once you

2128
01:32:18,060 --> 01:32:19,380
install that or once you move that

2129
01:32:19,380 --> 01:32:21,360
binary over and you run it

2130
01:32:21,360 --> 01:32:24,360
that host reaches out to DNS uh

2131
01:32:24,360 --> 01:32:27,179
communicates with the engrock service

2132
01:32:27,179 --> 01:32:30,600
and opens up a tunnel over Port 443 now

2133
01:32:30,600 --> 01:32:32,639
from a blue side what we're looking at

2134
01:32:32,639 --> 01:32:34,199
is just an outbound outbound

2135
01:32:34,199 --> 01:32:36,300
Communication number 443 nothing nothing

2136
01:32:36,300 --> 01:32:39,300
crazy there very difficult to block and

2137
01:32:39,300 --> 01:32:42,679
that communication is held open

2138
01:32:43,080 --> 01:32:46,080
now the adversary has a ngrok domain

2139
01:32:46,080 --> 01:32:47,639
that they can access they access the

2140
01:32:47,639 --> 01:32:49,139
Android service and it pushes it through

2141
01:32:49,139 --> 01:32:51,060
that tunnel and so you never see an

2142
01:32:51,060 --> 01:32:52,920
incoming connection so to speak so

2143
01:32:52,920 --> 01:32:56,000
that's what makes this really dangerous

2144
01:32:56,219 --> 01:32:58,440
so this is literally the command you run

2145
01:32:58,440 --> 01:33:01,440
you run ngrok TCP 22

2146
01:33:01,440 --> 01:33:03,840
it's going to reach out to engrock give

2147
01:33:03,840 --> 01:33:05,280
you a domain and the domain in this case

2148
01:33:05,280 --> 01:33:08,880
is right here this four tcpng.io and

2149
01:33:08,880 --> 01:33:12,060
then overport uh what is that 11 200.

2150
01:33:12,060 --> 01:33:14,040
and that's all you need to access at

2151
01:33:14,040 --> 01:33:16,560
that point from anywhere so on my phone

2152
01:33:16,560 --> 01:33:18,719
I could go and say great I want to I

2153
01:33:18,719 --> 01:33:20,699
don't have an SSH client but if I did I

2154
01:33:20,699 --> 01:33:22,080
could access that from anywhere in the

2155
01:33:22,080 --> 01:33:23,040
world

2156
01:33:23,040 --> 01:33:24,960
here's what it looks like you see me

2157
01:33:24,960 --> 01:33:27,719
trying to SSH to my local host and it's

2158
01:33:27,719 --> 01:33:29,940
been shut down by the host firewall

2159
01:33:29,940 --> 01:33:32,760
but if I want to go and access that same

2160
01:33:32,760 --> 01:33:34,920
host through ngrok I can put in the

2161
01:33:34,920 --> 01:33:38,280
ngrok domain specify the port and enter

2162
01:33:38,280 --> 01:33:39,600
the password and all of a sudden I've

2163
01:33:39,600 --> 01:33:42,179
connected and so it bypasses a lot of

2164
01:33:42,179 --> 01:33:43,679
the traditional controls especially from

2165
01:33:43,679 --> 01:33:46,760
a perimeter perspective

2166
01:33:47,639 --> 01:33:49,679
another thing it can do so actually let

2167
01:33:49,679 --> 01:33:51,540
me back up for a second this here allows

2168
01:33:51,540 --> 01:33:54,540
you to host any port not just SSH and so

2169
01:33:54,540 --> 01:33:56,580
how it can be used is you could stand up

2170
01:33:56,580 --> 01:34:00,719
you know a python file server and tunnel

2171
01:34:00,719 --> 01:34:03,360
to that Port right and that that exposes

2172
01:34:03,360 --> 01:34:04,980
your files it's a little bit you know a

2173
01:34:04,980 --> 01:34:06,900
little bit extra work an extra step

2174
01:34:06,900 --> 01:34:08,460
and grock actually allows you to do that

2175
01:34:08,460 --> 01:34:10,620
with a single command as well you run

2176
01:34:10,620 --> 01:34:12,960
ngrok HTTP and point to the directory

2177
01:34:12,960 --> 01:34:14,460
that you want to point to

2178
01:34:14,460 --> 01:34:16,440
it says great I've given you a new

2179
01:34:16,440 --> 01:34:18,960
domain and I'll give you access to the

2180
01:34:18,960 --> 01:34:21,120
files in that that particular directory

2181
01:34:21,120 --> 01:34:23,580
so here it is in action they can

2182
01:34:23,580 --> 01:34:25,380
literally just drop it into a browser

2183
01:34:25,380 --> 01:34:29,159
and navigate right to your directory

2184
01:34:29,159 --> 01:34:32,280
and so pretty powerful for xfill um

2185
01:34:32,280 --> 01:34:34,320
once again not impossible to stop but

2186
01:34:34,320 --> 01:34:36,600
just another Avenue that we actively see

2187
01:34:36,600 --> 01:34:39,060
Avatar is using

2188
01:34:39,060 --> 01:34:41,040
so if I want to recommend anything once

2189
01:34:41,040 --> 01:34:42,239
again we're going to Black Hole domain

2190
01:34:42,239 --> 01:34:43,620
that's my favorite way to stop a lot of

2191
01:34:43,620 --> 01:34:45,900
these legitimate Services because they

2192
01:34:45,900 --> 01:34:47,580
have domains that don't change very

2193
01:34:47,580 --> 01:34:49,560
often and so if you block that all of a

2194
01:34:49,560 --> 01:34:51,179
sudden you see this this application

2195
01:34:51,179 --> 01:34:53,699
struggling to reach out it can't reach

2196
01:34:53,699 --> 01:34:56,820
its uh certification revocation list it

2197
01:34:56,820 --> 01:34:58,860
can't access the tunnel domain because I

2198
01:34:58,860 --> 01:35:00,540
block those and so it just shuts that

2199
01:35:00,540 --> 01:35:02,159
down so you can download engrock all you

2200
01:35:02,159 --> 01:35:03,900
want but once you launch it you're not

2201
01:35:03,900 --> 01:35:05,760
getting out now

2202
01:35:05,760 --> 01:35:08,100
once again maybe you can specify a

2203
01:35:08,100 --> 01:35:09,960
different uh a different DNS server

2204
01:35:09,960 --> 01:35:12,000
depending on how a network is configured

2205
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,100
maybe you reach out to 8.8.8 and you get

2206
01:35:14,100 --> 01:35:16,460
around that

2207
01:35:16,620 --> 01:35:19,500
all right sliver

2208
01:35:19,500 --> 01:35:21,840
I want to fully get ahead of this bishop

2209
01:35:21,840 --> 01:35:24,659
Fox is here as a sponsor and they are

2210
01:35:24,659 --> 01:35:25,980
definitely more of an expert in this

2211
01:35:25,980 --> 01:35:28,139
tool than I am I think one of the people

2212
01:35:28,139 --> 01:35:29,760
who actually wrote slivers here and so

2213
01:35:29,760 --> 01:35:31,440
hit them up if you have any further

2214
01:35:31,440 --> 01:35:32,820
questions beyond what I'm I'm going to

2215
01:35:32,820 --> 01:35:35,179
show you here

2216
01:35:36,540 --> 01:35:38,639
so what is sliver it's a C2 framework

2217
01:35:38,639 --> 01:35:41,520
it's built once again by Bishop Fox and

2218
01:35:41,520 --> 01:35:43,260
the intention is not necessarily for it

2219
01:35:43,260 --> 01:35:44,820
to be an adversary tool it's meant to do

2220
01:35:44,820 --> 01:35:47,400
red team engagements and as we know if

2221
01:35:47,400 --> 01:35:49,380
we build really good teams for our blue

2222
01:35:49,380 --> 01:35:51,300
slash red team adversaries are going to

2223
01:35:51,300 --> 01:35:52,760
pick those up and start leveraging them

2224
01:35:52,760 --> 01:35:54,900
the Alternatives here are your

2225
01:35:54,900 --> 01:35:56,940
traditional Cobalt strike or Metasploit

2226
01:35:56,940 --> 01:35:58,800
or Covenant

2227
01:35:58,800 --> 01:36:01,199
um now the big Advantage here for sliver

2228
01:36:01,199 --> 01:36:05,120
is that it's free it's open source

2229
01:36:05,400 --> 01:36:07,020
with that we do see it as a trending

2230
01:36:07,020 --> 01:36:09,060
tool it's not entirely new but we do see

2231
01:36:09,060 --> 01:36:10,260
adversaries starting to pick that up

2232
01:36:10,260 --> 01:36:11,760
more and more they're using it for

2233
01:36:11,760 --> 01:36:13,080
command and control and exfiltration

2234
01:36:13,080 --> 01:36:15,060
just like the last tool but also there's

2235
01:36:15,060 --> 01:36:17,580
some pretty nifty defensive Asian tricks

2236
01:36:17,580 --> 01:36:19,560
in there so not only is it free but

2237
01:36:19,560 --> 01:36:21,900
every time you generate an implant it

2238
01:36:21,900 --> 01:36:23,820
dynamically creates that to where it

2239
01:36:23,820 --> 01:36:25,080
doesn't have the same hash every time

2240
01:36:25,080 --> 01:36:26,639
and you'll have to manually go keep

2241
01:36:26,639 --> 01:36:29,340
evading things one interesting thing to

2242
01:36:29,340 --> 01:36:31,560
note here is that I downloaded it with

2243
01:36:31,560 --> 01:36:33,600
Microsoft Edge and Microsoft Edge says

2244
01:36:33,600 --> 01:36:36,420
hey I can't tell you this binary is bad

2245
01:36:36,420 --> 01:36:38,100
but it's pretty rare we've never seen

2246
01:36:38,100 --> 01:36:39,659
this executable downloaded before which

2247
01:36:39,659 --> 01:36:41,040
I think is a cool functionality that

2248
01:36:41,040 --> 01:36:43,080
browsers are starting to implement so

2249
01:36:43,080 --> 01:36:45,780
even if they don't have a true match on

2250
01:36:45,780 --> 01:36:48,780
the md5 and it being a known bad bad

2251
01:36:48,780 --> 01:36:51,060
file it'll let you know hey this is rare

2252
01:36:51,060 --> 01:36:52,980
and quite frankly Microsoft Edge sees

2253
01:36:52,980 --> 01:36:54,120
enough traffic to where they can make

2254
01:36:54,120 --> 01:36:56,580
that determination

2255
01:36:56,580 --> 01:36:58,440
gaining popularity

2256
01:36:58,440 --> 01:37:01,020
I I was just trying to get to sliver's

2257
01:37:01,020 --> 01:37:02,219
webpage and I just kept getting

2258
01:37:02,219 --> 01:37:03,780
bombarded with all these articles it's

2259
01:37:03,780 --> 01:37:05,400
like hey adversaries are using this over

2260
01:37:05,400 --> 01:37:07,380
Cobalt strike so very clearly

2261
01:37:07,380 --> 01:37:09,300
crowdstrike isn't the only one seeing

2262
01:37:09,300 --> 01:37:11,600
that shift

2263
01:37:13,739 --> 01:37:15,000
so I had to stand up a little bit of

2264
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:16,920
infrastructure to get this to work I

2265
01:37:16,920 --> 01:37:18,239
thought about just skipping over this

2266
01:37:18,239 --> 01:37:21,239
but once again if you're a blue teamer

2267
01:37:21,239 --> 01:37:22,440
that doesn't have a whole lot of red

2268
01:37:22,440 --> 01:37:24,540
team experience I mean like me quite

2269
01:37:24,540 --> 01:37:26,460
frankly it's important to know what the

2270
01:37:26,460 --> 01:37:27,840
adversary has to do to get these things

2271
01:37:27,840 --> 01:37:28,800
to work

2272
01:37:28,800 --> 01:37:30,960
so first up um I could have done this

2273
01:37:30,960 --> 01:37:33,179
locally the way they're leveraging it is

2274
01:37:33,179 --> 01:37:34,320
going to be through the open internet

2275
01:37:34,320 --> 01:37:38,760
through uh usually a fresh domain uh and

2276
01:37:38,760 --> 01:37:40,020
so that's where I started started with

2277
01:37:40,020 --> 01:37:41,340
Google domains

2278
01:37:41,340 --> 01:37:43,620
I I bought a domain and then I spun up

2279
01:37:43,620 --> 01:37:46,139
an AWS ec2 instance trying to keep my

2280
01:37:46,139 --> 01:37:48,719
costs pretty low and once you have those

2281
01:37:48,719 --> 01:37:51,120
two you can set the domain or the DNS

2282
01:37:51,120 --> 01:37:53,580
records for that new domain to redirect

2283
01:37:53,580 --> 01:37:56,219
to that AWS environment and so once

2284
01:37:56,219 --> 01:37:57,780
again this is not my strength this is

2285
01:37:57,780 --> 01:37:59,460
not my background took me half a morning

2286
01:37:59,460 --> 01:38:02,400
to get all this stood up and so as you

2287
01:38:02,400 --> 01:38:03,719
operationalize this this could

2288
01:38:03,719 --> 01:38:05,400
absolutely be automated you start

2289
01:38:05,400 --> 01:38:07,260
putting in randomly generated domains

2290
01:38:07,260 --> 01:38:09,840
it's very low lift for adversaries to

2291
01:38:09,840 --> 01:38:12,420
stand up this basic infrastructure

2292
01:38:12,420 --> 01:38:15,360
so what does that mean for everything

2293
01:38:15,360 --> 01:38:17,580
important things to note here

2294
01:38:17,580 --> 01:38:19,080
if you go to this tiny fragment of

2295
01:38:19,080 --> 01:38:22,980
wood.com it will redirect you to my IP

2296
01:38:22,980 --> 01:38:25,739
address of my ec2 instance now what's

2297
01:38:25,739 --> 01:38:27,179
what's crucial about this is because I

2298
01:38:27,179 --> 01:38:28,920
registered it through Google

2299
01:38:28,920 --> 01:38:31,739
and I haven't really changed any of the

2300
01:38:31,739 --> 01:38:34,320
defaults with the authoritative answer

2301
01:38:34,320 --> 01:38:37,260
for that DNS query is this nscloud Dash

2302
01:38:37,260 --> 01:38:39,900
D1 Google domain so basically what that

2303
01:38:39,900 --> 01:38:42,780
means is the source of Truth for where

2304
01:38:42,780 --> 01:38:44,639
that domain should be redirected it

2305
01:38:44,639 --> 01:38:46,080
lives with Google

2306
01:38:46,080 --> 01:38:48,120
and so if I send a DNS request it's just

2307
01:38:48,120 --> 01:38:49,920
going to go to the Google uh

2308
01:38:49,920 --> 01:38:52,020
infrastructure so as an attacker that's

2309
01:38:52,020 --> 01:38:54,120
not very helpful for me now sure I could

2310
01:38:54,120 --> 01:38:55,800
adjust this to send it somewhere else

2311
01:38:55,800 --> 01:38:57,600
and that's exactly what I did in the

2312
01:38:57,600 --> 01:38:59,400
second one I created a subdomain called

2313
01:38:59,400 --> 01:39:01,320
really tiny fragment of wood

2314
01:39:01,320 --> 01:39:03,659
created some some DNS records and so now

2315
01:39:03,659 --> 01:39:05,760
the source of truth lies directly at

2316
01:39:05,760 --> 01:39:08,880
that ec2 instance and so now when anyone

2317
01:39:08,880 --> 01:39:11,699
on the internet makes a query for you

2318
01:39:11,699 --> 01:39:13,500
know this new domain or the subdomain

2319
01:39:13,500 --> 01:39:16,020
that DNS request is going to be sent and

2320
01:39:16,020 --> 01:39:18,239
directed to that ec2 instance so not

2321
01:39:18,239 --> 01:39:19,739
only am I sending traffic we're just

2322
01:39:19,739 --> 01:39:21,540
talking DNS record or DNS queries are

2323
01:39:21,540 --> 01:39:24,320
now heading that way too

2324
01:39:24,960 --> 01:39:27,360
so we got our infrastructure in place

2325
01:39:27,360 --> 01:39:29,760
let's go and install it once again I

2326
01:39:29,760 --> 01:39:31,260
keep coming back to this these tools are

2327
01:39:31,260 --> 01:39:32,880
incredibly easy to use and that's why we

2328
01:39:32,880 --> 01:39:34,920
see adversaries leveraging them so in

2329
01:39:34,920 --> 01:39:37,199
this case it's the one-liner for for a

2330
01:39:37,199 --> 01:39:39,600
Linux installation we're literally just

2331
01:39:39,600 --> 01:39:41,699
curling it passing over to bash and it's

2332
01:39:41,699 --> 01:39:43,380
doing all the work for you I think maybe

2333
01:39:43,380 --> 01:39:45,060
I had to type in a y for yes at some

2334
01:39:45,060 --> 01:39:48,659
point that was a super super easy

2335
01:39:48,659 --> 01:39:52,020
the next thing is great the DNS Network

2336
01:39:52,020 --> 01:39:54,659
the the the hive mind knows to send it

2337
01:39:54,659 --> 01:39:56,580
to this IP address but it doesn't do any

2338
01:39:56,580 --> 01:39:58,620
good if that host isn't listening for

2339
01:39:58,620 --> 01:40:00,659
DNS traffic or if it's not expecting to

2340
01:40:00,659 --> 01:40:03,600
process DNS queries so the first thing I

2341
01:40:03,600 --> 01:40:06,000
did was open up a security group within

2342
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:09,179
AWS to allow Port 53 to through and then

2343
01:40:09,179 --> 01:40:10,620
the other thing is I boot up sliver and

2344
01:40:10,620 --> 01:40:12,420
I said great I need to start a DNS

2345
01:40:12,420 --> 01:40:14,580
listener once again a one-liner I said

2346
01:40:14,580 --> 01:40:17,159
DNS Dash domains and I put the domain in

2347
01:40:17,159 --> 01:40:18,659
so now all of a sudden that service is

2348
01:40:18,659 --> 01:40:20,820
actively listening the security group is

2349
01:40:20,820 --> 01:40:22,380
allowing that traffic through and we're

2350
01:40:22,380 --> 01:40:25,400
ready to ready ready to go

2351
01:40:25,920 --> 01:40:27,780
generating an implant that's the next

2352
01:40:27,780 --> 01:40:29,760
step of a C2 infrastructure that's great

2353
01:40:29,760 --> 01:40:30,900
you have everything listening you're

2354
01:40:30,900 --> 01:40:33,060
waiting who's going to reach out well

2355
01:40:33,060 --> 01:40:35,040
that's where your implants come in so

2356
01:40:35,040 --> 01:40:36,719
once again it's a one-liner we're going

2357
01:40:36,719 --> 01:40:39,000
to generate a beacon we'll go into the

2358
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:41,340
options here in a second but in this

2359
01:40:41,340 --> 01:40:44,280
case I'm focused on DNS uh DNS implants

2360
01:40:44,280 --> 01:40:47,340
I put the uh the domain that I've

2361
01:40:47,340 --> 01:40:49,139
redirected and I've determined where

2362
01:40:49,139 --> 01:40:50,520
it's going to be saved and you can even

2363
01:40:50,520 --> 01:40:53,219
specify uh operating system here so here

2364
01:40:53,219 --> 01:40:56,520
are some of the options DNS HTTP mtls

2365
01:40:56,520 --> 01:40:58,020
and wireguard are all options for

2366
01:40:58,020 --> 01:40:59,940
protocols I stuck with DNS for this one

2367
01:40:59,940 --> 01:41:00,659
because that's where I'm most

2368
01:41:00,659 --> 01:41:01,800
comfortable at

2369
01:41:01,800 --> 01:41:03,360
and then from an operating system

2370
01:41:03,360 --> 01:41:05,340
perspective it's literally just a dash

2371
01:41:05,340 --> 01:41:07,139
OS and you can specify for whatever you

2372
01:41:07,139 --> 01:41:08,940
want and it'll dynamically generated for

2373
01:41:08,940 --> 01:41:11,040
any of those systems

2374
01:41:11,040 --> 01:41:12,659
the important thing to note here and

2375
01:41:12,659 --> 01:41:15,300
probably the most important flag is your

2376
01:41:15,300 --> 01:41:17,159
implant type and so this made some this

2377
01:41:17,159 --> 01:41:18,840
may be something that's not immediately

2378
01:41:18,840 --> 01:41:21,300
evident to people that haven't used this

2379
01:41:21,300 --> 01:41:23,040
before there's two different types

2380
01:41:23,040 --> 01:41:25,500
there's session and there's Beacon

2381
01:41:25,500 --> 01:41:27,540
and maybe you can see I don't need you

2382
01:41:27,540 --> 01:41:28,920
to read anything on this slide but maybe

2383
01:41:28,920 --> 01:41:30,420
you can see that the Wireshark on the

2384
01:41:30,420 --> 01:41:32,280
left hand side for session is going nuts

2385
01:41:32,280 --> 01:41:34,320
and basically it's sending out a ton of

2386
01:41:34,320 --> 01:41:36,900
DNS requests their text records going

2387
01:41:36,900 --> 01:41:38,400
out and they're hitting the attacker

2388
01:41:38,400 --> 01:41:41,040
infrastructure and so that's super noisy

2389
01:41:41,040 --> 01:41:42,540
and should be really really evident to

2390
01:41:42,540 --> 01:41:44,400
anyone that's even keeping a remote eye

2391
01:41:44,400 --> 01:41:45,420
on that

2392
01:41:45,420 --> 01:41:47,100
on the right hand side there's a beacon

2393
01:41:47,100 --> 01:41:49,560
implant and that's more of the the

2394
01:41:49,560 --> 01:41:52,080
method you use to stay kind of low and

2395
01:41:52,080 --> 01:41:55,020
silent and so it's setting it out I

2396
01:41:55,020 --> 01:41:56,460
think it's got some Jitter in there so

2397
01:41:56,460 --> 01:41:58,139
that means it's very there's a variation

2398
01:41:58,139 --> 01:41:59,580
for how often it reaches out but you're

2399
01:41:59,580 --> 01:42:01,020
seeing that once a minute or once every

2400
01:42:01,020 --> 01:42:03,119
two minutes and so of course looking at

2401
01:42:03,119 --> 01:42:04,380
this you're like well I want a beacon

2402
01:42:04,380 --> 01:42:05,580
implant I don't I don't want to be

2403
01:42:05,580 --> 01:42:08,159
making all this noise but from the

2404
01:42:08,159 --> 01:42:09,360
attacker's perspective there's an

2405
01:42:09,360 --> 01:42:11,400
advantage to how often the session

2406
01:42:11,400 --> 01:42:14,340
implant talks to that server

2407
01:42:14,340 --> 01:42:16,080
so when we start to run commands you'll

2408
01:42:16,080 --> 01:42:17,280
notice the one on the left comes back

2409
01:42:17,280 --> 01:42:19,500
immediately I'm running PWD I'm running

2410
01:42:19,500 --> 01:42:21,360
who am I I think I run one more maybe

2411
01:42:21,360 --> 01:42:23,280
yeah if config and it's coming back

2412
01:42:23,280 --> 01:42:24,900
immediately

2413
01:42:24,900 --> 01:42:27,300
on the right hand side I run PWD and it

2414
01:42:27,300 --> 01:42:29,159
says great I I just asked that Beacon

2415
01:42:29,159 --> 01:42:31,139
and so it has to wait for that Beacon to

2416
01:42:31,139 --> 01:42:33,060
reach out to respond that has some

2417
01:42:33,060 --> 01:42:35,219
implications for how you leverage it it

2418
01:42:35,219 --> 01:42:37,739
also limits you a session implant can be

2419
01:42:37,739 --> 01:42:39,780
used to actually stand up a true shell

2420
01:42:39,780 --> 01:42:41,940
inside that host whereas a beacon

2421
01:42:41,940 --> 01:42:45,179
implant doesn't allow you to actually

2422
01:42:45,179 --> 01:42:48,239
stand up a shell at all so

2423
01:42:48,239 --> 01:42:50,040
once you establish that session there's

2424
01:42:50,040 --> 01:42:51,780
a ton of different commands here and the

2425
01:42:51,780 --> 01:42:53,280
takeaway for for everyone in the room

2426
01:42:53,280 --> 01:42:55,380
here you see some commands you probably

2427
01:42:55,380 --> 01:42:58,800
recognize there's cat there's ifconfig

2428
01:42:58,800 --> 01:43:02,159
there's kill there's LS right and it may

2429
01:43:02,159 --> 01:43:03,719
be one of those things where you

2430
01:43:03,719 --> 01:43:04,980
immediately assume oh great I'm just

2431
01:43:04,980 --> 01:43:07,139
going to run LS on this host and that's

2432
01:43:07,139 --> 01:43:09,780
not exactly what's happening what's

2433
01:43:09,780 --> 01:43:11,880
happening is you're sending that to your

2434
01:43:11,880 --> 01:43:13,380
implant your implant is using system

2435
01:43:13,380 --> 01:43:15,480
calls to return that information

2436
01:43:15,480 --> 01:43:17,100
and so it's not going to show up in your

2437
01:43:17,100 --> 01:43:18,420
command history it's not going to show

2438
01:43:18,420 --> 01:43:19,980
up through any of those traditional

2439
01:43:19,980 --> 01:43:21,900
mechanisms the other advantage of this

2440
01:43:21,900 --> 01:43:24,540
is thank God I can finally run LS

2441
01:43:24,540 --> 01:43:27,239
against a Windows host right like

2442
01:43:27,239 --> 01:43:28,980
holy hell it makes it so much easier as

2443
01:43:28,980 --> 01:43:31,380
a single command and so if you were to

2444
01:43:31,380 --> 01:43:33,360
open a shell then you're interacting

2445
01:43:33,360 --> 01:43:35,280
directly with with that that endpoint

2446
01:43:35,280 --> 01:43:37,020
but here it's kind of abstract and it's

2447
01:43:37,020 --> 01:43:38,880
all running from the the audio running

2448
01:43:38,880 --> 01:43:41,360
implant

2449
01:43:41,520 --> 01:43:43,920
so here it is in action you'll see the

2450
01:43:43,920 --> 01:43:46,380
once we we actually execute that implant

2451
01:43:46,380 --> 01:43:48,239
on the host we get a callback and it

2452
01:43:48,239 --> 01:43:50,760
says Hey modern Army just checked in

2453
01:43:50,760 --> 01:43:53,940
and we can use the use command to go

2454
01:43:53,940 --> 01:43:56,340
select that that implant and we start

2455
01:43:56,340 --> 01:43:58,139
running those commands one thing that I

2456
01:43:58,139 --> 01:44:00,179
particularly liked about sliver is that

2457
01:44:00,179 --> 01:44:03,060
it goes through and it assigns a code

2458
01:44:03,060 --> 01:44:05,040
name for every implant and that's really

2459
01:44:05,040 --> 01:44:06,840
handy because I've used some in the past

2460
01:44:06,840 --> 01:44:09,179
that just give it a one through six or

2461
01:44:09,179 --> 01:44:10,980
whatever a number that's hard to keep

2462
01:44:10,980 --> 01:44:13,560
track of so what sliver does is it

2463
01:44:13,560 --> 01:44:15,239
assigns that an adjective and a noun and

2464
01:44:15,239 --> 01:44:17,280
so in this case it's modern Army I think

2465
01:44:17,280 --> 01:44:19,340
another one a while back was

2466
01:44:19,340 --> 01:44:21,480
cultural Coast

2467
01:44:21,480 --> 01:44:22,980
um boiling comment right and that makes

2468
01:44:22,980 --> 01:44:24,360
it much more identifiable those names

2469
01:44:24,360 --> 01:44:26,040
are changeable

2470
01:44:26,040 --> 01:44:27,060
um

2471
01:44:27,060 --> 01:44:29,219
but moving on

2472
01:44:29,219 --> 01:44:30,840
the final piece I'm going to talk about

2473
01:44:30,840 --> 01:44:32,699
is opening a shell and so you can run

2474
01:44:32,699 --> 01:44:34,380
the shell command that says hey this is

2475
01:44:34,380 --> 01:44:36,060
bad obstacle are you sure you want to do

2476
01:44:36,060 --> 01:44:38,280
this like are you an adult which I I

2477
01:44:38,280 --> 01:44:40,440
love the snark

2478
01:44:40,440 --> 01:44:43,500
and so you can run that

2479
01:44:43,500 --> 01:44:46,320
and the thing that I noticed is it opens

2480
01:44:46,320 --> 01:44:48,780
up a new process right

2481
01:44:48,780 --> 01:44:50,340
from a Defender perspective this is

2482
01:44:50,340 --> 01:44:52,080
really easy to spot because now you see

2483
01:44:52,080 --> 01:44:54,179
Powershell being executed from the

2484
01:44:54,179 --> 01:44:57,080
parent process of in this case it's

2485
01:44:57,080 --> 01:44:59,460
culturalcoast.exe super super visible

2486
01:44:59,460 --> 01:45:02,219
it's going to get you caught

2487
01:45:02,219 --> 01:45:03,540
so let's talk about that for a second

2488
01:45:03,540 --> 01:45:06,179
what happens when you get caught uh

2489
01:45:06,179 --> 01:45:08,040
sliver has an amazing functionality that

2490
01:45:08,040 --> 01:45:10,860
allows you to generate a DNS a DNS

2491
01:45:10,860 --> 01:45:13,920
Canary and so how this works is when

2492
01:45:13,920 --> 01:45:16,020
you're generating your implant up top

2493
01:45:16,020 --> 01:45:18,780
you can use the tag Canary and specify

2494
01:45:18,780 --> 01:45:20,400
another domain

2495
01:45:20,400 --> 01:45:22,980
so when these are generated there are

2496
01:45:22,980 --> 01:45:25,020
very few strings that are visible that

2497
01:45:25,020 --> 01:45:27,600
can tie tie that implant back to your

2498
01:45:27,600 --> 01:45:29,940
infrastructure it's all obfuscated but

2499
01:45:29,940 --> 01:45:31,739
when you use Canary it says cool I'm

2500
01:45:31,739 --> 01:45:33,480
just going to drop this domain

2501
01:45:33,480 --> 01:45:36,239
as a raw string the thought there is

2502
01:45:36,239 --> 01:45:38,100
that once a Defender finds out they're

2503
01:45:38,100 --> 01:45:39,540
going to say why I need to I need to

2504
01:45:39,540 --> 01:45:40,980
dive into this they're going to run

2505
01:45:40,980 --> 01:45:42,360
strings it's going to print out a bunch

2506
01:45:42,360 --> 01:45:43,560
of nonsense and they're going to find a

2507
01:45:43,560 --> 01:45:45,600
domain I say got them

2508
01:45:45,600 --> 01:45:47,040
they're going to go resolve that domain

2509
01:45:47,040 --> 01:45:48,480
and as soon as that resolution comes

2510
01:45:48,480 --> 01:45:50,659
through

2511
01:45:50,820 --> 01:45:52,800
our canaries go from yeah it's never

2512
01:45:52,800 --> 01:45:55,739
been triggered to oh by the way this

2513
01:45:55,739 --> 01:45:59,520
particular this particular implant

2514
01:45:59,520 --> 01:46:01,380
queried this or I'm sorry this

2515
01:46:01,380 --> 01:46:02,760
particular implant may have been found

2516
01:46:02,760 --> 01:46:06,420
this this DNS domain was uh

2517
01:46:06,420 --> 01:46:08,880
was queried and we see it triggered and

2518
01:46:08,880 --> 01:46:10,860
we even see when it triggered we don't

2519
01:46:10,860 --> 01:46:13,500
see the host or the IP address with DNS

2520
01:46:13,500 --> 01:46:14,940
queries depending on how it's configured

2521
01:46:14,940 --> 01:46:16,860
that wouldn't necessarily always take

2522
01:46:16,860 --> 01:46:19,260
you back to the in the end host that

2523
01:46:19,260 --> 01:46:20,520
actually triggered it but we know an

2524
01:46:20,520 --> 01:46:21,719
implant

2525
01:46:21,719 --> 01:46:23,639
um was discovered and there's some

2526
01:46:23,639 --> 01:46:25,020
investigation done so I thought that was

2527
01:46:25,020 --> 01:46:27,300
a really cool functionality

2528
01:46:27,300 --> 01:46:29,340
so keep in mind this recommendation is

2529
01:46:29,340 --> 01:46:31,860
for the specific path I used I'm sure

2530
01:46:31,860 --> 01:46:33,300
that that there's there's people who

2531
01:46:33,300 --> 01:46:35,159
know slivered that are squirmy in their

2532
01:46:35,159 --> 01:46:36,540
chairs waiting to ask me questions after

2533
01:46:36,540 --> 01:46:38,400
this but what about this how could I

2534
01:46:38,400 --> 01:46:39,780
hide this

2535
01:46:39,780 --> 01:46:41,940
um from the perspective of how I used it

2536
01:46:41,940 --> 01:46:43,679
there was a tremendous amount of text

2537
01:46:43,679 --> 01:46:45,239
records being used

2538
01:46:45,239 --> 01:46:47,580
and so those typically we don't see a

2539
01:46:47,580 --> 01:46:49,020
lot of especially if you're using a

2540
01:46:49,020 --> 01:46:50,460
session implant you're going to see an

2541
01:46:50,460 --> 01:46:52,080
absolute ton so it should Spike up

2542
01:46:52,080 --> 01:46:54,619
pretty quickly

2543
01:46:55,679 --> 01:46:57,780
so last but not least Afghan it didn't

2544
01:46:57,780 --> 01:46:59,400
have an icon I figured that's as good as

2545
01:46:59,400 --> 01:47:01,260
anything else

2546
01:47:01,260 --> 01:47:02,699
um

2547
01:47:02,699 --> 01:47:04,380
yeah right that's how that's how

2548
01:47:04,380 --> 01:47:06,360
official icons are born

2549
01:47:06,360 --> 01:47:07,980
um this one is just a network scanner

2550
01:47:07,980 --> 01:47:09,480
and I say that I don't mean to be

2551
01:47:09,480 --> 01:47:11,280
dismissive of it but it doesn't bring

2552
01:47:11,280 --> 01:47:13,560
anything that new to this ecosystem

2553
01:47:13,560 --> 01:47:15,659
there you could use nmap you could use

2554
01:47:15,659 --> 01:47:17,639
Advanced ip scanner Port Authority all

2555
01:47:17,639 --> 01:47:20,159
these are great Alternatives it is

2556
01:47:20,159 --> 01:47:21,659
pretty quick it's written in go and it

2557
01:47:21,659 --> 01:47:22,679
was released in the last couple of years

2558
01:47:22,679 --> 01:47:25,320
it's just on somebody's GitHub right put

2559
01:47:25,320 --> 01:47:27,179
a nice little Panda icon up there we see

2560
01:47:27,179 --> 01:47:29,280
a lot of Chinese actors using this and

2561
01:47:29,280 --> 01:47:31,440
so I was I was really excited I started

2562
01:47:31,440 --> 01:47:33,840
looking at the documentation right and

2563
01:47:33,840 --> 01:47:36,060
and man there's all kinds of stuff that

2564
01:47:36,060 --> 01:47:37,560
this this tool can do and I was like

2565
01:47:37,560 --> 01:47:39,000
great let's see how the users the advers

2566
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:42,179
are using it this is the first tool

2567
01:47:42,179 --> 01:47:43,980
um in in a lot of cases that we get to

2568
01:47:43,980 --> 01:47:45,300
see what the adversary is doing because

2569
01:47:45,300 --> 01:47:46,980
it's you download it to the victim host

2570
01:47:46,980 --> 01:47:49,440
and you run commands so I was like

2571
01:47:49,440 --> 01:47:51,000
awesome they're probably like doing some

2572
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:52,619
really advanced stuff

2573
01:47:52,619 --> 01:47:54,719
and they're really not I was kind of let

2574
01:47:54,719 --> 01:47:56,880
down actually they're just using F scan

2575
01:47:56,880 --> 01:47:58,619
to scan the environment they're not even

2576
01:47:58,619 --> 01:48:00,659
using the vulnerability scanners

2577
01:48:00,659 --> 01:48:01,920
um they're just looking for their next

2578
01:48:01,920 --> 01:48:03,900
hops they're looking for open ports and

2579
01:48:03,900 --> 01:48:05,580
so I almost excluded this from my talk

2580
01:48:05,580 --> 01:48:07,139
altogether but I I think there's an

2581
01:48:07,139 --> 01:48:08,760
important thing to note here and this is

2582
01:48:08,760 --> 01:48:09,900
something we see across all of our

2583
01:48:09,900 --> 01:48:11,100
intrusions

2584
01:48:11,100 --> 01:48:12,900
adversaries still have to do Discovery

2585
01:48:12,900 --> 01:48:14,639
once they gain access to an environment

2586
01:48:14,639 --> 01:48:16,800
nation state as well I know we put them

2587
01:48:16,800 --> 01:48:19,739
up on a you know this this Ivory Tower

2588
01:48:19,739 --> 01:48:21,840
that they're mystical creatures that are

2589
01:48:21,840 --> 01:48:24,119
able to do things through the wires um

2590
01:48:24,119 --> 01:48:25,980
but this next level of Discovery is

2591
01:48:25,980 --> 01:48:27,840
needed and we're seeing Chinese actors

2592
01:48:27,840 --> 01:48:30,719
use this tool just to say hey what ports

2593
01:48:30,719 --> 01:48:32,460
are open what hosts are there and so

2594
01:48:32,460 --> 01:48:34,260
whether that is as host Discovery or

2595
01:48:34,260 --> 01:48:35,880
network discovery or domain Discovery

2596
01:48:35,880 --> 01:48:38,639
it's a crucial part of that um I think I

2597
01:48:38,639 --> 01:48:39,840
have to pay money if I say kill chain

2598
01:48:39,840 --> 01:48:43,080
but it's part of the process right

2599
01:48:43,080 --> 01:48:45,719
so how do we how do we find this luckily

2600
01:48:45,719 --> 01:48:47,219
Network scans are incredibly noisy

2601
01:48:47,219 --> 01:48:48,600
you're going to see one host reaching

2602
01:48:48,600 --> 01:48:50,040
out to a bunch of other hosts over a

2603
01:48:50,040 --> 01:48:52,260
bunch of ports and so not too difficult

2604
01:48:52,260 --> 01:48:54,679
to spot

2605
01:48:57,480 --> 01:48:59,580
so to close it out we looked at four

2606
01:48:59,580 --> 01:49:01,739
tools any desk was a remote access tool

2607
01:49:01,739 --> 01:49:04,199
my favorite way to kind of block that

2608
01:49:04,199 --> 01:49:06,900
from your environment is to to block any

2609
01:49:06,900 --> 01:49:08,840
domain any DNS request going out to

2610
01:49:08,840 --> 01:49:12,119
net.nas.com keep in mind there are tons

2611
01:49:12,119 --> 01:49:14,100
of competitors out there against any

2612
01:49:14,100 --> 01:49:15,840
desk and so you block this one you

2613
01:49:15,840 --> 01:49:16,920
probably need to go look up the other

2614
01:49:16,920 --> 01:49:19,440
domains as well and garlic is reverse

2615
01:49:19,440 --> 01:49:21,659
proxy slash tunneling tool once again we

2616
01:49:21,659 --> 01:49:23,520
can black hole that at the edge of our

2617
01:49:23,520 --> 01:49:26,639
Network and we can stop a lot of those

2618
01:49:26,639 --> 01:49:28,080
engrock agents being able to actually

2619
01:49:28,080 --> 01:49:30,659
reach back out to the service

2620
01:49:30,659 --> 01:49:32,280
for sliver at least in the way that I

2621
01:49:32,280 --> 01:49:34,380
used it with the DNS tunnel blocking

2622
01:49:34,380 --> 01:49:36,119
text records stops a lot of that

2623
01:49:36,119 --> 01:49:38,639
activity or at least monitoring for it

2624
01:49:38,639 --> 01:49:40,139
maybe not blocking a bit monitoring for

2625
01:49:40,139 --> 01:49:41,760
it and then fscan of course you're just

2626
01:49:41,760 --> 01:49:44,040
monitoring Network traffic so with that

2627
01:49:44,040 --> 01:49:44,760
said

2628
01:49:44,760 --> 01:49:48,080
um does anybody have any questions

2629
01:49:49,199 --> 01:49:52,040
all right go ahead

2630
01:49:55,380 --> 01:49:57,360
you can actually use

2631
01:49:57,360 --> 01:49:59,360
it

2632
01:50:07,260 --> 01:50:09,119
forced them what what what's kind of

2633
01:50:09,119 --> 01:50:10,860
like the least one you've seen or the

2634
01:50:10,860 --> 01:50:13,500
best way to kind of put that oh thank

2635
01:50:13,500 --> 01:50:15,300
you oh that's awesome you have a

2636
01:50:15,300 --> 01:50:16,940
question box

2637
01:50:16,940 --> 01:50:19,739
does that have a mic in it yeah do you

2638
01:50:19,739 --> 01:50:20,820
want to repeat the question because I

2639
01:50:20,820 --> 01:50:22,080
was about to but I'll let you do it so

2640
01:50:22,080 --> 01:50:24,119
you can get it right yeah of course so

2641
01:50:24,119 --> 01:50:26,880
um I know a lot of clients use any desks

2642
01:50:26,880 --> 01:50:29,400
themselves for remote access into their

2643
01:50:29,400 --> 01:50:32,060
systems um is there either

2644
01:50:32,060 --> 01:50:33,960
any good

2645
01:50:33,960 --> 01:50:36,600
um uh either alternatives for any desks

2646
01:50:36,600 --> 01:50:39,119
that adversaries don't use as often but

2647
01:50:39,119 --> 01:50:41,820
it doesn't cost as much as you know a

2648
01:50:41,820 --> 01:50:43,800
lot of clients don't have that money for

2649
01:50:43,800 --> 01:50:45,600
remote accessories they're kind of like

2650
01:50:45,600 --> 01:50:47,940
a specific method to you know blog

2651
01:50:47,940 --> 01:50:50,219
adversaries with any desk but not the

2652
01:50:50,219 --> 01:50:52,679
current clients I'd assume like doing

2653
01:50:52,679 --> 01:50:54,840
that you know an IP

2654
01:50:54,840 --> 01:50:56,940
specific but obviously a lot of clients

2655
01:50:56,940 --> 01:50:58,860
that use any desks don't have technical

2656
01:50:58,860 --> 01:51:00,540
knowledge to do that well and the

2657
01:51:00,540 --> 01:51:01,800
problem of blocking it at the IP level

2658
01:51:01,800 --> 01:51:04,500
is the the host isn't reaching out to

2659
01:51:04,500 --> 01:51:06,060
adversary controlled space right they're

2660
01:51:06,060 --> 01:51:08,040
reaching out to the any desk service and

2661
01:51:08,040 --> 01:51:10,380
so my recommendation works great if

2662
01:51:10,380 --> 01:51:12,719
you're not using any desk but it works

2663
01:51:12,719 --> 01:51:15,420
terribly if you do now the issue with

2664
01:51:15,420 --> 01:51:16,980
saying well they use any desk I'm going

2665
01:51:16,980 --> 01:51:18,300
to use something else

2666
01:51:18,300 --> 01:51:19,800
odds are from an adversary I'm going to

2667
01:51:19,800 --> 01:51:20,880
log on I'm going to see if there's any

2668
01:51:20,880 --> 01:51:22,380
remote access tooling and I'm probably

2669
01:51:22,380 --> 01:51:23,340
going to leverage that because I know

2670
01:51:23,340 --> 01:51:25,500
it's not blocked it's really tough tough

2671
01:51:25,500 --> 01:51:28,080
if if a company uses that I would have

2672
01:51:28,080 --> 01:51:30,119
to look further into like maybe there's

2673
01:51:30,119 --> 01:51:31,860
there's opportunities to authenticate

2674
01:51:31,860 --> 01:51:34,260
differently maybe like a two-factor

2675
01:51:34,260 --> 01:51:35,940
authentication within any desk or

2676
01:51:35,940 --> 01:51:38,159
something like that maybe you can push

2677
01:51:38,159 --> 01:51:39,719
that out to a third party like OCTA

2678
01:51:39,719 --> 01:51:41,340
would probably be a better approach than

2679
01:51:41,340 --> 01:51:43,560
trying to like shift services to dodge

2680
01:51:43,560 --> 01:51:44,880
what adversaries are using because

2681
01:51:44,880 --> 01:51:46,260
they'll just follow you there especially

2682
01:51:46,260 --> 01:51:47,520
if it's easy to use

2683
01:51:47,520 --> 01:51:49,199
so that's not a great answer it's not

2684
01:51:49,199 --> 01:51:51,420
satisfactory but I think it's an honest

2685
01:51:51,420 --> 01:51:53,900
one so

2686
01:51:54,179 --> 01:51:56,520
all right so yeah we got some some uh

2687
01:51:56,520 --> 01:51:58,500
some possible opportunities in the crowd

2688
01:51:58,500 --> 01:51:59,639
all right we've got another question

2689
01:51:59,639 --> 01:52:00,900
here

2690
01:52:00,900 --> 01:52:04,440
the flavor client is running on

2691
01:52:04,440 --> 01:52:07,260
the victim books right so uh sorry could

2692
01:52:07,260 --> 01:52:08,820
you uh this is really weird for anyone

2693
01:52:08,820 --> 01:52:09,960
on the stream there's this weird box

2694
01:52:09,960 --> 01:52:11,280
could you hold the Box closer to your

2695
01:52:11,280 --> 01:52:12,540
face

2696
01:52:12,540 --> 01:52:14,580
like this yeah that's perfect there we

2697
01:52:14,580 --> 01:52:18,540
go okay so the sliver uh client is

2698
01:52:18,540 --> 01:52:20,280
running on the victim

2699
01:52:20,280 --> 01:52:24,360
so it should be visible on that one that

2700
01:52:24,360 --> 01:52:27,480
perspective and network communications

2701
01:52:27,480 --> 01:52:29,460
yeah so so it is running on the victim

2702
01:52:29,460 --> 01:52:31,679
box and depending on how tight you have

2703
01:52:31,679 --> 01:52:33,960
your processes tuned down

2704
01:52:33,960 --> 01:52:35,639
um maybe you're looking at certain API

2705
01:52:35,639 --> 01:52:37,800
calls being ran maybe you could detect

2706
01:52:37,800 --> 01:52:41,520
that but most of the time most AVS at

2707
01:52:41,520 --> 01:52:42,960
least are trying to block it at md5

2708
01:52:42,960 --> 01:52:44,580
level to stop it from even getting on

2709
01:52:44,580 --> 01:52:47,280
the box but you're correct it is it is

2710
01:52:47,280 --> 01:52:49,320
running on the victim host

2711
01:52:49,320 --> 01:52:50,940
um and in theory you could go to your

2712
01:52:50,940 --> 01:52:52,619
processes and actually find it I did

2713
01:52:52,619 --> 01:52:54,239
some procmon and absolutely found them

2714
01:52:54,239 --> 01:52:56,580
it's just it's a different name it's a

2715
01:52:56,580 --> 01:53:00,780
different md5 and so it's harder to look

2716
01:53:00,780 --> 01:53:02,340
for a specific implant if you don't know

2717
01:53:02,340 --> 01:53:03,900
what you're looking for is the issue and

2718
01:53:03,900 --> 01:53:06,179
so that's why I tend to lean on there's

2719
01:53:06,179 --> 01:53:07,199
going to be network communications

2720
01:53:07,199 --> 01:53:08,520
coming out of that host that's probably

2721
01:53:08,520 --> 01:53:09,719
how you find it and then you work

2722
01:53:09,719 --> 01:53:10,920
backwards

2723
01:53:10,920 --> 01:53:14,719
good thank you yeah absolutely

2724
01:53:16,020 --> 01:53:18,179
that's the throwable Box this is great

2725
01:53:18,179 --> 01:53:19,619
uh you mentioned as a possible

2726
01:53:19,619 --> 01:53:21,780
mitigation for ngrok to Black Hole the

2727
01:53:21,780 --> 01:53:23,100
domain

2728
01:53:23,100 --> 01:53:25,199
and figure and grog with your domain of

2729
01:53:25,199 --> 01:53:26,820
your choice that just sort of set its

2730
01:53:26,820 --> 01:53:27,600
own

2731
01:53:27,600 --> 01:53:29,159
that's a great question

2732
01:53:29,159 --> 01:53:30,719
um a Darwin answer for you I don't want

2733
01:53:30,719 --> 01:53:32,940
to say yes or no but uh engrock's got a

2734
01:53:32,940 --> 01:53:34,380
lot of capabilities

2735
01:53:34,380 --> 01:53:36,300
um let me look into it and we can talk

2736
01:53:36,300 --> 01:53:38,659
offline

2737
01:53:41,760 --> 01:53:42,840
yeah because that would absolutely

2738
01:53:42,840 --> 01:53:44,820
shatter that right it does require a

2739
01:53:44,820 --> 01:53:46,380
bigger investment from an adversary to

2740
01:53:46,380 --> 01:53:49,380
go by the domain to stand everything up

2741
01:53:49,380 --> 01:53:50,940
um and then they you have to register an

2742
01:53:50,940 --> 01:53:52,679
account with ngrok to do any of those

2743
01:53:52,679 --> 01:53:54,480
more advanced features so there is a

2744
01:53:54,480 --> 01:53:56,639
more inherent cost but a dedicated

2745
01:53:56,639 --> 01:53:58,560
adversary is going to do all that stuff

2746
01:53:58,560 --> 01:54:01,699
so it's a really good call

2747
01:54:02,340 --> 01:54:04,260
and just to give you some feedback from

2748
01:54:04,260 --> 01:54:06,540
how we see it in our environments or I

2749
01:54:06,540 --> 01:54:07,800
guess our clients environments it's

2750
01:54:07,800 --> 01:54:09,540
normally just ran with ngrok without

2751
01:54:09,540 --> 01:54:11,100
specifying a different type of domain

2752
01:54:11,100 --> 01:54:14,219
and so capability wise possibly but we

2753
01:54:14,219 --> 01:54:15,719
don't see at least from our narrow

2754
01:54:15,719 --> 01:54:17,340
window of the world we don't see it

2755
01:54:17,340 --> 01:54:18,900
happening like that yeah good good

2756
01:54:18,900 --> 01:54:20,159
question though

2757
01:54:20,159 --> 01:54:23,360
got a question behind you there

2758
01:54:24,179 --> 01:54:25,560
hi

2759
01:54:25,560 --> 01:54:28,260
um I was curious uh what signals that

2760
01:54:28,260 --> 01:54:30,000
Falcon picks up that indicates it's

2761
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:31,679
sliver or is that just figured out

2762
01:54:31,679 --> 01:54:33,900
afterward after like sort of finding the

2763
01:54:33,900 --> 01:54:35,820
Badness yeah it's usually found after

2764
01:54:35,820 --> 01:54:38,699
the fact because it is new md5 keep in

2765
01:54:38,699 --> 01:54:40,320
mind we have the Falcon side of the

2766
01:54:40,320 --> 01:54:41,639
house that's the sensor doing its

2767
01:54:41,639 --> 01:54:43,020
detections that's a totally different

2768
01:54:43,020 --> 01:54:45,840
world than the thread hunting side and

2769
01:54:45,840 --> 01:54:46,980
so we're not necessarily looking for

2770
01:54:46,980 --> 01:54:48,560
those signatures we're looking for

2771
01:54:48,560 --> 01:54:50,760
surrounding behaviors so maybe they

2772
01:54:50,760 --> 01:54:52,320
installed a service maybe they created

2773
01:54:52,320 --> 01:54:54,540
into account maybe they ran a certain

2774
01:54:54,540 --> 01:54:56,820
command from a weird parent process

2775
01:54:56,820 --> 01:54:58,739
right we hone in on that and then kind

2776
01:54:58,739 --> 01:55:00,000
of build out and that's usually where we

2777
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:01,320
come across sliver

2778
01:55:01,320 --> 01:55:05,059
so yeah it's a great question though

2779
01:55:06,480 --> 01:55:09,799
all right any other questions

2780
01:55:11,340 --> 01:55:12,840
all right I'm going to go ahead and jump

2781
01:55:12,840 --> 01:55:14,340
off stage here if you have any questions

2782
01:55:14,340 --> 01:55:16,020
feel free to come up and talk to me over

interesting

3513
05:05:31,260 --> 05:05:33,798
look at

3514
05:05:34,440 --> 05:05:38,780
the right traveling in a hurdle yeah

3515
05:05:43,400 --> 05:05:46,940
yeah that's right

3516
05:06:30,600 --> 05:06:32,218
so yeah

3517
05:06:32,218 --> 05:06:34,218
um

3518
05:06:42,000 --> 05:06:45,000
elevated

3519
05:06:56,218 --> 05:06:58,218
um

3520
05:07:13,200 --> 05:07:16,100
I thought that's a huge

3521
05:07:30,000 --> 05:07:32,480
thing

3522
05:08:15,840 --> 05:08:17,958
thank you

3523
05:08:32,458 --> 05:08:35,000
please

3524
05:09:31,320 --> 05:09:34,218
oh

3525
05:10:13,860 --> 05:10:16,860
speakers

3526
05:10:56,340 --> 05:10:59,480
so anything

3527
05:11:02,878 --> 05:11:05,638
right yeah yeah and so that was the only

3528
05:11:05,638 --> 05:11:07,940
way

3529
05:11:09,840 --> 05:11:12,560
because

3530
05:11:38,400 --> 05:11:41,400
foreign

3531
05:12:13,020 --> 05:12:15,620
I thought

3532
05:13:11,580 --> 05:13:14,580
foreign

3533
05:13:49,980 --> 05:13:51,958
all right up next we have Casey Beaumont

3534
05:13:51,958 --> 05:13:53,700
talking about documenting incident

3535
05:13:53,700 --> 05:13:56,958
response thanks for coming

3536
05:13:57,610 --> 05:14:01,860
[Applause]

3537
05:14:01,860 --> 05:14:04,440
alrighty hey guys like was mentioned

3538
05:14:04,440 --> 05:14:05,638
just make sure you're in the right talk

3539
05:14:05,638 --> 05:14:07,920
we're talking about the single source of

3540
05:14:07,920 --> 05:14:09,718
Truth and documenting and leading

3541
05:14:09,718 --> 05:14:11,820
incident response so it's a topic we

3542
05:14:11,820 --> 05:14:13,260
don't often really think about too much

3543
05:14:13,260 --> 05:14:15,180
we think about IR is how are we going to

3544
05:14:15,180 --> 05:14:17,820
solve the mystery but there's more that

3545
05:14:17,820 --> 05:14:19,560
goes into it than that right we need to

3546
05:14:19,560 --> 05:14:21,718
have deliverables at the end we need to

3547
05:14:21,718 --> 05:14:24,900
have someone kind of leading the way

3548
05:14:24,900 --> 05:14:26,458
so we're going to go over a lot of

3549
05:14:26,458 --> 05:14:28,020
things in this presentation starting

3550
05:14:28,020 --> 05:14:30,060
with pre-planning around roles and

3551
05:14:30,060 --> 05:14:32,040
responsibilities and having an incident

3552
05:14:32,040 --> 05:14:34,798
response plan in place so that all of

3553
05:14:34,798 --> 05:14:36,660
this isn't just knowledge in the head of

3554
05:14:36,660 --> 05:14:38,878
someone on your IR team but formally

3555
05:14:38,878 --> 05:14:41,100
documented because if you think about

3556
05:14:41,100 --> 05:14:43,200
your own companies and everything

3557
05:14:43,200 --> 05:14:45,600
everyone knows on your teams how much of

3558
05:14:45,600 --> 05:14:47,160
that is written down so if they left

3559
05:14:47,160 --> 05:14:50,458
tomorrow with no notice how many people

3560
05:14:50,458 --> 05:14:52,378
could pick up the slack

3561
05:14:52,378 --> 05:14:54,298
then we will assume you're in the midst

3562
05:14:54,298 --> 05:14:55,980
of an incident and discuss what needs to

3563
05:14:55,980 --> 05:14:58,020
be documented and how and the best ways

3564
05:14:58,020 --> 05:14:59,878
to keep these deliverables neat and

3565
05:14:59,878 --> 05:15:02,100
helpful will tackle both created

3566
05:15:02,100 --> 05:15:03,600
documents for using the investigation

3567
05:15:03,600 --> 05:15:05,940
incident artifacts themselves and after

3568
05:15:05,940 --> 05:15:07,560
action

3569
05:15:07,560 --> 05:15:09,000
so a little bit about me and why I'm

3570
05:15:09,000 --> 05:15:11,100
talking about this I've been coming to

3571
05:15:11,100 --> 05:15:13,200
cactuscon off and on since it was hosted

3572
05:15:13,200 --> 05:15:15,000
out of Dave and Buster's which had

3573
05:15:15,000 --> 05:15:17,120
definitely a certain charm to it

3574
05:15:17,120 --> 05:15:19,980
my background originally was in computer

3575
05:15:19,980 --> 05:15:22,320
systems engineering so I very briefly

3576
05:15:22,320 --> 05:15:25,020
was a developer I took one class in

3577
05:15:25,020 --> 05:15:27,660
Security in college because you know in

3578
05:15:27,660 --> 05:15:30,360
2010 there wasn't much to go from and

3579
05:15:30,360 --> 05:15:33,298
luckily fell into security and I've been

3580
05:15:33,298 --> 05:15:35,878
happy ever since I'm currently an

3581
05:15:35,878 --> 05:15:37,440
incident response manager at Marsh

3582
05:15:37,440 --> 05:15:39,120
McLennan a Global Financial Services

3583
05:15:39,120 --> 05:15:40,260
firm

3584
05:15:40,260 --> 05:15:42,540
but I started out in defense I started

3585
05:15:42,540 --> 05:15:44,340
out as a defense contractor and that was

3586
05:15:44,340 --> 05:15:47,520
kind of a great way to learn IR because

3587
05:15:47,520 --> 05:15:50,280
they typically have the budget the

3588
05:15:50,280 --> 05:15:52,260
policy which is extremely important the

3589
05:15:52,260 --> 05:15:54,600
seriousness around security uh and the

3590
05:15:54,600 --> 05:15:56,520
training to really get you started from

3591
05:15:56,520 --> 05:15:57,540
nothing

3592
05:15:57,540 --> 05:15:59,580
I've been doing direct incident response

3593
05:15:59,580 --> 05:16:01,560
for over 10 years and I'm a sucker for

3594
05:16:01,560 --> 05:16:04,080
process and documentation so I very

3595
05:16:04,080 --> 05:16:06,298
naturally started scribing these things

3596
05:16:06,298 --> 05:16:08,100
I very naturally started being the one

3597
05:16:08,100 --> 05:16:09,780
to be taking notes on what was going on

3598
05:16:09,780 --> 05:16:12,480
and kind of fell into being an incident

3599
05:16:12,480 --> 05:16:16,320
response lead and manager for the team

3600
05:16:16,320 --> 05:16:18,540
so first we're going to talk roles

3601
05:16:18,540 --> 05:16:21,180
responsibilities and realities

3602
05:16:21,180 --> 05:16:22,980
and let me give the context too that I

3603
05:16:22,980 --> 05:16:25,440
work at a Fortune 500 we have Staffing

3604
05:16:25,440 --> 05:16:27,900
we have documentation we're not perfect

3605
05:16:27,900 --> 05:16:30,180
but our level of sophistication is

3606
05:16:30,180 --> 05:16:32,458
generally higher if this is not you

3607
05:16:32,458 --> 05:16:34,378
customized to your needs if I'm going to

3608
05:16:34,378 --> 05:16:35,520
go over something and you're like

3609
05:16:35,520 --> 05:16:37,920
there's no way we can't do like we're

3610
05:16:37,920 --> 05:16:39,840
nowhere near this level of documentation

3611
05:16:39,840 --> 05:16:41,340
that's cool

3612
05:16:41,340 --> 05:16:43,320
if you Google incident response plans

3613
05:16:43,320 --> 05:16:45,000
for instance you'll see a lot of

3614
05:16:45,000 --> 05:16:47,520
examples are a single document I'm going

3615
05:16:47,520 --> 05:16:49,320
to describe something more than that but

3616
05:16:49,320 --> 05:16:52,100
start where you can

3617
05:16:52,320 --> 05:16:54,180
so why do you need an incident response

3618
05:16:54,180 --> 05:16:56,458
to lead or a scribe and I want to

3619
05:16:56,458 --> 05:16:59,520
preface this by I gave a similar talk to

3620
05:16:59,520 --> 05:17:01,560
this purely on incident response plans

3621
05:17:01,560 --> 05:17:04,020
at a conference back in October and it

3622
05:17:04,020 --> 05:17:05,700
was a conference for Rural Broadband

3623
05:17:05,700 --> 05:17:07,920
Telecom an industry I wasn't intimately

3624
05:17:07,920 --> 05:17:09,120
familiar with

3625
05:17:09,120 --> 05:17:10,798
before my talk there was a tabletop

3626
05:17:10,798 --> 05:17:12,298
exercise that everyone kind of did

3627
05:17:12,298 --> 05:17:13,620
together it was a smaller conference

3628
05:17:13,620 --> 05:17:15,480
like 150 people

3629
05:17:15,480 --> 05:17:17,820
and I participated and as I sat with

3630
05:17:17,820 --> 05:17:19,920
those folks it was revealed to me that

3631
05:17:19,920 --> 05:17:21,600
most of the companies represented were

3632
05:17:21,600 --> 05:17:24,000
across the board understaffed wearing

3633
05:17:24,000 --> 05:17:25,980
multiple hats and not at the level of

3634
05:17:25,980 --> 05:17:27,840
sophistication that you kind of get used

3635
05:17:27,840 --> 05:17:29,458
to in a larger company or if you've only

3636
05:17:29,458 --> 05:17:32,340
worked at large firms so when faced with

3637
05:17:32,340 --> 05:17:33,900
a question like how does your

3638
05:17:33,900 --> 05:17:36,180
vulnerability management handle new

3639
05:17:36,180 --> 05:17:38,700
major threats like solarwinds a couple

3640
05:17:38,700 --> 05:17:40,500
of them said we don't we don't have time

3641
05:17:40,500 --> 05:17:42,298
for that we're just that goes right past

3642
05:17:42,298 --> 05:17:45,000
us because we can't do that

3643
05:17:45,000 --> 05:17:47,700
so if your I.T team is your security

3644
05:17:47,700 --> 05:17:49,920
team and that's two people in your whole

3645
05:17:49,920 --> 05:17:52,378
organization you got to start small but

3646
05:17:52,378 --> 05:17:55,740
you have to think and Define who steps

3647
05:17:55,740 --> 05:17:57,480
into these roles ahead of time because

3648
05:17:57,480 --> 05:17:59,520
if you only have a limited security team

3649
05:17:59,520 --> 05:18:02,100
and nobody is taking notes and nobody is

3650
05:18:02,100 --> 05:18:04,200
keeping track in an incident and this is

3651
05:18:04,200 --> 05:18:05,760
something major

3652
05:18:05,760 --> 05:18:07,680
you're going to have a bad time

3653
05:18:07,680 --> 05:18:09,298
so know in advance even if you don't

3654
05:18:09,298 --> 05:18:11,340
have the luxury of a dedicated role

3655
05:18:11,340 --> 05:18:14,840
who's going to be doing these things

3656
05:18:15,000 --> 05:18:16,620
so why is this important and what do

3657
05:18:16,620 --> 05:18:18,298
these roles give us and let's talk big

3658
05:18:18,298 --> 05:18:19,680
picture here and this could be a little

3659
05:18:19,680 --> 05:18:22,260
unique to a larger organization but you

3660
05:18:22,260 --> 05:18:24,240
might have a cyber incident response

3661
05:18:24,240 --> 05:18:25,980
team as well as a general incident

3662
05:18:25,980 --> 05:18:28,260
response team at your organization so

3663
05:18:28,260 --> 05:18:29,820
the Cyber incident response team is kind

3664
05:18:29,820 --> 05:18:31,798
of what we're talking about here which

3665
05:18:31,798 --> 05:18:33,718
is like the separate call where it's all

3666
05:18:33,718 --> 05:18:35,218
the technical folks working the

3667
05:18:35,218 --> 05:18:38,340
investigation and the IR lead is on that

3668
05:18:38,340 --> 05:18:39,298
call

3669
05:18:39,298 --> 05:18:41,878
kind of facilitating leading but then

3670
05:18:41,878 --> 05:18:43,860
feeding updates through their leadership

3671
05:18:43,860 --> 05:18:46,080
and translating the technical updates

3672
05:18:46,080 --> 05:18:48,200
into digestible content for the business

3673
05:18:48,200 --> 05:18:51,120
then your leadership or you however your

3674
05:18:51,120 --> 05:18:52,798
organization does it maybe your CSO

3675
05:18:52,798 --> 05:18:54,780
takes that to the general incident

3676
05:18:54,780 --> 05:18:56,340
response team and I'll talk a little bit

3677
05:18:56,340 --> 05:18:58,440
about that later which handles the

3678
05:18:58,440 --> 05:19:00,660
business level handling of legal privacy

3679
05:19:00,660 --> 05:19:04,138
continuity client relationships briefing

3680
05:19:04,138 --> 05:19:05,820
the sea level things like that making

3681
05:19:05,820 --> 05:19:07,740
decisions with the data you're giving

3682
05:19:07,740 --> 05:19:09,900
them

3683
05:19:09,900 --> 05:19:11,760
so first be prepared with an incident

3684
05:19:11,760 --> 05:19:13,740
response plan everything is so much

3685
05:19:13,740 --> 05:19:16,560
easier if you have a plan before

3686
05:19:16,560 --> 05:19:18,840
this is not a good incident response

3687
05:19:18,840 --> 05:19:20,760
plan if your incident response plan is

3688
05:19:20,760 --> 05:19:22,760
update your resume you're doing it wrong

3689
05:19:22,760 --> 05:19:26,458
don't rely on winging it we all have to

3690
05:19:26,458 --> 05:19:28,138
start from somewhere right you know

3691
05:19:28,138 --> 05:19:30,360
we've all been at companies or incidents

3692
05:19:30,360 --> 05:19:31,740
where you're kind of largely winging it

3693
05:19:31,740 --> 05:19:34,320
and each one gets a little bit better

3694
05:19:34,320 --> 05:19:36,298
but incidents can be emotional things

3695
05:19:36,298 --> 05:19:38,580
and having a plan provides a guide rail

3696
05:19:38,580 --> 05:19:40,860
to hold on to when things get rough

3697
05:19:40,860 --> 05:19:42,958
and you might say well can't our third

3698
05:19:42,958 --> 05:19:45,060
party IR firm that we're going to engage

3699
05:19:45,060 --> 05:19:47,280
our retainer in do this for us and yes

3700
05:19:47,280 --> 05:19:48,780
they can you know they can kind of

3701
05:19:48,780 --> 05:19:50,400
perform that IR lead role for you

3702
05:19:50,400 --> 05:19:52,080
they're going to be documenting it for

3703
05:19:52,080 --> 05:19:53,820
you but wouldn't you like to be able to

3704
05:19:53,820 --> 05:19:55,560
focus them where you want them to be

3705
05:19:55,560 --> 05:19:57,840
focused and use them to both confirm

3706
05:19:57,840 --> 05:19:59,878
your own work and instantly increase

3707
05:19:59,878 --> 05:20:02,940
your 24x7 Staffing in a perfect world

3708
05:20:02,940 --> 05:20:05,160
you want to engage that IR firm and say

3709
05:20:05,160 --> 05:20:07,620
we just need bodies you know we've got

3710
05:20:07,620 --> 05:20:09,480
talented people but we've only got three

3711
05:20:09,480 --> 05:20:10,920
of them or five of them or something

3712
05:20:10,920 --> 05:20:13,138
like that we just want more folks that

3713
05:20:13,138 --> 05:20:15,120
we can direct at the knowledge and get

3714
05:20:15,120 --> 05:20:17,700
the right answer faster

3715
05:20:17,700 --> 05:20:20,040
so what is an incident response plan an

3716
05:20:20,040 --> 05:20:21,660
instant response plan is your place to

3717
05:20:21,660 --> 05:20:23,280
detail your approach to incident

3718
05:20:23,280 --> 05:20:25,138
response so that your organization is

3719
05:20:25,138 --> 05:20:27,840
prepared in advance right so you're

3720
05:20:27,840 --> 05:20:28,980
going to talk about the big picture

3721
05:20:28,980 --> 05:20:31,260
activities that are required and what

3722
05:20:31,260 --> 05:20:34,020
you hold yourself to as a company you're

3723
05:20:34,020 --> 05:20:35,160
going to talk about the step-by-step

3724
05:20:35,160 --> 05:20:37,378
flow of processing an incident not the

3725
05:20:37,378 --> 05:20:40,260
step-by-step of exactly how you do every

3726
05:20:40,260 --> 05:20:42,060
little thing to solve the mystery but

3727
05:20:42,060 --> 05:20:44,340
how does an event turn into an incident

3728
05:20:44,340 --> 05:20:46,378
how does it get to certain teams

3729
05:20:46,378 --> 05:20:48,540
who is involved in incident response and

3730
05:20:48,540 --> 05:20:50,580
who are the decision makers and then

3731
05:20:50,580 --> 05:20:52,440
contact information to engage teams

3732
05:20:52,440 --> 05:20:53,878
communication requirements and

3733
05:20:53,878 --> 05:20:56,160
deliverables so this is really important

3734
05:20:56,160 --> 05:20:58,440
because you don't want to be arguing

3735
05:20:58,440 --> 05:21:00,660
over whose role and responsibility is

3736
05:21:00,660 --> 05:21:02,878
what during the incident you don't want

3737
05:21:02,878 --> 05:21:04,920
to have a power struggle between teams

3738
05:21:04,920 --> 05:21:08,780
and I.T during an incident

3739
05:21:09,120 --> 05:21:10,860
now coming back to the general incident

3740
05:21:10,860 --> 05:21:12,360
response plans you know we're talking

3741
05:21:12,360 --> 05:21:14,878
about cyber incidents specifically but

3742
05:21:14,878 --> 05:21:17,160
your org may also you know have a

3743
05:21:17,160 --> 05:21:19,440
general incident response plan to cover

3744
05:21:19,440 --> 05:21:21,240
things that are outside of security

3745
05:21:21,240 --> 05:21:25,020
right so you might have an outage in an

3746
05:21:25,020 --> 05:21:26,700
application but it's not a security

3747
05:21:26,700 --> 05:21:28,378
issue it just it went down it's

3748
05:21:28,378 --> 05:21:30,540
affecting people the general incident

3749
05:21:30,540 --> 05:21:34,080
response plan is engaged to solve that

3750
05:21:34,080 --> 05:21:36,120
however these incident response plans

3751
05:21:36,120 --> 05:21:38,400
are linked developed together and major

3752
05:21:38,400 --> 05:21:40,138
incident response often involves both

3753
05:21:40,138 --> 05:21:43,138
particularly when it comes to data so

3754
05:21:43,138 --> 05:21:45,718
defining an I.T security incident is

3755
05:21:45,718 --> 05:21:48,660
purely let's say a server has malware

3756
05:21:48,660 --> 05:21:50,760
running on it but that's it you contain

3757
05:21:50,760 --> 05:21:52,320
it it's fine

3758
05:21:52,320 --> 05:21:54,718
end of story that's purely an I.T

3759
05:21:54,718 --> 05:21:57,000
security incident a purely data incident

3760
05:21:57,000 --> 05:22:00,660
is a colleague emailed the wrong

3761
05:22:00,660 --> 05:22:02,878
client's data to another client whoops

3762
05:22:02,878 --> 05:22:05,040
they're going to contact privacy they're

3763
05:22:05,040 --> 05:22:06,718
going to handle that as a general

3764
05:22:06,718 --> 05:22:07,740
incident

3765
05:22:07,740 --> 05:22:10,020
the second you have a server was

3766
05:22:10,020 --> 05:22:12,660
compromised and data was exfiltrated and

3767
05:22:12,660 --> 05:22:15,120
now it's online that's a hybrid incident

3768
05:22:15,120 --> 05:22:16,920
and all hands are on Deck because you

3769
05:22:16,920 --> 05:22:19,260
need those other teams to help you out

3770
05:22:19,260 --> 05:22:22,200
early triage in all of these you know if

3771
05:22:22,200 --> 05:22:23,160
something comes in through the service

3772
05:22:23,160 --> 05:22:24,958
desk they might have a triage that kind

3773
05:22:24,958 --> 05:22:26,820
of figures out what kind of incident is

3774
05:22:26,820 --> 05:22:28,700
this who are we sending it to

3775
05:22:28,700 --> 05:22:31,200
it might be part of your plans too to

3776
05:22:31,200 --> 05:22:32,580
say like okay if it's an I.T security

3777
05:22:32,580 --> 05:22:34,980
incident at what point are you engaging

3778
05:22:34,980 --> 05:22:37,320
the other team and vice versa to make

3779
05:22:37,320 --> 05:22:40,638
sure they're engaged at the right time

3780
05:22:40,860 --> 05:22:43,138
so talking about how we can break an

3781
05:22:43,138 --> 05:22:45,360
incident response plan into digestible

3782
05:22:45,360 --> 05:22:48,120
pieces this is one way of doing it so

3783
05:22:48,120 --> 05:22:49,680
that you can have pieces of it that are

3784
05:22:49,680 --> 05:22:52,138
shareable pieces of it that are not if

3785
05:22:52,138 --> 05:22:54,900
we break it into you know policy process

3786
05:22:54,900 --> 05:22:56,820
playbooks and procedures it makes it a

3787
05:22:56,820 --> 05:22:58,138
little bit easier

3788
05:22:58,138 --> 05:23:00,000
and so depending on the size of when and

3789
05:23:00,000 --> 05:23:01,740
what you already have you could have an

3790
05:23:01,740 --> 05:23:03,180
incident response plan that all is one

3791
05:23:03,180 --> 05:23:05,700
document but doing it this way really

3792
05:23:05,700 --> 05:23:06,980
helps out

3793
05:23:06,980 --> 05:23:10,320
policy addresses purpose scope roles

3794
05:23:10,320 --> 05:23:12,420
responsibility management commitment

3795
05:23:12,420 --> 05:23:14,040
coordination among organizational

3796
05:23:14,040 --> 05:23:16,740
entities and compliance but don't

3797
05:23:16,740 --> 05:23:18,240
reinvent the wheel you don't have to

3798
05:23:18,240 --> 05:23:20,340
write a policy from scratch pick a

3799
05:23:20,340 --> 05:23:23,340
guideline like nist and base your policy

3800
05:23:23,340 --> 05:23:24,718
around it say we can we can

3801
05:23:24,718 --> 05:23:26,160
realistically hold ourselves to the

3802
05:23:26,160 --> 05:23:28,260
standard and you copy and paste out of

3803
05:23:28,260 --> 05:23:29,458
nist

3804
05:23:29,458 --> 05:23:31,560
a process will facilitate the

3805
05:23:31,560 --> 05:23:33,660
implementation of the policy and

3806
05:23:33,660 --> 05:23:36,240
Associated controls so it's more like

3807
05:23:36,240 --> 05:23:38,040
the flow of events and all steps taken

3808
05:23:38,040 --> 05:23:39,718
in a typical response what teams are

3809
05:23:39,718 --> 05:23:42,060
doing what and that flow maybe with like

3810
05:23:42,060 --> 05:23:44,520
a flow chart is not saying like in the

3811
05:23:44,520 --> 05:23:46,680
weeds first we're going to look at this

3812
05:23:46,680 --> 05:23:48,000
log then we're going to look at this log

3813
05:23:48,000 --> 05:23:50,160
it's here's how our events come in

3814
05:23:50,160 --> 05:23:52,138
here's how the sock gets them here's how

3815
05:23:52,138 --> 05:23:54,060
they triage it it might break off and be

3816
05:23:54,060 --> 05:23:55,740
handled by other predefined procedures

3817
05:23:55,740 --> 05:23:57,180
but then here's how it gets into

3818
05:23:57,180 --> 05:23:58,798
incident response and what teams are

3819
05:23:58,798 --> 05:24:00,600
involved

3820
05:24:00,600 --> 05:24:02,820
then playbooks this is where it starts

3821
05:24:02,820 --> 05:24:04,500
getting into more of a luxury so

3822
05:24:04,500 --> 05:24:06,060
playbooks are something that your IR

3823
05:24:06,060 --> 05:24:08,458
team might generate from scenarios that

3824
05:24:08,458 --> 05:24:10,500
haven't happened yet but you want to be

3825
05:24:10,500 --> 05:24:12,718
prepared for so whatever's keeping you

3826
05:24:12,718 --> 05:24:14,700
up at night if you're thinking we've

3827
05:24:14,700 --> 05:24:17,638
never had an incident in a cloud and I

3828
05:24:17,638 --> 05:24:20,100
don't really know how we'd handle it if

3829
05:24:20,100 --> 05:24:22,320
an oracle Cloud instance has a problem

3830
05:24:22,320 --> 05:24:24,240
so you're going to write a playbook for

3831
05:24:24,240 --> 05:24:25,560
that you're going to investigate it

3832
05:24:25,560 --> 05:24:26,820
you're going to find the teams that

3833
05:24:26,820 --> 05:24:28,260
would be involved and you write it out

3834
05:24:28,260 --> 05:24:29,458
as a Playbook

3835
05:24:29,458 --> 05:24:31,440
an early one that's an easy win because

3836
05:24:31,440 --> 05:24:33,540
it kind of covers a lot of incident

3837
05:24:33,540 --> 05:24:36,240
response is ransomware so our first

3838
05:24:36,240 --> 05:24:37,798
Playbook was ransomware because you know

3839
05:24:37,798 --> 05:24:39,780
most things can lead to ransomware you

3840
05:24:39,780 --> 05:24:41,340
know and so you'd write the whole

3841
05:24:41,340 --> 05:24:43,378
Playbook of you know what what do you do

3842
05:24:43,378 --> 05:24:45,240
and what's different about ransomware

3843
05:24:45,240 --> 05:24:47,520
that you might want to pre-define in

3844
05:24:47,520 --> 05:24:49,080
advance like what's your policy on

3845
05:24:49,080 --> 05:24:50,160
things

3846
05:24:50,160 --> 05:24:52,560
that's shareable to the different teams

3847
05:24:52,560 --> 05:24:54,420
that might be involved so if you're

3848
05:24:54,420 --> 05:24:56,340
calling out a team in the Playbook

3849
05:24:56,340 --> 05:24:57,840
saying this team's going to do this for

3850
05:24:57,840 --> 05:24:59,280
us make sure they've seen your playbook

3851
05:24:59,280 --> 05:25:01,860
and have agreed to do these things

3852
05:25:01,860 --> 05:25:03,660
and then your playbook might link to

3853
05:25:03,660 --> 05:25:06,298
procedures so in ransomware

3854
05:25:06,298 --> 05:25:07,920
you might be like well if it came in

3855
05:25:07,920 --> 05:25:09,600
through email let me link to procedures

3856
05:25:09,600 --> 05:25:12,000
on how to do something very specific so

3857
05:25:12,000 --> 05:25:14,700
I want a procedure on here's all the

3858
05:25:14,700 --> 05:25:17,340
methods we use to analyze URLs in email

3859
05:25:17,340 --> 05:25:19,680
here's all the methods we use to analyze

3860
05:25:19,680 --> 05:25:22,740
an attachment anytime that you've got a

3861
05:25:22,740 --> 05:25:24,420
repeatable process that someone knows

3862
05:25:24,420 --> 05:25:26,458
how to do technically make it a

3863
05:25:26,458 --> 05:25:28,680
procedure put it somewhere because you

3864
05:25:28,680 --> 05:25:30,298
know that when major incidents happen

3865
05:25:30,298 --> 05:25:32,878
that's when your best guy on the team is

3866
05:25:32,878 --> 05:25:35,280
on vacation for two weeks or on medical

3867
05:25:35,280 --> 05:25:38,100
leave because you just had a baby or is

3868
05:25:38,100 --> 05:25:40,860
super sick or whatever maybe they've

3869
05:25:40,860 --> 05:25:42,298
just left the company and taken all

3870
05:25:42,298 --> 05:25:43,680
their knowledge with them

3871
05:25:43,680 --> 05:25:45,240
if you have a new hire you want to be

3872
05:25:45,240 --> 05:25:47,040
able to point them to oh yeah you don't

3873
05:25:47,040 --> 05:25:48,660
know how to pull that log here's how

3874
05:25:48,660 --> 05:25:50,520
it's written down here's what access you

3875
05:25:50,520 --> 05:25:52,680
need and here's how to do it in a

3876
05:25:52,680 --> 05:25:54,958
consistent way

3877
05:25:54,958 --> 05:25:56,340
it's also important to think about where

3878
05:25:56,340 --> 05:25:58,138
the stuff gets stored before it happens

3879
05:25:58,138 --> 05:26:01,138
you know for audit purposes for metrics

3880
05:26:01,138 --> 05:26:03,240
purposes you hopefully have some sort of

3881
05:26:03,240 --> 05:26:05,040
ticketing system either homegrown you've

3882
05:26:05,040 --> 05:26:07,200
bought a solution but you need to

3883
05:26:07,200 --> 05:26:09,240
consider what's the access control to

3884
05:26:09,240 --> 05:26:11,160
that ticketing system can anyone in your

3885
05:26:11,160 --> 05:26:13,080
company go in there and search their own

3886
05:26:13,080 --> 05:26:14,218
name and see if they've ever been

3887
05:26:14,218 --> 05:26:16,080
involved in an incident or an internal

3888
05:26:16,080 --> 05:26:19,740
investigation that's not great so for

3889
05:26:19,740 --> 05:26:21,060
most stuff it's going to be in your

3890
05:26:21,060 --> 05:26:22,500
ticketing system but what about major

3891
05:26:22,500 --> 05:26:25,020
incidents that are a little bit scarier

3892
05:26:25,020 --> 05:26:26,760
you're going to want some restricted

3893
05:26:26,760 --> 05:26:28,560
access and you can do this in any way

3894
05:26:28,560 --> 05:26:30,600
you want if you have a ticketing system

3895
05:26:30,600 --> 05:26:32,878
that has like a special module for only

3896
05:26:32,878 --> 05:26:35,820
security where it's private awesome if

3897
05:26:35,820 --> 05:26:37,680
you don't you could have a general

3898
05:26:37,680 --> 05:26:40,320
ticket with a link in it to a restricted

3899
05:26:40,320 --> 05:26:42,540
you access SharePoint and say okay well

3900
05:26:42,540 --> 05:26:44,760
all the documentation's over here what I

3901
05:26:44,760 --> 05:26:46,798
can control who can see it

3902
05:26:46,798 --> 05:26:49,138
if it's really bad or if it's a very

3903
05:26:49,138 --> 05:26:50,700
sensitive incident where you're like

3904
05:26:50,700 --> 05:26:52,980
even new hires in security I don't know

3905
05:26:52,980 --> 05:26:54,480
if they should be able to see it it's

3906
05:26:54,480 --> 05:26:56,458
need to know only only the people who

3907
05:26:56,458 --> 05:26:58,680
were there should be able to see it

3908
05:26:58,680 --> 05:27:00,660
encrypt it further

3909
05:27:00,660 --> 05:27:02,218
and then it's important to talk to your

3910
05:27:02,218 --> 05:27:04,440
legal team about retention periods

3911
05:27:04,440 --> 05:27:06,298
planning for legal holds and

3912
05:27:06,298 --> 05:27:08,040
standardized naming conventions so you

3913
05:27:08,040 --> 05:27:10,980
can keep track of all of this

3914
05:27:10,980 --> 05:27:13,020
so I could Deep dive very heavily into

3915
05:27:13,020 --> 05:27:14,638
incident response plans the components

3916
05:27:14,638 --> 05:27:16,620
of each so if that interests you reach

3917
05:27:16,620 --> 05:27:18,360
out to me later and I've got a whole

3918
05:27:18,360 --> 05:27:19,980
presentation on that with kind of more

3919
05:27:19,980 --> 05:27:22,080
in depth into each section

3920
05:27:22,080 --> 05:27:24,240
however for this we're focused on what

3921
05:27:24,240 --> 05:27:26,218
we want to accomplish specifically as an

3922
05:27:26,218 --> 05:27:29,580
IR lead and or scribe in documenting a

3923
05:27:29,580 --> 05:27:31,620
major cyber incident so what are our

3924
05:27:31,620 --> 05:27:33,240
goals

3925
05:27:33,240 --> 05:27:35,218
so first and foremost we want to get

3926
05:27:35,218 --> 05:27:36,600
through the incident life cycle right we

3927
05:27:36,600 --> 05:27:39,480
want to survive this incident your job

3928
05:27:39,480 --> 05:27:41,160
is to help the teams quickly and

3929
05:27:41,160 --> 05:27:42,540
efficiently move through analysis

3930
05:27:42,540 --> 05:27:44,638
containment eradication without having

3931
05:27:44,638 --> 05:27:46,440
to manage on their own the documentation

3932
05:27:46,440 --> 05:27:49,680
side of things in IR is directly

3933
05:27:49,680 --> 05:27:51,240
involved in a lot of these things you

3934
05:27:51,240 --> 05:27:52,798
know the preparation is kind of what

3935
05:27:52,798 --> 05:27:54,780
we've covered before detection is

3936
05:27:54,780 --> 05:27:56,520
something along with your sock you know

3937
05:27:56,520 --> 05:27:58,320
finding out some things happening in the

3938
05:27:58,320 --> 05:27:59,820
first place and then you're going to be

3939
05:27:59,820 --> 05:28:01,080
going through the rest of the steps a

3940
05:28:01,080 --> 05:28:04,440
lot but it's important to consider where

3941
05:28:04,440 --> 05:28:06,060
does your job end as an incident

3942
05:28:06,060 --> 05:28:08,580
responder you know you can't hand hold

3943
05:28:08,580 --> 05:28:09,660
the whole way there's going to be a

3944
05:28:09,660 --> 05:28:11,160
point where you have to release this to

3945
05:28:11,160 --> 05:28:13,200
the business and say okay we've

3946
05:28:13,200 --> 05:28:15,060
completed the investigation the problem

3947
05:28:15,060 --> 05:28:17,878
is gone persistence is gone we want you

3948
05:28:17,878 --> 05:28:19,740
to rebuild these systems we have these

3949
05:28:19,740 --> 05:28:21,718
recommendations you can't directly do

3950
05:28:21,718 --> 05:28:24,000
that yourself but you have to identify

3951
05:28:24,000 --> 05:28:27,900
where your role ends in being on daily

3952
05:28:27,900 --> 05:28:29,820
calls and you know you need to be able

3953
05:28:29,820 --> 05:28:32,100
to trust the business to recover back to

3954
05:28:32,100 --> 05:28:34,877
a typical state

3955
05:28:34,920 --> 05:28:37,138
and a big part of incident response as a

3956
05:28:37,138 --> 05:28:38,400
leader is getting the right parties

3957
05:28:38,400 --> 05:28:41,100
notified immediately your process may

3958
05:28:41,100 --> 05:28:43,200
help Define who notifies who so maybe

3959
05:28:43,200 --> 05:28:45,000
you'll say you know you don't want

3960
05:28:45,000 --> 05:28:47,218
anyone just randomly going and notifying

3961
05:28:47,218 --> 05:28:49,138
the sea level there should be the proper

3962
05:28:49,138 --> 05:28:51,240
flow of information but it's important

3963
05:28:51,240 --> 05:28:53,400
to be timely both for regulatory reasons

3964
05:28:53,400 --> 05:28:55,500
and so that a business CSO isn't the

3965
05:28:55,500 --> 05:28:56,820
last one to hear about an incident

3966
05:28:56,820 --> 05:28:59,218
affecting their organization

3967
05:28:59,218 --> 05:29:00,900
so I put a bunch of teams on here it

3968
05:29:00,900 --> 05:29:03,240
really depends on the situation but as

3969
05:29:03,240 --> 05:29:06,060
an IR lead part of your role is getting

3970
05:29:06,060 --> 05:29:07,680
the right person on the phone if there's

3971
05:29:07,680 --> 05:29:09,240
something that needs to be done that you

3972
05:29:09,240 --> 05:29:11,878
can't do directly so often the hardest

3973
05:29:11,878 --> 05:29:13,740
part is figuring out who from the

3974
05:29:13,740 --> 05:29:16,020
business side owns a thing so you've got

3975
05:29:16,020 --> 05:29:18,600
an application it's been defaced it's

3976
05:29:18,600 --> 05:29:20,400
down something's clearly wrong but

3977
05:29:20,400 --> 05:29:22,260
you're like I don't know in this major

3978
05:29:22,260 --> 05:29:25,080
company what business unit owns this I

3979
05:29:25,080 --> 05:29:27,060
don't know what team owns this I don't

3980
05:29:27,060 --> 05:29:29,100
need to you know I need to find out how

3981
05:29:29,100 --> 05:29:31,680
and you might be lucky you might have a

3982
05:29:31,680 --> 05:29:33,420
group that through that General incident

3983
05:29:33,420 --> 05:29:35,760
response plan is dedicated to figuring

3984
05:29:35,760 --> 05:29:37,680
that out they might be able to get the

3985
05:29:37,680 --> 05:29:39,600
phone you know on the phone whoever you

3986
05:29:39,600 --> 05:29:40,378
need

3987
05:29:40,378 --> 05:29:42,298
but if you don't have that resource you

3988
05:29:42,298 --> 05:29:43,560
need to have a plan for figuring out

3989
05:29:43,560 --> 05:29:45,660
okay do I have contacts for messaging do

3990
05:29:45,660 --> 05:29:48,298
I have contacts for the business uh who

3991
05:29:48,298 --> 05:29:51,600
do I talk to when inevitably it's three

3992
05:29:51,600 --> 05:29:53,280
in the morning and you need to get

3993
05:29:53,280 --> 05:29:55,138
someone up and it's your job to call

3994
05:29:55,138 --> 05:29:57,360
those people in the night and say you

3995
05:29:57,360 --> 05:29:58,378
know you're in charge of this team

3996
05:29:58,378 --> 05:30:00,600
you're going to be helping otherwise

3997
05:30:00,600 --> 05:30:03,120
you're gonna have a problem

3998
05:30:03,120 --> 05:30:04,620
so what do we want to accomplish with

3999
05:30:04,620 --> 05:30:06,718
our records of the incident so we want

4000
05:30:06,718 --> 05:30:08,340
to be able to tell the story and answer

4001
05:30:08,340 --> 05:30:10,378
questions later I don't know about you

4002
05:30:10,378 --> 05:30:13,080
but I'm kind of a goldfish and if

4003
05:30:13,080 --> 05:30:14,700
someone asks me about an incident that

4004
05:30:14,700 --> 05:30:17,218
happened last week I'm like which one I

4005
05:30:17,218 --> 05:30:19,378
don't know you know there's it's hard to

4006
05:30:19,378 --> 05:30:21,660
keep in your head the facts straight of

4007
05:30:21,660 --> 05:30:23,340
something that happened and you'll find

4008
05:30:23,340 --> 05:30:25,260
that people come to you asking questions

4009
05:30:25,260 --> 05:30:28,500
nine months later two years later you

4010
05:30:28,500 --> 05:30:29,820
want to be able to have all of it

4011
05:30:29,820 --> 05:30:31,320
written down

4012
05:30:31,320 --> 05:30:33,718
you want a detailed searchable artifact

4013
05:30:33,718 --> 05:30:35,878
and host list so you can cross-reference

4014
05:30:35,878 --> 05:30:38,638
future incidents or confirm actions

4015
05:30:38,638 --> 05:30:41,040
taken so someone might say hey this you

4016
05:30:41,040 --> 05:30:42,718
know this is a year later hey this

4017
05:30:42,718 --> 05:30:44,160
username is kind of familiar in this

4018
05:30:44,160 --> 05:30:45,660
ticket were they involved in that

4019
05:30:45,660 --> 05:30:47,280
previous incident you can go check

4020
05:30:47,280 --> 05:30:49,260
someone might come to you and say hey

4021
05:30:49,260 --> 05:30:51,420
just sanity checking did that host get

4022
05:30:51,420 --> 05:30:53,340
re-imaged what did we do with that you

4023
05:30:53,340 --> 05:30:54,718
better have the answer you can't just

4024
05:30:54,718 --> 05:30:57,120
leave these things unfinished

4025
05:30:57,120 --> 05:30:58,920
and then legal retention considerations

4026
05:30:58,920 --> 05:31:01,080
this could come back as a court case you

4027
05:31:01,080 --> 05:31:02,878
don't know until you've been through the

4028
05:31:02,878 --> 05:31:05,580
whole thing how bad it's going to get

4029
05:31:05,580 --> 05:31:08,340
so accurate objective documentation is

4030
05:31:08,340 --> 05:31:09,900
essential for your legal team so that

4031
05:31:09,900 --> 05:31:11,580
you can just hand them all this and be

4032
05:31:11,580 --> 05:31:13,560
like that's we've got it all we've got

4033
05:31:13,560 --> 05:31:15,480
all the data that feeds into it here's

4034
05:31:15,480 --> 05:31:19,280
the story and they can speak from that

4035
05:31:19,560 --> 05:31:22,138
so legal considerations are especially

4036
05:31:22,138 --> 05:31:24,600
important the second this becomes a data

4037
05:31:24,600 --> 05:31:26,638
incident right because now you have to

4038
05:31:26,638 --> 05:31:29,340
consider regulatory issues it really

4039
05:31:29,340 --> 05:31:31,080
depends on your industry and this is not

4040
05:31:31,080 --> 05:31:33,718
your area of expertise this is legal's

4041
05:31:33,718 --> 05:31:36,360
area so let them make the decisions

4042
05:31:36,360 --> 05:31:38,100
about what's going to happen and who's

4043
05:31:38,100 --> 05:31:39,500
going to be notified

4044
05:31:39,500 --> 05:31:41,700
because you might not know you might not

4045
05:31:41,700 --> 05:31:43,920
be thinking about everything so Loop

4046
05:31:43,920 --> 05:31:46,500
them in the second it's appropriate to

4047
05:31:46,500 --> 05:31:48,540
there's also issues sometimes with

4048
05:31:48,540 --> 05:31:50,458
country if you've got a global

4049
05:31:50,458 --> 05:31:52,440
organization depending on where the

4050
05:31:52,440 --> 05:31:54,900
assets are sitting depending on Whose

4051
05:31:54,900 --> 05:31:57,240
data is at risk there could be other

4052
05:31:57,240 --> 05:31:59,878
reporting requirements or maybe you have

4053
05:31:59,878 --> 05:32:01,680
a special customer or client where

4054
05:32:01,680 --> 05:32:03,660
you've signed something you've agreed to

4055
05:32:03,660 --> 05:32:06,480
some different uh reporting requirements

4056
05:32:06,480 --> 05:32:08,638
saying okay well I'll call your sock

4057
05:32:08,638 --> 05:32:11,218
within 24 hours if a certain kind of

4058
05:32:11,218 --> 05:32:13,138
incident happens

4059
05:32:13,138 --> 05:32:15,060
for the parties managing the incident

4060
05:32:15,060 --> 05:32:17,340
for your own IR team you might face

4061
05:32:17,340 --> 05:32:19,320
legal holds where you're told do not

4062
05:32:19,320 --> 05:32:21,320
destroy logs don't destroy information

4063
05:32:21,320 --> 05:32:24,240
or Stop Trade orders where if it's bad

4064
05:32:24,240 --> 05:32:26,040
enough your legal team might say

4065
05:32:26,040 --> 05:32:27,360
you know you're going to be issued a

4066
05:32:27,360 --> 05:32:28,920
Stop Trade order so that you can't dump

4067
05:32:28,920 --> 05:32:30,600
your stock before this hits the news

4068
05:32:30,600 --> 05:32:32,760
right

4069
05:32:32,760 --> 05:32:35,458
so now to talk about how things play out

4070
05:32:35,458 --> 05:32:37,320
when you get paged for something funky

4071
05:32:37,320 --> 05:32:39,780
happening off hours it has to be off

4072
05:32:39,780 --> 05:32:42,180
hours or Friday at 4 pm because it has

4073
05:32:42,180 --> 05:32:44,878
to that's just the rule of ir

4074
05:32:44,878 --> 05:32:47,160
and how does it play out so typically

4075
05:32:47,160 --> 05:32:49,320
this clip of the Matrix just shows Neo

4076
05:32:49,320 --> 05:32:51,298
dodging bullets but I expanded it a

4077
05:32:51,298 --> 05:32:52,980
little bit to include the part where he

4078
05:32:52,980 --> 05:32:55,740
gets clipped because after all you might

4079
05:32:55,740 --> 05:32:57,540
get lucky sometimes you might be super

4080
05:32:57,540 --> 05:33:00,120
prepared as an organization and you skip

4081
05:33:00,120 --> 05:33:02,340
a lot of major issues or some of the big

4082
05:33:02,340 --> 05:33:04,020
vulnerabilities in the news maybe you

4083
05:33:04,020 --> 05:33:06,298
handle it perfectly and not a single

4084
05:33:06,298 --> 05:33:08,100
host had a compromise from some big

4085
05:33:08,100 --> 05:33:11,100
thing in the news but if some it's going

4086
05:33:11,100 --> 05:33:12,780
to happen if it hasn't happened to you

4087
05:33:12,780 --> 05:33:16,080
it did you just missed it so does your

4088
05:33:16,080 --> 05:33:17,760
incident response plan does all the

4089
05:33:17,760 --> 05:33:19,680
pre-work you did give you the Bare Bones

4090
05:33:19,680 --> 05:33:21,360
you need to get the right people on the

4091
05:33:21,360 --> 05:33:23,458
phone and the ability to investigate

4092
05:33:23,458 --> 05:33:24,780
properly

4093
05:33:24,780 --> 05:33:26,280
with the right preparation and

4094
05:33:26,280 --> 05:33:28,440
experienced team your goal is to feel so

4095
05:33:28,440 --> 05:33:29,940
on top of it that you're engaging a

4096
05:33:29,940 --> 05:33:32,160
third party IR but you're not just

4097
05:33:32,160 --> 05:33:33,660
relying on them to do all the work

4098
05:33:33,660 --> 05:33:36,660
you're using them as equal teammates

4099
05:33:36,660 --> 05:33:38,400
you're using them to check your own work

4100
05:33:38,400 --> 05:33:40,260
you're providing them information just

4101
05:33:40,260 --> 05:33:42,240
like they provide you information and

4102
05:33:42,240 --> 05:33:43,860
then they're the nice objective third

4103
05:33:43,860 --> 05:33:46,160
party

4104
05:33:46,560 --> 05:33:48,540
are we good nope

4105
05:33:48,540 --> 05:33:50,820
they're the objective third party that

4106
05:33:50,820 --> 05:33:53,638
is comforting to your sea level

4107
05:33:53,638 --> 05:33:56,520
to say okay our internal team is not the

4108
05:33:56,520 --> 05:33:57,780
only one saying that we handled it

4109
05:33:57,780 --> 05:34:00,180
appropriately but you know your third

4110
05:34:00,180 --> 05:34:02,820
party firm is validating what you've

4111
05:34:02,820 --> 05:34:05,060
done

4112
05:34:05,400 --> 05:34:07,260
so what does the incident response lead

4113
05:34:07,260 --> 05:34:08,940
do and I keep mentioning an incident

4114
05:34:08,940 --> 05:34:11,700
response lead and a scribe if you are

4115
05:34:11,700 --> 05:34:13,260
super luxurious you might have the

4116
05:34:13,260 --> 05:34:15,480
luxury of two dedicated bodies for this

4117
05:34:15,480 --> 05:34:18,540
I do both I'm the lead but you know you

4118
05:34:18,540 --> 05:34:21,000
end up being the Scribe too but the

4119
05:34:21,000 --> 05:34:23,100
primary responsibilities are incident

4120
05:34:23,100 --> 05:34:26,218
stand up so creating dedicated resources

4121
05:34:26,218 --> 05:34:27,600
so you've planned all this out in

4122
05:34:27,600 --> 05:34:29,760
advance how you're going to do this you

4123
05:34:29,760 --> 05:34:31,920
know what tools are you going to use are

4124
05:34:31,920 --> 05:34:33,780
you going to have like a private teams

4125
05:34:33,780 --> 05:34:35,340
Channel where it's access controlled

4126
05:34:35,340 --> 05:34:36,780
where are you telling people to dump

4127
05:34:36,780 --> 05:34:39,120
logs where are you you know what is your

4128
05:34:39,120 --> 05:34:40,700
plan for out-of-band communications

4129
05:34:40,700 --> 05:34:42,240
where are you doing through

4130
05:34:42,240 --> 05:34:44,040
documentation

4131
05:34:44,040 --> 05:34:46,500
initial notifications an IR lead is the

4132
05:34:46,500 --> 05:34:48,120
person who needs to be getting the right

4133
05:34:48,120 --> 05:34:50,218
teams involved notifying the right

4134
05:34:50,218 --> 05:34:52,320
people and sending out that first status

4135
05:34:52,320 --> 05:34:54,900
message to maybe your CSO saying here's

4136
05:34:54,900 --> 05:34:56,340
what we know here's the background

4137
05:34:56,340 --> 05:34:58,200
here's what we've done and here's what

4138
05:34:58,200 --> 05:34:59,820
we're going to do

4139
05:34:59,820 --> 05:35:02,218
there's also the delegation of tasks and

4140
05:35:02,218 --> 05:35:03,420
decision making

4141
05:35:03,420 --> 05:35:06,000
so you delegate some tasks if you need

4142
05:35:06,000 --> 05:35:09,240
to most of us know with an IR team if

4143
05:35:09,240 --> 05:35:11,040
you find something cool if someone says

4144
05:35:11,040 --> 05:35:13,138
I found something I found a web shell I

4145
05:35:13,138 --> 05:35:15,360
found something to Pivot on the natural

4146
05:35:15,360 --> 05:35:17,340
inclination is to squirrel it's too big

4147
05:35:17,340 --> 05:35:18,840
I found it I'm going I'm going to look

4148
05:35:18,840 --> 05:35:20,100
at this new lead and I'm going to leave

4149
05:35:20,100 --> 05:35:22,620
that old system behind you need to make

4150
05:35:22,620 --> 05:35:24,000
sure that you're completing an

4151
05:35:24,000 --> 05:35:26,280
investigation on a system controlling

4152
05:35:26,280 --> 05:35:27,958
who's going off on the new shiny lead

4153
05:35:27,958 --> 05:35:30,180
and making sure sure things are moving

4154
05:35:30,180 --> 05:35:31,560
appropriately

4155
05:35:31,560 --> 05:35:33,718
another important thing to consider is

4156
05:35:33,718 --> 05:35:35,520
you need to delegate who has the

4157
05:35:35,520 --> 05:35:37,138
authority to make an uncomfortable call

4158
05:35:37,138 --> 05:35:39,840
so okay you've got an infection on a

4159
05:35:39,840 --> 05:35:41,700
production server that's running an

4160
05:35:41,700 --> 05:35:43,440
application that generates revenue for

4161
05:35:43,440 --> 05:35:44,580
the business

4162
05:35:44,580 --> 05:35:46,080
whose can make the call and whether or

4163
05:35:46,080 --> 05:35:48,480
not you contain that system and stop the

4164
05:35:48,480 --> 05:35:51,060
business if you've got a VIP with a

4165
05:35:51,060 --> 05:35:52,798
compromised account

4166
05:35:52,798 --> 05:35:54,120
you know who can make the call on

4167
05:35:54,120 --> 05:35:55,620
deactivating his accounts and who's

4168
05:35:55,620 --> 05:35:57,660
going to take the political Fallout if

4169
05:35:57,660 --> 05:35:59,700
that's a bad decision or someone gets

4170
05:35:59,700 --> 05:36:01,500
upset about it

4171
05:36:01,500 --> 05:36:03,780
and then reporting status translating

4172
05:36:03,780 --> 05:36:06,000
developments into digestible status for

4173
05:36:06,000 --> 05:36:08,280
management so this could be hourly if

4174
05:36:08,280 --> 05:36:10,020
it's really early an incident it could

4175
05:36:10,020 --> 05:36:12,900
be once a day it could be once a week as

4176
05:36:12,900 --> 05:36:14,760
things are winding down it's whatever

4177
05:36:14,760 --> 05:36:16,980
makes sense for your organization but in

4178
05:36:16,980 --> 05:36:18,600
a perfect situation when you've

4179
05:36:18,600 --> 05:36:20,040
established this trust with your

4180
05:36:20,040 --> 05:36:21,900
management they're not going to be

4181
05:36:21,900 --> 05:36:24,000
micromanaging the situation if they

4182
05:36:24,000 --> 05:36:27,480
trust you've got it under control

4183
05:36:27,480 --> 05:36:29,580
so here's rules of communication and

4184
05:36:29,580 --> 05:36:31,138
what is your problem and what is not

4185
05:36:31,138 --> 05:36:32,218
your problem

4186
05:36:32,218 --> 05:36:33,780
so your problem is the team

4187
05:36:33,780 --> 05:36:36,000
communication because everything you say

4188
05:36:36,000 --> 05:36:37,860
could be used in court one day so you

4189
05:36:37,860 --> 05:36:39,958
want to make sure that anything you say

4190
05:36:39,958 --> 05:36:43,080
with your team is recorded you know if

4191
05:36:43,080 --> 05:36:44,760
you're using teams or slack or whatever

4192
05:36:44,760 --> 05:36:46,620
create a separate place for that

4193
05:36:46,620 --> 05:36:48,180
communication and give people ground

4194
05:36:48,180 --> 05:36:50,700
rules make sure there's some level of

4195
05:36:50,700 --> 05:36:53,218
professionalism try to discourage people

4196
05:36:53,218 --> 05:36:54,780
saying we are so screwed we need to

4197
05:36:54,780 --> 05:36:56,040
update our resumes because if that's

4198
05:36:56,040 --> 05:36:57,600
read out in court it doesn't look great

4199
05:36:57,600 --> 05:36:59,760
and then talk about out-of-band

4200
05:36:59,760 --> 05:37:01,020
communication

4201
05:37:01,020 --> 05:37:05,520
so maybe your typical communication is

4202
05:37:05,520 --> 05:37:07,740
there's an outage it's gone whatever the

4203
05:37:07,740 --> 05:37:10,920
attacker did you can't get to it or you

4204
05:37:10,920 --> 05:37:12,780
don't trust it you think an attacker

4205
05:37:12,780 --> 05:37:14,580
might have visibility into it you need

4206
05:37:14,580 --> 05:37:17,160
to have planned in advance how you could

4207
05:37:17,160 --> 05:37:18,480
talk to your team in a worst case

4208
05:37:18,480 --> 05:37:21,060
situation and talk to Legal about this

4209
05:37:21,060 --> 05:37:22,740
because they are going to have opinions

4210
05:37:22,740 --> 05:37:24,240
and they're not going to be a fan of

4211
05:37:24,240 --> 05:37:26,700
this but you need to pick the least of

4212
05:37:26,700 --> 05:37:28,798
the evils right so if you're using

4213
05:37:28,798 --> 05:37:31,260
signal with your group no disappearing

4214
05:37:31,260 --> 05:37:32,160
messages

4215
05:37:32,160 --> 05:37:35,160
because as a lawyer told me if there's

4216
05:37:35,160 --> 05:37:37,440
like nine hours of Disappearing messages

4217
05:37:37,440 --> 05:37:40,080
an opposing lawyer can infer anything

4218
05:37:40,080 --> 05:37:43,138
they want about what was in that content

4219
05:37:43,138 --> 05:37:45,180
what is it not your problem is public

4220
05:37:45,180 --> 05:37:47,040
statements client communication or

4221
05:37:47,040 --> 05:37:48,958
internal notifications that's why you

4222
05:37:48,958 --> 05:37:50,340
engage the business that's why you

4223
05:37:50,340 --> 05:37:53,040
engage Communications they are the ones

4224
05:37:53,040 --> 05:37:55,020
who control that you want to keep this

4225
05:37:55,020 --> 05:37:57,540
held close you don't let people go

4226
05:37:57,540 --> 05:38:01,520
talking to the public or whoever

4227
05:38:01,920 --> 05:38:03,958
Staffing this is a tough one it usually

4228
05:38:03,958 --> 05:38:05,760
kind of comes up when you're already

4229
05:38:05,760 --> 05:38:07,500
deep into the night on the first day of

4230
05:38:07,500 --> 05:38:10,320
an incident is understand your team size

4231
05:38:10,320 --> 05:38:12,718
and how you'd staff a major extended

4232
05:38:12,718 --> 05:38:14,280
incident like I'm going to be doing this

4233
05:38:14,280 --> 05:38:16,860
for a whole couple weeks you know we got

4234
05:38:16,860 --> 05:38:18,000
to talk about how we're going to staff

4235
05:38:18,000 --> 05:38:20,280
it and what your expectations are can

4236
05:38:20,280 --> 05:38:23,580
you do 24x7 work on your own are you

4237
05:38:23,580 --> 05:38:25,320
going to engage a third party and hand

4238
05:38:25,320 --> 05:38:26,878
it off completely

4239
05:38:26,878 --> 05:38:29,580
or if you have let's say like my team we

4240
05:38:29,580 --> 05:38:31,378
have four dedicated incident responders

4241
05:38:31,378 --> 05:38:34,320
but we have a lot of talent in all of

4242
05:38:34,320 --> 05:38:36,360
our teams we have managers who used to

4243
05:38:36,360 --> 05:38:38,340
be ir and who want to help if

4244
05:38:38,340 --> 05:38:39,958
something's really happening people

4245
05:38:39,958 --> 05:38:41,520
aren't going to say well no I'm on a

4246
05:38:41,520 --> 05:38:43,020
different team I don't you know it's not

4247
05:38:43,020 --> 05:38:45,180
my problem a lot of people in your sock

4248
05:38:45,180 --> 05:38:47,160
might say I want to be fully involved a

4249
05:38:47,160 --> 05:38:49,440
lot of people in all your teams you know

4250
05:38:49,440 --> 05:38:51,060
your CTI folks are going to be like well

4251
05:38:51,060 --> 05:38:53,820
we're helping directly anyone who can

4252
05:38:53,820 --> 05:38:55,740
you can start fitting into the Staffing

4253
05:38:55,740 --> 05:38:57,420
rotation

4254
05:38:57,420 --> 05:38:59,700
so we consider plan shifts and downtime

4255
05:38:59,700 --> 05:39:01,620
and agree with your team what makes

4256
05:39:01,620 --> 05:39:03,958
sense because the hard part is kicking

4257
05:39:03,958 --> 05:39:05,878
people off you know when something's

4258
05:39:05,878 --> 05:39:07,920
happening adrenaline's up your IR team

4259
05:39:07,920 --> 05:39:10,500
does not want to go to bed they want to

4260
05:39:10,500 --> 05:39:12,780
stay and keep working but it's been 14

4261
05:39:12,780 --> 05:39:14,900
hours and somebody needs to take a nap

4262
05:39:14,900 --> 05:39:18,600
so plan shifts and pair people up and

4263
05:39:18,600 --> 05:39:19,920
say okay we're all going to work in the

4264
05:39:19,920 --> 05:39:21,120
business day we're all going to work

4265
05:39:21,120 --> 05:39:24,120
till like six or seven but then two

4266
05:39:24,120 --> 05:39:25,200
people are going to stay on the bridge

4267
05:39:25,200 --> 05:39:26,638
and two people are going to go to sleep

4268
05:39:26,638 --> 05:39:29,100
and we're being strict about that and

4269
05:39:29,100 --> 05:39:30,660
then we'll pick it up we'll switch it 2

4270
05:39:30,660 --> 05:39:31,980
A.M or something

4271
05:39:31,980 --> 05:39:33,600
and figure it out so that you've got

4272
05:39:33,600 --> 05:39:35,700
bodies doing something but then people

4273
05:39:35,700 --> 05:39:37,378
are getting rest as well

4274
05:39:37,378 --> 05:39:39,180
and figure out who's managing the

4275
05:39:39,180 --> 05:39:40,920
business as usual right because stuff is

4276
05:39:40,920 --> 05:39:43,020
still happening but someone's got to be

4277
05:39:43,020 --> 05:39:44,638
working tickets someone's got to be

4278
05:39:44,638 --> 05:39:46,620
answering emails and kind of figure out

4279
05:39:46,620 --> 05:39:48,600
how that balance works

4280
05:39:48,600 --> 05:39:50,520
a nice thing you can do is reward or

4281
05:39:50,520 --> 05:39:52,440
make easier these long hours if you're

4282
05:39:52,440 --> 05:39:54,298
fortunate maybe you can get a slush fund

4283
05:39:54,298 --> 05:39:55,980
where you can help doordash for these

4284
05:39:55,980 --> 05:39:57,840
people or do it out of your own money if

4285
05:39:57,840 --> 05:39:59,040
you're you know you've got a close-knit

4286
05:39:59,040 --> 05:40:02,040
team you don't have that luxury can you

4287
05:40:02,040 --> 05:40:03,660
reward at the end can you give people

4288
05:40:03,660 --> 05:40:06,000
additional time off can you do a

4289
05:40:06,000 --> 05:40:07,680
challenge coin at the end and say hey we

4290
05:40:07,680 --> 05:40:09,420
all survived this horrible incident

4291
05:40:09,420 --> 05:40:12,298
let's you know have this coin to attach

4292
05:40:12,298 --> 05:40:15,360
all our PTSD to

4293
05:40:15,360 --> 05:40:18,120
so now we've reached deliverables and

4294
05:40:18,120 --> 05:40:20,940
what are we generating right

4295
05:40:20,940 --> 05:40:22,620
right so the Scribe or the IR lead

4296
05:40:22,620 --> 05:40:24,600
whoever is doing this gets to work and

4297
05:40:24,600 --> 05:40:26,458
this is what's being generated from the

4298
05:40:26,458 --> 05:40:28,080
moment you realize something major is

4299
05:40:28,080 --> 05:40:28,920
happening

4300
05:40:28,920 --> 05:40:30,660
so you've got an overview document and

4301
05:40:30,660 --> 05:40:32,400
that's the catch-all that is like a one

4302
05:40:32,400 --> 05:40:34,740
long word document where you're putting

4303
05:40:34,740 --> 05:40:37,260
everything all your notes from calls in

4304
05:40:37,260 --> 05:40:40,080
chronological order statuses copies of

4305
05:40:40,080 --> 05:40:42,060
Correspondence a list of Who's involved

4306
05:40:42,060 --> 05:40:43,560
because that could be more relevant if

4307
05:40:43,560 --> 05:40:46,080
it gets more serious and anytime anyone

4308
05:40:46,080 --> 05:40:47,940
says you know what this wouldn't have

4309
05:40:47,940 --> 05:40:49,860
happened if we had done this in the

4310
05:40:49,860 --> 05:40:51,840
organization if this architecture was

4311
05:40:51,840 --> 05:40:54,600
changed if we fixed this or hey I

4312
05:40:54,600 --> 05:40:56,520
noticed this host doesn't have GPO

4313
05:40:56,520 --> 05:40:58,680
enforced properly so the logs are all

4314
05:40:58,680 --> 05:41:01,138
messed up note that down because you can

4315
05:41:01,138 --> 05:41:03,840
Circle back to it in your after action

4316
05:41:03,840 --> 05:41:06,240
a tracking spreadsheet is where you list

4317
05:41:06,240 --> 05:41:08,520
the specifics of what you're finding and

4318
05:41:08,520 --> 05:41:10,440
what about it is important so that you

4319
05:41:10,440 --> 05:41:12,480
don't lose track so that can be systems

4320
05:41:12,480 --> 05:41:15,840
accounts iocs requests uh you know

4321
05:41:15,840 --> 05:41:18,240
evidence tracking things like that

4322
05:41:18,240 --> 05:41:19,680
you want to make sure you're capturing

4323
05:41:19,680 --> 05:41:22,138
timestamps for a timeline generating the

4324
05:41:22,138 --> 05:41:23,700
actual timeline might come at the end

4325
05:41:23,700 --> 05:41:27,660
but you want those time stamps in UTC uh

4326
05:41:27,660 --> 05:41:30,180
you know as you go along and it's

4327
05:41:30,180 --> 05:41:32,480
extremely important to be translating

4328
05:41:32,480 --> 05:41:35,280
the time zones because I work at a

4329
05:41:35,280 --> 05:41:37,680
global company it never happens you know

4330
05:41:37,680 --> 05:41:39,480
your whole team is working in different

4331
05:41:39,480 --> 05:41:42,120
places the way they view tools might

4332
05:41:42,120 --> 05:41:44,040
display the data in different time zones

4333
05:41:44,040 --> 05:41:46,320
and the systems where this is happening

4334
05:41:46,320 --> 05:41:47,580
are in different parts of the world

4335
05:41:47,580 --> 05:41:50,040
potentially you need to standardize that

4336
05:41:50,040 --> 05:41:51,540
when you put it in a timeline it makes

4337
05:41:51,540 --> 05:41:52,798
sense

4338
05:41:52,798 --> 05:41:54,298
and then you need to consider file

4339
05:41:54,298 --> 05:41:56,160
storage you need to make sure that if

4340
05:41:56,160 --> 05:41:58,878
you come back to this log file it's not

4341
05:41:58,878 --> 05:42:01,860
log.csv and you're like oh shoot I don't

4342
05:42:01,860 --> 05:42:03,360
know what Host this is I don't know what

4343
05:42:03,360 --> 05:42:05,280
time frame this is you need to make sure

4344
05:42:05,280 --> 05:42:08,298
they're named appropriately

4345
05:42:08,458 --> 05:42:10,740
I'm breaking everything okay

4346
05:42:10,740 --> 05:42:13,080
so the overview document can be huge if

4347
05:42:13,080 --> 05:42:15,360
the incident is Major I speak of doing

4348
05:42:15,360 --> 05:42:17,040
this all in a Word document maybe you're

4349
05:42:17,040 --> 05:42:18,120
lucky and you have like a ticketing

4350
05:42:18,120 --> 05:42:19,680
system where you can like put all this

4351
05:42:19,680 --> 05:42:22,080
in there magically but you know going

4352
05:42:22,080 --> 05:42:23,638
more into the weeds of what you can put

4353
05:42:23,638 --> 05:42:25,560
in there you want to talk about the

4354
05:42:25,560 --> 05:42:27,660
background so what was the original

4355
05:42:27,660 --> 05:42:29,638
source of this incident what did you

4356
05:42:29,638 --> 05:42:31,980
know and at the end when you've kind of

4357
05:42:31,980 --> 05:42:33,600
figured it all out right like an

4358
05:42:33,600 --> 05:42:35,700
overview right the story of the

4359
05:42:35,700 --> 05:42:38,100
beginning the middle the end and

4360
05:42:38,100 --> 05:42:39,780
everything so that when you come back to

4361
05:42:39,780 --> 05:42:41,700
it to learn from to show this to

4362
05:42:41,700 --> 05:42:44,400
somebody else you've got the full story

4363
05:42:44,400 --> 05:42:46,440
and then copies of all the

4364
05:42:46,440 --> 05:42:48,480
correspondence anything notes from calls

4365
05:42:48,480 --> 05:42:50,638
it's all important

4366
05:42:50,638 --> 05:42:52,500
any ticket numbers that are related if

4367
05:42:52,500 --> 05:42:54,180
you Outsource work to other groups or

4368
05:42:54,180 --> 05:42:55,620
you have tickets tracking this incident

4369
05:42:55,620 --> 05:42:58,260
jot those down and then anything the

4370
05:42:58,260 --> 05:42:59,638
timestamp developments because you're

4371
05:42:59,638 --> 05:43:00,718
going to be feeding those into a

4372
05:43:00,718 --> 05:43:01,920
timeline

4373
05:43:01,920 --> 05:43:03,600
you also want to keep track of who's

4374
05:43:03,600 --> 05:43:05,218
doing what and what the due dates on

4375
05:43:05,218 --> 05:43:07,620
that kind of stuff is and then one nice

4376
05:43:07,620 --> 05:43:09,298
thing to have in there is URLs for

4377
05:43:09,298 --> 05:43:11,700
Relevant references or articles if it

4378
05:43:11,700 --> 05:43:13,378
hits the media you want to keep track of

4379
05:43:13,378 --> 05:43:15,540
that and then if you're a cyber threat

4380
05:43:15,540 --> 05:43:17,040
intelligence team is finding cool

4381
05:43:17,040 --> 05:43:19,680
information saying what we're seeing or

4382
05:43:19,680 --> 05:43:21,420
what's happening in our environment is

4383
05:43:21,420 --> 05:43:24,060
lining up with this vulnerability it's

4384
05:43:24,060 --> 05:43:26,400
lining up with this thread actor or this

4385
05:43:26,400 --> 05:43:28,138
method of doing things capture those

4386
05:43:28,138 --> 05:43:30,298
links as references

4387
05:43:30,298 --> 05:43:32,458
appendices can include output from IR

4388
05:43:32,458 --> 05:43:34,620
firms so if they generate a timeline

4389
05:43:34,620 --> 05:43:37,200
stick it in there to compare to yours a

4390
05:43:37,200 --> 05:43:39,480
list of red and individuals copies of

4391
05:43:39,480 --> 05:43:41,820
attacker correspondence God forbid and

4392
05:43:41,820 --> 05:43:44,458
contact information

4393
05:43:44,458 --> 05:43:46,980
for the spreadsheet so typically I've

4394
05:43:46,980 --> 05:43:48,660
rolled my own you know in the moment you

4395
05:43:48,660 --> 05:43:50,100
just create a spreadsheet but you might

4396
05:43:50,100 --> 05:43:52,200
miss something in terms of what types of

4397
05:43:52,200 --> 05:43:53,878
data you're tracking that going back

4398
05:43:53,878 --> 05:43:55,680
later you're like oh shoot and I have to

4399
05:43:55,680 --> 05:43:57,120
go figure out what domain all these

4400
05:43:57,120 --> 05:44:00,240
hosts are in I found in some Googling

4401
05:44:00,240 --> 05:44:02,340
crowdstrike has an awesome example one

4402
05:44:02,340 --> 05:44:03,900
that's free you don't have to put your

4403
05:44:03,900 --> 05:44:05,340
information into their website to get it

4404
05:44:05,340 --> 05:44:07,138
I've got a copy on my GitHub I'll

4405
05:44:07,138 --> 05:44:09,540
provide to you but they've got tabs for

4406
05:44:09,540 --> 05:44:10,920
all these different kinds of things and

4407
05:44:10,920 --> 05:44:13,020
importantly they've got columns with all

4408
05:44:13,020 --> 05:44:14,820
the different types of information you

4409
05:44:14,820 --> 05:44:17,480
might want to track

4410
05:44:17,760 --> 05:44:19,980
so this can get pretty specific but it's

4411
05:44:19,980 --> 05:44:21,240
useful because you're going to get

4412
05:44:21,240 --> 05:44:23,940
questions later about all of this I

4413
05:44:23,940 --> 05:44:25,860
guarantee it you want to really keep

4414
05:44:25,860 --> 05:44:28,138
track of okay we have all these hosts

4415
05:44:28,138 --> 05:44:30,660
identified we haven't proved that all of

4416
05:44:30,660 --> 05:44:32,340
them are directly involved yet because

4417
05:44:32,340 --> 05:44:34,020
maybe sometimes you have a lead but it

4418
05:44:34,020 --> 05:44:36,000
doesn't really pan out but what did you

4419
05:44:36,000 --> 05:44:37,740
do with it which ones have you contained

4420
05:44:37,740 --> 05:44:40,020
which ones had web shells on them or

4421
05:44:40,020 --> 05:44:41,820
which ones had evidence that something

4422
05:44:41,820 --> 05:44:44,520
actually happened or where a lateral

4423
05:44:44,520 --> 05:44:45,718
movement happened you've got a time

4424
05:44:45,718 --> 05:44:47,638
stamp put all that in there so you can

4425
05:44:47,638 --> 05:44:49,320
piece it all together later and then

4426
05:44:49,320 --> 05:44:51,058
during recovery you can break it down

4427
05:44:51,058 --> 05:44:52,558
into okay well we know these ones were

4428
05:44:52,558 --> 05:44:54,058
actually involved these ones were

4429
05:44:54,058 --> 05:44:55,320
decommissioning these ones were

4430
05:44:55,320 --> 05:44:57,058
rebuilding and you can kind of keep

4431
05:44:57,058 --> 05:44:58,080
track

4432
05:44:58,080 --> 05:45:00,360
same with accounts keep track of what

4433
05:45:00,360 --> 05:45:02,760
accounts were involved and what you did

4434
05:45:02,760 --> 05:45:04,260
with those accounts were they service

4435
05:45:04,260 --> 05:45:06,540
accounts you got rid of at the end were

4436
05:45:06,540 --> 05:45:08,040
they you know were changes made to them

4437
05:45:08,040 --> 05:45:10,378
were they deactivated make sure you keep

4438
05:45:10,378 --> 05:45:11,400
track

4439
05:45:11,400 --> 05:45:14,458
indicators of compromise uh you might

4440
05:45:14,458 --> 05:45:16,138
want to share them someday if you have

4441
05:45:16,138 --> 05:45:18,180
permission to so having a lot of

4442
05:45:18,180 --> 05:45:20,218
information not only led to your own

4443
05:45:20,218 --> 05:45:22,138
teams sweep your environment for these

4444
05:45:22,138 --> 05:45:24,120
indicators compromise but you might want

4445
05:45:24,120 --> 05:45:25,798
to share them later and you know you

4446
05:45:25,798 --> 05:45:27,840
want to have the information to give out

4447
05:45:27,840 --> 05:45:29,820
and then task tracking you can choose to

4448
05:45:29,820 --> 05:45:31,378
do this in a spreadsheet or however you

4449
05:45:31,378 --> 05:45:34,020
want but if you've got some action item

4450
05:45:34,020 --> 05:45:37,500
for a team you can track it here

4451
05:45:37,500 --> 05:45:39,480
for timeline creation this could be

4452
05:45:39,480 --> 05:45:40,980
something you Circle back to later when

4453
05:45:40,980 --> 05:45:43,680
you have the luxury of time you can use

4454
05:45:43,680 --> 05:45:45,780
any tool you like to do this this little

4455
05:45:45,780 --> 05:45:47,280
screenshot is from a tool called

4456
05:45:47,280 --> 05:45:50,458
timeline maker Pro that we impulse bot

4457
05:45:50,458 --> 05:45:52,558
in the middle of an incident because it

4458
05:45:52,558 --> 05:45:55,320
is cheap I think it's under 200 for a

4459
05:45:55,320 --> 05:45:57,480
lifetime license and it was just

4460
05:45:57,480 --> 05:45:59,638
something you can plug stuff into and

4461
05:45:59,638 --> 05:46:01,320
break it into categories and get a bunch

4462
05:46:01,320 --> 05:46:02,878
of different visual ways of showing it

4463
05:46:02,878 --> 05:46:05,160
so here we've got things on artifact

4464
05:46:05,160 --> 05:46:06,540
information like when did a certain

4465
05:46:06,540 --> 05:46:09,298
artifacts show up threat information so

4466
05:46:09,298 --> 05:46:10,980
if you figure out okay well this the

4467
05:46:10,980 --> 05:46:13,200
root cause here was a cve you can put

4468
05:46:13,200 --> 05:46:14,820
something on there and say this

4469
05:46:14,820 --> 05:46:17,040
vulnerability was reported on this date

4470
05:46:17,040 --> 05:46:18,840
we didn't patch it in time but here's

4471
05:46:18,840 --> 05:46:21,120
how much lead time was between it being

4472
05:46:21,120 --> 05:46:23,218
released publicly and when something

4473
05:46:23,218 --> 05:46:24,600
happened

4474
05:46:24,600 --> 05:46:27,180
things the attacker did things that your

4475
05:46:27,180 --> 05:46:29,340
team did and then actions taken on the

4476
05:46:29,340 --> 05:46:31,080
host so keeping track of what your

4477
05:46:31,080 --> 05:46:33,420
actions were in the timeline of the

4478
05:46:33,420 --> 05:46:35,899
actual attack

4479
05:46:36,000 --> 05:46:37,378
and then you need to be organized

4480
05:46:37,378 --> 05:46:39,958
because this stuff piles up right so

4481
05:46:39,958 --> 05:46:41,340
like I mentioned you know you need to

4482
05:46:41,340 --> 05:46:43,020
put a date on there you need to make

4483
05:46:43,020 --> 05:46:45,058
sure that there's the data type where it

4484
05:46:45,058 --> 05:46:47,280
came from and a Time range so if you're

4485
05:46:47,280 --> 05:46:49,558
pulling email records from someone put

4486
05:46:49,558 --> 05:46:51,240
the date you're pulling it that it's

4487
05:46:51,240 --> 05:46:54,600
email what the user account is and how

4488
05:46:54,600 --> 05:46:57,420
big of a range it is because it could

4489
05:46:57,420 --> 05:46:59,940
end up being hundreds of log files and

4490
05:46:59,940 --> 05:47:01,558
you want to make sure they're organized

4491
05:47:01,558 --> 05:47:03,840
so that if you need to pull them you

4492
05:47:03,840 --> 05:47:05,760
know if legal needs them later you're

4493
05:47:05,760 --> 05:47:07,680
not searching through your email saying

4494
05:47:07,680 --> 05:47:09,240
okay well when did someone send me this

4495
05:47:09,240 --> 05:47:10,798
and what is it and can I figure out the

4496
05:47:10,798 --> 05:47:13,638
context from email

4497
05:47:14,218 --> 05:47:17,100
so after action so we did it we kept our

4498
05:47:17,100 --> 05:47:20,700
jobs uh you know no one's fired but you

4499
05:47:20,700 --> 05:47:22,558
know you want to move on but you need to

4500
05:47:22,558 --> 05:47:25,080
go through an after Action Report you

4501
05:47:25,080 --> 05:47:26,878
need to learn something from this right

4502
05:47:26,878 --> 05:47:29,040
and all the documentation you've been

4503
05:47:29,040 --> 05:47:31,440
doing really helps put all that together

4504
05:47:31,440 --> 05:47:33,600
you can write in like maybe a PowerPoint

4505
05:47:33,600 --> 05:47:34,980
or a Word document however you want to

4506
05:47:34,980 --> 05:47:37,638
do this a background actions taken

4507
05:47:37,638 --> 05:47:40,558
importantly what was successful and then

4508
05:47:40,558 --> 05:47:42,840
what did you drop the ball on both on

4509
05:47:42,840 --> 05:47:45,298
your own team and then within the whole

4510
05:47:45,298 --> 05:47:46,980
business you know we're teams giving you

4511
05:47:46,980 --> 05:47:49,798
trouble did your own process fail you

4512
05:47:49,798 --> 05:47:51,600
and what can be improved and that's

4513
05:47:51,600 --> 05:47:53,280
where you create draft recommendations

4514
05:47:53,280 --> 05:47:56,218
to the business that you can float up to

4515
05:47:56,218 --> 05:47:58,558
other teams one way of doing this is

4516
05:47:58,558 --> 05:48:00,180
doing an after action kind of small

4517
05:48:00,180 --> 05:48:02,040
doing it with your own incident Response

4518
05:48:02,040 --> 05:48:03,480
Team anyone who is involved in security

4519
05:48:03,480 --> 05:48:06,000
and doing it there but you could also do

4520
05:48:06,000 --> 05:48:08,458
an after action involving other teams in

4521
05:48:08,458 --> 05:48:10,558
the business and what their view was of

4522
05:48:10,558 --> 05:48:14,100
how it was successful or not successful

4523
05:48:14,100 --> 05:48:15,958
then you need to document those changes

4524
05:48:15,958 --> 05:48:18,298
and you can't just make a list of

4525
05:48:18,298 --> 05:48:20,638
recommendations and just shove them off

4526
05:48:20,638 --> 05:48:23,400
to someone and say it'll be done it's

4527
05:48:23,400 --> 05:48:26,700
not our problem anymore because if those

4528
05:48:26,700 --> 05:48:29,700
go off and die in someone's inbox and if

4529
05:48:29,700 --> 05:48:31,798
something happens with a breach and you

4530
05:48:31,798 --> 05:48:33,180
had recommended something that could

4531
05:48:33,180 --> 05:48:35,280
have prevented the next one and someone

4532
05:48:35,280 --> 05:48:37,138
in legal finds out that you had

4533
05:48:37,138 --> 05:48:39,058
recommended these things and nobody

4534
05:48:39,058 --> 05:48:40,680
followed through it can be kind of a

4535
05:48:40,680 --> 05:48:42,780
problem so make sure if you're

4536
05:48:42,780 --> 05:48:45,420
recommending action that you get

4537
05:48:45,420 --> 05:48:47,458
agreement from the party who's going to

4538
05:48:47,458 --> 05:48:49,260
do it and a timeline in which they can

4539
05:48:49,260 --> 05:48:51,718
do it and who has accountability for

4540
05:48:51,718 --> 05:48:52,740
that change

4541
05:48:52,740 --> 05:48:54,660
the easy stuff to do though is process

4542
05:48:54,660 --> 05:48:56,100
improvements you've got control over

4543
05:48:56,100 --> 05:48:58,440
that so figure out where did your own

4544
05:48:58,440 --> 05:49:01,080
incident response plan let you down is

4545
05:49:01,080 --> 05:49:02,520
it inaccurate like do you have this nice

4546
05:49:02,520 --> 05:49:04,920
little flow chart of how IR works and

4547
05:49:04,920 --> 05:49:07,138
none of that happens in real life fix it

4548
05:49:07,138 --> 05:49:09,840
right if you have contact information

4549
05:49:09,840 --> 05:49:11,820
that's super out of date or it

4550
05:49:11,820 --> 05:49:14,340
references tools that don't exist take

4551
05:49:14,340 --> 05:49:15,958
the time and fix it

4552
05:49:15,958 --> 05:49:18,058
and then emergency and versus proactive

4553
05:49:18,058 --> 05:49:20,520
changes in an incident you're going to

4554
05:49:20,520 --> 05:49:21,900
be doing stuff in real time you're going

4555
05:49:21,900 --> 05:49:23,520
to be like screw the process I'm not

4556
05:49:23,520 --> 05:49:25,320
doing a 10-day lead time on this change

4557
05:49:25,320 --> 05:49:27,420
make it happen but you need to make sure

4558
05:49:27,420 --> 05:49:29,820
those things you know

4559
05:49:29,820 --> 05:49:33,138
you close that Gap

4560
05:49:33,958 --> 05:49:36,900
then we archive and move on so having an

4561
05:49:36,900 --> 05:49:38,638
incident response plan in place and to

4562
05:49:38,638 --> 05:49:40,798
find leadership and documentation should

4563
05:49:40,798 --> 05:49:42,360
have gotten you some wins and kept more

4564
05:49:42,360 --> 05:49:44,820
people happy about your response so

4565
05:49:44,820 --> 05:49:47,280
faster time to inform better analysis

4566
05:49:47,280 --> 05:49:50,340
and response people just feeling like

4567
05:49:50,340 --> 05:49:52,798
there's better relationships between the

4568
05:49:52,798 --> 05:49:54,240
different teams in I.T and the

4569
05:49:54,240 --> 05:49:56,878
businesses and that nobody was panicking

4570
05:49:56,878 --> 05:49:58,920
and upset because we talked about the

4571
05:49:58,920 --> 05:50:00,840
life cycle of an incident there's also

4572
05:50:00,840 --> 05:50:03,420
the life cycle of grief and we all know

4573
05:50:03,420 --> 05:50:05,340
that when something is going real

4574
05:50:05,340 --> 05:50:07,260
sideways at your company there's going

4575
05:50:07,260 --> 05:50:09,718
to be a lot of emotions flying between

4576
05:50:09,718 --> 05:50:12,660
denial you know denial anger you know

4577
05:50:12,660 --> 05:50:15,120
being upset finally accepting you know

4578
05:50:15,120 --> 05:50:16,500
that kind of defeatist attitude you got

4579
05:50:16,500 --> 05:50:18,298
to make sure that having these guide

4580
05:50:18,298 --> 05:50:19,920
rails in place and having leadership

4581
05:50:19,920 --> 05:50:22,920
guiding can keep people in a healthier

4582
05:50:22,920 --> 05:50:24,180
mind space

4583
05:50:24,180 --> 05:50:27,000
but you got to move on right because the

4584
05:50:27,000 --> 05:50:28,320
worst fear is you're in the middle of

4585
05:50:28,320 --> 05:50:30,840
major IR you think what if we bump into

4586
05:50:30,840 --> 05:50:32,638
a separate problem what if something

4587
05:50:32,638 --> 05:50:35,040
else gets reported at the same time you

4588
05:50:35,040 --> 05:50:36,240
know you want to make sure you're always

4589
05:50:36,240 --> 05:50:39,360
ready that when it rains it pours you

4590
05:50:39,360 --> 05:50:41,100
could have one right after or at the

4591
05:50:41,100 --> 05:50:43,798
same time but then at the end you can

4592
05:50:43,798 --> 05:50:45,780
archive all this you've done it it's not

4593
05:50:45,780 --> 05:50:47,340
going to be like an action item where

4594
05:50:47,340 --> 05:50:49,260
you're like oh shoot I have to go back

4595
05:50:49,260 --> 05:50:52,138
and finalize all this stuff or try to

4596
05:50:52,138 --> 05:50:53,940
remember what happened two weeks after

4597
05:50:53,940 --> 05:50:57,780
it did you've been able to be successful

4598
05:50:57,780 --> 05:50:59,638
so I know this was a lot of content I

4599
05:50:59,638 --> 05:51:01,860
have a GitHub lifted list here where

4600
05:51:01,860 --> 05:51:04,440
I've stripped down some example policy

4601
05:51:04,440 --> 05:51:07,080
process and Playbook documents policy is

4602
05:51:07,080 --> 05:51:08,580
easier if a lot of it's pulled from nist

4603
05:51:08,580 --> 05:51:09,900
there's a lot more to look at there

4604
05:51:09,900 --> 05:51:12,000
playbooks might just kind of have more

4605
05:51:12,000 --> 05:51:14,160
like headers of sections because I can't

4606
05:51:14,160 --> 05:51:16,500
talk about what we do specific to our

4607
05:51:16,500 --> 05:51:18,600
organization but I did put a copy of

4608
05:51:18,600 --> 05:51:20,580
that crowdstrike tracking spreadsheet so

4609
05:51:20,580 --> 05:51:21,660
you don't even have to Google it you can

4610
05:51:21,660 --> 05:51:23,218
just go grab it

4611
05:51:23,218 --> 05:51:25,260
and if anyone wants these slides I'll go

4612
05:51:25,260 --> 05:51:28,138
post them there too as well so if your

4613
05:51:28,138 --> 05:51:30,360
organization does this differently or

4614
05:51:30,360 --> 05:51:32,400
better come find me after I'd love to

4615
05:51:32,400 --> 05:51:34,620
talk I'd love to improve a lot of this

4616
05:51:34,620 --> 05:51:37,080
kind of was homegrown but if anyone has

4617
05:51:37,080 --> 05:51:39,840
any questions comments you know we can

4618
05:51:39,840 --> 05:51:40,980
talk

4619
05:51:40,980 --> 05:51:42,800
and that's it

4620
05:51:42,800 --> 05:51:50,899
[Applause]

4621
05:51:52,378 --> 05:51:54,180
anybody got anything

4622
05:51:54,180 --> 05:51:57,120
otherwise just find me after

4623
05:51:57,120 --> 05:51:59,600
yes

4624
05:52:16,980 --> 05:52:20,040
not quite I mean typically where it

4625
05:52:20,040 --> 05:52:22,620
leaves me in particular is I explain to

4626
05:52:22,620 --> 05:52:24,840
our CSO you know this is what's going on

4627
05:52:24,840 --> 05:52:26,820
this is what's handled and not handled

4628
05:52:26,820 --> 05:52:30,180
and maybe he'll determine who needs to

4629
05:52:30,180 --> 05:52:32,160
be told at that point how nervous are we

4630
05:52:32,160 --> 05:52:34,620
about this at this point so but I

4631
05:52:34,620 --> 05:52:36,900
wouldn't say that's pre-scripted at all

4632
05:52:36,900 --> 05:52:40,160
because every situation is different

4633
05:52:41,160 --> 05:52:43,638
anything else

4634
05:52:46,620 --> 05:52:50,420
all right thank you Casey Beaumont

hey everybody Welcome to the talk uh if

4719
06:14:05,580 --> 06:14:07,378
you're here for decompiler Tom Fuller

4720
06:14:07,378 --> 06:14:09,298
you're in the right room if you're in

4721
06:14:09,298 --> 06:14:10,980
here for another talk you're still in

4722
06:14:10,980 --> 06:14:12,360
the right room it's a great talk stick

4723
06:14:12,360 --> 06:14:13,920
around

4724
06:14:13,920 --> 06:14:16,500
so I I thought I'd start this off by uh

4725
06:14:16,500 --> 06:14:18,360
talking about some alternative titles I

4726
06:14:18,360 --> 06:14:21,058
had for this talk uh a song of dragons

4727
06:14:21,058 --> 06:14:24,240
and elves anybody

4728
06:14:24,240 --> 06:14:27,298
uh debugger Wars episode three Revenge

4729
06:14:27,298 --> 06:14:28,500
of the dwarf

4730
06:14:28,500 --> 06:14:30,120
hmm

4731
06:14:30,120 --> 06:14:32,400
so I I've recently been told by my

4732
06:14:32,400 --> 06:14:33,900
professors that I really need to take

4733
06:14:33,900 --> 06:14:36,240
down the text in my slides so I've had

4734
06:14:36,240 --> 06:14:38,400
this revolutionary revolutionary new

4735
06:14:38,400 --> 06:14:40,980
idea to talk to other gen zeers like

4736
06:14:40,980 --> 06:14:44,458
myself this is the title

4737
06:14:44,458 --> 06:14:45,718
yeah

4738
06:14:45,718 --> 06:14:47,340
I can't even I can't even read that

4739
06:14:47,340 --> 06:14:49,860
title so I've also shortened the title

4740
06:14:49,860 --> 06:14:51,480
That's How we'll refer to the talk from

4741
06:14:51,480 --> 06:14:56,040
now on fish bridge Dragon that's it

4742
06:14:56,040 --> 06:14:57,718
so I I'm Zion

4743
06:14:57,718 --> 06:14:59,400
um my hacker name is mahalos I'm a

4744
06:14:59,400 --> 06:15:00,958
native Hawaiian hacker I'm from Hawaii

4745
06:15:00,958 --> 06:15:03,958
that also means no pineapple pizza

4746
06:15:03,958 --> 06:15:06,540
uh don't bring in near me I'm the

4747
06:15:06,540 --> 06:15:08,400
co-captain of shellfish we're a hacking

4748
06:15:08,400 --> 06:15:10,798
team we compete at Defcon finals every

4749
06:15:10,798 --> 06:15:13,558
year since 2003 we're really into the

4750
06:15:13,558 --> 06:15:15,600
hacking scene I love helping with ctfs

4751
06:15:15,600 --> 06:15:17,100
and stuff like that if you know poem

4752
06:15:17,100 --> 06:15:18,420
college is I'm one of the authors of

4753
06:15:18,420 --> 06:15:20,340
phone college so I'm all over the place

4754
06:15:20,340 --> 06:15:23,400
I'm a PhD student here at ASU I study

4755
06:15:23,400 --> 06:15:25,378
decompilers how we can make them better

4756
06:15:25,378 --> 06:15:27,540
how we can improve structuring so that's

4757
06:15:27,540 --> 06:15:29,100
kind of what I do I'm all around in that

4758
06:15:29,100 --> 06:15:31,200
stuff and I've also been the ASU hacking

4759
06:15:31,200 --> 06:15:32,760
Club president they're a great Club here

4760
06:15:32,760 --> 06:15:35,040
so all these symbols kind of represent

4761
06:15:35,040 --> 06:15:37,378
things I'm associated with so if you see

4762
06:15:37,378 --> 06:15:39,058
these symbols and you happen to have a

4763
06:15:39,058 --> 06:15:42,718
pineapple pizza go the other way

4764
06:15:42,718 --> 06:15:44,940
so an outline of this talk we have five

4765
06:15:44,940 --> 06:15:46,320
major components of the talk we're going

4766
06:15:46,320 --> 06:15:47,638
to be talking about reversing embedded

4767
06:15:47,638 --> 06:15:50,218
devices then reversing the things on the

4768
06:15:50,218 --> 06:15:51,718
embedded devices that make them tick

4769
06:15:51,718 --> 06:15:53,700
which is the binaries then we're talking

4770
06:15:53,700 --> 06:15:55,920
about previous approaches of course by

4771
06:15:55,920 --> 06:15:57,798
the old sages

4772
06:15:57,798 --> 06:16:00,420
solving previous problems problems with

4773
06:16:00,420 --> 06:16:02,340
those previous approaches and then the

4774
06:16:02,340 --> 06:16:04,440
big headliner decomp debug which tries

4775
06:16:04,440 --> 06:16:06,360
to solve all of these previous problems

4776
06:16:06,360 --> 06:16:08,638
we represent decompilation with this

4777
06:16:08,638 --> 06:16:10,558
little dragon guy debugging with the

4778
06:16:10,558 --> 06:16:13,378
fish and the Gap with a scrunched face

4779
06:16:13,378 --> 06:16:15,180
of pain

4780
06:16:15,180 --> 06:16:16,798
so let's talk about reversing embedded

4781
06:16:16,798 --> 06:16:19,020
devices a lot of the talks here at uh

4782
06:16:19,020 --> 06:16:20,940
Cactus con have been about embedded

4783
06:16:20,940 --> 06:16:22,740
devices and how we integrate them in our

4784
06:16:22,740 --> 06:16:24,480
lives how we pen test them things like

4785
06:16:24,480 --> 06:16:26,940
that so one major component of reversing

4786
06:16:26,940 --> 06:16:28,860
embedded devices is the actual Services

4787
06:16:28,860 --> 06:16:30,958
which run those by you know the the

4788
06:16:30,958 --> 06:16:32,878
embedded device which is usually

4789
06:16:32,878 --> 06:16:35,940
binaries uh binaries compiled programs

4790
06:16:35,940 --> 06:16:37,740
that you know are not interpreted so

4791
06:16:37,740 --> 06:16:39,120
we're not talking about python or

4792
06:16:39,120 --> 06:16:41,638
JavaScript we're talking about rust C go

4793
06:16:41,638 --> 06:16:43,200
things you compile

4794
06:16:43,200 --> 06:16:44,760
so that means you have no source code

4795
06:16:44,760 --> 06:16:47,218
and what I have here is a nice embedded

4796
06:16:47,218 --> 06:16:49,020
device a Netgear router it's of the

4797
06:16:49,020 --> 06:16:51,840
Nighthawk variant they don't want you to

4798
06:16:51,840 --> 06:16:53,100
have the source code

4799
06:16:53,100 --> 06:16:55,740
for obvious reasons it would be good if

4800
06:16:55,740 --> 06:16:56,878
we could have it because then we could

4801
06:16:56,878 --> 06:16:58,680
validate the claims they make but we

4802
06:16:58,680 --> 06:16:59,760
don't

4803
06:16:59,760 --> 06:17:01,740
um these binaries you have no Source you

4804
06:17:01,740 --> 06:17:03,240
likely have no symbols either they take

4805
06:17:03,240 --> 06:17:04,620
away the symbols because it makes it

4806
06:17:04,620 --> 06:17:06,180
smaller they also don't want you to have

4807
06:17:06,180 --> 06:17:08,458
an easier time and local execution is

4808
06:17:08,458 --> 06:17:10,680
actually rather frustrating if you've

4809
06:17:10,680 --> 06:17:12,718
ever tried to reverse an embedded device

4810
06:17:12,718 --> 06:17:15,480
before you realize often these binaries

4811
06:17:15,480 --> 06:17:17,400
are connected to the physical stuff on

4812
06:17:17,400 --> 06:17:19,558
the hardware so like imagine you have a

4813
06:17:19,558 --> 06:17:22,740
binary which does hurts manipulation for

4814
06:17:22,740 --> 06:17:26,218
these specific uh antennas if you run

4815
06:17:26,218 --> 06:17:29,218
that binary on your own you know VM even

4816
06:17:29,218 --> 06:17:30,900
if you have the right architecture it

4817
06:17:30,900 --> 06:17:32,820
likely won't run at all because it

4818
06:17:32,820 --> 06:17:34,020
doesn't have the right connections it

4819
06:17:34,020 --> 06:17:35,400
doesn't have the right Services talking

4820
06:17:35,400 --> 06:17:37,558
to it it doesn't even know what Hardware

4821
06:17:37,558 --> 06:17:40,138
to touch so it's not really an option A

4822
06:17:40,138 --> 06:17:41,940
lot of the time and it's a huge space of

4823
06:17:41,940 --> 06:17:42,660
work

4824
06:17:42,660 --> 06:17:45,180
so in this talk we focus on one of these

4825
06:17:45,180 --> 06:17:47,100
major categories which is that binaries

4826
06:17:47,100 --> 06:17:49,320
have zero symbols essentially they're

4827
06:17:49,320 --> 06:17:51,000
really hard to understand and these

4828
06:17:51,000 --> 06:17:53,940
other two are assisted by this first one

4829
06:17:53,940 --> 06:17:55,580
so let's talk about reversing binaries

4830
06:17:55,580 --> 06:17:57,958
reversing binaries is a rather hard

4831
06:17:57,958 --> 06:17:59,820
thing for a lot of people including

4832
06:17:59,820 --> 06:18:01,558
myself I'm a Noob that's why I work on

4833
06:18:01,558 --> 06:18:03,420
decompilation because I can't read

4834
06:18:03,420 --> 06:18:05,760
assembly it's terrible I only can read

4835
06:18:05,760 --> 06:18:07,920
decompilation and emojis those are the

4836
06:18:07,920 --> 06:18:09,600
only two things I understand

4837
06:18:09,600 --> 06:18:11,520
so you have this binary right you can

4838
06:18:11,520 --> 06:18:13,320
take two approaches dynamically which

4839
06:18:13,320 --> 06:18:15,180
means you run through it concretely with

4840
06:18:15,180 --> 06:18:16,860
one state in your mind as you Traverse

4841
06:18:16,860 --> 06:18:19,020
the binary this is you creating a model

4842
06:18:19,020 --> 06:18:21,058
of the binary as you walk through it one

4843
06:18:21,058 --> 06:18:23,760
at a time with like GDB or something

4844
06:18:23,760 --> 06:18:25,980
the other way is statically and this is

4845
06:18:25,980 --> 06:18:28,260
usually with a decompiler and this gives

4846
06:18:28,260 --> 06:18:30,540
you a general abstract model this allows

4847
06:18:30,540 --> 06:18:32,218
you to understand all paths for the

4848
06:18:32,218 --> 06:18:33,780
program it's like reading source code

4849
06:18:33,780 --> 06:18:35,760
when you read the source code you are

4850
06:18:35,760 --> 06:18:37,798
creating a model of every path that goes

4851
06:18:37,798 --> 06:18:39,780
through it so you iterate this process

4852
06:18:39,780 --> 06:18:41,100
until you have some fundamental

4853
06:18:41,100 --> 06:18:43,080
understanding you go between debugging

4854
06:18:43,080 --> 06:18:45,058
go between decompiler you get this great

4855
06:18:45,058 --> 06:18:46,798
understanding of what the binary does

4856
06:18:46,798 --> 06:18:48,600
awesome

4857
06:18:48,600 --> 06:18:51,180
so what does this actually look like in

4858
06:18:51,180 --> 06:18:53,700
practice so this is this is ghidra a big

4859
06:18:53,700 --> 06:18:56,340
old panel full of a lot of things I'm

4860
06:18:56,340 --> 06:18:57,840
not going to explain the things it's a

4861
06:18:57,840 --> 06:18:59,160
lot we don't even want to look at it

4862
06:18:59,160 --> 06:19:00,958
really but there is one some one thing

4863
06:19:00,958 --> 06:19:02,520
really important in here and it's the

4864
06:19:02,520 --> 06:19:05,040
decompilation the decompilation is our

4865
06:19:05,040 --> 06:19:06,660
approximation of the source given only

4866
06:19:06,660 --> 06:19:07,740
the binary

4867
06:19:07,740 --> 06:19:09,840
take a closer look so this is what it

4868
06:19:09,840 --> 06:19:12,298
looks like it's rather ugly right now

4869
06:19:12,298 --> 06:19:14,940
fun zero zero four seven whatever right

4870
06:19:14,940 --> 06:19:16,080
that's

4871
06:19:16,080 --> 06:19:18,540
that's uh very descriptive we don't

4872
06:19:18,540 --> 06:19:20,280
really know what it means what does this

4873
06:19:20,280 --> 06:19:22,200
function do what do any of the variables

4874
06:19:22,200 --> 06:19:23,940
mean what are the types everything's

4875
06:19:23,940 --> 06:19:25,798
undefined nothing makes any sense this

4876
06:19:25,798 --> 06:19:27,780
looks nothing like my C code

4877
06:19:27,780 --> 06:19:30,240
right luckily guidra allows us to

4878
06:19:30,240 --> 06:19:32,520
redefine it we can work on it ourselves

4879
06:19:32,520 --> 06:19:34,558
and we can Define the symbols and the

4880
06:19:34,558 --> 06:19:36,360
types and you know whatever else we want

4881
06:19:36,360 --> 06:19:38,458
this is called generating reverse

4882
06:19:38,458 --> 06:19:40,020
engineering artifacts or we call them

4883
06:19:40,020 --> 06:19:41,340
Reas

4884
06:19:41,340 --> 06:19:44,100
so what has changed exactly the name of

4885
06:19:44,100 --> 06:19:45,840
the function is changed we have symbols

4886
06:19:45,840 --> 06:19:48,120
so has the variables and so have the

4887
06:19:48,120 --> 06:19:50,340
types so what we have done in our mental

4888
06:19:50,340 --> 06:19:52,320
model of this program is we've raised it

4889
06:19:52,320 --> 06:19:54,298
to a new symbolic level this is main

4890
06:19:54,298 --> 06:19:56,820
this is the entry point is authenticated

4891
06:19:56,820 --> 06:19:59,638
is a state we also have types like car

4892
06:19:59,638 --> 06:20:03,058
or Char you know the argument so these

4893
06:20:03,058 --> 06:20:04,980
are the things we have right

4894
06:20:04,980 --> 06:20:07,378
so let's move over to the dynamic side

4895
06:20:07,378 --> 06:20:09,240
now that was the static side this is the

4896
06:20:09,240 --> 06:20:11,520
dynamic side this is GDB this is what

4897
06:20:11,520 --> 06:20:12,840
GDB looks like without any other

4898
06:20:12,840 --> 06:20:15,360
extensions on top of it so looking at

4899
06:20:15,360 --> 06:20:16,620
this you know there's some assembly

4900
06:20:16,620 --> 06:20:18,660
we're breaking at four zero zero seven

4901
06:20:18,660 --> 06:20:21,360
One D that's the same address as main so

4902
06:20:21,360 --> 06:20:23,280
we're breaking at some address and we're

4903
06:20:23,280 --> 06:20:24,958
getting some assembly

4904
06:20:24,958 --> 06:20:27,120
all right a little hard to comprehend

4905
06:20:27,120 --> 06:20:28,980
after just seeing this great source but

4906
06:20:28,980 --> 06:20:31,138
we see it now there's ways to extend

4907
06:20:31,138 --> 06:20:32,820
this you can actually extend it with a

4908
06:20:32,820 --> 06:20:34,558
plugin called Jeff which is just about

4909
06:20:34,558 --> 06:20:37,378
extending what you can see now you know

4910
06:20:37,378 --> 06:20:39,298
from a distance this kind of just looks

4911
06:20:39,298 --> 06:20:41,340
like an eyesore but I promise you it's

4912
06:20:41,340 --> 06:20:44,458
actually useful in practice this gives

4913
06:20:44,458 --> 06:20:46,620
us more information it kind of prints

4914
06:20:46,620 --> 06:20:48,120
out everything that we would see in the

4915
06:20:48,120 --> 06:20:51,000
current state of the debugger but one

4916
06:20:51,000 --> 06:20:52,798
fundamental problem we still don't have

4917
06:20:52,798 --> 06:20:53,940
any of the information from our

4918
06:20:53,940 --> 06:20:56,160
decompiler nothing has made it here we

4919
06:20:56,160 --> 06:20:58,020
still are just seeing assembly we're

4920
06:20:58,020 --> 06:20:59,878
seeing addresses none of our symbolic

4921
06:20:59,878 --> 06:21:00,840
information

4922
06:21:00,840 --> 06:21:03,660
and here lies the Gap right the first

4923
06:21:03,660 --> 06:21:05,520
thing that's problematic we've created

4924
06:21:05,520 --> 06:21:07,378
symbolic locations in our mental model

4925
06:21:07,378 --> 06:21:09,260
of this program

4926
06:21:09,260 --> 06:21:12,180
40071d is mapped to main we think of

4927
06:21:12,180 --> 06:21:14,160
this as main when we try to break here

4928
06:21:14,160 --> 06:21:16,200
we're trying to break at a symbolic

4929
06:21:16,200 --> 06:21:17,218
location

4930
06:21:17,218 --> 06:21:18,718
that's the same for these types and

4931
06:21:18,718 --> 06:21:20,700
their variables right we are thinking

4932
06:21:20,700 --> 06:21:22,920
about a higher level standard already we

4933
06:21:22,920 --> 06:21:24,780
have converted this assembly into C in

4934
06:21:24,780 --> 06:21:26,638
our minds but yet we still have to deal

4935
06:21:26,638 --> 06:21:28,860
with assembly in our debugger which

4936
06:21:28,860 --> 06:21:31,860
sucks again decompilation or emojis

4937
06:21:31,860 --> 06:21:34,920
so where is my source that is the main

4938
06:21:34,920 --> 06:21:36,240
question here and that is the

4939
06:21:36,240 --> 06:21:38,520
fundamental motivation of this talk how

4940
06:21:38,520 --> 06:21:40,500
can we get source and how can we get our

4941
06:21:40,500 --> 06:21:42,840
debugger to be more like our decompiler

4942
06:21:42,840 --> 06:21:44,638
where can we merge the two and close

4943
06:21:44,638 --> 06:21:46,080
this Gap

4944
06:21:46,080 --> 06:21:48,120
so some previous approaches have tried

4945
06:21:48,120 --> 06:21:50,100
to make this a little bit easier

4946
06:21:50,100 --> 06:21:52,200
I think of two major previous approaches

4947
06:21:52,200 --> 06:21:53,520
there are some other ones the first one

4948
06:21:53,520 --> 06:21:56,340
is retsync here's their GitHub rhet sync

4949
06:21:56,340 --> 06:21:58,440
is about synchronizing your actual view

4950
06:21:58,440 --> 06:22:00,540
from the decompiler to your debugger so

4951
06:22:00,540 --> 06:22:03,600
you know say I'm at 40071d and I'm at

4952
06:22:03,600 --> 06:22:05,458
Main it will just make sure that

4953
06:22:05,458 --> 06:22:07,020
whatever you're looking at in either or

4954
06:22:07,020 --> 06:22:10,260
are synced up so you know if you change

4955
06:22:10,260 --> 06:22:11,700
your address it changes it in the

4956
06:22:11,700 --> 06:22:13,138
decompiler

4957
06:22:13,138 --> 06:22:15,180
so that's nice because at least you have

4958
06:22:15,180 --> 06:22:17,458
synchronized views but you still don't

4959
06:22:17,458 --> 06:22:18,958
have any of the symbolic information

4960
06:22:18,958 --> 06:22:21,298
inside of your debugger you can't break

4961
06:22:21,298 --> 06:22:22,740
it main you can break it the address

4962
06:22:22,740 --> 06:22:24,660
representative of Maine

4963
06:22:24,660 --> 06:22:26,760
the second one is probably the closest

4964
06:22:26,760 --> 06:22:28,080
approach that has to try to get here

4965
06:22:28,080 --> 06:22:30,718
which is called dwarf export dwarf is a

4966
06:22:30,718 --> 06:22:33,058
debugging format for GDB or sorry for

4967
06:22:33,058 --> 06:22:35,520
for elves that GDB can understand so

4968
06:22:35,520 --> 06:22:37,378
what this project tried to do was take

4969
06:22:37,378 --> 06:22:39,120
all the information inside of Ida

4970
06:22:39,120 --> 06:22:41,700
another decompiler export it to a dwarf

4971
06:22:41,700 --> 06:22:44,160
once and then import it into the

4972
06:22:44,160 --> 06:22:46,080
debugger so this is actually really

4973
06:22:46,080 --> 06:22:48,540
really close because you have Source

4974
06:22:48,540 --> 06:22:51,298
lines you have types you also have

4975
06:22:51,298 --> 06:22:53,820
variable names now the big problem with

4976
06:22:53,820 --> 06:22:55,860
this is when you update anything in any

4977
06:22:55,860 --> 06:22:57,958
of your decompilers this dwarf is now

4978
06:22:57,958 --> 06:23:00,180
not correct you have a model mismatch

4979
06:23:00,180 --> 06:23:01,860
right you've changed something in this

4980
06:23:01,860 --> 06:23:03,660
the compiler doesn't update in the

4981
06:23:03,660 --> 06:23:06,120
debugger it's a mismatch second this

4982
06:23:06,120 --> 06:23:07,620
only works for Ida and this only works

4983
06:23:07,620 --> 06:23:09,000
for Linux you can't use it on anything

4984
06:23:09,000 --> 06:23:10,980
else because it is specific to dwarfs

4985
06:23:10,980 --> 06:23:13,020
and third this can take a long time

4986
06:23:13,020 --> 06:23:14,878
sometimes because the dwarfs are kind of

4987
06:23:14,878 --> 06:23:15,840
complicated

4988
06:23:15,840 --> 06:23:17,700
so these are the kind of problems we've

4989
06:23:17,700 --> 06:23:19,320
faced

4990
06:23:19,320 --> 06:23:21,660
now there's some generic solutions to

4991
06:23:21,660 --> 06:23:23,458
these problems that we've had there's

4992
06:23:23,458 --> 06:23:25,320
three main ones that you need to cover

4993
06:23:25,320 --> 06:23:27,780
to be a valid solution to this problem

4994
06:23:27,780 --> 06:23:30,298
which is first you need to update your

4995
06:23:30,298 --> 06:23:32,040
symbols dynamically they need to be

4996
06:23:32,040 --> 06:23:33,958
updated as we go you know you need to

4997
06:23:33,958 --> 06:23:35,700
continue to have changes when you make

4998
06:23:35,700 --> 06:23:38,218
them in your static engine your

4999
06:23:38,218 --> 06:23:40,980
decompiler whatever it is second you

5000
06:23:40,980 --> 06:23:43,260
need to display your context we want a

5001
06:23:43,260 --> 06:23:45,180
debug Source where's my source show me

5002
06:23:45,180 --> 06:23:47,040
the source so we should have Source in

5003
06:23:47,040 --> 06:23:49,260
our debugger and third this should be

5004
06:23:49,260 --> 06:23:51,840
somewhat extensible to you know some

5005
06:23:51,840 --> 06:23:53,580
degree shouldn't be really Linux

5006
06:23:53,580 --> 06:23:56,400
specific it could be anywhere so we try

5007
06:23:56,400 --> 06:23:58,320
to cover all three of these spaces and

5008
06:23:58,320 --> 06:24:00,780
surprise surprise we we do cover them in

5009
06:24:00,780 --> 06:24:02,458
this project that is associated with

5010
06:24:02,458 --> 06:24:04,260
this talk which is called dcom to debug

5011
06:24:04,260 --> 06:24:06,058
which tries to lift this information

5012
06:24:06,058 --> 06:24:09,058
into a standard format and then you know

5013
06:24:09,058 --> 06:24:10,740
fit them into the the debugger in

5014
06:24:10,740 --> 06:24:12,660
whatever way we can if you're using GDB

5015
06:24:12,660 --> 06:24:16,378
you can get actual uh Native symbols

5016
06:24:16,378 --> 06:24:18,900
symbols that are real to GDB now that's

5017
06:24:18,900 --> 06:24:22,200
this is fun stuff in here you can see

5018
06:24:22,200 --> 06:24:23,400
this kind of pain and if you're

5019
06:24:23,400 --> 06:24:25,260
interested in using it it works for Ida

5020
06:24:25,260 --> 06:24:27,780
guidra binary ninja anger management and

5021
06:24:27,780 --> 06:24:29,700
you know GDB and all its variants

5022
06:24:29,700 --> 06:24:31,440
including Jeff and stuff like that you

5023
06:24:31,440 --> 06:24:32,700
can go check it out if you're interested

5024
06:24:32,700 --> 06:24:35,040
and I think the best way for you to see

5025
06:24:35,040 --> 06:24:36,900
what the power is is for me to do some

5026
06:24:36,900 --> 06:24:39,180
some demo so we're going to do some demo

5027
06:24:39,180 --> 06:24:41,218
in the shellfish tradition things may

5028
06:24:41,218 --> 06:24:43,260
Sig fault break or blow up during the

5029
06:24:43,260 --> 06:24:45,660
presentation so that's just part of the

5030
06:24:45,660 --> 06:24:47,638
tradition of shellfish this hacking team

5031
06:24:47,638 --> 06:24:49,680
that you guys are now about to get in on

5032
06:24:49,680 --> 06:24:53,400
so let's uh let's see it in action

5033
06:24:53,400 --> 06:24:55,740
so this first uh binary I'm going to

5034
06:24:55,740 --> 06:24:57,660
show you I have two I have two different

5035
06:24:57,660 --> 06:24:59,638
demos for you guys the first is a local

5036
06:24:59,638 --> 06:25:01,378
debugging session and the second is a

5037
06:25:01,378 --> 06:25:03,660
remote debugging session the second one

5038
06:25:03,660 --> 06:25:06,540
actually features a zero day we found on

5039
06:25:06,540 --> 06:25:09,798
this router over here

5040
06:25:13,798 --> 06:25:15,600
latest version or that's the latest

5041
06:25:15,600 --> 06:25:18,718
Netgear router it's one firmware update

5042
06:25:18,718 --> 06:25:20,520
behind so it is now patched and latest

5043
06:25:20,520 --> 06:25:22,740
but this was the zero day as of the last

5044
06:25:22,740 --> 06:25:25,020
update so I guess now it's an end day or

5045
06:25:25,020 --> 06:25:27,840
a one or 0.5 day because it's not

5046
06:25:27,840 --> 06:25:29,940
publicly known you guys are actually the

5047
06:25:29,940 --> 06:25:32,400
first ones to see it so we'll see it in

5048
06:25:32,400 --> 06:25:34,500
the second demo so the first demo will

5049
06:25:34,500 --> 06:25:36,058
be local the second demo will be remote

5050
06:25:36,058 --> 06:25:37,980
the second demo is where things get

5051
06:25:37,980 --> 06:25:41,458
dicey so we'll hope it goes well yeah so

5052
06:25:41,458 --> 06:25:43,260
let's check out this first one so

5053
06:25:43,260 --> 06:25:45,840
running your dcom to debug session is

5054
06:25:45,840 --> 06:25:48,420
pretty easy we started up everything is

5055
06:25:48,420 --> 06:25:51,000
talking over a local port on an XML RPC

5056
06:25:51,000 --> 06:25:53,760
server so we start this we enter the

5057
06:25:53,760 --> 06:25:57,718
binary and now we do decompiler connect

5058
06:25:57,718 --> 06:25:59,218
ghidra

5059
06:25:59,218 --> 06:26:01,798
and we've connected to the decompiler so

5060
06:26:01,798 --> 06:26:04,320
earlier we actually had no symbols right

5061
06:26:04,320 --> 06:26:06,540
this binary doesn't have any symbols we

5062
06:26:06,540 --> 06:26:07,920
can't break it anything it's completely

5063
06:26:07,920 --> 06:26:09,180
stripped

5064
06:26:09,180 --> 06:26:11,878
now we can break a main we hit continue

5065
06:26:11,878 --> 06:26:14,458
we next instruction a little to get into

5066
06:26:14,458 --> 06:26:17,280
past the prologue and you can see on

5067
06:26:17,280 --> 06:26:18,840
this left hand side we actually have

5068
06:26:18,840 --> 06:26:21,900
decompilation inside of our debugger now

5069
06:26:21,900 --> 06:26:24,120
these are actually mapped addresses that

5070
06:26:24,120 --> 06:26:26,280
go between decompilation lines and we

5071
06:26:26,280 --> 06:26:28,980
have real symbols so if I print main

5072
06:26:28,980 --> 06:26:31,080
right this is actually a real symbol

5073
06:26:31,080 --> 06:26:33,120
inside the debugger now it's not fake

5074
06:26:33,120 --> 06:26:35,280
it's not an artificial symbol so it's

5075
06:26:35,280 --> 06:26:36,480
pretty awesome

5076
06:26:36,480 --> 06:26:38,340
so what we can do is we can actually

5077
06:26:38,340 --> 06:26:40,680
keep stepping right we can keep moving

5078
06:26:40,680 --> 06:26:42,718
through stuff we hit a call for a read

5079
06:26:42,718 --> 06:26:44,820
we say cactus

5080
06:26:44,820 --> 06:26:47,400
right and now we can actually print our

5081
06:26:47,400 --> 06:26:49,320
variables over here as well password

5082
06:26:49,320 --> 06:26:52,080
it's typed which is awesome we also have

5083
06:26:52,080 --> 06:26:54,620
username

5084
06:26:55,080 --> 06:26:56,760
so these variables which are local

5085
06:26:56,760 --> 06:27:00,240
variables are mapped as GDB helper

5086
06:27:00,240 --> 06:27:01,920
variables so these ones are not actually

5087
06:27:01,920 --> 06:27:04,740
native and it is kind of fun because you

5088
06:27:04,740 --> 06:27:06,660
can now Port that to wind debug and much

5089
06:27:06,660 --> 06:27:09,480
other ones so if we print this it's

5090
06:27:09,480 --> 06:27:11,340
typed so we can actually see the whole

5091
06:27:11,340 --> 06:27:13,200
normal thing we didn't have to assume

5092
06:27:13,200 --> 06:27:14,580
types we didn't have to do any of that

5093
06:27:14,580 --> 06:27:16,920
we get it all here in addition to that

5094
06:27:16,920 --> 06:27:19,320
if we change stuff we can do new

5095
06:27:19,320 --> 06:27:23,160
username right new username very cool we

5096
06:27:23,160 --> 06:27:25,138
do a next instruction everything has

5097
06:27:25,138 --> 06:27:27,000
changed in our decompilation

5098
06:27:27,000 --> 06:27:29,700
print new username

5099
06:27:29,700 --> 06:27:32,040
we see the same thing same address we

5100
06:27:32,040 --> 06:27:34,080
can dereference it it's Cactus it works

5101
06:27:34,080 --> 06:27:36,298
it's awesome it works for Global

5102
06:27:36,298 --> 06:27:38,520
variables which we can see inside over

5103
06:27:38,520 --> 06:27:39,660
here

5104
06:27:39,660 --> 06:27:42,540
four zero zero two five four

5105
06:27:42,540 --> 06:27:44,218
these are all Global variables found

5106
06:27:44,218 --> 06:27:46,200
within the binary and it even works as

5107
06:27:46,200 --> 06:27:48,240
we change the symbols so for instance if

5108
06:27:48,240 --> 06:27:52,760
we change this to uh not Main

5109
06:27:53,100 --> 06:27:54,660
that's fine

5110
06:27:54,660 --> 06:27:56,878
next instruction

5111
06:27:56,878 --> 06:27:58,798
a little crash on not main I guess

5112
06:27:58,798 --> 06:28:00,540
that's fine

5113
06:28:00,540 --> 06:28:02,878
so generally speaking we are able to

5114
06:28:02,878 --> 06:28:04,620
update these things on the Fly you can

5115
06:28:04,620 --> 06:28:06,958
update symbols you can update types you

5116
06:28:06,958 --> 06:28:09,180
can update these little helper variables

5117
06:28:09,180 --> 06:28:11,878
and the decompilation modifies as we go

5118
06:28:11,878 --> 06:28:13,558
through it so this is kind of the basics

5119
06:28:13,558 --> 06:28:16,378
of dcom to debug and after the demo I'll

5120
06:28:16,378 --> 06:28:17,820
you know reveal a little bit of the

5121
06:28:17,820 --> 06:28:20,218
magic of how we did it so that's kind of

5122
06:28:20,218 --> 06:28:22,378
the cool part of this so now we move on

5123
06:28:22,378 --> 06:28:24,540
to the risky demo let's get to the risky

5124
06:28:24,540 --> 06:28:26,760
demo so here's the risky demo let me

5125
06:28:26,760 --> 06:28:29,239
plug this in

5126
06:28:32,820 --> 06:28:34,740
so what I'm doing right now is plugging

5127
06:28:34,740 --> 06:28:36,480
us into the Netgear router so we're on

5128
06:28:36,480 --> 06:28:39,000
the same network interface so what we're

5129
06:28:39,000 --> 06:28:41,100
going to do is we're going to exploit

5130
06:28:41,100 --> 06:28:43,080
the router so that we can have a shell

5131
06:28:43,080 --> 06:28:44,940
on the router and then once we have a

5132
06:28:44,940 --> 06:28:46,200
shell on the router we're going to start

5133
06:28:46,200 --> 06:28:48,058
a GDB server so that we can connect

5134
06:28:48,058 --> 06:28:50,340
remotely what this all goes to say is

5135
06:28:50,340 --> 06:28:52,860
this is running arm32 and it's running

5136
06:28:52,860 --> 06:28:54,900
very specific binaries but we connect

5137
06:28:54,900 --> 06:28:57,180
from here with GDB remote and then we

5138
06:28:57,180 --> 06:28:59,218
can get our symbols from our decompiler

5139
06:28:59,218 --> 06:29:02,180
so let's try it out

5140
06:29:02,940 --> 06:29:05,520
all right wait for the exploit to

5141
06:29:05,520 --> 06:29:06,958
trigger

5142
06:29:06,958 --> 06:29:11,298
should be uh some nice little suspense

5143
06:29:12,058 --> 06:29:14,638
brilliant we're on the box awesome so

5144
06:29:14,638 --> 06:29:16,620
right now we are on this router's shell

5145
06:29:16,620 --> 06:29:19,440
and what we're going to do is start this

5146
06:29:19,440 --> 06:29:22,200
GDB server

5147
06:29:22,200 --> 06:29:24,180
now I know this is a little pedantic

5148
06:29:24,180 --> 06:29:26,160
because we're going this huge roundabout

5149
06:29:26,160 --> 06:29:27,958
just to run a remote server but I I

5150
06:29:27,958 --> 06:29:29,940
promise it is worth it

5151
06:29:29,940 --> 06:29:33,298
so we also go here let's start this dcom

5152
06:29:33,298 --> 06:29:34,980
to debug server over here on a different

5153
06:29:34,980 --> 06:29:39,360
port 633 good awesome start this in

5154
06:29:39,360 --> 06:29:41,280
multi-arc

5155
06:29:41,280 --> 06:29:44,520
we do Jeff remote

5156
06:29:44,520 --> 06:29:47,520
192.

5157
06:29:49,860 --> 06:29:52,740
we connect remotely

5158
06:29:52,740 --> 06:29:54,718
connect our decompiler

5159
06:29:54,718 --> 06:29:57,600
print packet callback

5160
06:29:57,600 --> 06:30:00,240
see if we have symbols we do to make

5161
06:30:00,240 --> 06:30:02,340
sure things are safe this is a remapped

5162
06:30:02,340 --> 06:30:05,360
address we break there

5163
06:30:05,820 --> 06:30:08,218
now the cool thing about this binary is

5164
06:30:08,218 --> 06:30:10,558
that this binary is for parsing packets

5165
06:30:10,558 --> 06:30:12,360
you can't step through this binary

5166
06:30:12,360 --> 06:30:14,340
unless you're able to trigger packets

5167
06:30:14,340 --> 06:30:16,260
and listen to it remotely without

5168
06:30:16,260 --> 06:30:18,120
interfering with those packet parsings

5169
06:30:18,120 --> 06:30:22,080
so what we do is we send a single curl

5170
06:30:22,080 --> 06:30:24,240
I've sent a curl to this router now you

5171
06:30:24,240 --> 06:30:26,160
can see that it's a Netgear router and

5172
06:30:26,160 --> 06:30:27,600
everything in here

5173
06:30:27,600 --> 06:30:29,700
and now we've actually broken inside of

5174
06:30:29,700 --> 06:30:31,138
the function

5175
06:30:31,138 --> 06:30:34,138
so this is awesome because we are live

5176
06:30:34,138 --> 06:30:36,000
on this router looking at this

5177
06:30:36,000 --> 06:30:38,160
information here which we can now parse

5178
06:30:38,160 --> 06:30:40,260
so I can do something like print packet

5179
06:30:40,260 --> 06:30:41,638
data

5180
06:30:41,638 --> 06:30:44,820
print packet data

5181
06:30:44,820 --> 06:30:46,320
and you can see that the data is

5182
06:30:46,320 --> 06:30:48,958
actually there which is very fun

5183
06:30:48,958 --> 06:30:51,360
so the kind of point of this is that

5184
06:30:51,360 --> 06:30:53,400
this debugging standard Works regardless

5185
06:30:53,400 --> 06:30:55,138
of architecture it works regardless of

5186
06:30:55,138 --> 06:30:57,058
decompiler and debugger we can do it

5187
06:30:57,058 --> 06:30:59,458
remotely and these symbols can kind of

5188
06:30:59,458 --> 06:31:01,558
go back and forth and this is cool

5189
06:31:01,558 --> 06:31:03,480
because this is normally not possible

5190
06:31:03,480 --> 06:31:05,878
for embedded device reversing so you

5191
06:31:05,878 --> 06:31:07,920
know anything you do in here it holds

5192
06:31:07,920 --> 06:31:09,240
the same standards that your normal

5193
06:31:09,240 --> 06:31:11,218
local debugging environment has

5194
06:31:11,218 --> 06:31:13,860
essentially getting you Source over a

5195
06:31:13,860 --> 06:31:15,240
remote connection

5196
06:31:15,240 --> 06:31:17,160
uh so yeah if you're interested more

5197
06:31:17,160 --> 06:31:18,958
about how I actually did this because

5198
06:31:18,958 --> 06:31:20,458
this does kind of look like black magic

5199
06:31:20,458 --> 06:31:22,260
I kind of just got a shell went on the

5200
06:31:22,260 --> 06:31:24,540
router and now we have debugging

5201
06:31:24,540 --> 06:31:26,458
um we have a blog post coming later this

5202
06:31:26,458 --> 06:31:28,020
week where we'll be explaining what this

5203
06:31:28,020 --> 06:31:30,298
bug actually is it is a zero or it's a

5204
06:31:30,298 --> 06:31:32,580
one click into your router over one side

5205
06:31:32,580 --> 06:31:35,458
but it's a fun little thing for all

5206
06:31:35,458 --> 06:31:39,120
Netgear Nighthawk routers so we fully

5207
06:31:39,120 --> 06:31:40,798
you know discovered this exploitability

5208
06:31:40,798 --> 06:31:42,780
through using this decomp to debug

5209
06:31:42,780 --> 06:31:44,458
interface because we have this faster

5210
06:31:44,458 --> 06:31:46,860
reversing system

5211
06:31:46,860 --> 06:31:49,260
so let's move back now to the rest of

5212
06:31:49,260 --> 06:31:51,840
this I will unplug this guy so I have

5213
06:31:51,840 --> 06:31:53,760
normal internet again

5214
06:31:53,760 --> 06:31:58,340
and let's go back to the talk

5215
06:32:01,980 --> 06:32:04,138
I guess we'll have to reconnect to the

5216
06:32:04,138 --> 06:32:06,958
Wi-Fi that's what I get for uh

5217
06:32:06,958 --> 06:32:09,900
trying to do a demo disconnect the Wi-Fi

5218
06:32:09,900 --> 06:32:11,458
and then reconnect

5219
06:32:11,458 --> 06:32:13,940
awesome

5220
06:32:14,820 --> 06:32:16,680
right so you guys have kind of seen some

5221
06:32:16,680 --> 06:32:18,298
of the magic that you can do right we

5222
06:32:18,298 --> 06:32:20,160
can actually make these two things more

5223
06:32:20,160 --> 06:32:21,420
like the same you can get your

5224
06:32:21,420 --> 06:32:23,400
decompiler in your debugger you can have

5225
06:32:23,400 --> 06:32:25,080
these symbols you can map things on the

5226
06:32:25,080 --> 06:32:27,480
Fly how are we actually doing this so in

5227
06:32:27,480 --> 06:32:29,040
the steps that go right you got your

5228
06:32:29,040 --> 06:32:30,600
little reversing sent to the fish here

5229
06:32:30,600 --> 06:32:32,218
you're trying to debug something you're

5230
06:32:32,218 --> 06:32:34,080
trying to debug a binary when you try to

5231
06:32:34,080 --> 06:32:35,700
debug it you trigger events called

5232
06:32:35,700 --> 06:32:37,798
rebase stop events or break points

5233
06:32:37,798 --> 06:32:40,260
anytime you have a break point access we

5234
06:32:40,260 --> 06:32:42,420
take that address we eliminate whatever

5235
06:32:42,420 --> 06:32:44,400
the Base address was in the debugger we

5236
06:32:44,400 --> 06:32:46,320
send it off to the decompiler the

5237
06:32:46,320 --> 06:32:49,080
decompiler sees that what it does is it

5238
06:32:49,080 --> 06:32:50,820
weights on a trigger every time you

5239
06:32:50,820 --> 06:32:52,860
change something we update the cache of

5240
06:32:52,860 --> 06:32:54,900
symbols that we have stored these

5241
06:32:54,900 --> 06:32:56,700
symbols get updated on every change so

5242
06:32:56,700 --> 06:32:58,558
we have hooks in every decompiler that's

5243
06:32:58,558 --> 06:33:01,200
supported so the big four and then we

5244
06:33:01,200 --> 06:33:03,120
send these symbols back in a rebased

5245
06:33:03,120 --> 06:33:05,160
format so those addresses get rebased

5246
06:33:05,160 --> 06:33:06,718
back to the original addresses of the

5247
06:33:06,718 --> 06:33:08,940
debugger we do this with the symbols we

5248
06:33:08,940 --> 06:33:10,320
send you the context of your

5249
06:33:10,320 --> 06:33:12,780
decompilation so we map your address to

5250
06:33:12,780 --> 06:33:14,760
the real source and decompilation and we

5251
06:33:14,760 --> 06:33:17,280
send it back as an XML so you can parse

5252
06:33:17,280 --> 06:33:19,740
this in whatever debugger you want and

5253
06:33:19,740 --> 06:33:20,820
we're kind of doing this through another

5254
06:33:20,820 --> 06:33:23,520
project I write called binsync

5255
06:33:23,520 --> 06:33:26,100
and lastly all those are now made into a

5256
06:33:26,100 --> 06:33:28,080
fake symbol file this symbol file we use

5257
06:33:28,080 --> 06:33:30,180
inside the debugger

5258
06:33:30,180 --> 06:33:32,218
so to give you the quick overview of how

5259
06:33:32,218 --> 06:33:33,718
we do that last part because it's kind

5260
06:33:33,718 --> 06:33:36,360
of nuts we make a small elf on hand

5261
06:33:36,360 --> 06:33:39,120
rapidly on every debug we inject into

5262
06:33:39,120 --> 06:33:41,100
the dot symbol table because this is a

5263
06:33:41,100 --> 06:33:42,480
section of your symbols that can

5264
06:33:42,480 --> 06:33:44,940
actually be modified in runtime we bite

5265
06:33:44,940 --> 06:33:48,298
patch that section to have the max size

5266
06:33:48,298 --> 06:33:51,180
which are these many F sizes so that we

5267
06:33:51,180 --> 06:33:53,940
override the GDB code which checks if a

5268
06:33:53,940 --> 06:33:55,320
section is big enough for new symbols

5269
06:33:55,320 --> 06:33:57,180
and then we add a fake symbol file in on

5270
06:33:57,180 --> 06:33:59,218
every iteration that's kind of a fast

5271
06:33:59,218 --> 06:34:00,840
overview but if you want to see more you

5272
06:34:00,840 --> 06:34:02,458
can read the code online it's open

5273
06:34:02,458 --> 06:34:04,680
source accessible to everybody and you

5274
06:34:04,680 --> 06:34:06,780
know if you like it I'd love for you to

5275
06:34:06,780 --> 06:34:08,878
check it out Port it to windybug you

5276
06:34:08,878 --> 06:34:10,798
know Port it or whatever I accept PRS

5277
06:34:10,798 --> 06:34:12,480
from anybody so it's out there it's open

5278
06:34:12,480 --> 06:34:14,700
you know ready for for you to work with

5279
06:34:14,700 --> 06:34:15,780
it

5280
06:34:15,780 --> 06:34:17,760
and on that note I think we've covered

5281
06:34:17,760 --> 06:34:19,200
all the cool stuff

5282
06:34:19,200 --> 06:34:21,240
um does anybody have any questions about

5283
06:34:21,240 --> 06:34:23,340
any part of this even binary analysis

5284
06:34:23,340 --> 06:34:25,080
since I love binary analysis love

5285
06:34:25,080 --> 06:34:26,160
questions

5286
06:34:26,160 --> 06:34:27,780
yes

5287
06:34:27,780 --> 06:34:32,120
oh oh wait there's a sorry about that

5288
06:34:32,160 --> 06:34:34,638
like this box

5289
06:34:35,520 --> 06:34:39,680
that's a microphone wow yeah

5290
06:34:39,840 --> 06:34:41,760
um so I assume that there was an

5291
06:34:41,760 --> 06:34:44,280
intermediary step when you got root on

5292
06:34:44,280 --> 06:34:45,780
the router in which you had to copy off

5293
06:34:45,780 --> 06:34:47,420
all the binaries to load them into your

5294
06:34:47,420 --> 06:34:50,580
decomposer is that right yes yes it is

5295
06:34:50,580 --> 06:34:52,740
um however the firmware for all these

5296
06:34:52,740 --> 06:34:55,080
routers are usually available online so

5297
06:34:55,080 --> 06:34:56,520
you can just download all the firmware

5298
06:34:56,520 --> 06:34:58,680
but in this case yeah we would have had

5299
06:34:58,680 --> 06:35:01,020
to copy it off normally yeah

5300
06:35:01,020 --> 06:35:04,080
yes uh and then

5301
06:35:04,080 --> 06:35:07,020
you mentioned briefly about how you had

5302
06:35:07,020 --> 06:35:09,360
to rebase these addresses I assume this

5303
06:35:09,360 --> 06:35:11,638
is because in the static firmware they

5304
06:35:11,638 --> 06:35:13,080
have some assumed load address and then

5305
06:35:13,080 --> 06:35:14,218
that load address is different at

5306
06:35:14,218 --> 06:35:16,680
runtime is that right precisely not only

5307
06:35:16,680 --> 06:35:18,900
that but the decompiler will decide

5308
06:35:18,900 --> 06:35:21,058
whatever Base address it wants in Anger

5309
06:35:21,058 --> 06:35:24,540
We Do ox 40 000 in ghidra they do 50 000

5310
06:35:24,540 --> 06:35:26,280
sometimes and in Ida they do sixty

5311
06:35:26,280 --> 06:35:28,138
thousand so everyone gets to just choose

5312
06:35:28,138 --> 06:35:29,760
whatever they want so we always have to

5313
06:35:29,760 --> 06:35:31,798
make it an offset regardless regardless

5314
06:35:31,798 --> 06:35:35,520
of if it's Pi or not pi yeah okay yeah

5315
06:35:35,520 --> 06:35:38,940
yeah it's a mess and then lastly you

5316
06:35:38,940 --> 06:35:42,000
made a point of explaining how it wasn't

5317
06:35:42,000 --> 06:35:45,240
like a virtual symbol in GDB it was like

5318
06:35:45,240 --> 06:35:47,280
a real GDP it's a real g2b Center I

5319
06:35:47,280 --> 06:35:48,540
don't know what that

5320
06:35:48,540 --> 06:35:50,760
is right right so the difference between

5321
06:35:50,760 --> 06:35:53,700
a virtual and a real symbol virtual um a

5322
06:35:53,700 --> 06:35:55,378
virtual symbol was when I did that

5323
06:35:55,378 --> 06:35:57,600
dollar sign that's essentially like an

5324
06:35:57,600 --> 06:35:59,540
environment variable right you

5325
06:35:59,540 --> 06:36:02,040
environment variable and GDB and those

5326
06:36:02,040 --> 06:36:03,600
environment variables you can even set

5327
06:36:03,600 --> 06:36:06,058
types to so it almost looks real to a

5328
06:36:06,058 --> 06:36:07,558
viewer it would look like the same thing

5329
06:36:07,558 --> 06:36:09,480
you'd be like those are the same it'd be

5330
06:36:09,480 --> 06:36:12,180
that this is the same meme but um in

5331
06:36:12,180 --> 06:36:14,580
reality that symbol that was not with

5332
06:36:14,580 --> 06:36:16,740
the dollar sign those are symbols that

5333
06:36:16,740 --> 06:36:18,958
GDB has parsed that are located inside

5334
06:36:18,958 --> 06:36:21,360
the elf and that it recognizes as a real

5335
06:36:21,360 --> 06:36:23,760
function now the reason that's kind of

5336
06:36:23,760 --> 06:36:26,040
like whoa is because other tools down

5337
06:36:26,040 --> 06:36:27,780
the pipeline they depend on that

5338
06:36:27,780 --> 06:36:30,298
information and it's not a dwarf it's in

5339
06:36:30,298 --> 06:36:32,180
the dot symbol table which was invented

5340
06:36:32,180 --> 06:36:35,280
in like early 2000 or something and you

5341
06:36:35,280 --> 06:36:36,860
know way before my time

5342
06:36:36,860 --> 06:36:39,718
and they uh they they made it in such a

5343
06:36:39,718 --> 06:36:41,400
way that it's parcelable by everybody so

5344
06:36:41,400 --> 06:36:42,900
the difference between these real and

5345
06:36:42,900 --> 06:36:45,298
not real symbols is kind of that they're

5346
06:36:45,298 --> 06:36:48,120
not supposed to exist in GDB you're not

5347
06:36:48,120 --> 06:36:50,100
allowed to to create a new symbol like

5348
06:36:50,100 --> 06:36:52,558
hey I reverse this function let me name

5349
06:36:52,558 --> 06:36:55,740
it something GDB says no go get a new

5350
06:36:55,740 --> 06:36:57,240
binary why don't you write Source

5351
06:36:57,240 --> 06:36:59,878
compile that and bring it back right so

5352
06:36:59,878 --> 06:37:02,400
you can't do that in GDB but with our

5353
06:37:02,400 --> 06:37:03,958
tool you can you can hack it in it's

5354
06:37:03,958 --> 06:37:05,700
you're not allowed to do it we hack it

5355
06:37:05,700 --> 06:37:07,740
in and the reason why during the remote

5356
06:37:07,740 --> 06:37:10,440
demo that I couldn't show Breaking at

5357
06:37:10,440 --> 06:37:12,660
that specific symbol like without taking

5358
06:37:12,660 --> 06:37:15,718
the address is because up until I think

5359
06:37:15,718 --> 06:37:18,540
three versions ago GDB if it's 32-bit it

5360
06:37:18,540 --> 06:37:20,820
just sank false GDB it's just save fault

5361
06:37:20,820 --> 06:37:23,638
so this is a rather recent update that

5362
06:37:23,638 --> 06:37:25,620
you can with our stuff hack in real

5363
06:37:25,620 --> 06:37:27,480
symbols and that's kind of what a real

5364
06:37:27,480 --> 06:37:31,160
symbol is very cool

5365
06:37:31,200 --> 06:37:34,700
yes oh yeah

5366
06:37:34,860 --> 06:37:36,058
all right

5367
06:37:36,058 --> 06:37:38,940
um so you found zero days or I guess now

5368
06:37:38,940 --> 06:37:43,039
like end days for the router yeah uh

5369
06:37:43,920 --> 06:37:46,920
get any feedback from Netgear on that so

5370
06:37:46,920 --> 06:37:48,958
for these ones for Netgear they patched

5371
06:37:48,958 --> 06:37:51,840
these I think five days before the pone

5372
06:37:51,840 --> 06:37:54,540
to own but nobody has acknowledged that

5373
06:37:54,540 --> 06:37:56,580
they exist publicly so right now we have

5374
06:37:56,580 --> 06:37:58,320
something going through miter to try and

5375
06:37:58,320 --> 06:38:00,780
get you know CV so we can release it

5376
06:38:00,780 --> 06:38:03,600
more but uh either way it's patched in

5377
06:38:03,600 --> 06:38:05,638
the latest but nobody actually knows

5378
06:38:05,638 --> 06:38:08,280
that this one exists it was categorized

5379
06:38:08,280 --> 06:38:10,138
as a lan exploit which means that you

5380
06:38:10,138 --> 06:38:12,420
can only pone it when you're on the

5381
06:38:12,420 --> 06:38:14,218
Wi-Fi router but we've found that this

5382
06:38:14,218 --> 06:38:15,900
is actually much more devastating you

5383
06:38:15,900 --> 06:38:18,540
can um if I have a website I can point

5384
06:38:18,540 --> 06:38:21,080
you yeah

5385
06:38:21,320 --> 06:38:25,520
ponone is a zero day competition

5386
06:38:27,480 --> 06:38:29,878
more questions I got I got five minutes

5387
06:38:29,878 --> 06:38:31,980
left of questions any questions you want

5388
06:38:31,980 --> 06:38:35,458
binary analysis trivia go

5389
06:38:35,458 --> 06:38:39,079
what's your favorite decompiler

5390
06:38:39,540 --> 06:38:42,120
my favorite decompiler is the decompiler

5391
06:38:42,120 --> 06:38:45,240
called anger management at ASU we write

5392
06:38:45,240 --> 06:38:47,218
our own decompiler we have our own cell

5393
06:38:47,218 --> 06:38:49,200
front decompiler so I guess I'm biased

5394
06:38:49,200 --> 06:38:51,058
but I think that is the coolest

5395
06:38:51,058 --> 06:38:54,298
decompiler however I Ida is uh is Miles

5396
06:38:54,298 --> 06:38:58,680
Ahead of of most decompilers yeah

5397
06:38:58,680 --> 06:39:01,520
any other questions

5398
06:39:02,100 --> 06:39:04,820
there

5399
06:39:05,040 --> 06:39:07,020
why that's that's a real question

5400
06:39:07,020 --> 06:39:08,940
actually I actually feel a little bit

5401
06:39:08,940 --> 06:39:12,420
insulted like like I actually did make a

5402
06:39:12,420 --> 06:39:16,620
mistake and it was uh a t or it was the

5403
06:39:16,620 --> 06:39:19,378
yeah it was at T syntax when I had it up

5404
06:39:19,378 --> 06:39:20,218
there

5405
06:39:20,218 --> 06:39:22,320
I that was a mistake that was just a

5406
06:39:22,320 --> 06:39:24,120
mistake I'll I'll admit my uh fault

5407
06:39:24,120 --> 06:39:27,058
there my bad

5408
06:39:27,058 --> 06:39:29,340
if my uh Professor were here he would

5409
06:39:29,340 --> 06:39:31,740
definitely be like he's a faker he

5410
06:39:31,740 --> 06:39:34,760
doesn't know how to reverse

5411
06:39:36,718 --> 06:39:38,700
any other questions

5412
06:39:38,700 --> 06:39:40,500
from you Rob

5413
06:39:40,500 --> 06:39:42,780
no

5414
06:39:42,780 --> 06:39:43,860
okay

5415
06:39:43,860 --> 06:39:47,218
all right awesome thank you so much

5416
06:39:47,218 --> 06:39:49,680
oh

5417
06:39:49,680 --> 06:39:52,558
I have a light a nice last statement for

5418
06:39:52,558 --> 06:39:56,100
you guys uh goodbye question so in in

5419
06:39:56,100 --> 06:39:58,020
this kind of envisionment of what the

5420
06:39:58,020 --> 06:39:59,638
future of binary analysis looks like

5421
06:39:59,638 --> 06:40:00,840
right because this this was rather

5422
06:40:00,840 --> 06:40:02,280
complicated anything could have gone

5423
06:40:02,280 --> 06:40:04,260
wrong during this talk what does the

5424
06:40:04,260 --> 06:40:06,718
future of binary analysis look like to

5425
06:40:06,718 --> 06:40:08,820
you guys we have more AI we have more

5426
06:40:08,820 --> 06:40:11,160
emojis you know I couldn't find a single

5427
06:40:11,160 --> 06:40:12,958
decompiler that would let me name my

5428
06:40:12,958 --> 06:40:15,900
function in emoji so you know what does

5429
06:40:15,900 --> 06:40:18,240
the future of binary analysis look like

5430
06:40:18,240 --> 06:40:19,440
to you guys

5431
06:40:19,440 --> 06:40:21,730
