1
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,080
no matter characters not live how about

2
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,520
now

3
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:38,640
give it about five seconds you should

4
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,780
hey anyone know what's going on with

5
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:41,940
track two yes yep there we go who they

6
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:44,120
got audio

7
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,440
hey anyone know what's going on track

8
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:49,280
too oh wait

9
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:56,220
up we can hear you on the street talking

10
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:59,120
to us on the street

11
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,920
s

12
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:15,300
why am I hearing

13
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:17,599
this

14
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:39,200
okay

15
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:20,880
I think it's been known to have

16
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:24,320
the same effects on the electrical

17
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,699
so

18
00:09:42,019 --> 00:09:43,980
hacking experience with the technology

19
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:46,200
so that's what we're here to do

20
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,120
essential tools you don't need the

21
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,620
latest and greatest

22
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:51,839
but having sport invasive tools is gonna

23
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:54,540
carry you forward with your engagements

24
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:56,100
multimeter

25
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:58,560
super important you can use a Multimeter

26
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,480
to test continuity and voltage on a

27
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,800
device

28
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:04,380
and this is useful for when you identify

29
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:05,700
components that aren't going to be

30
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:07,860
labeled the world isn't all flowers and

31
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:09,540
snowflakes and you're not going to get

32
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:11,519
those nice instructions

33
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:13,320
so multimeter will help with that

34
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,700
debugging experience

35
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:16,800
I like the iFixit screwdriver kit it's

36
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,440
got a lot of unique extra shapes and so

37
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,959
far I've not run into a device that has

38
00:10:21,959 --> 00:10:23,339
not had at least one of the screws on

39
00:10:23,339 --> 00:10:26,660
the iFixit screwdriver kit

40
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,920
a locked analyzer this is very good for

41
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,620
analyzing the clock signals on a digital

42
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:32,880
circuit

43
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,920
so when you're going through a protocol

44
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:37,200
like you are a spy

45
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,500
can lock piano Locker can be very useful

46
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,880
for when you're trying to debug the

47
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,200
circuit

48
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,459
sorry

49
00:10:44,459 --> 00:10:46,740
Asian soldering is super important skill

50
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:49,140
to have when you're working with these

51
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:51,240
devices a lot of times you're gonna have

52
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,980
these pin outs

53
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:54,300
and they're not going to be fired for

54
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:55,560
you or they're not going to have in

55
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,120
second connect so being able to start

56
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,160
those results is support skill to have

57
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:01,380
when I started I was terrible at it I

58
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:03,060
couldn't solder that well and what I

59
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:05,160
found out was that I was buying these

60
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,779
cheap soldering iron

61
00:11:06,779 --> 00:11:09,180
it's off Amazon and they're terrible

62
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:10,680
quality they weren't heating up hot

63
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,600
enough so I got this haco digital

64
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,240
soldering station it heats up at a much

65
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,680
higher temperature and it's a lot better

66
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,779
for soldering and I found my soldering

67
00:11:18,779 --> 00:11:20,040
becoming a lot better just by having a

68
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:22,200
better quality tool

69
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,480
and the last Essentials whatever man is

70
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,880
a digital microscope because when you're

71
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,399
performing a teardown of the device

72
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:30,480
you're going to want to be able to see

73
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,000
the serial number as well as more

74
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,860
information on

75
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:37,200
components I play a lot of video games

76
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,579
on my phone a lot mine's getting worse

77
00:11:38,579 --> 00:11:40,260
and I thought I'm squinting all time

78
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:43,260
it's not the fun thing so having a

79
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:45,120
tool like a digital microscope is really

80
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,980
helpful and what's nice about this when

81
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:49,620
I have the end and star it can take

82
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:51,240
screenshots so if you're working on

83
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,620
engagement and you need to put an image

84
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:54,779
on a report the screenshot capabilities

85
00:11:54,779 --> 00:11:57,680
are really nice to have

86
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:00,839
so let's start acquiring our targets how

87
00:12:00,839 --> 00:12:02,040
do you go out

88
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:04,200
My Philosophy for getting started in iot

89
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,700
start with the cheapest devices you can

90
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:06,959
find you don't need to spend a lot of

91
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:09,000
money and these cheaper devices you're

92
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,079
going to start to see these more

93
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:13,320
low-level vulnerabilities so I went on

94
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:16,079
websites like AliExpress eBay Amazon and

95
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:18,000
Walmart and I bought the cheapest things

96
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,820
I could find lots of routers I think

97
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:22,980
there's a smart TV in there some alarm

98
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:25,260
systems you probably see that giant

99
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:27,120
arcade machine in the back I got that at

100
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,279
Walmart it was on sale all these have

101
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:30,540
the same protocols that we're gonna talk

102
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:32,839
about today

103
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,700
it should also be recommended you should

104
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:37,860
buy two of the same device because if

105
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:40,260
you break it or you start modifying it a

106
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:41,760
lot and you want to test it against the

107
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,260
original firmware that's on the device

108
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:44,700
having it

109
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,680
the second device will help you again

110
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,779
list how many devices I've bricked and

111
00:12:48,779 --> 00:12:52,160
then regretted not having a second one

112
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,320
Harbor reconnaissance and information

113
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,360
gathering let's explain the importance

114
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,500
of it

115
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,240
which is kind of the methodology you

116
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,100
should try to approach when going after

117
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:03,839
these iot devices

118
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:05,639
First Step get your hands dirty take

119
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:07,260
open the device you're not going to get

120
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:09,120
much further if you just start

121
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,160
I got this beautiful plastic case that's

122
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:13,200
aligned around it if you look at back

123
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,040
here

124
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,899
I just open all these routers so you

125
00:13:15,899 --> 00:13:17,700
might not oozies are but these are all

126
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:18,779
routers I just took the shell off

127
00:13:18,779 --> 00:13:20,880
because I don't really care what it

128
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,180
looks like

129
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,019
Harbor reconnaissance information

130
00:13:25,019 --> 00:13:27,240
gathering is super important because you

131
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,500
need to take advantage of the

132
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,180
information already out there to save

133
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:32,579
time there's a security researcher or an

134
00:13:32,579 --> 00:13:34,800
organization out there who's already

135
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,240
written a blog post about the device

136
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,920
you're hacking just go look at you know

137
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:38,820
that information's out there it's for

138
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:40,380
everyone to help you potentially find

139
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:41,700
other new things because you have place

140
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:45,060
and greatest information

141
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,519
after you've done that it's important to

142
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:49,320
go through the board and identify

143
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:52,139
important ships pin outs and other

144
00:13:52,139 --> 00:13:54,120
interfaces on the board this is where

145
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,260
having digital microscope is nice

146
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:56,760
because you can kind of see it at a

147
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:57,959
larger scale

148
00:13:57,959 --> 00:13:59,459
and a better idea of what you're working

149
00:13:59,459 --> 00:14:01,019
with

150
00:14:01,019 --> 00:14:02,700
understand where's the firmware on the

151
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:05,220
device firmware is a important attack

152
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:06,899
Target for these two devices so being

153
00:14:06,899 --> 00:14:08,880
able to quickly identify the components

154
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,279
where the firmware is sure they help you

155
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:12,300
a lot

156
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:15,180
did you find a data sheet data sheets

157
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:18,240
are important because represent a wealth

158
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,980
of information related either to the

159
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:21,300
board or the component you're working on

160
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:22,680
and you might not even need perform

161
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:24,240
reverse engineering if you can find age

162
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,339
sheet on the component

163
00:14:26,339 --> 00:14:27,899
and then does the device have a known

164
00:14:27,899 --> 00:14:29,880
fccdi

165
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:32,639
CC IDs they have are required by the US

166
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:34,200
government

167
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:37,560
if you emit a 2.4 gigahertz signal and

168
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:38,959
you can find a wealth information

169
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:41,820
teardowns device schematics and it can

170
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:43,980
be really useful for your engagements

171
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:45,240
and then once you've gone through this

172
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:48,120
process being able to interact with the

173
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,500
interfaces and components you've

174
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,600
identified can you read it can you write

175
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,519
and then reduce your can you execute it

176
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:54,660
these are all going to be important

177
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:55,800
strategies

178
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,959
the last two reverse engineering and

179
00:14:57,959 --> 00:14:59,820
exploitation phases they might not be

180
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:00,959
needed for what you're trying to

181
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:03,360
accomplish but once you are back to put

182
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,279
the system what more can you learn from

183
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:08,000
it and attack

184
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,279
so I mentioned that reading date sheets

185
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:13,260
is important

186
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:17,699
and this data sheet I found twin Bond

187
00:15:17,699 --> 00:15:19,680
and what's nice about this data sheet is

188
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,920
I was going through a iot device that

189
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:25,139
had the firmware stored on it and I

190
00:15:25,139 --> 00:15:27,000
wanted to see what the pin out of the

191
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,860
device looked like and I was able to

192
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:30,899
just look up the serial number from the

193
00:15:30,899 --> 00:15:32,639
component from my digital microscope and

194
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:35,160
be able to find that exact data issue so

195
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:37,019
a lot of the times the information is

196
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:38,699
already out there you just have to go

197
00:15:38,699 --> 00:15:41,240
after it before

198
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,940
so you mentioned that FCC IDs are your

199
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:47,639
friends because they might give you

200
00:15:47,639 --> 00:15:49,079
information that you can't find in other

201
00:15:49,079 --> 00:15:52,079
places I was working on engagement once

202
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:54,600
time and I asked the client for

203
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,100
important schematics and data sheets

204
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:58,920
that might be useful but the client for

205
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,300
some reason they thought that this

206
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:01,920
information was sensitive and they

207
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,600
wanted to go through

208
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,760
an NDA process to share it with me I

209
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,019
didn't have enough time on the

210
00:16:07,019 --> 00:16:09,060
engagement left so he didn't give to me

211
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:11,579
what I quickly realized is that just

212
00:16:11,579 --> 00:16:14,100
searching their product on the fcc's

213
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:15,839
website I was able to find a tear down

214
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:17,399
of the device I was able to find a data

215
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:18,360
sheet

216
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:20,279
systematic so what they thought was

217
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:21,779
sensitive information I was able to find

218
00:16:21,779 --> 00:16:24,000
publicly on fcc's website so moral of

219
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,820
the story oh no screw what probably find

220
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:29,000
it

221
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,699
so let's get into iot debugging serial

222
00:16:32,699 --> 00:16:34,380
interfaces this is going to be really

223
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:36,060
good when you start out in iot

224
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:38,759
and I like to start with QR because it's

225
00:16:38,759 --> 00:16:40,139
the more symbol of all the interfaces

226
00:16:40,139 --> 00:16:45,060
and you'll start to see but

227
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:49,079
so your art stands for the universal

228
00:16:49,079 --> 00:16:51,060
asynchronous transmitter and receiver

229
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:55,920
and it's typically a three four five pin

230
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,899
setup on a board so if you start to see

231
00:16:57,899 --> 00:17:00,899
these type hints in order then potential

232
00:17:00,899 --> 00:17:03,420
Contender for more

233
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:06,480
the three most important pins on uart

234
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,699
are the TX which is the transmitter the

235
00:17:08,699 --> 00:17:11,699
RX the receiver and the grout I wrote

236
00:17:11,699 --> 00:17:14,160
VCC is optional because it depends if

237
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,619
you want to power or you aren't through

238
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:18,419
the pencil or the device most of the

239
00:17:18,419 --> 00:17:19,919
time I'll just turn on the device and

240
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:23,099
access you art through that so I think

241
00:17:23,099 --> 00:17:26,059
that's a much better approach

242
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:29,400
you are it's a interface that's used a

243
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,559
lot with Engineers because they can

244
00:17:31,559 --> 00:17:33,660
debug the board as they're developing it

245
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:35,280
and what we see a lot of wild with these

246
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:38,100
iot devices is that Engineers will not

247
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:39,780
disable you are after shipping it to

248
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:42,240
production so this is why we see a lot

249
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,820
of your attacks and wild coyote and what

250
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:47,039
you can do with Ur are things like

251
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:48,600
privilege escalation establishing

252
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,520
persistence and getting code execution

253
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,260
on the system

254
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:54,120
now if you look at this diagram you'll

255
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:55,919
see that the TX and the RX bits are

256
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:58,559
flipped for the hackers Ur device and

257
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:00,480
the iot device uh this is really

258
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,799
important to know because you are

259
00:18:01,799 --> 00:18:03,900
they're inverted so if you wire the TX

260
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:05,640
to the TX or not

261
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:09,440
going to get a proper viewer connection

262
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:13,500
so what types of devices can you find in

263
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,360
your home when you aren't

264
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,980
the obvious one would be a router

265
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:18,900
routers are good contenders if you have

266
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:20,640
some form of security system I've seen a

267
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,320
lot of different interfaces

268
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:25,320
running on your alarm systems but let's

269
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:27,299
get a little crazier off machines I

270
00:18:27,299 --> 00:18:30,480
found you are on a coffee machine which

271
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,340
is kind of cool but I recommend it

272
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:33,840
attacking it if it's your main coffee

273
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,179
machine because if you brick it's almost

274
00:18:36,179 --> 00:18:37,620
not going to be happy in the morning we

275
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:39,600
need caffeine in this industry

276
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,700
and then more fun products like arcade

277
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:42,660
machines

278
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:45,240
you saw my arcade machine previous video

279
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,160
this is the screenshot of that it's just

280
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:50,720
a a three yard pinout

281
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:54,000
so what do we need to understand about

282
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,700
Ur to start going after it well it has

283
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,440
to have your reports but it's a little

284
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,240
more deep enough the New York actually

285
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,100
has to be enabled because if it's

286
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,320
disabled you're gonna have

287
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,539
to another form of attack in order to go

288
00:19:06,539 --> 00:19:09,240
after the surface you need to identify

289
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:11,760
the correct hints because if the pins

290
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:12,600
are correct you're not going to

291
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,640
establish a proper uart connection

292
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,700
and then also the baud rate the baud

293
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:19,860
rate is the speed at which the iot

294
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:23,220
device and you're attacking iot device

295
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:24,539
are going to use to communicate and if

296
00:19:24,539 --> 00:19:25,559
they're not the same speeds then you

297
00:19:25,559 --> 00:19:27,900
don't have a proper Ur connection

298
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,460
I said the beginning always have a

299
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:31,020
backup always have a backup your device

300
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:32,460
because

301
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:34,020
I've had a lot of times where my your

302
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:35,640
devices have failed and I thought that I

303
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,860
was doing it correctly but after quickly

304
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:39,660
using a different Ur adapter

305
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:41,340
the connection worked so having spare

306
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:43,020
tools doesn't help a lot with your

307
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:45,440
engagements

308
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:48,360
so these are some tools I recommend for

309
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:51,260
connecting to viewmark

310
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:53,940
the FDI friends very simple device made

311
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:55,679
by Adafruit

312
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:58,320
and it converts the

313
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,240
and someone from your laptop and

314
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:03,539
connects it to the iot devices your pins

315
00:20:03,539 --> 00:20:05,400
the TBR it's a Kickstarter project and

316
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,480
it's designed to have a lot of the

317
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,340
testing capabilities already built into

318
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:09,720
it how

319
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,700
ever is more expensive and it's newer

320
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:13,380
the market so you won't typically find

321
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:15,240
it on Amazon it might be a it might be

322
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,220
discouraged for a lot of people but I

323
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:20,280
like to recommend equal bone black and

324
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:22,140
Raspberry Pi because these are devices

325
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:23,700
you might already have and you don't

326
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:25,980
have to go out there and buy another iot

327
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:28,440
price the uart can be done through these

328
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:31,320
gpio pins on the side of the boards so

329
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:32,700
it's a very good multi-purpose

330
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:34,740
technology for going after a lot of

331
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:37,640
these iot vehicles

332
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,220
baud rate that's

333
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:42,960
per second you're gonna need to

334
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,700
determine the correct baud rate that's

335
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:46,380
running on the device in order to

336
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:48,059
connect you are I have two of these

337
00:20:48,059 --> 00:20:51,000
bolted the 90s 600 and the one one five

338
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,500
two zero zero and these are bolted

339
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,720
because you're gonna find these most of

340
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:55,799
the time

341
00:20:55,799 --> 00:20:58,140
and well that's nice to have

342
00:20:58,140 --> 00:20:59,880
it might also hurt you in a lot of ways

343
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:03,799
because I guarantee you if you go on uh

344
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:06,419
you're gonna run across either of these

345
00:21:06,419 --> 00:21:07,440
two

346
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,660
and I was hacking a uart device one time

347
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:10,679
it didn't have

348
00:21:10,679 --> 00:21:12,360
spot rate so I went through this table

349
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:15,299
and I tested one body at a time and I

350
00:21:15,299 --> 00:21:17,460
was able to find the correct one

351
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:20,820
so it's really important as pen testers

352
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:22,919
good pen testers they test everything

353
00:21:22,919 --> 00:21:24,240
they go through every check and they

354
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,080
just

355
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:26,700
one by one because if you start making

356
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:27,960
assumptions you could potentially run

357
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,760
into Roblox and

358
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,140
you're not gonna need it very far so

359
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:34,320
being very open-minded is crucial

360
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,240
so I mentioned a multimeter is very

361
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,940
digital half let's examine I can use a

362
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:41,039
Multimeter to identify the pin outs on

363
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:43,220
your

364
00:21:43,559 --> 00:21:46,140
the first good hand attack in Newark is

365
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:47,059
the ground

366
00:21:47,059 --> 00:21:49,799
because when you put your multimeter in

367
00:21:49,799 --> 00:21:51,720
continuity mode it's

368
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:55,260
very easy to identify what's grounded

369
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:57,419
you can identify Parts on the board are

370
00:21:57,419 --> 00:21:59,520
already grounded usually it'll be these

371
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,500
power sheets that are already connected

372
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:02,880
to ground so those are good things

373
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,740
connect one side of them

374
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,299
time here and then the other side of the

375
00:22:06,299 --> 00:22:07,500
multimeter you're gonna go for those

376
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,120
pins one by one trying to fight ground

377
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,039
so that's an easy target

378
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:14,039
the second one should identify is

379
00:22:14,039 --> 00:22:15,659
if you put your multimeter voltage mode

380
00:22:15,659 --> 00:22:17,400
you keep it I'm pointing

381
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:20,460
volts you can compare the pins and

382
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:21,780
what's nice about

383
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:23,940
PCC is the constant value it's not going

384
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:25,500
to fluctuate so if you start seeing a

385
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:27,000
value that's either

386
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,700
3.3 or 5 volts this is most likely your

387
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:33,539
tender for uh constant VCC

388
00:22:33,539 --> 00:22:35,880
so the tip from the RX are going to be

389
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,440
our next targets they're slightly more

390
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,380
trivial than BCC and ground

391
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:42,059
but there are some patterns that we see

392
00:22:42,059 --> 00:22:44,940
when we go through this multimeter

393
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:47,340
with TX should start with TX because

394
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:49,380
it's a little bit easier and how TS

395
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:51,720
works is when you are device starts up

396
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:54,360
it's going to fluctuate in voltage

397
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:56,159
and that's because it's sending debug

398
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:57,299
information

399
00:22:57,299 --> 00:22:59,220
but then it'll eventually reach the same

400
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:01,260
value as BCC so

401
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:02,640
you gotta make sure you're testing this

402
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,140
right when the buy starts up because you

403
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:06,600
might accidentally misidentify BCC and

404
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,880
TX

405
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:10,260
and then RX this is the last time I

406
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:12,000
recommend trying because

407
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,200
it typically has a lower voltage

408
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,100
variance

409
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:16,559
in a lower value than VCC and I like to

410
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:17,520
rely on the other three findings before

411
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:20,580
I go after them actually identify RX

412
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:23,580
it's okay if you swap RX and TX

413
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:25,260
you're not gonna get a UR connection but

414
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:26,880
that's totally okay however

415
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,400
misidentifying ground ABC have

416
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,860
consequential uh consequences on your it

417
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:35,220
cord such as frying it which is fun it's

418
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:37,760
destroyed

419
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:41,240
logic analyzers these are the next

420
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:45,240
step up on a super protocol on your iot

421
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:47,340
device they're a little bit more trivial

422
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:49,020
and it can be a little more expensive

423
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:52,260
I'm included on the top right a Jeep

424
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:55,320
watch analyzer you can find on eBay or

425
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:57,000
Amazon these are good to start out with

426
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,400
because they're only 10 bucks

427
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:01,260
now what electrical engineers and

428
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:02,880
firmware developers use is

429
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:05,280
olate and it's more advanced it has a

430
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:06,780
lot more advanced feature

431
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:08,820
and it's really nice too if you don't

432
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:11,039
mind paying I think it's around 600

433
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:13,200
dollars which can be current for a lot

434
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,179
of entry-level iot developers but it's a

435
00:24:15,179 --> 00:24:16,320
nice capability

436
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:19,260
please display ER it can Depot your spy

437
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:21,120
all these Advanced interfaces

438
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,860
so it does a lot of the automated work

439
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:25,219
for you

440
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:30,659
so I've talked a lot about your but left

441
00:24:30,659 --> 00:24:31,799
your hands dirty and we're nursing how

442
00:24:31,799 --> 00:24:34,440
to set this up so on the left you're

443
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,419
gonna need a laptop that has USB ports

444
00:24:36,419 --> 00:24:38,580
and we're going to connect our laptop to

445
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:39,720
our

446
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,880
King device an image I've included a

447
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:44,720
ftdi friend because this is

448
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:47,580
really middle school and then we're

449
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:49,520
gonna

450
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:52,440
to our Target iot device that has our

451
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:55,740
orders and remember to flip the RX and

452
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:58,220
the teams

453
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,080
the commander gonna need

454
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:04,559
for connecting to a UR show is screen

455
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:06,600
this is the command for launching the

456
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:07,980
serial Network

457
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:10,740
which converts USB into your serial data

458
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:14,340
it needs to run it and privileges the

459
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:15,720
slash Dev slash

460
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,760
Ty you'll be zero familiar with Linux

461
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,400
this is just going to be the USB device

462
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,080
you have connected to the serial port

463
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,700
and then the last parameters

464
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:25,559
is going to be battery we've identified

465
00:25:25,559 --> 00:25:29,240
the pottery to be one one five two zero

466
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,340
so this is my hack lab and this is what

467
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:34,799
it looks like at the end when we have

468
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:37,620
our router which has Ur ports and it's

469
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:39,960
connected to our device

470
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,700
you can see here that

471
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:43,860
no the right side the yellow and blue

472
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:46,140
wires we have our inverted TX and art

473
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:49,140
that's and on the left we see a bunch of

474
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:51,299
ASCII data

475
00:25:51,299 --> 00:25:52,919
which is really good to see when you're

476
00:25:52,919 --> 00:25:54,059
trying to connect New York because if

477
00:25:54,059 --> 00:25:54,960
you do it

478
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,360
wrong Marcy's garbage not nasty readable

479
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,580
text

480
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:01,620
and after that

481
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:03,539
it's pretty much good in this case I

482
00:26:03,539 --> 00:26:05,760
identified that the router

483
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,260
was running

484
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:09,779
a York shell as a root user

485
00:26:09,779 --> 00:26:11,520
so privilege escalation wasn't even

486
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,440
needed but as

487
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,000
soon as I moved up the device I got a

488
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,679
root shell and I could interact with the

489
00:26:16,679 --> 00:26:21,620
device and however which way I want it

490
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:24,240
so the vulnerability we identified in

491
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,159
this iot advice is that

492
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:28,559
that you are has no access control

493
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:30,000
and it's running with elevated

494
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,200
privileges as a root user

495
00:26:33,779 --> 00:26:36,120
let's understand another crucial inner

496
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:38,580
face also known as JTAG I think this is

497
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:40,980
important too when you work on iot

498
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:42,059
products

499
00:26:42,059 --> 00:26:43,200
so what

500
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:46,679
JTAG is is it stands for the job test

501
00:26:46,679 --> 00:26:48,720
Action Group and this was a protocol

502
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:49,980
design

503
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:52,559
into standardized how silicon was

504
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:55,260
debugged on a chip it's more low level

505
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:56,400
than you are

506
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:59,460
and if it's designed to test crucial

507
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:00,900
parts of Hardware you'll see this used

508
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:04,020
on Manufacturing facilities in iot

509
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:06,120
Plants because the engineers are using

510
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,860
this to test the

511
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:09,240
legitimacy of

512
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:10,860
their products

513
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:12,240
the connector pins are essential they

514
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,400
all start with T which stands for test

515
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,400
and you're going to need to identify

516
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,659
these pin outs in order to properly

517
00:27:18,659 --> 00:27:20,340
connect to your

518
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:21,659
you are

519
00:27:21,659 --> 00:27:25,740
G Tigers gtag is similar to you more but

520
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:27,360
it's more focused on firmware extraction

521
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:30,179
attacks because you can pull from data

522
00:27:30,179 --> 00:27:32,240
off

523
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:36,000
some tools I recommend for using

524
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,640
connect to JTAG the segger it's really

525
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,799
good for Connect

526
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:42,299
ing to the device and has a lot of

527
00:27:42,299 --> 00:27:44,159
capabilities when you run into you'll

528
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:45,600
probably need

529
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,520
an adapter if the pan out exactly isn't

530
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:50,340
correct but these are easy to find

531
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:51,539
I've talked to some other security

532
00:27:51,539 --> 00:27:53,340
researchers and

533
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:56,159
make the rift box in the HD attack I

534
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:58,760
haven't used them

535
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:02,760
you've probably heard of it

536
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:05,039
a very known tool and it's very good for

537
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:06,600
identifying that

538
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,460
announce on JTAG because you're going to

539
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:10,679
run into a lot more house than just

540
00:28:10,679 --> 00:28:14,179
three like solid uart so a jtagulator

541
00:28:14,179 --> 00:28:16,440
will help speed up your process and it

542
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:18,480
was made by a researcher named Joe Grant

543
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,100
he's really well known Hardware hacking

544
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:21,659
community so his product's really good

545
00:28:21,659 --> 00:28:22,799
and I highly recommend it if you want to

546
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:25,400
get your hand on it

547
00:28:27,179 --> 00:28:28,919
s Square t is really important to know

548
00:28:28,919 --> 00:28:31,679
is the first protocol you learn if

549
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:32,820
you're in University class or you're

550
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:34,380
starting out electrical engineering it's

551
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:35,279
very

552
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:37,320
simple because it only has two wires the

553
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:40,879
cereal box line and the drill data line

554
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:42,299
you see this a lot with many iot

555
00:28:42,299 --> 00:28:44,820
solutions and it's very

556
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:46,799
slow and that's why maybe you won't see

557
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:48,419
it as much as spy which we'll go into

558
00:28:48,419 --> 00:28:50,640
next but it's important to have

559
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,980
an understanding of I Square C because

560
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:56,299
you might run into it at some point

561
00:28:58,260 --> 00:29:00,059
so let's look into spy this is the

562
00:29:00,059 --> 00:29:02,220
protocol that will help with

563
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:04,919
extraction attacks

564
00:29:04,919 --> 00:29:06,419
so why should we care about firmware

565
00:29:06,419 --> 00:29:07,799
extraction

566
00:29:07,799 --> 00:29:09,720
well first interesting story that

567
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,820
happened in late September of last year

568
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:13,260
and

569
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:15,000
a security researcher was buying voting

570
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,100
machines off of

571
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:18,179
eBay

572
00:29:18,179 --> 00:29:20,640
and while the first 100 or so he bought

573
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,679
were okay there was concerns

574
00:29:22,679 --> 00:29:24,899
on this one because there was a question

575
00:29:24,899 --> 00:29:26,820
of how the voting machine was acquired

576
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:28,919
on eBay there were speculation

577
00:29:28,919 --> 00:29:30,960
that this was an actual voting machine

578
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,159
that wasn't

579
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:33,899
decommissioned and still had to save

580
00:29:33,899 --> 00:29:36,899
information on it so

581
00:29:36,899 --> 00:29:39,120
big threat for organizations is they

582
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:41,700
don't intend for their proprietary

583
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:42,960
source code to be released in the wild

584
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,419
and one of the ways that we can get

585
00:29:45,419 --> 00:29:47,640
access to this is through performing

586
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:48,720
firmware

587
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,460
extraction attacks on the physical

588
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:53,240
device itself

589
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:58,320
so understanding more about Psy

590
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,240
it stands for the serial peripheral

591
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,279
interface and it's essentially it's a

592
00:30:02,279 --> 00:30:04,020
protocol that allows

593
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:06,840
one device to talk to another

594
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:09,240
so what we see with firmware is that

595
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:11,520
we'll have firmware stored on a

596
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,919
component of the device and this

597
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:15,960
component we'll talk to other components

598
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:18,899
on the device using spot now what

599
00:30:18,899 --> 00:30:20,940
attacker can do is they can go after the

600
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:22,320
component that has the firmware stored

601
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,820
on it and use their own device to talk

602
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:27,240
over spy so unlike I squared C you need

603
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:29,159
four wires instead of two to talk to

604
00:30:29,159 --> 00:30:31,080
spike you need to

605
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:33,659
clock signal SCLC uh most C Master

606
00:30:33,659 --> 00:30:35,600
Outlet

607
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,700
and CS is the just select any spy can

608
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:39,419
talk

609
00:30:39,419 --> 00:30:41,580
multiple devices so specifying which

610
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:42,600
device

611
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:45,480
you can talk to is important

612
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:47,640
I left this optional as two wires for

613
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:49,559
voltage and ground again do you want to

614
00:30:49,559 --> 00:30:50,880
power the individual

615
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,500
component of the device that has the

616
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:54,600
firmware or do you want to power on the

617
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,399
whole device and wait for it to connect

618
00:30:56,399 --> 00:30:59,179
the chip holding

619
00:30:59,179 --> 00:31:01,679
forks I I like to go after the

620
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:04,020
individual pin itself unlike

621
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:05,640
you are like to power on the whole board

622
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:08,899
I've had a lot more success in this

623
00:31:09,179 --> 00:31:11,460
knowing a little bit about

624
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:12,720
you don't have to be an electrical

625
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,520
engineer no ins and outs to spy just

626
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:15,539
being

627
00:31:15,539 --> 00:31:16,919
able to know how it works what the clock

628
00:31:16,919 --> 00:31:20,100
signals look like and which pin to

629
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:22,020
to identify is going to help you with

630
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:23,820
these type of attacks

631
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:25,860
and they don't just have firmware sword

632
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:27,260
on them we've seen

633
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:31,500
passwords hard-coded on flash chips file

634
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:33,299
systems secret Keys it's not just

635
00:31:33,299 --> 00:31:34,440
firmware

636
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:35,880
there's a lot of information that can be

637
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:39,200
found on these types of devices

638
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:45,120
so you need to have a better

639
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,880
understanding of how to identify flash

640
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:50,039
memory because it might be more trivial

641
00:31:50,039 --> 00:31:51,419
in some cases

642
00:31:51,419 --> 00:31:52,799
today we're gonna

643
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:55,140
Focus mostly on Nord because it's on in

644
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:57,059
a lot of smaller iot devices

645
00:31:57,059 --> 00:31:59,159
and it's a lower cost and complexity if

646
00:31:59,159 --> 00:32:01,740
you look on the right side of the emmc

647
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:03,000
it's

648
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,919
surface mounted it's higher costing

649
00:32:04,919 --> 00:32:06,480
capacity you'll

650
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,919
see these and things like Automotive

651
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:09,720
Vehicles mobile devices and it's just

652
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:11,100
more trivial because

653
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:13,380
you can't exactly attach it to the

654
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:14,760
external pins you're gonna have to

655
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,320
interface with the surface mounted

656
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,539
material so it works Simply Better

657
00:32:18,539 --> 00:32:21,860
beginners and easy to go after

658
00:32:24,179 --> 00:32:26,640
so for information gathering and Recon

659
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,919
when it comes to spy we need to identify

660
00:32:28,919 --> 00:32:31,679
the chip that has the firmware on the

661
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:33,000
device

662
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,919
so going through the device I've

663
00:32:34,919 --> 00:32:37,860
identified identified this chip this is

664
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:39,539
Win Bond and then serial number after it

665
00:32:39,539 --> 00:32:41,880
so we can Google it

666
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:44,100
and find the data sheet for it and be

667
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:46,140
found very quickly that this data sheet

668
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:48,120
support spy and it has

669
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:51,179
all the same panels as we originally saw

670
00:32:51,179 --> 00:32:54,360
when I was explaining spy but

671
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:55,860
you need to realize too the serial

672
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:56,820
number is not always going to be there

673
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:59,299
ever in any cases where

674
00:32:59,299 --> 00:33:02,820
uh the client they filed the serial

675
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:04,200
number off

676
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:06,000
so I was like that sucks that sucks for

677
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,279
me but it wasn't a deal breaker because

678
00:33:08,279 --> 00:33:10,140
rely on all these other techniques I was

679
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:12,179
able to go back and reverse engineer

680
00:33:12,179 --> 00:33:13,740
opponent and identify which ones were

681
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:15,419
used to spy so all they really did was

682
00:33:15,419 --> 00:33:16,799
slow me down I was illegal to accomplish

683
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:19,340
Michael's

684
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:25,080
understanding how the payoff work on

685
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:27,179
your flash is really important

686
00:33:27,179 --> 00:33:29,580
because like you are if you mislabel or

687
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:30,720
misidentified you're not gonna have a

688
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:33,200
proper connection so

689
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,640
you can see this little dark circle in

690
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:36,600
the top

691
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:39,120
left corner these are on the chips

692
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,919
because they told you which the first

693
00:33:40,919 --> 00:33:42,480
pin is so

694
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,159
oh on the left you'll see a little and

695
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:45,840
great pole that's the indication that it

696
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,159
winds with us

697
00:33:47,159 --> 00:33:49,320
Circle hole on the data

698
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:52,500
and just going through these I was very

699
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:54,659
able to quickly identify what the pins

700
00:33:54,659 --> 00:33:55,679
were

701
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:58,320
you need to realize too that

702
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,399
we're working with a lot of different

703
00:33:59,399 --> 00:34:01,799
countries to manufacturers technology

704
00:34:01,799 --> 00:34:03,000
so you're gonna see a lot of different

705
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,539
terminologies when it comes to spy and

706
00:34:05,539 --> 00:34:08,280
that's the word but through more

707
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,780
experience to learn about patterns and

708
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:14,599
this is as much difficulties I might see

709
00:34:16,199 --> 00:34:17,760
let's look into some tooling that we can

710
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:18,659
use

711
00:34:18,659 --> 00:34:21,659
form firmware extraction so if you start

712
00:34:21,659 --> 00:34:22,679
going through try to find the best

713
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:25,139
device for firmware instruction you're

714
00:34:25,139 --> 00:34:26,520
probably running to advice called the

715
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:29,159
bus pirate this is a lot older of a tool

716
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:32,159
and it's most well known it's fairly

717
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:34,320
cheap you can get it for about 30 or 40

718
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:36,418
bucks on Amazon

719
00:34:36,418 --> 00:34:38,040
and it's really good tool to get started

720
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:39,780
however you should know it's fairly slow

721
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:41,639
and it might take a while when you start

722
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:43,560
performing these dumps because it's an

723
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:45,719
older tool it doesn't run at this high

724
00:34:45,719 --> 00:34:47,099
of a speed so that's something you need

725
00:34:47,099 --> 00:34:48,239
to account for in your firmware

726
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:50,399
attraction attacks

727
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:52,679
likewise Raspberry Pi if you already got

728
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:55,918
it you can use this as well again

729
00:34:55,918 --> 00:34:58,980
GPU gpio ports on the right side of a

730
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:00,839
Raspberry Pi they can be used to

731
00:35:00,839 --> 00:35:03,599
interact not only via uart but spy

732
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:05,280
a lot of other protocols so this is

733
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:07,020
where we can start to eat the raspberry

734
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:10,020
I do a lot of damage space

735
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:11,880
The Next Step Up

736
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:13,200
and what I'm getting more playing with

737
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,460
are these devices called device

738
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:16,859
programmers and

739
00:35:16,859 --> 00:35:19,560
we can actually remove the flash memory

740
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:22,619
off of an iot board and connect it to

741
00:35:22,619 --> 00:35:24,900
a device programmer this is more useful

742
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:27,119
because this is what Engineers Who

743
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:30,180
develops iot Solutions are using and

744
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:32,040
we'll have a lot more success trying to

745
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:33,660
jump firmware this way but it is a more

746
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:34,740
high level tool and it's more

747
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:36,119
sophisticated

748
00:35:36,119 --> 00:35:38,520
so you really need to assess what your

749
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:39,480
goals are and what you're trying to

750
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:40,859
accomplish if you want

751
00:35:40,859 --> 00:35:43,339
this device

752
00:35:44,099 --> 00:35:47,280
so let's look up our setup for how

753
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:49,680
comes from a distraction we're going to

754
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:52,260
use the tool called Flash from that can

755
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:54,240
allow the device interact over spy and

756
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,800
down firmware

757
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,420
and we're going to need to connect all

758
00:35:57,420 --> 00:35:59,579
the critical components of the chip to

759
00:35:59,579 --> 00:36:01,380
our bus pirate

760
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:03,599
or other homework instructions we don't

761
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:06,960
need to invert any wires every wire that

762
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:09,359
it is is going to connect with its twin

763
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:11,160
on other device so see so mostly miso

764
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:12,240
clock

765
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:13,500
they're all kind of connected to us

766
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:17,099
retrospective oh

767
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:22,079
and this is a photo of myself

768
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:24,540
you'd see here that I've just used a bus

769
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:26,160
pirate and

770
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:27,720
we're using the same device that I put

771
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:30,599
it to you art and we performed firmware

772
00:36:30,599 --> 00:36:32,760
instruction using this using the

773
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:36,800
identify pinouts on the flashlight

774
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:41,040
so flash ROM is really interesting

775
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:44,520
because it has a list of gnome chips

776
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:47,339
that it can be used to identify firmware

777
00:36:47,339 --> 00:36:51,060
so I specified to use the bus pirate and

778
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:54,060
the respective USB interface

779
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:56,940
and I had Flash run and it was quickly

780
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:58,859
able to identify the chip I was going

781
00:36:58,859 --> 00:37:00,480
after

782
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,579
and platform doesn't identify the chip

783
00:37:02,579 --> 00:37:04,200
which does happen a lot of times it's

784
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:05,460
happened for me at least one out of

785
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:06,900
every two it's a really hard tool to

786
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:07,859
work with

787
00:37:07,859 --> 00:37:10,440
so if you're not able to identify it

788
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:12,540
properly I recommend having a separate

789
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:13,980
uh

790
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:15,599
for more extraction device because your

791
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:18,780
device could be broken or there might be

792
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:20,339
bad wire so having all these different

793
00:37:20,339 --> 00:37:21,960
backup devices is going to help speed up

794
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:23,520
the process

795
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,140
so we've successfully identified the

796
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:25,980
chip

797
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:29,160
which is good now let's specify

798
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:30,839
where we want to

799
00:37:30,839 --> 00:37:32,280
make the firmware too so we can use the

800
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,960
stop our parameter and we can dump it

801
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:36,119
firmware

802
00:37:36,119 --> 00:37:38,760
so it just took about probably three or

803
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:40,200
four minutes on

804
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:41,880
pirate we're using something else it

805
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,619
might be fairly quick so I just went I

806
00:37:43,619 --> 00:37:45,180
got a cup of coffee and came back and it

807
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:47,419
was done

808
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:52,700
it's a great tool for understanding

809
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:55,380
firmware extraction because when you

810
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:56,339
don't

811
00:37:56,339 --> 00:37:58,200
firmware file it's usually a similar

812
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:00,480
file and away from where it works kind

813
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:03,000
of like a puzzle or Legos where

814
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,800
these things put together into a lot of

815
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,780
piece so in walk

816
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:08,760
it's a school that has a database of

817
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:10,320
known file signatures

818
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:11,880
and it can go through firmware and

819
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:14,040
identify important files that'll help

820
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:16,440
you with your firmware extraction

821
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:17,820
engagements

822
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:20,420
what happens if Ben walk isn't able to

823
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:23,099
identify file signature or reversing

824
00:38:23,099 --> 00:38:24,839
some obscure file format that can

825
00:38:24,839 --> 00:38:27,420
identify this is where static and

826
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:28,680
dynamic and also come in you're gonna

827
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:30,540
have to up your reverse engineering

828
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:32,640
skills tools like either Pro key draw

829
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:35,280
some dynamic tools as well you're gonna

830
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,960
have to rely on these for a reverse

831
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,700
engineering the firmware file formats

832
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:40,320
but I'd say for the most of the time if

833
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,579
you're working with more

834
00:38:41,579 --> 00:38:43,560
common formats and do a good job at

835
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:45,900
identifying which trying to go after

836
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:48,440
a different way

837
00:38:50,339 --> 00:38:52,079
we can see here that I've run they walk

838
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:54,420
on our firmware

839
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:57,240
and signing a bunch of it's on a string

840
00:38:57,240 --> 00:39:01,320
some copyright some HTML profiles u-boot

841
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:02,599
which is

842
00:39:02,599 --> 00:39:05,400
and very bottom we found a file system

843
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:08,720
this is very interesting

844
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:13,740
and just another look at what we

845
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:15,060
extracted

846
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:16,320
you can go by the you can draw options

847
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:18,900
one by one to see what we're going to

848
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:20,640
interact with after we've extracted

849
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,320
firmware

850
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:23,520
so

851
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:25,320
squash FS root this is the file system I

852
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:27,060
was referring to

853
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:28,740
uh found some interesting files in here

854
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:30,240
anyone know what this is has you ever

855
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:31,200
seen this

856
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:34,440
structure before it's a Linux faster so

857
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:35,700
this is interesting

858
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:36,780
because

859
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:38,160
if you're familiar Flex you can start to

860
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,300
go after

861
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:41,040
or the high-risk areas of this file

862
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:43,140
system can we extract any sensitive

863
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:45,379
information

864
00:39:46,859 --> 00:39:49,260
so right off the bat I found password

865
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:51,119
and Shadow file

866
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:52,859
if you're familiar with how

867
00:39:52,859 --> 00:39:54,839
hash cracking works if you have the

868
00:39:54,839 --> 00:39:58,140
password and Shadow you can use this to

869
00:39:58,140 --> 00:40:00,300
run it against known hashes to

870
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:03,000
potentially crack a password what's nice

871
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,859
about firmware extraction is when you've

872
00:40:04,859 --> 00:40:06,420
extracted the firmware there's no access

873
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:08,400
control anymore because you have it all

874
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,380
so files that you would see on your

875
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:11,700
operating system you know they be

876
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:13,020
protected if you don't have root

877
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:14,940
permissions but now that we've performed

878
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:16,260
firmware extraction

879
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:19,280
we have access to everything

880
00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:23,220
privilege escalation is also very

881
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:25,260
important when it comes to

882
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:27,780
firmware and other iot were called apps

883
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:29,520
because how do we better Elevate

884
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:30,839
privileges

885
00:40:30,839 --> 00:40:33,900
and get access to more information

886
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:36,119
the way we just described gaining access

887
00:40:36,119 --> 00:40:38,820
to credentials that's like a root use

888
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:40,920
dessert can come in handy because then

889
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:42,300
you can just authenticate as them you

890
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:44,280
don't need to roll out any exploits but

891
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:46,440
exploitation is also another

892
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:48,540
great way to gain privilege escalation

893
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:52,579
whether it's through the files Suite

894
00:40:52,579 --> 00:40:54,960
variables you can also do kernel

895
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,160
exploits these are more high level

896
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:57,540
sophisticated types of vulnerabilities

897
00:40:57,540 --> 00:40:59,099
but they're all gonna

898
00:40:59,099 --> 00:41:00,720
help you when you try to get higher

899
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:03,439
access on the system

900
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:08,339
supply chain security is also another

901
00:41:08,339 --> 00:41:09,780
issue that comes into play when we're

902
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:11,940
working with these iot devices because

903
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:14,400
how do we prove our iot devices haven't

904
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,260
been compromised a lot of them are made

905
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:17,579
overseas and they go through a lot of

906
00:41:17,579 --> 00:41:19,619
different processes

907
00:41:19,619 --> 00:41:21,960
that device I bought has been optimized

908
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:23,940
or assignmented with any

909
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:26,400
malicious software with the dod and

910
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,540
other organizations we're starting to

911
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:30,300
see software built materials s-bombs

912
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:31,680
which are essentially these lists of

913
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:34,260
components that are being used in your

914
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:36,240
product

915
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:38,099
Hardware Integrity checking so does it

916
00:41:38,099 --> 00:41:40,220
validate the firmware on put up time

917
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:42,300
does it protect against any

918
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:44,760
modifications to the firmware and

919
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:47,940
another important way is to have regular

920
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:49,740
security testing through your pen

921
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:51,480
testing or security architecture reviews

922
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:52,980
and engagements are going to help you

923
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:56,579
better alleviate this risk for this

924
00:41:56,579 --> 00:41:58,320
device however it did not have any type

925
00:41:58,320 --> 00:41:59,099
of

926
00:41:59,099 --> 00:42:01,560
firmware protection so there's a tool up

927
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:03,540
there it's the firmware mod kit it's

928
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:05,400
like

929
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:07,619
valid links too but we can modify the

930
00:42:07,619 --> 00:42:09,000
firmware that we dumped through flash

931
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,400
ROM make modifications to it and then

932
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:14,640
upload the firmware back to device so

933
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:17,359
what I did here is

934
00:42:17,359 --> 00:42:20,700
the system of the router

935
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:23,700
laundry

936
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:26,160
37.

937
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:30,119
and I had access to the root level use

938
00:42:30,119 --> 00:42:31,800
so these are really important things to

939
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:34,920
consider region when you use an iot

940
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:37,140
product

941
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:38,040
so

942
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:39,720
just encrypt the firmware you'll be safe

943
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:40,440
right

944
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:42,180
well

945
00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:44,160
that's not exactly the case because even

946
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:45,780
with systems

947
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:48,480
to have firmware researchers and hackers

948
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:51,119
are still finding ways to bypass this

949
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:53,220
uh interesting wait and I saw one

950
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:55,200
Timeless hacking system is the firmware

951
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:57,720
was encrypted but there was this

952
00:42:57,720 --> 00:42:59,819
decryption binary on the system so I was

953
00:42:59,819 --> 00:43:01,280
able to use that description binary

954
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:03,780
creating other sensitive information so

955
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:04,980
it kind of led me to the point okay

956
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:05,760
what's

957
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:07,020
the point of encrypting if I could just

958
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:08,160
do this

959
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:10,859
over there updates are really common iot

960
00:43:10,859 --> 00:43:12,420
because it's low wave

961
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:14,339
employee updates the firmware and it'll

962
00:43:14,339 --> 00:43:17,280
be encrypted over the air but maybe not

963
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:19,619
physical device the flash memory so

964
00:43:19,619 --> 00:43:21,780
physical attacks so

965
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:23,520
important consider if we can access

966
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:25,260
another interface like gtag or you are

967
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:27,540
this might help us with accessing

968
00:43:27,540 --> 00:43:29,880
encrypted information and then

969
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:31,800
another one is if they don't properly

970
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:33,060
store the keys

971
00:43:33,060 --> 00:43:34,920
and proper way that you can gain access

972
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:36,660
to any crushing keys and use

973
00:43:36,660 --> 00:43:40,160
these two decrypt from work

974
00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:42,000
so the vulnerability with this iot

975
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,160
device is they're designed from where it

976
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:45,060
wasn't about

977
00:43:45,060 --> 00:43:46,619
outdated and I was able to make

978
00:43:46,619 --> 00:43:49,640
modifications to it

979
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:56,579
USB is awesome also known as the serial

980
00:43:56,579 --> 00:43:58,500
Universal serial boss and this is

981
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:00,599
actually a really good inner fees for

982
00:44:00,599 --> 00:44:02,040
iot systems and even necessarily expect

983
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:03,900
it right because

984
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:06,359
you think of an ice or USB devices or

985
00:44:06,359 --> 00:44:08,160
something you plug into a computer but

986
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:10,859
these are great entry points into

987
00:44:10,859 --> 00:44:12,480
the devices

988
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:14,520
ahead or human interaction

989
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:17,040
device it can be used to interact with

990
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:19,800
an iot system and trick it into thinking

991
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:21,839
that it's receiving

992
00:44:21,839 --> 00:44:24,839
legitimate USB and mouse keystrokes you

993
00:44:24,839 --> 00:44:26,400
can use this to interact with it

994
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:28,140
electrical

995
00:44:28,140 --> 00:44:30,240
fault injection attack so being able to

996
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:31,920
eject electrical faults into a system

997
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:33,599
and get it today

998
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:35,700
behave unintended ways

999
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:37,859
kiosk escapes we see this a lot with ATM

1000
00:44:37,859 --> 00:44:40,020
systems but being able to use hit

1001
00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:42,480
devices to

1002
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:43,859
send malicious commands and escape the

1003
00:44:43,859 --> 00:44:45,300
kiosk

1004
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:47,339
and the last one is USB man in the

1005
00:44:47,339 --> 00:44:49,619
middle uh being able to sniff USB

1006
00:44:49,619 --> 00:44:52,319
traffic is really important especially

1007
00:44:52,319 --> 00:44:54,300
for these bigger systems we see because

1008
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:56,339
you just insert device inside of it and

1009
00:44:56,339 --> 00:44:59,280
it'd be something important information

1010
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:03,680
and like Bank 10 codes or passwords

1011
00:45:04,980 --> 00:45:07,079
so

1012
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:10,319
understand how to go after iot

1013
00:45:10,319 --> 00:45:12,420
USB there's two tools I like they're a

1014
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:13,880
little bit more expensive

1015
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:16,079
but these tools are going to help you

1016
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:17,640
with your USB and the middle type of

1017
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:19,920
attacks in order to sniff track

1018
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:22,680
but we see a lot with USB and larger

1019
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:24,180
embedded systems is that the traffic

1020
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:26,040
isn't encrypted so if you could still

1021
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:28,020
stick one of these devices into a larger

1022
00:45:28,020 --> 00:45:29,400
system you're sniffing playing tracks

1023
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:31,440
traffic and you're able to attract

1024
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:34,520
sensitive information

1025
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:38,579
some devices I recommend for hit attacks

1026
00:45:38,579 --> 00:45:40,560
you all probably heard of a rubber ducky

1027
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:42,720
it's made by five

1028
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:44,880
uses a language called Script which

1029
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:46,260
makes it very easy to write your

1030
00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:48,839
malicious head scripts I prefer a Teensy

1031
00:45:48,839 --> 00:45:49,859
just because

1032
00:45:49,859 --> 00:45:51,359
it's more low level it has more

1033
00:45:51,359 --> 00:45:53,579
capabilities but no matter what you're

1034
00:45:53,579 --> 00:45:55,560
gonna use these can all carry out the

1035
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:57,680
same type of hit attacks

1036
00:45:57,680 --> 00:45:59,339
wheels are great because you probably

1037
00:45:59,339 --> 00:46:00,599
already have one so you don't go out and

1038
00:46:00,599 --> 00:46:02,040
buy another device

1039
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:03,900
uh making do with what you have to make

1040
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:07,040
you a great iot hacker

1041
00:46:07,859 --> 00:46:09,960
so what I did to

1042
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:12,060
demonstrate hit device attacks is I

1043
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:13,920
wrote a blog post on how to

1044
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:16,740
attack chaosystems using hit devices and

1045
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:20,280
what I did was I got all the well-known

1046
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:22,980
kiosk Escape techniques on a Windows

1047
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:25,020
based system and I programmed them all

1048
00:46:25,020 --> 00:46:26,300
into a hid device

1049
00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:30,300
so now when I put in my USB into kiosks

1050
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:33,480
excuse these commands one by one and

1051
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:36,359
potentially try to escape dust and gain

1052
00:46:36,359 --> 00:46:37,920
sensitive access to a system that wasn't

1053
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:40,339
intended

1054
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:43,819
so my script it found the print

1055
00:46:43,819 --> 00:46:46,619
so control p and I was able to get the

1056
00:46:46,619 --> 00:46:48,540
print window

1057
00:46:48,540 --> 00:46:50,579
and navigating through because I have a

1058
00:46:50,579 --> 00:46:52,319
key hit device and

1059
00:46:52,319 --> 00:46:53,579
the system now I'm using awesome

1060
00:46:53,579 --> 00:46:55,500
keyboard I was able to use this fine

1061
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:57,540
printer functionality on the print

1062
00:46:57,540 --> 00:46:59,040
menu

1063
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:02,520
and it opened up a Windows path so I

1064
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:04,140
enter in any

1065
00:47:04,140 --> 00:47:07,500
Google I want I wasn't sure if it works

1066
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:11,040
so I found the cmd.exe binary

1067
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:14,640
and I entered it and I was in the Shell

1068
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:19,578
on the system just through my hid device

1069
00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:24,780
when you're working with iot it's really

1070
00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:26,819
important to understand how responsible

1071
00:47:26,819 --> 00:47:29,099
disclosure works you find some serious

1072
00:47:29,099 --> 00:47:30,980
vulnerability in a medical device

1073
00:47:30,980 --> 00:47:32,880
these companies might not be happy with

1074
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:34,200
you they might think you're a punk or

1075
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:36,240
you're just doing it for clout but there

1076
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:38,160
is a right way to do it

1077
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:40,500
first thing I recommend is don't just

1078
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:42,119
start throwing burp nests and end map

1079
00:47:42,119 --> 00:47:44,460
scans into a fancy looking report

1080
00:47:44,460 --> 00:47:45,900
if you have no understanding of the

1081
00:47:45,900 --> 00:47:47,819
business or the organization for

1082
00:47:47,819 --> 00:47:49,920
organizations understand what they were

1083
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:51,720
gone to understand security so you start

1084
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:53,520
throwing in all these findings

1085
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:55,200
uh they might not make sense of it so

1086
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:56,700
what I like to do

1087
00:47:56,700 --> 00:47:58,800
is not only when I get remote code

1088
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:00,119
execution or some other high-level

1089
00:48:00,119 --> 00:48:01,440
vulnerability

1090
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:03,480
but show how it affects their iot

1091
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:05,160
devices can you interact with a system

1092
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:06,540
can you cause it to shut off for

1093
00:48:06,540 --> 00:48:09,800
internet exactly

1094
00:48:11,060 --> 00:48:14,540
that'll be really important

1095
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:19,680
so I think I see batteries is also

1096
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:21,900
a new research topic that's

1097
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:24,300
gaining traction into the security

1098
00:48:24,300 --> 00:48:25,859
research Community what they're finding

1099
00:48:25,859 --> 00:48:27,359
is you can do

1100
00:48:27,359 --> 00:48:30,180
buzzing over interfaces like uart and

1101
00:48:30,180 --> 00:48:31,440
this is a good way to find unknown

1102
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:32,940
vulnerabilities

1103
00:48:32,940 --> 00:48:35,160
and stuff it's very complicated but

1104
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:36,359
there's a lot of things you can do to

1105
00:48:36,359 --> 00:48:39,900
set up I recommend AFL AFL plus plus is

1106
00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:40,920
the

1107
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:42,720
user reviews and it works well with a

1108
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:43,980
lot of these different firmware that

1109
00:48:43,980 --> 00:48:45,240
have access

1110
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:47,220
to and just creating targets and test

1111
00:48:47,220 --> 00:48:48,839
cases

1112
00:48:48,839 --> 00:48:51,240
environment can help you with going

1113
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:52,380
about this process it's very

1114
00:48:52,380 --> 00:48:53,640
computationally expensive so make sure

1115
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:54,420
you have

1116
00:48:54,420 --> 00:48:56,099
good hardware and I know there's ways to

1117
00:48:56,099 --> 00:48:58,140
set it up using multi-threading multiple

1118
00:48:58,140 --> 00:49:01,319
devices so having a good buzzing inbox

1119
00:49:01,319 --> 00:49:03,540
it's not needed but it is a good

1120
00:49:03,540 --> 00:49:07,279
strategy to employ for working with iot

1121
00:49:07,700 --> 00:49:10,260
so this kind of leads me to the end of

1122
00:49:10,260 --> 00:49:12,599
my talk and just getting more involved

1123
00:49:12,599 --> 00:49:13,560
with

1124
00:49:13,560 --> 00:49:16,140
iot through the security meetups in

1125
00:49:16,140 --> 00:49:17,940
Arizona has been really helpful I've met

1126
00:49:17,940 --> 00:49:20,339
a lot of researchers who have been able

1127
00:49:20,339 --> 00:49:23,700
to give me tips or give you new areas of

1128
00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:26,040
approach to tackle these complex iot

1129
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:27,359
Solutions

1130
00:49:27,359 --> 00:49:29,460
so if you really want to get involved in

1131
00:49:29,460 --> 00:49:31,140
iot highly recommend you take advantage

1132
00:49:31,140 --> 00:49:33,599
of the different security meetups

1133
00:49:33,599 --> 00:49:36,180
in Arizona because we're gonna meet a

1134
00:49:36,180 --> 00:49:37,680
lot of talented security researchers

1135
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:39,119
here and this is how my journey got

1136
00:49:39,119 --> 00:49:41,420
started

1137
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:45,839
so a little bit more about my work I run

1138
00:49:45,839 --> 00:49:48,060
a Blog called Ryan Jones rocks

1139
00:49:48,060 --> 00:49:51,300
I'm on Twitter Ryan Jones rocks like to

1140
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:53,099
keep it consistent and you see me

1141
00:49:53,099 --> 00:49:54,660
tweeting mostly about iot and security

1142
00:49:54,660 --> 00:49:57,599
most of the time and I'm also at a lot

1143
00:49:57,599 --> 00:49:59,220
of security meetups and conferences so

1144
00:49:59,220 --> 00:50:00,660
appreciate

1145
00:50:00,660 --> 00:50:01,740
appreciate seeing you all here today

1146
00:50:01,740 --> 00:50:03,000
it's been a great experience I'm looking

1147
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,079
forward to seeing the rest of y'all

speaker is going to be talking about

1188
00:59:30,540 --> 00:59:33,059
uh presentations entitled it's a bird

it's a plane it's a script abusing

1190
00:59:35,160 --> 00:59:37,559
headers to create Python and bitmap

1191
00:59:37,559 --> 00:59:40,099
polyglots

1192
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:47,460
so much Leah all right welcome everyone

1193
00:59:47,460 --> 00:59:49,020
um as you mentioned

1194
00:59:49,020 --> 00:59:51,720

1195
00:59:51,720 --> 00:59:54,839
today I bring to you it's a bird it's a

1196
00:59:54,839 --> 00:59:58,680
plane it's a script and my adventure in

1197
00:59:58,680 --> 01:00:02,099
playing with uh Python and bitmap and

1198
01:00:02,099 --> 01:00:04,260
just figuring things out as I blog it's

1199
01:00:04,260 --> 01:00:05,880
going to be a bit of a silly

1200
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:07,740
presentation so I apologize but not

1201
01:00:07,740 --> 01:00:08,819

and my radios likes to go off right now

1210
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:31,079
because of course I am that popular

1211
01:00:31,079 --> 01:00:32,400

1212
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:34,140
um so premium

1213
01:00:34,140 --> 01:00:36,359
honestly uh I said all research and

1214
01:00:36,359 --> 01:00:37,920
opinions here are my own don't hold them

1215
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:41,640
against me though because I like to talk

1216
01:00:41,640 --> 01:00:43,079
um previously I was cyber threat until

1217
01:00:43,079 --> 01:00:45,359
at Amazon offensive security fighter

1218
01:00:45,359 --> 01:00:47,160
names you've heard

1219
01:00:47,160 --> 01:00:49,740
Austin's red team with the dod I was a

1220
01:00:49,740 --> 01:00:51,059
good Farm in Texas I have a nuclear

1221
01:00:51,059 --> 01:00:52,500
engineering background and for Halloween

1222
01:00:52,500 --> 01:00:54,660
addresses

1223
01:00:54,660 --> 01:00:56,400
I shake my head and I have no other

1224
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:59,940
Hobbies so um anyway

1225
01:00:59,940 --> 01:01:02,160
you know you're not here to hear me talk

1226
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:04,619
about you know myself even like more

1227
01:01:04,619 --> 01:01:07,380
hours what you're actually here is uh

1228
01:01:07,380 --> 01:01:10,880
fire over here I should talk about

1229
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:12,839
polyglots and to give you a little

1230
01:01:12,839 --> 01:01:14,460
background and scope as to what let me

1231
01:01:14,460 --> 01:01:16,260
down this this path

1232
01:01:16,260 --> 01:01:18,680
um I was dreaming about that

1233
01:01:18,680 --> 01:01:21,960
JavaScript and if you need image tags to

1234
01:01:21,960 --> 01:01:24,660
create these polyglots that would

1235
01:01:24,660 --> 01:01:26,400
be interpreted as images in some cases

1236
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:27,960
whereas JavaScript or another now that's

1237
01:01:27,960 --> 01:01:29,099
doing this

1238
01:01:29,099 --> 01:01:31,079
I was watching the Maury show at the

1239
01:01:31,079 --> 01:01:32,460
same time and I was eating barbecue and

1240
01:01:32,460 --> 01:01:34,500
Spilled barbecue sauce on myself and of

1241
01:01:34,500 --> 01:01:36,180
course

1242
01:01:36,180 --> 01:01:38,299
um

1243
01:01:39,720 --> 01:01:41,160
a polyglot you know for all you

1244
01:01:41,160 --> 01:01:42,960
dictionary nerd out there it's about

1245
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:44,220
computer

1246
01:01:44,220 --> 01:01:46,200
program that is written multiple valid

1247
01:01:46,200 --> 01:01:49,579
computer languages it can be read as

1248
01:01:49,579 --> 01:01:52,500
and there is no other changes done to

1249
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:53,700
the file itself

1250
01:01:53,700 --> 01:01:55,200
um so

1251
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:57,660
eating me full of barbecue I decided to

1252
01:01:57,660 --> 01:02:00,359
make my own I went down that rabbit hole

1253
01:02:00,359 --> 01:02:04,759
okay to kind of scope a little better

1254
01:02:05,460 --> 01:02:08,000
I said

1255
01:02:08,579 --> 01:02:10,020
respect

1256
01:02:10,020 --> 01:02:13,380
and I needed I need to fool the OS or in

1257
01:02:13,380 --> 01:02:15,780
this case the file command in Linux and

1258
01:02:15,780 --> 01:02:16,500
Mac

1259
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:18,720
I didn't want to have any modifications

1260
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:21,119
file I didn't need another a separate

1261
01:02:21,119 --> 01:02:23,339
program to say hey extract all these

1262
01:02:23,339 --> 01:02:25,220
bits and bikes and build a payload

1263
01:02:25,220 --> 01:02:27,480
I wanted to take it bypro as an

1264
01:02:27,480 --> 01:02:28,740
interpreter

1265
01:02:28,740 --> 01:02:30,660
or man life and I say hey run it this

1266
01:02:30,660 --> 01:02:33,359
way get it to a but if they run it that

1267
01:02:33,359 --> 01:02:35,760
way can it do B so I started looking at

1268
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:37,380
it

1269
01:02:37,380 --> 01:02:39,480
because again nothing better to do and

1270
01:02:39,480 --> 01:02:41,220
full of barbecue

1271
01:02:41,220 --> 01:02:44,880
so looking at the files I started to say

1272
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:46,920
well how does a computer Act

1273
01:02:46,920 --> 01:02:48,660
know what kind of file I'm trying to

1274
01:02:48,660 --> 01:02:51,119
open I looked at the file extension

1275
01:02:51,119 --> 01:02:52,799
that doesn't always work as we've all

1276
01:02:52,799 --> 01:02:54,059
known you can smash the file extension

1277
01:02:54,059 --> 01:02:55,559
try to open it past it

1278
01:02:55,559 --> 01:02:56,700
thanks

1279
01:02:56,700 --> 01:02:58,799
but what if there's no extension and

1280
01:02:58,799 --> 01:03:00,480
then I stumbled upon

1281
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:02,339
the magic bites which are the first two

1282
01:03:02,339 --> 01:03:05,819
bytes or so of a file and it's part of

1283
01:03:05,819 --> 01:03:07,380
the header that identifies what kind of

1284
01:03:07,380 --> 01:03:08,280
file

1285
01:03:08,280 --> 01:03:09,900
this

1286
01:03:09,900 --> 01:03:11,579
um I look at some things like JPEG and I

1287
01:03:11,579 --> 01:03:13,020
said that's not gonna work

1288
01:03:13,020 --> 01:03:14,700
but it might I don't know

1289
01:03:14,700 --> 01:03:16,260
um I look at it have some of them have

1290
01:03:16,260 --> 01:03:19,579
Footers that say hey

1291
01:03:22,220 --> 01:03:25,040
and what happened

1292
01:03:25,040 --> 01:03:26,819
I'm gonna

1293
01:03:26,819 --> 01:03:28,859
simple what can I actually do with this

1294
01:03:28,859 --> 01:03:30,900
what about python

1295
01:03:30,900 --> 01:03:31,619
um

1296
01:03:31,619 --> 01:03:33,299
I remember a lot of Python scripts in my

1297
01:03:33,299 --> 01:03:34,079
life

1298
01:03:34,079 --> 01:03:36,299
do they have headers and flutters I

1299
01:03:36,299 --> 01:03:37,319
don't think I've never written one or

1300
01:03:37,319 --> 01:03:39,359
seen one for Python and turns out they

1301
01:03:39,359 --> 01:03:41,700
won't have one and more than a minute

1302
01:03:41,700 --> 01:03:44,339
I'm getting a header of myself

1303
01:03:44,339 --> 01:03:47,280
so um I was decided to see cam muck

1304
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:49,619
about them and kind of confused the

1305
01:03:49,619 --> 01:03:52,440
computer and spoiler yes I could and yes

1306
01:03:52,440 --> 01:03:53,700
I did

1307
01:03:53,700 --> 01:03:56,700
so

1308
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:02,760
it's also

1309
01:04:02,760 --> 01:04:05,280
super old like old holes and it's a

1310
01:04:05,280 --> 01:04:06,720
header that has

1311
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:08,880
this match fight it has a file size it

1312
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:10,200
has an offset

1313
01:04:10,200 --> 01:04:12,420
the images has hey here's the width of

1314
01:04:12,420 --> 01:04:14,099
the height and pixels

1315
01:04:14,099 --> 01:04:16,140
of the grade you're gonna draw on it has

1316
01:04:16,140 --> 01:04:18,299
the image size and it tells you but at

1317
01:04:18,299 --> 01:04:20,880
least it 24-bit it tells you three bytes

1318
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:23,220
per pixel of how you're gonna do it and

1319
01:04:23,220 --> 01:04:27,439
it ignores everything that is

1320
01:04:30,599 --> 01:04:33,720
the bike's done so if you append more

1321
01:04:33,720 --> 01:04:37,140
time it ignores it and it's awesome now

1322
01:04:37,140 --> 01:04:39,359
for all the visual people I open it up

1323
01:04:39,359 --> 01:04:41,700
and Bim and I looked at the header

1324
01:04:41,700 --> 01:04:45,020
because all my homies man and I am

1325
01:04:45,020 --> 01:04:48,119
and as you see from my shirt

1326
01:04:48,119 --> 01:04:49,020
um

1327
01:04:49,020 --> 01:04:52,680
so for the visual people like I said

1328
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:54,420
here's the magic number the file size

1329
01:04:54,420 --> 01:04:57,119
offset with height and everything is

1330
01:04:57,119 --> 01:04:58,140
right there

1331
01:04:58,140 --> 01:05:00,420
and I said well

1332
01:05:00,420 --> 01:05:01,319
um

1333
01:05:01,319 --> 01:05:04,020
let's Channel my inner Rocky 4 Ivan

1334
01:05:04,020 --> 01:05:05,339
Drago

1335
01:05:05,339 --> 01:05:08,280
and I said I must break and I started to

1336
01:05:08,280 --> 01:05:10,500
figure out what are the parts to the

1337
01:05:10,500 --> 01:05:12,480
header that I could muck about and

1338
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:14,460
nothing happened nothing would work and

1339
01:05:14,460 --> 01:05:16,640
so

1340
01:05:16,680 --> 01:05:17,839
what happens about

1341
01:05:17,839 --> 01:05:20,220
I don't want to message the magic

1342
01:05:20,220 --> 01:05:21,960
bites because I will read us a different

1343
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:23,880
file the author tells me where the image

1344
01:05:23,880 --> 01:05:25,319
data is so I just started playing with

1345
01:05:25,319 --> 01:05:26,280
them

1346
01:05:26,280 --> 01:05:28,859
and it turns out as you alter the file

1347
01:05:28,859 --> 01:05:30,299
size it's number two up there in the

1348
01:05:30,299 --> 01:05:32,640
picture bitmap does

1349
01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:36,420
not there because it's so old back in

1350
01:05:36,420 --> 01:05:37,799
the day you cared about the file size it

1351
01:05:37,799 --> 01:05:39,500
had to be included

1352
01:05:39,500 --> 01:05:43,020
nowadays the file system doesn't care if

1353
01:05:43,020 --> 01:05:44,160
you can write whatever you want there

1354
01:05:44,160 --> 01:05:45,720
and it didn't matter

1355
01:05:45,720 --> 01:05:47,760
um but it when it came to the

1356
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:49,799
offset width and height to draw that

1357
01:05:49,799 --> 01:05:52,740
grid it actually turned a lot it yelled

1358
01:05:52,740 --> 01:05:54,780
me quite a lot and now you're thinking

1359
01:05:54,780 --> 01:05:56,819
well cool I just learned a lot about

1360
01:05:56,819 --> 01:05:59,220
bitmap bitmap volt that's the moral of

1361
01:05:59,220 --> 01:06:00,059
that story

1362
01:06:00,059 --> 01:06:03,240
so um like I said meanwhile on Python's

1363
01:06:03,240 --> 01:06:04,579
side

1364
01:06:04,579 --> 01:06:07,020
pythons don't have magic bikes they

1365
01:06:07,020 --> 01:06:08,460
don't use a head or any of that nonsense

1366
01:06:08,460 --> 01:06:11,160
they just quote unquote Max yellowing so

1367
01:06:11,160 --> 01:06:13,079
look at how to write a comment in Python

1368
01:06:13,079 --> 01:06:15,240
turns out if you have a cow sign you can

1369
01:06:15,240 --> 01:06:16,619
write somebody

1370
01:06:16,619 --> 01:06:19,140
and as long as you have that uh zero d08

1371
01:06:19,140 --> 01:06:20,940
that character in a new line

1372
01:06:20,940 --> 01:06:22,260
everything

1373
01:06:22,260 --> 01:06:25,079
in between those three bites is a

1374
01:06:25,079 --> 01:06:26,640
comment and the best part and this is

1375
01:06:26,640 --> 01:06:27,539
where

1376
01:06:27,539 --> 01:06:29,760
python really shines is that you can

1377
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:33,799
clear a variable just in here

1378
01:06:34,940 --> 01:06:37,319
here's my variable

1379
01:06:37,319 --> 01:06:40,619
opposite for iPhone figures out it's an

1380
01:06:40,619 --> 01:06:44,839
hint unless you say other ones so

1381
01:06:45,780 --> 01:06:47,280
the file side and the header doesn't

1382
01:06:47,280 --> 01:06:48,660
matter and you don't need that you have

1383
01:06:48,660 --> 01:06:49,799
a bitmap file

1384
01:06:49,799 --> 01:06:52,740
let's first create a bit now so I went

1385
01:06:52,740 --> 01:06:54,599
to Microsoft PayPal

1386
01:06:54,599 --> 01:06:58,440
friend that said hey give me a one point

1387
01:06:58,440 --> 01:07:01,220
two pixels

1388
01:07:03,500 --> 01:07:07,039
isn't that a little small

1389
01:07:08,280 --> 01:07:09,780
um

1390
01:07:09,780 --> 01:07:12,180
so I say hey Ashley it's all about

1391
01:07:12,180 --> 01:07:14,940
asking why because I didn't want to

1392
01:07:14,940 --> 01:07:17,400
worry about hey am I encoding this

1393
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:19,559
correctly yeah am I doing this correctly

1394
01:07:19,559 --> 01:07:20,940
I was still researching I was still

1395
01:07:20,940 --> 01:07:22,859
going on an adventure and

1396
01:07:22,859 --> 01:07:24,720
I don't know what I mean because it's

1397
01:07:24,720 --> 01:07:26,220
nothing special if we're all asking

1398
01:07:26,220 --> 01:07:28,920
total So based on that

1399
01:07:28,920 --> 01:07:31,200
including my 122 by 122 that's in

1400
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:34,440
decimal that maps to a beat and so I

1401
01:07:34,440 --> 01:07:36,119
said well I need some color we need some

1402
01:07:36,119 --> 01:07:37,740
Vibrance in my life

1403
01:07:37,740 --> 01:07:39,720
so unfortunately green is not a creative

1404
01:07:39,720 --> 01:07:42,180
color but uh bitmap this is three bytes

1405
01:07:42,180 --> 01:07:43,380
per pixel

1406
01:07:43,380 --> 01:07:46,380
because

1407
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:53,520
and then for the second color I said 122

1408
01:07:53,520 --> 01:07:56,039
122 32. you

1409
01:07:56,039 --> 01:08:00,599
because same same and

1410
01:08:01,260 --> 01:08:04,200
then gives me the real art comes comes

1411
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:07,880
through that makes wonderful picture

1412
01:08:07,880 --> 01:08:12,000
and I say it as a 24-bit map which means

1413
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:15,180
free by per pixel those RGB colors and

1414
01:08:15,180 --> 01:08:19,278
on a 122 by pixel grid and

1415
01:08:19,580 --> 01:08:23,719
right so not quite

1416
01:08:23,719 --> 01:08:26,460
uh this is not that scam

1417
01:08:26,460 --> 01:08:29,040
um so I export the file

1418
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:30,600
them and I was able to achieve those

1419
01:08:30,600 --> 01:08:34,259
matches in the header and all those Z's

1420
01:08:34,259 --> 01:08:37,140
for the pixels but I still need more

1421
01:08:37,140 --> 01:08:41,040
because that's not very people and again

1422
01:08:41,040 --> 01:08:42,479
remember my shirt

1423
01:08:42,479 --> 01:08:43,920
um I said

1424
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:46,920
well let's use het to look at it in a

1425
01:08:46,920 --> 01:08:48,540
performance

1426
01:08:48,540 --> 01:08:51,060
and I said ah there's fbm I can see that

1427
01:08:51,060 --> 01:08:52,439
36 actually

1428
01:08:52,439 --> 01:08:53,939
I said I can see the grid I can start

1429
01:08:53,939 --> 01:08:56,160
seeing my data I see all these all the

1430
01:08:56,160 --> 01:08:57,420
colors

1431
01:08:57,420 --> 01:09:00,660
this is awesome so what connected from

1432
01:09:00,660 --> 01:09:01,679
here

1433
01:09:01,679 --> 01:09:03,779
well I decided to use

1434
01:09:03,779 --> 01:09:05,580
the hex header to modify the header and

1435
01:09:05,580 --> 01:09:08,040
say hey let's treat this as Python and

1436
01:09:08,040 --> 01:09:09,299
set that BM

1437
01:09:09,299 --> 01:09:12,238
The Next Bite equals the four not a good

1438
01:09:12,238 --> 01:09:13,738
sign again

1439
01:09:13,738 --> 01:09:15,299
I declared the end of the line with the

1440
01:09:15,299 --> 01:09:17,100
suncoan I started a comic with a pound

1441
01:09:17,100 --> 01:09:19,020
and a pen at the end

1442
01:09:19,020 --> 01:09:21,120
file a character turn in a new line so

1443
01:09:21,120 --> 01:09:24,719
what I basically did was say hey if

1444
01:09:24,719 --> 01:09:26,100
you're reading at this from a python

1445
01:09:26,100 --> 01:09:28,500
perspective I said I have a variable

1446
01:09:28,500 --> 01:09:31,738
number four a setting code and that line

1447
01:09:31,738 --> 01:09:34,319
between the start of a comment and then

1448
01:09:34,319 --> 01:09:35,880
I said the end of the comment is over

1449
01:09:35,880 --> 01:09:37,738
there but if you

1450
01:09:37,738 --> 01:09:39,779
same file from a bit not perspective

1451
01:09:39,779 --> 01:09:42,380
again

1452
01:09:42,799 --> 01:09:44,640
doesn't care

1453
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:46,140
so

1454
01:09:46,140 --> 01:09:48,660
it says okay I'm from getting my

1455
01:09:48,660 --> 01:09:50,100
perspective I have the magic bites to

1456
01:09:50,100 --> 01:09:50,759
tell

1457
01:09:50,759 --> 01:09:53,339
it's a bitmap the file size looks wonky

1458
01:09:53,339 --> 01:09:54,660
but I don't care

1459
01:09:54,660 --> 01:09:56,179
um

1460
01:09:56,179 --> 01:09:58,920
and here's all this image data and for

1461
01:09:58,920 --> 01:10:02,300
some reason there's random numbers

1462
01:10:04,380 --> 01:10:06,320
because

1463
01:10:06,320 --> 01:10:09,179
Aaron chat and about the file size it

1464
01:10:09,179 --> 01:10:10,199
doesn't

1465
01:10:10,199 --> 01:10:12,780
matter what the file size is any data

1466
01:10:12,780 --> 01:10:13,880
outside

1467
01:10:13,880 --> 01:10:17,100
offset and that grid generator it

1468
01:10:17,100 --> 01:10:20,159
doesn't matter and that my friends where

1469
01:10:20,159 --> 01:10:24,420
the fun begins because I took in them

1470
01:10:24,420 --> 01:10:27,060
that cactuscon 11 modified the header

1471
01:10:27,060 --> 01:10:29,100
and then append it a new line and a

1472
01:10:29,100 --> 01:10:30,719
carriage return at the end

1473
01:10:30,719 --> 01:10:33,719
and said hey I am going to after that

1474
01:10:33,719 --> 01:10:36,000
append a random

1475
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:39,560
python statement in this case

1476
01:10:40,040 --> 01:10:43,020
or an image and let's hope I prayed

1477
01:10:43,020 --> 01:10:45,179
enough to the uh

1478
01:10:45,179 --> 01:10:48,540
to the uh Democrats because if I say hey

1479
01:10:48,540 --> 01:10:51,140
file

1480
01:10:51,480 --> 01:10:54,900
what is it it's a it's a pc bitmap

1481
01:10:54,900 --> 01:10:59,100
windows 3x format 122 A 122 24.

1482
01:10:59,100 --> 01:11:02,100
foreign

1483
01:11:19,140 --> 01:11:23,060
what happens if I do python three

1484
01:11:23,179 --> 01:11:25,140
block Dot

1485
01:11:25,140 --> 01:11:27,120
because

1486
01:11:27,120 --> 01:11:31,140
file or minor so the same file no one

1487
01:11:31,140 --> 01:11:33,420
to respond to it python was able to

1488
01:11:33,420 --> 01:11:36,239
interpret it but it fooled the offerings

1489
01:11:36,239 --> 01:11:39,719
to treat as an image and then to quote

1490
01:11:39,719 --> 01:11:42,120
the Fantastic Billy maze

1491
01:11:42,120 --> 01:11:44,460
there's more because I thought well what

1492
01:11:44,460 --> 01:11:48,060
can I do with this and I said well

1493
01:11:48,060 --> 01:11:50,520
um let's start our own NetApp listener

1494
01:11:50,520 --> 01:11:54,540
important 9001 because it's over 9 000.

1495
01:11:54,540 --> 01:11:59,820
and so I say well let's see can I open

1496
01:11:59,820 --> 01:12:01,080
I've been a lot easier if I had the

1497
01:12:01,080 --> 01:12:03,239
other microphone but it's okay it's gone

1498
01:12:03,239 --> 01:12:04,580
uh

1499
01:12:04,580 --> 01:12:06,780
shell dot bitmap that's what I called it

1500
01:12:06,780 --> 01:12:09,179
and I said

1501
01:12:09,179 --> 01:12:11,040
image

1502
01:12:11,040 --> 01:12:14,659
all right well um

1503
01:12:17,360 --> 01:12:22,199
watch so again it says it's a 122 by 122

1504
01:12:22,199 --> 01:12:24,480
by 24.

1505
01:12:24,480 --> 01:12:27,960
um well what does Python 3

1506
01:12:27,960 --> 01:12:30,980
say about this

1507
01:12:33,719 --> 01:12:35,780
um

1508
01:12:35,880 --> 01:12:38,699
and all right please hit enter and boom

1509
01:12:38,699 --> 01:12:39,900
we got her

1510
01:12:39,900 --> 01:12:42,000
call back meaning I mean it's just a

1511
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:43,620
simple one-liner in Python you're like

1512
01:12:43,620 --> 01:12:44,940
yeah that's like

1513
01:12:44,940 --> 01:12:46,560
they're cute little stuff but that's not

1514
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:48,900
the point here the point here is that I

1515
01:12:48,900 --> 01:12:53,940
just was able to treat a an image as

1516
01:12:53,940 --> 01:12:56,400
a perfectly looking at python script and

1517
01:12:56,400 --> 01:12:57,480
this is

1518
01:12:57,480 --> 01:12:59,820
where it wonders and this is where the

1519
01:12:59,820 --> 01:13:00,900
important

1520
01:13:00,900 --> 01:13:04,140
part comes in it's like wait there's

1521
01:13:04,140 --> 01:13:07,820
more cool you added

1522
01:13:08,699 --> 01:13:12,260
like why why my wife

1523
01:13:12,260 --> 01:13:15,480
I don't know I was bored I was full of

1524
01:13:15,480 --> 01:13:16,920
barbecue

1525
01:13:16,920 --> 01:13:19,980
try things but but I did find and this

1526
01:13:19,980 --> 01:13:22,140
is my current area of research that you

1527
01:13:22,140 --> 01:13:23,640
can basically floor encode the data

1528
01:13:23,640 --> 01:13:25,620
because again

1529
01:13:25,620 --> 01:13:27,360
and really start creating enemies you

1530
01:13:27,360 --> 01:13:29,760
can hide damn it you can

1531
01:13:29,760 --> 01:13:31,860
hide the data within itself almost like

1532
01:13:31,860 --> 01:13:34,440
a steganography within the image itself

1533
01:13:34,440 --> 01:13:37,020
and hide the payload there

1534
01:13:37,020 --> 01:13:38,520
um the python script can then use the

1535
01:13:38,520 --> 01:13:40,679
dropper as a downloader this is just a

1536
01:13:40,679 --> 01:13:44,040
vessel for your imagination and I may or

1537
01:13:44,040 --> 01:13:45,540
may not have done some photos of

1538
01:13:45,540 --> 01:13:48,320
interesting and

1539
01:13:50,540 --> 01:13:53,760
and so

1540
01:13:53,760 --> 01:13:58,380
um what I did find is a lot of um

1541
01:13:58,380 --> 01:14:01,080
a lot of the endpoint detection systems

1542
01:14:01,080 --> 01:14:03,659
we're looking at file extension and uh

1543
01:14:03,659 --> 01:14:05,940
we're looking at Magic bikes live

1544
01:14:05,940 --> 01:14:08,159
it's the it's the lowest hanging fruit

1545
01:14:08,159 --> 01:14:09,780
We're Not Gonna spend a lot of time

1546
01:14:09,780 --> 01:14:12,300
so we're able to buy a strap and I am

1547
01:14:12,300 --> 01:14:14,960
able to have

1548
01:14:15,020 --> 01:14:18,300
in Python that is

1549
01:14:18,300 --> 01:14:20,159
pass all those and keep running in

1550
01:14:20,159 --> 01:14:23,340
memory then well I am now able to do

1551
01:14:23,340 --> 01:14:25,380
whatever the hell

1552
01:14:25,380 --> 01:14:28,380
I want and so yeah again this is nothing

1553
01:14:28,380 --> 01:14:30,800
fancy at least an example

1554
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:33,840
but it is able to build off for this to

1555
01:14:33,840 --> 01:14:36,179
create a dropper a downloader the

1556
01:14:36,179 --> 01:14:39,500
drawback which I have heard

1557
01:14:39,560 --> 01:14:43,640
I don't care but um

1558
01:14:43,860 --> 01:14:46,860
cases I was looking at a easy at an easy

1559
01:14:46,860 --> 01:14:51,500
way to have a dropper drop

1560
01:14:52,040 --> 01:14:55,440
Linux or Mac which is

1561
01:14:55,440 --> 01:14:57,780
a hassle I mean we don't have all of the

1562
01:14:57,780 --> 01:15:00,719
macro camera but

1563
01:15:00,719 --> 01:15:02,460
that's all I have I know I talk really

1564
01:15:02,460 --> 01:15:04,140
fast

1565
01:15:04,140 --> 01:15:06,540
but um if you'd like to know more

1566
01:15:06,540 --> 01:15:08,219
um

1567
01:15:08,219 --> 01:15:09,840
my blog I have a much more thorough

1568
01:15:09,840 --> 01:15:11,400
write-up as to how I actually build this

1569
01:15:11,400 --> 01:15:13,440
sticks by GitHub link

1570
01:15:13,440 --> 01:15:15,659
there at legends.pro it's a legit

1571
01:15:15,659 --> 01:15:16,739
website

1572
01:15:16,739 --> 01:15:18,480
I own it so don't be easier than that

1573
01:15:18,480 --> 01:15:22,280
I'm on Twitter at nuclear Farm Boy

1574
01:15:22,640 --> 01:15:26,040
and that's all I have do I have any

1575
01:15:26,040 --> 01:15:27,659
questions comments is your concerned yes

1576
01:15:27,659 --> 01:15:29,839
sir

1577
01:15:54,060 --> 01:15:57,060
foreign

1578
01:16:32,840 --> 01:16:35,219
yeah and that's uh ultimately we're

1579
01:16:35,219 --> 01:16:36,300
looking at

1580
01:16:36,300 --> 01:16:37,860
we have a process that's running and we

1581
01:16:37,860 --> 01:16:39,360
want to get a payload to it and we're

1582
01:16:39,360 --> 01:16:41,100
like steganography is here

1583
01:16:41,100 --> 01:16:43,440
but like Yeah you mentioned within the

1584
01:16:43,440 --> 01:16:45,780
ffd9 that's jpeg I looked at some

1585
01:16:45,780 --> 01:16:47,699
something like that and part of my

1586
01:16:47,699 --> 01:16:49,920
research on bypassing uh more hardcore

1587
01:16:49,920 --> 01:16:52,440
uh and for detection with it

1588
01:16:52,440 --> 01:16:54,239
at source it says hey here's a pad next

1589
01:16:54,239 --> 01:16:56,340
with all of it and No One's Gonna

1590
01:16:56,340 --> 01:16:58,620
catch it especially because the header

1591
01:16:58,620 --> 01:17:00,900
looks relatively normal so yeah

1592
01:17:00,900 --> 01:17:01,620
um

1593
01:17:01,620 --> 01:17:04,159
foreign

1594
01:17:21,480 --> 01:17:23,400
that's actually something I'm actively

1595
01:17:23,400 --> 01:17:24,480
researching

1596
01:17:24,480 --> 01:17:25,920
um what I

1597
01:17:25,920 --> 01:17:28,260
been able to do is put the elf as part

1598
01:17:28,260 --> 01:17:29,940
of the image data basically pouring code

1599
01:17:29,940 --> 01:17:31,800
and have python run

1600
01:17:31,800 --> 01:17:33,719
well but again it's not very dependent

1601
01:17:33,719 --> 01:17:37,020
because I am abusing the python backup

1602
01:17:37,020 --> 01:17:39,420
the header and that little work with the

1603
01:17:39,420 --> 01:17:41,880
clean variables but I do know that there

1604
01:17:41,880 --> 01:17:44,340
are other four out of 500

1605
01:17:44,340 --> 01:17:46,199
I believe it's a key app and can also

1606
01:17:46,199 --> 01:17:47,760
treat it as an elf that is something

1607
01:17:47,760 --> 01:17:49,080
that I

1608
01:17:49,080 --> 01:17:52,260
had to look well

1609
01:17:52,260 --> 01:17:55,260
no uh you can create a

1610
01:17:55,260 --> 01:17:58,500
PDF Hollywood man that I think is part

1611
01:17:58,500 --> 01:17:59,520
of my research where I was looking into

1612
01:17:59,520 --> 01:18:01,500
this yeah

1613
01:18:01,500 --> 01:18:03,360
um yes sir

1614
01:18:03,360 --> 01:18:06,360
foreign

1615
01:18:15,780 --> 01:18:18,600
yeah and that's not where the actual

1616
01:18:18,600 --> 01:18:21,000
execution of this

1617
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:22,980
Falls more on you know your larger

1618
01:18:22,980 --> 01:18:24,900
attack chain but if you're having like

1619
01:18:24,900 --> 01:18:26,520
you already have a process running that

1620
01:18:26,520 --> 01:18:28,560
you can get a python started so it

1621
01:18:28,560 --> 01:18:30,060
doesn't look at suspicious this is a

1622
01:18:30,060 --> 01:18:31,980
good way to deliver that

1623
01:18:31,980 --> 01:18:33,719
um we can also you know create a hey

1624
01:18:33,719 --> 01:18:35,520
here's an install script

1625
01:18:35,520 --> 01:18:37,320
that line there and your little logo

1626
01:18:37,320 --> 01:18:38,940
that's there so yeah do you still have

1627
01:18:38,940 --> 01:18:42,300
to get your to run Python and click on

1628
01:18:42,300 --> 01:18:45,420
it which is a lot harder than the team

1629
01:18:45,420 --> 01:18:47,040
but that's why we have social Engineers

1630
01:18:47,040 --> 01:18:48,060
for that I've just been there the place

1631
01:18:48,060 --> 01:18:50,280
for the header but yeah it's a very good

1632
01:18:50,280 --> 01:18:52,320
point

1633
01:18:52,320 --> 01:18:54,120
any other questions not station comments

1634
01:18:54,120 --> 01:18:56,100
are concerns

1635
01:18:56,100 --> 01:18:58,219
um

1636
01:18:59,520 --> 01:19:01,560
uh online

1637
01:19:01,560 --> 01:19:05,239
see I just submitted and um

1638
01:19:07,199 --> 01:19:09,719
awesome well there is no other comments

1639
01:19:09,719 --> 01:19:11,340
or if you think about something later

1640
01:19:11,340 --> 01:19:14,219
again there's my contact info

1641
01:19:14,219 --> 01:19:16,440
to put this little madly hot at your boy

1642
01:19:16,440 --> 01:19:17,580
I'm always

1643
01:19:17,580 --> 01:19:22,040
ready to nerd out and I'll be around

1644
01:19:22,500 --> 01:19:25,199
and that's all I got

1645
01:19:25,199 --> 01:19:27,799

um

1685

right all right

um

1687
01:30:41,280 --> 01:30:42,780
quick disclaimer

1688
01:30:42,780 --> 01:30:44,280
I'm not an authority on this so

1689
01:30:44,280 --> 01:30:45,600
everything should be taken with a grain

1690
01:30:45,600 --> 01:30:47,840
of salt

1691
01:30:48,860 --> 01:30:51,420
I've spent quite a large portion of my

1692
01:30:51,420 --> 01:30:53,120
career as that monkey

1693
01:30:53,120 --> 01:30:55,800
before I ended up building one at my

1694
01:30:55,800 --> 01:30:57,239
previous job

1695
01:30:57,239 --> 01:30:59,100
um

1696
01:30:59,100 --> 01:31:01,340
foreign

1697
01:31:03,120 --> 01:31:06,120
manager

1698
01:31:10,199 --> 01:31:11,940
and where most of the stock comes in is

1699
01:31:11,940 --> 01:31:14,400
building out a complete facility for uh

1700
01:31:14,400 --> 01:31:16,560
Blackberry for the global

1701
01:31:16,560 --> 01:31:18,540
IR team supporting their threat research

1702
01:31:18,540 --> 01:31:19,980
teams and a couple other teams over

1703
01:31:19,980 --> 01:31:22,080
there

1704
01:31:22,080 --> 01:31:22,760
um

1705
01:31:22,760 --> 01:31:25,980
strike doing uh appearance and response

1706
01:31:25,980 --> 01:31:28,099
services

1707
01:31:30,199 --> 01:31:32,159
tat onto that

1708
01:31:32,159 --> 01:31:35,159
is

1709
01:31:37,340 --> 01:31:39,120
competition if you haven't heard of it

1710
01:31:39,120 --> 01:31:41,219
basically I set up infrastructure

1711
01:31:41,219 --> 01:31:43,320
while college students try to survive

1712
01:31:43,320 --> 01:31:45,719
against my team is super amusing

1713
01:31:45,719 --> 01:31:46,699
um

1714
01:31:46,699 --> 01:31:48,719
it's not a really fun environment it's

1715
01:31:48,719 --> 01:31:51,020
really broken games like uh

1716
01:31:51,020 --> 01:31:54,239
have fun kids so um a lot of

1717
01:31:54,239 --> 01:31:55,500
infrastructure

1718
01:31:55,500 --> 01:31:58,139
stuff over there

1719
01:31:58,139 --> 01:32:00,719
um no uh

1720
01:32:00,719 --> 01:32:03,179
started if you are finding yourself in

1721
01:32:03,179 --> 01:32:05,340
the position

1722
01:32:05,340 --> 01:32:06,900
you're gonna want these two books uh

1723
01:32:06,900 --> 01:32:08,820
this one right here

1724
01:32:08,820 --> 01:32:10,199
and I brought this pen like I know

1725
01:32:10,199 --> 01:32:12,900
something so I'm gonna Vanna White

1726
01:32:12,900 --> 01:32:17,040
uh ISO 27001 guide and then it's lesser

1727
01:32:17,040 --> 01:32:18,480
no one cares

1728
01:32:18,480 --> 01:32:21,000
o 1720.

1729
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:24,020
um that's the theory

1730
01:32:27,679 --> 01:32:30,600
ISO and this 853

1731
01:32:30,600 --> 01:32:33,600
uh

1732
01:32:35,940 --> 01:32:38,340
from this laboratory these are ancient I

1733
01:32:38,340 --> 01:32:41,219
think these are the early 2000s and

1734
01:32:41,219 --> 01:32:42,600
this one right here is actually due for

1735
01:32:42,600 --> 01:32:45,480
a refresh in about two months so

1736
01:32:45,480 --> 01:32:47,219
let me try that but

1737
01:32:47,219 --> 01:32:48,900
most of everything in relation to

1738
01:32:48,900 --> 01:32:51,060
clients and a couple of

1739
01:32:51,060 --> 01:32:52,260
I think they're all thinking from that

1740
01:32:52,260 --> 01:32:54,360
book and the rest is to uh followed by

1741
01:32:54,360 --> 01:32:56,400
fire

1742
01:32:56,400 --> 01:32:58,800
so uh

1743
01:32:58,800 --> 01:33:01,440
in this uh the first thing is your

1744
01:33:01,440 --> 01:33:03,179
companies

1745
01:33:03,179 --> 01:33:05,460
budget you know depending on how big of

1746
01:33:05,460 --> 01:33:07,860
a shop you are and what you guys are

1747
01:33:07,860 --> 01:33:09,239
looking for

1748
01:33:09,239 --> 01:33:11,760
in your own visual forensics and IR team

1749
01:33:11,760 --> 01:33:13,560
right you might have a busted peanuts

1750
01:33:13,560 --> 01:33:16,980
you might have a blank check right so

1751
01:33:16,980 --> 01:33:18,540
um this one with all points it'll all

1752
01:33:18,540 --> 01:33:22,040
change how you might take away things

1753
01:33:22,139 --> 01:33:24,360
uh the second one is company politics

1754
01:33:24,360 --> 01:33:26,820
right maybe you're able to bribe people

1755
01:33:26,820 --> 01:33:29,400
to get some things maybe you're not

1756
01:33:29,400 --> 01:33:30,780
um you know

1757
01:33:30,780 --> 01:33:32,940
along that by our construction people to

1758
01:33:32,940 --> 01:33:34,500
put in a couple TVs into our lab because

1759
01:33:34,500 --> 01:33:38,300
sitting in the sterile lab

1760
01:33:38,840 --> 01:33:41,820
uh but you know there's also a lot to

1761
01:33:41,820 --> 01:33:44,040
digest if you're dealing with

1762
01:33:44,040 --> 01:33:47,040
specifics

1763
01:33:48,120 --> 01:33:50,159
all right so I am not a contractor I

1764
01:33:50,159 --> 01:33:52,500
don't know how to construct a pain worth

1765
01:33:52,500 --> 01:33:54,480
so

1766
01:33:54,480 --> 01:33:56,400
we'll be discussing anything about you

1767
01:33:56,400 --> 01:33:58,080
know working with the contractors

1768
01:33:58,080 --> 01:33:59,639
um

1769
01:33:59,639 --> 01:34:00,900
because again every project is different

1770
01:34:00,900 --> 01:34:03,719
every layout you know everything is

1771
01:34:03,719 --> 01:34:06,020
different so while I will be going over

1772
01:34:06,020 --> 01:34:08,580
the physical attributes of the lab I've

1773
01:34:08,580 --> 01:34:10,920
really been giving too much into that

1774
01:34:10,920 --> 01:34:12,920
um

1775
01:34:14,600 --> 01:34:17,840
of the lab

1776
01:34:18,320 --> 01:34:20,460
you know

1777
01:34:20,460 --> 01:34:21,960
and doing that sort of stuff you know

1778
01:34:21,960 --> 01:34:23,340
working with putting everything in

1779
01:34:23,340 --> 01:34:24,840
evidence back

1780
01:34:24,840 --> 01:34:26,639
and so forth

1781
01:34:26,639 --> 01:34:29,040
um that can be a whole talk of its own

1782
01:34:29,040 --> 01:34:30,560
but

1783
01:34:30,560 --> 01:34:32,760
it's just one of the things that you

1784
01:34:32,760 --> 01:34:34,440
know some of it will be covered but it's

1785
01:34:34,440 --> 01:34:36,600
not going to be a focal point

1786
01:34:36,600 --> 01:34:38,040
so

1787
01:34:38,040 --> 01:34:39,420
I guess it's sort of why do we have a

1788
01:34:39,420 --> 01:34:40,860
lab right

1789
01:34:40,860 --> 01:34:43,380
the whole point of a lab forensic slap

1790
01:34:43,380 --> 01:34:46,639
so we're taking a step back

1791
01:34:47,840 --> 01:34:49,800
you know

1792
01:34:49,800 --> 01:34:51,540
biological outright you're investigating

1793
01:34:51,540 --> 01:34:53,760
crimes and emergency veterans

1794
01:34:53,760 --> 01:34:56,219
you need a clean area where the evidence

1795
01:34:56,219 --> 01:34:58,440
can be tainted and the story cannot

1796
01:34:58,440 --> 01:34:59,280
change

1797
01:34:59,280 --> 01:35:00,540
definitely when your people out

1798
01:35:00,540 --> 01:35:02,520
throughout this because when you're

1799
01:35:02,520 --> 01:35:05,340
doing forensics when you're doing IR

1800
01:35:05,340 --> 01:35:08,699
um you need to make sure that your story

1801
01:35:08,699 --> 01:35:10,739
evidence remains unchanged so the facts

1802
01:35:10,739 --> 01:35:13,739
don't change so I mean a little hard to

1803
01:35:13,739 --> 01:35:15,860
see

1804
01:35:15,860 --> 01:35:18,300
the first one is clean

1805
01:35:18,300 --> 01:35:21,300
right

1806
01:35:22,440 --> 01:35:24,840
Championship or whatever uh as time

1807
01:35:24,840 --> 01:35:26,159
progresses right now we're seeing

1808
01:35:26,159 --> 01:35:28,638
Electronics

1809
01:35:28,980 --> 01:35:32,179
um maybe through camera surveillance

1810
01:35:32,179 --> 01:35:34,980
maybe the victim had a phone

1811
01:35:34,980 --> 01:35:36,719
or a laptop on them something or another

1812
01:35:36,719 --> 01:35:39,300
right so now you have the need today

1813
01:35:39,300 --> 01:35:41,940
a uh additional forensic slab right now

1814
01:35:41,940 --> 01:35:43,980
you're looking at the media

1815
01:35:43,980 --> 01:35:45,540
uh maybe looking for Clues maybe you're

1816
01:35:45,540 --> 01:35:47,639
trying to um

1817
01:35:47,639 --> 01:35:48,840
what happened so I think we're still

1818
01:35:48,840 --> 01:35:50,100
talking about like the crime scene stuff

1819
01:35:50,100 --> 01:35:52,739
if we go into incident response right

1820
01:35:52,739 --> 01:35:56,400
now or traditional forensics you know

1821
01:35:56,400 --> 01:35:58,199
limit just together so we don't really

1822
01:35:58,199 --> 01:35:59,880
careful much about

1823
01:35:59,880 --> 01:36:03,600
that means um one of the other things

1824
01:36:03,600 --> 01:36:06,120
so keep in mind I mean this is a lot of

1825
01:36:06,120 --> 01:36:07,080
times

1826
01:36:07,080 --> 01:36:09,300
doing content to focus only the actual

1827
01:36:09,300 --> 01:36:10,980
image and stuff presented

1828
01:36:10,980 --> 01:36:13,199
you can't really stay human about things

1829
01:36:13,199 --> 01:36:16,199
I'll get it distribution is kind of

1830
01:36:16,199 --> 01:36:18,000
limited

1831
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:20,340
so now you know now everyone's got a

1832
01:36:20,340 --> 01:36:21,780
phone number to me

1833
01:36:21,780 --> 01:36:25,980
uh watch cameras are everywhere um

1834
01:36:25,980 --> 01:36:30,840
now we've sort of largely uh at least

1835
01:36:30,840 --> 01:36:33,020
foreign

1836
01:36:57,000 --> 01:37:00,000
that

1837
01:37:02,580 --> 01:37:04,580
um

1838
01:37:04,820 --> 01:37:08,100
are not tangible right like if you can

1839
01:37:08,100 --> 01:37:10,580
do your job

1840
01:37:11,100 --> 01:37:12,960
you know it's whatever but if you're

1841
01:37:12,960 --> 01:37:15,480
working as like a private investigator

1842
01:37:15,480 --> 01:37:18,600
type dealer this is an important

1843
01:37:18,600 --> 01:37:21,719
you have to make triply sure that um the

1844
01:37:21,719 --> 01:37:23,460
evidence is not all

1845
01:37:23,460 --> 01:37:25,679
anyway right especially on that sort of

1846
01:37:25,679 --> 01:37:29,480
side of things we're going into cyber uh

1847
01:37:29,480 --> 01:37:34,638
so that same process holds

1848
01:37:36,739 --> 01:37:38,760
right you wanna

1849
01:37:38,760 --> 01:37:41,760
man

1850
01:37:45,659 --> 01:37:46,920
um and you know I've asked him anything

1851
01:37:46,920 --> 01:37:49,260
so that's your timeline right

1852
01:37:49,260 --> 01:37:52,440
you cannot let the evidence be you know

1853
01:37:52,440 --> 01:37:54,540
change anyway so

1854
01:37:54,540 --> 01:37:56,159
think about timestamps right and you're

1855
01:37:56,159 --> 01:37:56,940
traveling through multiple different

1856
01:37:56,940 --> 01:37:58,380
times like there's a reason why we try

1857
01:37:58,380 --> 01:37:59,880
to uh normally

1858
01:37:59,880 --> 01:38:02,760
everything UTC so everything is set in

1859
01:38:02,760 --> 01:38:04,620
that single time zone you're not dealing

1860
01:38:04,620 --> 01:38:06,800
with like

1861
01:38:07,639 --> 01:38:10,340
over here

1862
01:38:10,340 --> 01:38:12,380
God knows what

1863
01:38:12,380 --> 01:38:14,400
the middle of the engagement right so

1864
01:38:14,400 --> 01:38:15,960
everything is

1865
01:38:15,960 --> 01:38:18,300
so I mean I guess swamps for short is

1866
01:38:18,300 --> 01:38:19,860
you have to normalize everything it

1867
01:38:19,860 --> 01:38:21,300
makes for nothing

1868
01:38:21,300 --> 01:38:22,800
changes

1869
01:38:22,800 --> 01:38:24,420
um but for slightly different reasons

1870
01:38:24,420 --> 01:38:27,500
right one is the best features

1871
01:38:27,500 --> 01:38:29,520
we're testing one of the other in a

1872
01:38:29,520 --> 01:38:33,380
report for the client or legal

1873
01:38:36,480 --> 01:38:38,639
my only other things that comes up when

1874
01:38:38,639 --> 01:38:40,440
you're flipping out the lab or the

1875
01:38:40,440 --> 01:38:42,120
obviously

1876
01:38:42,120 --> 01:38:45,120
response

1877
01:38:50,219 --> 01:38:52,080
right and such so I need to go you're

1878
01:38:52,080 --> 01:38:53,940
probably working with

1879
01:38:53,940 --> 01:38:56,340
tens of thousands of terabytes of data

1880
01:38:56,340 --> 01:38:57,780
right because you're going through this

1881
01:38:57,780 --> 01:38:59,699
giant data set looking for something

1882
01:38:59,699 --> 01:39:01,739
I think so that will change how you

1883
01:39:01,739 --> 01:39:03,780
structure everything up the hardware you

1884
01:39:03,780 --> 01:39:06,000
buy to the space you can use uh to build

1885
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:07,980
things out

1886
01:39:07,980 --> 01:39:10,139
we might even higher but it's not

1887
01:39:10,139 --> 01:39:12,500
responsible

1888
01:39:13,040 --> 01:39:14,699
data most of the time that you're

1889
01:39:14,699 --> 01:39:18,559
deploying trash to and like at a concert

1890
01:39:19,940 --> 01:39:22,340
uh data

1891
01:39:22,340 --> 01:39:25,860
FFC Kyler or whatever right

1892
01:39:25,860 --> 01:39:27,860
yeah

1893
01:39:30,139 --> 01:39:32,159
you're still going to want processing

1894
01:39:32,159 --> 01:39:33,659
power so again

1895
01:39:33,659 --> 01:39:36,600
change you know um what you buy you

1896
01:39:36,600 --> 01:39:37,920
might not need as much storage you might

1897
01:39:37,920 --> 01:39:39,060
not

1898
01:39:39,060 --> 01:39:41,060
um

1899
01:39:47,040 --> 01:39:48,060
um there's one or two companies out

1900
01:39:48,060 --> 01:39:50,040
there that have the office

1901
01:39:50,040 --> 01:39:51,960
I just have one out before that's only

1902
01:39:51,960 --> 01:39:53,760
evidence version that's it but nothing

1903
01:39:53,760 --> 01:39:56,840
else is one thing to say

1904
01:39:57,739 --> 01:40:01,940
all right so there are completely

1905
01:40:04,620 --> 01:40:05,880
how much you need a place to put it

1906
01:40:05,880 --> 01:40:07,440
right you can't really commit your life

1907
01:40:07,440 --> 01:40:09,719
without a thin air

1908
01:40:09,719 --> 01:40:12,000
um so beautiful location for the lab you

1909
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:13,440
need some security

1910
01:40:13,440 --> 01:40:16,560
right so you know aside from cameras and

1911
01:40:16,560 --> 01:40:18,239
what both like there's a couple other

1912
01:40:18,239 --> 01:40:19,260
things

1913
01:40:19,260 --> 01:40:21,659
to make sure that your lab stays secure

1914
01:40:21,659 --> 01:40:25,340
uh your workstation is here

1915
01:40:25,340 --> 01:40:29,040
a lot of processing power and a lot of

1916
01:40:29,040 --> 01:40:31,199
just the peaky system in general so I'll

1917
01:40:31,199 --> 01:40:33,900
get a little bit more into that

1918
01:40:33,900 --> 01:40:37,219
um and as you grow along

1919
01:40:37,639 --> 01:40:39,960
apartments right so that's where this

1920
01:40:39,960 --> 01:40:41,520
book comes in you need your isos and

1921
01:40:41,520 --> 01:40:42,900
your nests

1922
01:40:42,900 --> 01:40:44,940
he just within ramps and all that stuff

1923
01:40:44,940 --> 01:40:47,100
right it sucks I hate it too but it

1924
01:40:47,100 --> 01:40:48,080
doesn't

1925
01:40:48,080 --> 01:40:50,520
Necessities you have

1926
01:40:50,520 --> 01:40:52,620
um a way to talk yourself

1927
01:40:52,620 --> 01:40:54,600
I want to come and see okay are you

1928
01:40:54,600 --> 01:40:56,840
actually

1929
01:40:58,580 --> 01:41:00,239
to do

1930
01:41:00,239 --> 01:41:02,820
something yes we are certified to do

1931
01:41:02,820 --> 01:41:04,320
things properly Trust

1932
01:41:04,320 --> 01:41:07,620
for Professionals in theory with

1933
01:41:07,620 --> 01:41:09,960
and once you go along you might

1934
01:41:09,960 --> 01:41:11,340
you know especially the bakery firm if

1935
01:41:11,340 --> 01:41:13,320
you want to automate things

1936
01:41:13,320 --> 01:41:16,139
or twice everything so at some point you

1937
01:41:16,139 --> 01:41:19,380
know having six ten boxes in a lab isn't

1938
01:41:19,380 --> 01:41:20,940
going to cut it anymore you're gonna

1939
01:41:20,940 --> 01:41:23,760
need 20 30 100 PMS on a constant for

1940
01:41:23,760 --> 01:41:26,179
analysts

1941
01:41:26,300 --> 01:41:28,380
and a lot of this except for the

1942
01:41:28,380 --> 01:41:31,139
compliancy requirements will shift

1943
01:41:31,139 --> 01:41:34,139
slab

1944
01:41:34,980 --> 01:41:37,860
I'm gonna try to 27.01 You're Gonna Want

1945
01:41:37,860 --> 01:41:41,159
to Miss 850.

1946
01:41:41,699 --> 01:41:44,219
um and 17.

1947
01:41:44,219 --> 01:41:47,219
again

1948
01:41:53,219 --> 01:41:55,679
so the actual office space

1949
01:41:55,679 --> 01:41:57,679
um

1950
01:41:57,719 --> 01:42:00,719
where

1951
01:42:02,100 --> 01:42:04,560
your offices but your company is hybrid

1952
01:42:04,560 --> 01:42:05,639
or you just happen to have a lot of

1953
01:42:05,639 --> 01:42:06,900
people like

1954
01:42:06,900 --> 01:42:08,159
in California right you're going to want

1955
01:42:08,159 --> 01:42:11,219
that lab to where everyone can get to it

1956
01:42:11,219 --> 01:42:13,139
um if you guys mostly

1957
01:42:13,139 --> 01:42:16,400
many people on site right

1958
01:42:16,820 --> 01:42:20,159
your new systems and you at least my

1959
01:42:20,159 --> 01:42:21,780
purpose you might close to a major city

1960
01:42:21,780 --> 01:42:23,760
uh main reason

1961
01:42:23,760 --> 01:42:25,860
for that is if you need something like

1962
01:42:25,860 --> 01:42:29,360
uh six months of Nod

1963
01:42:37,500 --> 01:42:40,500
so

1964
01:42:44,400 --> 01:42:45,960
if possible a little bit close to a

1965
01:42:45,960 --> 01:42:47,639
major city that way something to lead by

1966
01:42:47,639 --> 01:42:49,739
the cable and adapter you can you know

1967
01:42:49,739 --> 01:42:53,040
flyovers whatever and grab it

1968
01:42:53,040 --> 01:42:53,780
um

1969
01:42:53,780 --> 01:42:56,639
a lot of the things a lot

1970
01:42:56,639 --> 01:42:58,560
of the people say to keep it in an

1971
01:42:58,560 --> 01:43:00,380
inconsiderous space right so you want it

1972
01:43:00,380 --> 01:43:04,030
not clearly labeled hey

1973
01:43:04,030 --> 01:43:06,860
[Music]

1974
01:43:06,860 --> 01:43:08,880
a little

1975
01:43:08,880 --> 01:43:10,739
you know the way or at least accessible

1976
01:43:10,739 --> 01:43:11,880
right

1977
01:43:11,880 --> 01:43:14,460
um it can be

1978
01:43:14,460 --> 01:43:16,260
actually like monster office or housing

1979
01:43:16,260 --> 01:43:17,219
area

1980
01:43:17,219 --> 01:43:18,300
um you know you generally don't want to

1981
01:43:18,300 --> 01:43:21,199
advertise that uh

1982
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:26,040
um

1983
01:43:26,040 --> 01:43:28,080
do you want multiple rooms are single

1984
01:43:28,080 --> 01:43:29,520
right and again this is you know what

1985
01:43:29,520 --> 01:43:32,280
makes a decision right is your order

1986
01:43:32,280 --> 01:43:34,260
big enough to just by having one

1987
01:43:34,260 --> 01:43:36,960
investment analysis one just forever

1988
01:43:36,960 --> 01:43:39,719
4-H do we have room for a great room you

1989
01:43:39,719 --> 01:43:41,580
know that sort of stuff we're really

1990
01:43:41,580 --> 01:43:43,260
smaller so there's no

1991
01:43:43,260 --> 01:43:45,060
there really need to be visible space

1992
01:43:45,060 --> 01:43:46,739
people sit in right

1993
01:43:46,739 --> 01:43:49,440
maybe your lab is gonna be all for July

1994
01:43:49,440 --> 01:43:51,060
so you don't really need

1995
01:43:51,060 --> 01:43:52,619
anything more than a small area of

1996
01:43:52,619 --> 01:43:54,619
Imaging and a small area for everything

1997
01:43:54,619 --> 01:43:58,199
the rest is in a locked up um cab out in

1998
01:43:58,199 --> 01:44:00,840
a color somewhere

1999
01:44:00,840 --> 01:44:04,320
um it's really an organizational need as

2000
01:44:04,320 --> 01:44:05,820
well as a budgetary maybe you need

2001
01:44:05,820 --> 01:44:07,440
multiple rooms

2002
01:44:07,440 --> 01:44:09,719
come on all right start out with a solid

2003
01:44:09,719 --> 01:44:11,900
room

2004
01:44:12,980 --> 01:44:14,940
if you have

2005
01:44:14,940 --> 01:44:17,219
only budget or the space for one room at

2006
01:44:17,219 --> 01:44:19,199
that time right then

2007
01:44:19,199 --> 01:44:19,940
um

2008
01:44:19,940 --> 01:44:22,619
new space open Team expands you can

2009
01:44:22,619 --> 01:44:24,060
bring you up in storage room where you

2010
01:44:24,060 --> 01:44:27,000
can make a brand new uh

2011
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:28,800
analysis

2012
01:44:28,800 --> 01:44:30,600
part right

2013
01:44:30,600 --> 01:44:31,619
um

2014
01:44:31,619 --> 01:44:33,600
speaking as long as you have space for

2015
01:44:33,600 --> 01:44:35,580
the equipment and most importantly the

2016
01:44:35,580 --> 01:44:38,040
people you're good right because it's

2017
01:44:38,040 --> 01:44:39,780
still fun to work in like the size of

2018
01:44:39,780 --> 01:44:41,159
this Podium area

2019
01:44:41,159 --> 01:44:43,380
and you've got six offices like churning

2020
01:44:43,380 --> 01:44:46,920
out like fcm and x-ways 24 7s

2021
01:44:46,920 --> 01:44:50,060
getting fuckingly hot

2022
01:44:54,060 --> 01:44:57,139
I should probably fix that

2023
01:44:58,619 --> 01:45:00,619
stuff

2024
01:45:02,520 --> 01:45:05,719
check the cleaner mission

2025
01:45:22,699 --> 01:45:24,719
oh my gosh

2026
01:45:24,719 --> 01:45:26,520
thing right it's not great to have a

2027
01:45:26,520 --> 01:45:28,380
small room with all these boxes Alvin

2028
01:45:28,380 --> 01:45:29,940
and you're like kind of sliding through

2029
01:45:29,940 --> 01:45:31,320
these boxes trying to get to things

2030
01:45:31,320 --> 01:45:32,520
you're trying to take apart a laptop

2031
01:45:32,520 --> 01:45:34,380
with like

2032
01:45:34,380 --> 01:45:37,080
this space right so you need space to do

2033
01:45:37,080 --> 01:45:38,460
things you need space tutorial equipment

2034
01:45:38,460 --> 01:45:41,600
so that's sort of like

2035
01:45:46,440 --> 01:45:48,440
um

2036
01:45:50,699 --> 01:45:53,699
space

2037
01:45:56,880 --> 01:45:58,619
dedicated stations right up here and

2038
01:45:58,619 --> 01:45:59,880
wonder we have a station just repairing

2039
01:45:59,880 --> 01:46:03,560
this part store tracks

2040
01:46:03,600 --> 01:46:04,980
workstations on back side of the room

2041
01:46:04,980 --> 01:46:06,300
right there's different ways to leaking

2042
01:46:06,300 --> 01:46:07,400
out

2043
01:46:07,400 --> 01:46:10,380
we have a clean way to get these parts

2044
01:46:10,380 --> 01:46:12,360
you can look at them

2045
01:46:12,360 --> 01:46:15,480
that's okay another thing is you need to

2046
01:46:15,480 --> 01:46:18,440
be closer look into service

2047
01:46:24,139 --> 01:46:27,480
right so there's always weird unknowns

2048
01:46:27,480 --> 01:46:28,679
right we had one time where we had to do

2049
01:46:28,679 --> 01:46:31,980
the heimlich on an intern that he was

2050
01:46:31,980 --> 01:46:33,719
eating like a grape or something else

2051
01:46:33,719 --> 01:46:35,820
stuck right and it's like okay stuff

2052
01:46:35,820 --> 01:46:38,219
like that will happen

2053
01:46:38,219 --> 01:46:41,760
one time we had a fire break out too

2054
01:46:41,760 --> 01:46:44,900
bad uh

2055
01:46:46,820 --> 01:46:50,699
it might be critical to have a firearms

2056
01:46:50,699 --> 01:46:52,739
these things really do get out of

2057
01:46:52,739 --> 01:46:53,699
control

2058
01:46:53,699 --> 01:46:55,199
um hopefully I don't know

2059
01:46:55,199 --> 01:46:58,199
right

2060
01:47:00,179 --> 01:47:02,639
um it may be a completely different a

2061
01:47:02,639 --> 01:47:05,239
complete Factor individually

2062
01:47:05,239 --> 01:47:07,980
service by a local TV but if you want to

2063
01:47:07,980 --> 01:47:09,420
be serviced by the sheriffs which takes

2064
01:47:09,420 --> 01:47:11,340
20 minutes to get out there

2065
01:47:11,340 --> 01:47:13,800
something really major right versus a

2066
01:47:13,800 --> 01:47:16,219
local video

2067
01:47:24,020 --> 01:47:26,100
I'll link out

2068
01:47:26,100 --> 01:47:27,719
um we've had it happen when we had a

2069
01:47:27,719 --> 01:47:28,980
triple

2070
01:47:28,980 --> 01:47:32,100
uh from three lines

2071
01:47:32,100 --> 01:47:34,139
at two for one and a third for the other

2072
01:47:34,139 --> 01:47:35,520
and a

2073
01:47:35,520 --> 01:47:37,199
completely different part of the city

2074
01:47:37,199 --> 01:47:39,300
someone cut through the big fatigue

2075
01:47:39,300 --> 01:47:41,219
fiber line we had knocked out two of our

2076
01:47:41,219 --> 01:47:42,060
three

2077
01:47:42,060 --> 01:47:43,080
um

2078
01:47:43,080 --> 01:47:45,300
but we still have that third link right

2079
01:47:45,300 --> 01:47:47,159
so multiply speed as well even if it's

2080
01:47:47,159 --> 01:47:48,300
just like

2081
01:47:48,300 --> 01:47:49,800
starling

2082
01:47:49,800 --> 01:47:52,080
or whatever you have something that's

2083
01:47:52,080 --> 01:47:55,519
maybe not depending on

2084
01:47:56,900 --> 01:47:58,860
I got the value

2085
01:47:58,860 --> 01:48:01,280
show it um

2086
01:48:01,280 --> 01:48:04,199
I mean that's someone jokingly right

2087
01:48:04,199 --> 01:48:06,960
but as I moved previously uh people are

2088
01:48:06,960 --> 01:48:10,100
not going to be happy working out

2089
01:48:10,280 --> 01:48:14,179
I mean it's just like you know of course

2090
01:48:14,179 --> 01:48:17,280
it's also good to keep it next to it

2091
01:48:17,280 --> 01:48:20,840
and finally agario things

2092
01:48:26,900 --> 01:48:30,900
and another thing especially

2093
01:48:30,900 --> 01:48:33,420
and SoCal is a relatively safe for

2094
01:48:33,420 --> 01:48:36,119
natural disaster credits

2095
01:48:36,119 --> 01:48:37,500
okay good

2096
01:48:37,500 --> 01:48:40,980
um make sure like it's Earthly great

2097
01:48:40,980 --> 01:48:42,480
I had a pretty strong we worked at a

2098
01:48:42,480 --> 01:48:43,679
data center where

2099
01:48:43,679 --> 01:48:45,719
the entire data center was

2100
01:48:45,719 --> 01:48:48,420
sleep on strut on giant shock absorbers

2101
01:48:48,420 --> 01:48:52,380
like this similar to car like

2102
01:48:52,380 --> 01:48:53,940
driving on the dunes and only the

2103
01:48:53,940 --> 01:48:56,219
suspensions safety the entire data

2104
01:48:56,219 --> 01:48:58,139
center was suspended on struts and

2105
01:48:58,139 --> 01:48:59,280
there's also like a boat and everything

2106
01:48:59,280 --> 01:49:00,659
right because in SoCal is about

2107
01:49:00,659 --> 01:49:04,699
earthquakes nothing much information

2108
01:49:05,900 --> 01:49:07,739
you know

2109
01:49:07,739 --> 01:49:09,119
you're not doing her lab in Southern

2110
01:49:09,119 --> 01:49:10,500
Florida where there's a hurricane every

2111
01:49:10,500 --> 01:49:12,800
other day

2112
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:17,340
our data center

2113
01:49:17,340 --> 01:49:19,380
again it's another thing you don't

2114
01:49:19,380 --> 01:49:22,260
really want it out there

2115
01:49:22,260 --> 01:49:25,040
the Middle East

2116
01:49:27,380 --> 01:49:31,040
from that sort of stuff

2117
01:49:34,380 --> 01:49:37,340
um one of the things that

2118
01:49:37,340 --> 01:49:40,380
right it's easy

2119
01:49:40,380 --> 01:49:42,420
traditional AC systems build up

2120
01:49:42,420 --> 01:49:44,900
condensation

2121
01:49:48,179 --> 01:49:50,040
it's not created as over countless

2122
01:49:50,040 --> 01:49:52,800
cycles of your boxes turned on off works

2123
01:49:52,800 --> 01:49:54,960
singer conversational build build up in

2124
01:49:54,960 --> 01:49:57,500
the capacitors

2125
01:50:01,679 --> 01:50:04,679
King

2126
01:50:05,699 --> 01:50:08,219
that's what happened where over time

2127
01:50:08,219 --> 01:50:09,540
used to have a really really bad AC

2128
01:50:09,540 --> 01:50:12,060
system like it was damaging it was just

2129
01:50:12,060 --> 01:50:14,159
the room was always humid right and

2130
01:50:14,159 --> 01:50:15,900
eventually all the videos

2131
01:50:15,900 --> 01:50:19,199
because over time corrosion happens

2132
01:50:19,199 --> 01:50:21,900
died so they specifically make low

2133
01:50:21,900 --> 01:50:23,900
condensation

2134
01:50:23,900 --> 01:50:25,739
that's interesting death centers that's

2135
01:50:25,739 --> 01:50:27,960
why that Center is so dry because

2136
01:50:27,960 --> 01:50:29,400
they're designed to suck the

2137
01:50:29,400 --> 01:50:32,219
condensation out major elements damaged

2138
01:50:32,219 --> 01:50:34,679
um another thing to think about it is um

2139
01:50:34,679 --> 01:50:37,440
your fire system right Sparkles are

2140
01:50:37,440 --> 01:50:40,159
great but when you're sitting on like

2141
01:50:40,159 --> 01:50:44,719
four stations and servers uh

2142
01:50:44,719 --> 01:50:47,400
right so you know previously we saw

2143
01:50:47,400 --> 01:50:48,420
people on

2144
01:50:48,420 --> 01:50:51,420
now

2145
01:50:52,380 --> 01:50:54,420
we've got the lovely November 12 race

2146
01:50:54,420 --> 01:50:57,420
and so it's a gas that comes in like

2147
01:50:57,420 --> 01:50:58,860
Halon will kill you this will keep you

2148
01:50:58,860 --> 01:51:00,360
boxing this is what you need you don't

2149
01:51:00,360 --> 01:51:04,260
want to be okay one um but this one

2150
01:51:04,260 --> 01:51:07,080
get the fire on seconds and so if you're

2151
01:51:07,080 --> 01:51:08,820
doing anything you know not just in the

2152
01:51:08,820 --> 01:51:10,159
lab

2153
01:51:10,159 --> 01:51:14,900
orers electronics and you see spring

2154
01:51:15,739 --> 01:51:17,699
there goes

2155
01:51:17,699 --> 01:51:22,159
right and it's not just your girls

2156
01:51:24,619 --> 01:51:27,380
sitting there

2157
01:51:27,380 --> 01:51:31,280
yeah good luck um

2158
01:51:32,480 --> 01:51:35,280
it's still always

2159
01:51:35,280 --> 01:51:37,080
if you're down to that level

2160
01:51:37,080 --> 01:51:39,780
um recovery needs

2161
01:51:39,780 --> 01:51:43,699
uh electricity right so

2162
01:51:44,580 --> 01:51:46,739
it's not funnily enough out of this

2163
01:51:46,739 --> 01:51:48,179
project going on at home right now so my

2164
01:51:48,179 --> 01:51:49,560
mind's sneaking like

2165
01:51:49,560 --> 01:51:51,780
oh solar right so

2166
01:51:51,780 --> 01:51:53,840
um

2167
01:51:54,500 --> 01:51:58,199
you know we will always have UPS yes

2168
01:51:58,199 --> 01:52:00,360
interoperable our spies on each system

2169
01:52:00,360 --> 01:52:01,619
but there's multiple times

2170
01:52:01,619 --> 01:52:03,719
right you'll have your like standard

2171
01:52:03,719 --> 01:52:05,580
stuff that you get at that's fine

2172
01:52:05,580 --> 01:52:07,320
all the way up to uh I think it's line

2173
01:52:07,320 --> 01:52:10,020
level UPS is where

2174
01:52:10,020 --> 01:52:12,480
the battery is always

2175
01:52:12,480 --> 01:52:14,280
so that when the power comes up there's

2176
01:52:14,280 --> 01:52:17,179
no milliseconds of

2177
01:52:17,179 --> 01:52:19,080
delayed with the power supply right

2178
01:52:19,080 --> 01:52:21,960
because some system especially delicate

2179
01:52:21,960 --> 01:52:23,520
conversations if you have that loaded

2180
01:52:23,520 --> 01:52:25,139
bullet the computer might shut down

2181
01:52:25,139 --> 01:52:27,860
undergoes you

2182
01:52:31,679 --> 01:52:35,940
um so really

2183
01:52:35,940 --> 01:52:38,100
right especially if a system that holds

2184
01:52:38,100 --> 01:52:39,540
the old you've got like 10 minutes on

2185
01:52:39,540 --> 01:52:41,520
the standard door desktop you guess at

2186
01:52:41,520 --> 01:52:44,159
best so now you go to the site needs

2187
01:52:44,159 --> 01:52:45,500
generator

2188
01:52:45,500 --> 01:52:47,699
now you've got a diesel tank generator

2189
01:52:47,699 --> 01:52:49,860
kicking on and making sure

2190
01:52:49,860 --> 01:52:52,920
these forces to stay up in enough time

2191
01:52:52,920 --> 01:52:54,900
for you to shut them down

2192
01:52:54,900 --> 01:52:56,699
um even beyond that right

2193
01:52:56,699 --> 01:52:58,380
in our previous slide we actually have

2194
01:52:58,380 --> 01:52:59,820
Tesla power balls

2195
01:52:59,820 --> 01:53:02,820
well

2196
01:53:04,619 --> 01:53:06,360
we not only have generators but we have

2197
01:53:06,360 --> 01:53:07,739
the power walls

2198
01:53:07,739 --> 01:53:10,940
two stages

2199
01:53:15,360 --> 01:53:16,739
about an hour left to get everything

2200
01:53:16,739 --> 01:53:18,719
closed out

2201
01:53:18,719 --> 01:53:21,719
right

2202
01:53:22,619 --> 01:53:24,739
um

2203
01:53:25,860 --> 01:53:27,600
all right so

2204
01:53:27,600 --> 01:53:31,100
um for a long time

2205
01:53:35,540 --> 01:53:40,139
metal chair here especially when working

2206
01:53:40,139 --> 01:53:41,760
um

2207
01:53:41,760 --> 01:53:43,199
just don't put equipment but when you're

2208
01:53:43,199 --> 01:53:46,219
working on something as

2209
01:53:46,739 --> 01:53:48,500
special that's not really the right word

2210
01:53:48,500 --> 01:53:50,580
but if you're working on something of

2211
01:53:50,580 --> 01:53:53,100
this matter right you need yeah sure so

2212
01:53:53,100 --> 01:53:54,420
to the point where you've got your

2213
01:53:54,420 --> 01:53:55,880
answer

2214
01:53:55,880 --> 01:53:58,560
your floors are grounded and your walls

2215
01:53:58,560 --> 01:54:00,000
are coming to your cables

2216
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:01,800
around it right so when you're building

2217
01:54:01,800 --> 01:54:03,480
a lab out you're working with your

2218
01:54:03,480 --> 01:54:06,500
contractor to have tiles

2219
01:54:07,760 --> 01:54:09,420
all the way

2220
01:54:09,420 --> 01:54:12,420
things

2221
01:54:13,219 --> 01:54:15,900
that go up from the floor to the outlet

2222
01:54:15,900 --> 01:54:17,940
Beach down to the ground

2223
01:54:17,940 --> 01:54:19,739
so if there's no chance of you having

2224
01:54:19,739 --> 01:54:22,080
static even if you have metal everywhere

2225
01:54:22,080 --> 01:54:23,460
so these

2226
01:54:23,460 --> 01:54:25,940
messages

2227
01:54:29,940 --> 01:54:33,000
if you cry that like one SSD that just

2228
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:34,560
so happens to be like patient

2229
01:54:34,560 --> 01:54:37,560
gone

2230
01:54:37,980 --> 01:54:39,600
it's a really major part investigation

2231
01:54:39,600 --> 01:54:42,739
because that's how they got it

2232
01:54:47,780 --> 01:54:50,280
that's like you know

2233
01:54:50,280 --> 01:54:53,239
three times worse

2234
01:54:54,119 --> 01:54:56,480
um like I mentioned

2235
01:54:56,480 --> 01:55:00,119
space for your personnel and your team

2236
01:55:00,119 --> 01:55:02,119
um

2237
01:55:04,100 --> 01:55:06,480
eight hour Street carrying a part of the

2238
01:55:06,480 --> 01:55:07,980
eight devices or any disco case you're

2239
01:55:07,980 --> 01:55:08,940
not gonna

2240
01:55:08,940 --> 01:55:11,880
time to go out and get food and get

2241
01:55:11,880 --> 01:55:13,920
things ready

2242
01:55:13,920 --> 01:55:15,659
you're gonna want something there so you

2243
01:55:15,659 --> 01:55:18,780
don't have to get up I mean that's not

2244
01:55:18,780 --> 01:55:20,460
the starting the fact that you can come

2245
01:55:20,460 --> 01:55:21,780
away but if you're working in something

2246
01:55:21,780 --> 01:55:24,659
especially time for the course like we

2247
01:55:24,659 --> 01:55:27,300
need results now

2248
01:55:27,300 --> 01:55:29,100
having that sort of stuff while you know

2249
01:55:29,100 --> 01:55:30,780
it sounds kind of like a joking it makes

2250
01:55:30,780 --> 01:55:33,000
sense right

2251
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:35,119
um

2252
01:55:40,159 --> 01:55:43,500
all right so uh

2253
01:55:43,500 --> 01:55:46,500
typically

2254
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:51,300
the time if you can have white three or

2255
01:55:51,300 --> 01:55:54,060
four thousand stack shifts so no one

2256
01:55:54,060 --> 01:55:55,260
that's not

2257
01:55:55,260 --> 01:55:57,260
um

2258
01:55:58,679 --> 01:56:00,239
speaking app maybe you'll have front

2259
01:56:00,239 --> 01:56:02,100
desk perception that's open 9-5 match

2260
01:56:02,100 --> 01:56:03,119
your security

2261
01:56:03,119 --> 01:56:05,040
starting out with my fashion getting

2262
01:56:05,040 --> 01:56:06,900
that works as long as you have all your

2263
01:56:06,900 --> 01:56:09,080
support

2264
01:56:09,900 --> 01:56:13,699
um so there's a difference

2265
01:56:16,280 --> 01:56:18,960
personal ones advice and that's

2266
01:56:18,960 --> 01:56:20,580
hopefully trained like in case there's

2267
01:56:20,580 --> 01:56:23,580
an intrusion we had one guy who came in

2268
01:56:23,580 --> 01:56:25,800
he was like that's uh Iranian

2269
01:56:25,800 --> 01:56:28,100
intelligence

2270
01:56:28,100 --> 01:56:30,960
and it's like okay why did you see that

2271
01:56:30,960 --> 01:56:33,360
when we hire you right

2272
01:56:33,360 --> 01:56:36,739
right another thing I'll come into place

2273
01:56:37,139 --> 01:56:39,420
right definitely if it's a great

2274
01:56:39,420 --> 01:56:42,179
personal uh The Usual Suspects fighter

2275
01:56:42,179 --> 01:56:44,520
as far as like cameras motion detectors

2276
01:56:44,520 --> 01:56:47,300
or detectors

2277
01:56:51,139 --> 01:56:53,100
in and out

2278
01:56:53,100 --> 01:56:55,139
and lab and security areas are actually

2279
01:56:55,139 --> 01:56:56,820
who they're supposed to be and if

2280
01:56:56,820 --> 01:56:58,219
there's anyone

2281
01:56:58,219 --> 01:57:00,600
like um I really doubt you're going to

2282
01:57:00,600 --> 01:57:02,119
have a consultant

2283
01:57:02,119 --> 01:57:05,400
that's like it's a fortune thing or

2284
01:57:05,400 --> 01:57:06,420
something

2285
01:57:06,420 --> 01:57:08,219
amazing right so you know if the alarms

2286
01:57:08,219 --> 01:57:10,580
go out at 2AM something's up

2287
01:57:10,580 --> 01:57:12,719
and even vice versa right if someone

2288
01:57:12,719 --> 01:57:16,080
gets past your door

2289
01:57:16,080 --> 01:57:18,020
um

2290
01:57:18,020 --> 01:57:21,199
right so

2291
01:57:22,980 --> 01:57:24,540
um all the audit requirements they want

2292
01:57:24,540 --> 01:57:25,619
to

2293
01:57:25,619 --> 01:57:29,760
if you want either a card like this

2294
01:57:29,760 --> 01:57:30,780
hotel

2295
01:57:30,780 --> 01:57:33,179
which is nothing you should be using lap

2296
01:57:33,179 --> 01:57:35,460
and you know your ID and your PIN a

2297
01:57:35,460 --> 01:57:38,460
finger playing Iris and whatever you

2298
01:57:38,460 --> 01:57:40,020
need the 2fa uh if you're working

2299
01:57:40,020 --> 01:57:42,320
against

2300
01:57:42,739 --> 01:57:45,000
another code for it you need something

2301
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:47,040
of the sort to make sure that not

2302
01:57:47,040 --> 01:57:49,159
anymore

2303
01:57:50,400 --> 01:57:53,400
is

2304
01:57:53,520 --> 01:57:55,860
a master key especially maintenance but

2305
01:57:55,860 --> 01:57:58,880
if you're going into the lab

2306
01:58:05,480 --> 01:58:08,340
attack me that's right you can't just go

2307
01:58:08,340 --> 01:58:09,599
in there alone someone hasn't been

2308
01:58:09,599 --> 01:58:11,699
watching them

2309
01:58:11,699 --> 01:58:15,500
um so that stuff gets into play

2310
01:58:21,480 --> 01:58:24,320
evidence safe

2311
01:58:31,940 --> 01:58:36,540
thank you does

2312
01:58:39,540 --> 01:58:41,940
um and just because you have like say a

2313
01:58:41,940 --> 01:58:44,460
gun safe doesn't mean it can be obvious

2314
01:58:44,460 --> 01:58:45,840
but it still needs to be inside the lab

2315
01:58:45,840 --> 01:58:48,300
and it's still it awesome security

2316
01:58:48,300 --> 01:58:52,880
controls right so yes the labs

2317
01:58:53,300 --> 01:58:55,500
electronic but the state should also

2318
01:58:55,500 --> 01:59:00,380
have some variant of 2fa for someone

2319
01:59:02,960 --> 01:59:04,739
that also needs to be taken into

2320
01:59:04,739 --> 01:59:06,420
consideration

2321
01:59:06,420 --> 01:59:09,239
and one of the other things that sort of

2322
01:59:09,239 --> 01:59:10,080
was

2323
01:59:10,080 --> 01:59:12,440
especially

2324
01:59:12,440 --> 01:59:15,179
okay what

2325
01:59:15,179 --> 01:59:17,400
well so

2326
01:59:17,400 --> 01:59:20,239
um you know especially

2327
01:59:20,239 --> 01:59:22,980
FBI teaches which is a criminal justice

2328
01:59:22,980 --> 01:59:24,960
stuff you want to make sure no one's

2329
01:59:24,960 --> 01:59:27,000
creating right not only a metal door but

2330
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:28,580
having Steel

2331
01:59:28,580 --> 01:59:32,219
s which sounds like a joke but uh

2332
01:59:32,219 --> 01:59:37,699
stuff that we used was 30 or 40 minutes

2333
01:59:37,880 --> 01:59:41,099
right so not only

2334
01:59:41,099 --> 01:59:42,420
you know if we were talking about threat

2335
01:59:42,420 --> 01:59:43,440
models I don't want to get past the

2336
01:59:43,440 --> 01:59:45,020
security guards

2337
01:59:45,020 --> 01:59:47,159
doors and now they can't get through

2338
01:59:47,159 --> 01:59:49,199
your laptop or another

2339
01:59:49,199 --> 01:59:51,239
oh and it's not just the wall it's all

2340
01:59:51,239 --> 01:59:53,360
around

2341
01:59:54,360 --> 01:59:56,280
um so these are just like some some

2342
01:59:56,280 --> 01:59:58,820
security things right

2343
01:59:58,820 --> 02:00:02,960
personal plate wall um

2344
02:00:04,800 --> 02:00:07,800
Kevlar

2345
02:00:11,239 --> 02:00:14,639
drywall or um

2346
02:00:14,639 --> 02:00:16,380
they don't do that anymore right but

2347
02:00:16,380 --> 02:00:18,179
they're you know there's different ways

2348
02:00:18,179 --> 02:00:19,679
to go around that maybe you just need

2349
02:00:19,679 --> 02:00:21,179
you know double

2350
02:00:21,179 --> 02:00:23,840
uh

2351
02:00:25,099 --> 02:00:28,800
steel cotton mesh uh something that it

2352
02:00:28,800 --> 02:00:29,639
didn't

2353
02:00:29,639 --> 02:00:31,560
put on here is also sound isolation

2354
02:00:31,560 --> 02:00:32,820
right

2355
02:00:32,820 --> 02:00:35,099
if your lab is one that people take

2356
02:00:35,099 --> 02:00:39,659
their work calls and foreign

2357
02:00:46,380 --> 02:00:48,599
so you know there's multiple ways of

2358
02:00:48,599 --> 02:00:50,219
making sure that minnows gets out right

2359
02:00:50,219 --> 02:00:52,440
you can do whatever cheating on the

2360
02:00:52,440 --> 02:00:54,719
walls you can be massive vinyl

2361
02:00:54,719 --> 02:00:57,480
you can do uh two pieces of drywall your

2362
02:00:57,480 --> 02:00:59,760
gap between glue um

2363
02:00:59,760 --> 02:01:01,020
you know there's a couple different ones

2364
02:01:01,020 --> 02:01:03,860
go around that as well

2365
02:01:05,420 --> 02:01:07,560
I'm looking into it you don't want

2366
02:01:07,560 --> 02:01:10,199
anyone listening into it right

2367
02:01:10,199 --> 02:01:12,420
um nobody knows it's

2368
02:01:12,420 --> 02:01:14,480
it's

2369
02:01:16,760 --> 02:01:20,460
the construction workers put a door with

2370
02:01:20,460 --> 02:01:22,560
like a clear piece of

2371
02:01:22,560 --> 02:01:24,900
a cute piece of glass in the middle and

2372
02:01:24,900 --> 02:01:26,940
it's like okay you guys have the plan

2373
02:01:26,940 --> 02:01:29,880
it's a secure location forensics lab

2374
02:01:29,880 --> 02:01:32,460
security what part of

2375
02:01:32,460 --> 02:01:35,900
Pure Glass makes sense

2376
02:01:35,900 --> 02:01:40,560
to class and reach around the door right

2377
02:01:40,560 --> 02:01:42,000
so

2378
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:44,159
um everybody just want to detail kind of

2379
02:01:44,159 --> 02:01:45,960
matters if you're doing

2380
02:01:45,960 --> 02:01:48,900
but Pop Secret type stuff that's the top

2381
02:01:48,900 --> 02:01:50,880
secret type of stuff right but like

2382
02:01:50,880 --> 02:01:53,480
specifically

2383
02:01:56,580 --> 02:01:59,520
hi blockers all right so typically

2384
02:01:59,520 --> 02:02:00,719
there's the two

2385
02:02:00,719 --> 02:02:02,820
and that's in my blocker industry

2386
02:02:02,820 --> 02:02:04,139
um it's a blow

2387
02:02:04,139 --> 02:02:07,080
and uh I don't actually know how to say

2388
02:02:07,080 --> 02:02:09,599
I just don't want to read text

2389
02:02:09,599 --> 02:02:11,040
uh

2390
02:02:11,040 --> 02:02:12,719
the industry standard right I mean if

2391
02:02:12,719 --> 02:02:15,239
you're working in any lab more than

2392
02:02:15,239 --> 02:02:18,000
likely have to blow here

2393
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:21,780
for my m.2 soft just how to disaster

2394
02:02:21,780 --> 02:02:23,880
five and a quarter inch Drive being here

2395
02:02:23,880 --> 02:02:25,980
uh

2396
02:02:25,980 --> 02:02:27,599
industry sander but they also come with

2397
02:02:27,599 --> 02:02:29,159
that price tag of the industry standard

2398
02:02:29,159 --> 02:02:31,380
right they're right blockers are five by

2399
02:02:31,380 --> 02:02:33,540
fifty just for standards data uh right

2400
02:02:33,540 --> 02:02:38,460
blocker so they do carry it up uh

2401
02:02:39,060 --> 02:02:41,099
um I haven't seen as much but

2402
02:02:41,099 --> 02:02:43,020
we still keep them on here just in case

2403
02:02:43,020 --> 02:02:44,699
especially if we have a lot of drives

2404
02:02:44,699 --> 02:02:46,820
coming out more

2405
02:02:46,820 --> 02:02:48,659
blockers and if we're talking like

2406
02:02:48,659 --> 02:02:51,440
specifically SATA based probably 400

2407
02:02:51,440 --> 02:02:53,940
it's only 100 cheaper than the total

2408
02:02:53,940 --> 02:02:56,580
option although it might

2409
02:02:56,580 --> 02:02:59,460
Millions right the drivers on those are

2410
02:02:59,460 --> 02:03:01,679
really definitely and they tend to be

2411
02:03:01,679 --> 02:03:05,780
very flaky side sort of telling them

2412
02:03:06,440 --> 02:03:10,159
if it's like 15 minutes

2413
02:03:10,159 --> 02:03:13,679
I mean the whole purpose of having like

2414
02:03:13,679 --> 02:03:16,099
blockers

2415
02:03:16,800 --> 02:03:17,880
um you can have Standalone right

2416
02:03:17,880 --> 02:03:19,440
blockers you can have one built into the

2417
02:03:19,440 --> 02:03:21,900
system you can have Imaging stations

2418
02:03:21,900 --> 02:03:23,219
right so you have a little dedicated

2419
02:03:23,219 --> 02:03:24,360
bottle

2420
02:03:24,360 --> 02:03:26,699
I mean you put the new drive and it

2421
02:03:26,699 --> 02:03:28,080
automatically images and puts the image

2422
02:03:28,080 --> 02:03:30,800
onto another machine

2423
02:03:32,360 --> 02:03:35,280
this whole process of having the gears

2424
02:03:35,280 --> 02:03:38,219
to make sure everything doesn't alter

2425
02:03:38,219 --> 02:03:40,560
um and so

2426
02:03:40,560 --> 02:03:42,540
just give me an example real fast enough

2427
02:03:42,540 --> 02:03:44,360
that it would end up like a workflow

2428
02:03:44,360 --> 02:03:46,739
here uh original drive to the right

2429
02:03:46,739 --> 02:03:47,880
block

2430
02:03:47,880 --> 02:03:51,119
Advantage media as your backup copy of

2431
02:03:51,119 --> 02:03:53,040
the image you put an image on either a

2432
02:03:53,040 --> 02:03:56,280
network share or the workstation you've

2433
02:03:56,280 --> 02:03:57,900
always work on the coffee

2434
02:03:57,900 --> 02:04:00,900
and

2435
02:04:06,500 --> 02:04:09,179
workstation all right so this is the fun

2436
02:04:09,179 --> 02:04:10,940
part right

2437
02:04:10,940 --> 02:04:12,960
if you're really looking at the server

2438
02:04:12,960 --> 02:04:16,080
and a tower with like a million five

2439
02:04:16,080 --> 02:04:18,179
quarter inch space right so

2440
02:04:18,179 --> 02:04:20,040
you pop open on these workstations and

2441
02:04:20,040 --> 02:04:23,599
that's really just a dual it's a tower

2442
02:04:29,820 --> 02:04:33,440
around uh the mortgage

2443
02:04:34,940 --> 02:04:37,139
do you want

2444
02:04:37,139 --> 02:04:39,560
yes

2445
02:04:41,840 --> 02:04:43,980
specifically to run your raids so like

2446
02:04:43,980 --> 02:04:47,060
you'd be running uh

2447
02:04:47,060 --> 02:04:50,840
90 pros from Samsung

2448
02:04:54,260 --> 02:04:56,400
you want everything to be as fast as

2449
02:04:56,400 --> 02:04:57,380
possible

2450
02:04:57,380 --> 02:05:00,060
and you know I can't you may not have a

2451
02:05:00,060 --> 02:05:01,619
bunch of the board

2452
02:05:01,619 --> 02:05:04,619
or

2453
02:05:08,119 --> 02:05:09,960
the other

2454
02:05:09,960 --> 02:05:12,480
thing that also is really important is

2455
02:05:12,480 --> 02:05:14,300
the quarantine support service right

2456
02:05:14,300 --> 02:05:16,260
especially the

2457
02:05:16,260 --> 02:05:20,580
entire world to get something great now

2458
02:05:20,580 --> 02:05:22,679
and so

2459
02:05:22,679 --> 02:05:24,480
you're doing it try to go and build on

2460
02:05:24,480 --> 02:05:26,780
that local team right like

2461
02:05:26,780 --> 02:05:30,119
a silicon forensic site Force he serves

2462
02:05:30,119 --> 02:05:32,699
all of SoCal and and they will have

2463
02:05:32,699 --> 02:05:35,699
foreign

2464
02:05:38,099 --> 02:05:40,619
24 hours 12 hours even

2465
02:05:40,619 --> 02:05:42,420
uh one can we go

2466
02:05:42,420 --> 02:05:43,800
station up there and what happened to

2467
02:05:43,800 --> 02:05:45,540
the Utah station just to make and you

2468
02:05:45,540 --> 02:05:46,860
know we kept our Drive

2469
02:05:46,860 --> 02:05:48,599
but we walked up into the replacement

2470
02:05:48,599 --> 02:05:51,619
just because

2471
02:05:52,400 --> 02:05:54,980
if you're looking at rack mount servers

2472
02:05:54,980 --> 02:05:57,300
there's no not really

2473
02:05:57,300 --> 02:06:00,300
contest there here you need a Dell

2474
02:06:00,300 --> 02:06:03,139
server uh

2475
02:06:06,540 --> 02:06:08,880
um Mac OS

2476
02:06:08,880 --> 02:06:11,880
sometimes

2477
02:06:15,119 --> 02:06:18,019
for um

2478
02:06:19,760 --> 02:06:22,739
some of that stuff on a normal rotation

2479
02:06:22,739 --> 02:06:24,179
because it's x86 space now you're

2480
02:06:24,179 --> 02:06:27,960
dealing with r based stuff so you will

2481
02:06:27,960 --> 02:06:30,840
more likely at the very least once if I

2482
02:06:30,840 --> 02:06:32,639
need a max station

2483
02:06:32,639 --> 02:06:34,080
I think that's some point before

2484
02:06:34,080 --> 02:06:36,179
celebrate or a long time ago when we had

2485
02:06:36,179 --> 02:06:39,619
blackback was not to celebrate

2486
02:06:40,400 --> 02:06:43,040
right so

2487
02:06:43,040 --> 02:06:44,820
sometimes I'll get a case anymore it's

2488
02:06:44,820 --> 02:06:47,659
like hey we have our uh

2489
02:06:47,659 --> 02:06:49,739
senior security guy

2490
02:06:49,739 --> 02:06:53,420
um he's actually actual trading data

2491
02:06:53,420 --> 02:06:55,739
right so you might have something like

2492
02:06:55,739 --> 02:06:56,940
that coming along which is always fun

2493
02:06:56,940 --> 02:06:59,659
because probably

2494
02:06:59,940 --> 02:07:02,659
I believe

2495
02:07:04,860 --> 02:07:08,119
also uh

2496
02:07:08,119 --> 02:07:10,619
I'm gonna smashing the Imaging stations

2497
02:07:10,619 --> 02:07:12,060
right if you have the budget you have

2498
02:07:12,060 --> 02:07:13,920
the space

2499
02:07:13,920 --> 02:07:16,159
Imaging stations are great right because

2500
02:07:16,159 --> 02:07:18,420
patch this is the drive this is the

2501
02:07:18,420 --> 02:07:19,739
destination image and we'll do

2502
02:07:19,739 --> 02:07:21,599
everything before you just walk

2503
02:07:21,599 --> 02:07:23,099
away

2504
02:07:23,099 --> 02:07:27,080
um I think it'll start about like 1800s

2505
02:07:28,880 --> 02:07:32,340
what if I'm not mistaken uh

2506
02:07:32,340 --> 02:07:35,480
all really great options

2507
02:07:36,599 --> 02:07:38,699
and what this really all adds up to is

2508
02:07:38,699 --> 02:07:41,340
trying to build the lapse where it's

2509
02:07:41,340 --> 02:07:43,980
super resilient right

2510
02:07:43,980 --> 02:07:45,320
foreign

2511
02:07:45,320 --> 02:07:48,900
goes out you'll either have backups for

2512
02:07:48,900 --> 02:07:51,739
your images

2513
02:07:54,980 --> 02:07:57,360
for that and something is true to try

2514
02:07:57,360 --> 02:08:00,259
like your motherboard

2515
02:08:01,159 --> 02:08:03,900
uh you know as soon as possible

2516
02:08:03,900 --> 02:08:06,300
another thing to mentioned here is

2517
02:08:06,300 --> 02:08:09,300
information

2518
02:08:11,599 --> 02:08:14,400
these options change greatly is more

2519
02:08:14,400 --> 02:08:17,719
support because you can only have

2520
02:08:20,060 --> 02:08:22,099
Service Hardware

2521
02:08:22,099 --> 02:08:26,540
or like whoever with the system

2522
02:08:26,540 --> 02:08:29,219
the drives on there with like one file

2523
02:08:29,219 --> 02:08:31,860
with CBI it's off limits

2524
02:08:31,860 --> 02:08:34,880
it's like just about everything

2525
02:08:37,880 --> 02:08:41,219
all right I hate this um

2526
02:08:41,219 --> 02:08:43,139
it's arguably the worst thing to do is

2527
02:08:43,139 --> 02:08:46,280
if things change constantly right

2528
02:08:47,219 --> 02:08:48,900
um typically when you're doing mobile

2529
02:08:48,900 --> 02:08:51,080
friends

2530
02:08:51,260 --> 02:08:54,360
why because if someone goes to find my

2531
02:08:54,360 --> 02:08:56,480
iPhone

2532
02:08:56,699 --> 02:08:59,699
switches

2533
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:01,980
for that matter right maybe they have

2534
02:09:01,980 --> 02:09:03,440
something

2535
02:09:03,440 --> 02:09:05,520
at a certain time or whatever you want

2536
02:09:05,520 --> 02:09:07,760
to make sure nothing

2537
02:09:07,760 --> 02:09:11,760
so even when you're in imaging analysis

2538
02:09:11,760 --> 02:09:15,420
torch always in like Verity box or a bag

2539
02:09:15,420 --> 02:09:18,920
uh sometimes

2540
02:09:19,440 --> 02:09:21,440
um

2541
02:09:25,920 --> 02:09:26,900
um

2542
02:09:26,900 --> 02:09:28,980
literally even have to wipe in the box I

2543
02:09:28,980 --> 02:09:30,000
have to use a different box extreme

2544
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:31,619
which I just didn't like the

2545
02:09:31,619 --> 02:09:34,139
Hardware of advice and no one was able

2546
02:09:34,139 --> 02:09:36,060
to figure it out if like six months ago

2547
02:09:36,060 --> 02:09:37,560
looking at it

2548
02:09:37,560 --> 02:09:39,360
um have a center box for celebrating

2549
02:09:39,360 --> 02:09:41,820
it'll save you so much time

2550
02:09:41,820 --> 02:09:44,760
and if you get to the stage which you

2551
02:09:44,760 --> 02:09:45,900
know I hope you don't you might need to

2552
02:09:45,900 --> 02:09:47,820
detect by a certain dude

2553
02:09:47,820 --> 02:09:49,440
off right you need a physical solder

2554
02:09:49,440 --> 02:09:51,360
take the actual Source trip out of the

2555
02:09:51,360 --> 02:09:53,580
phone and put it in you know image it

2556
02:09:53,580 --> 02:09:55,940
that way versus going through

2557
02:09:55,940 --> 02:09:58,080
or whatever so

2558
02:09:58,080 --> 02:10:02,540
rarely is that case um

2559
02:10:05,659 --> 02:10:08,839
right there

2560
02:10:09,239 --> 02:10:11,880
there's a lot of it seems really simple

2561
02:10:11,880 --> 02:10:13,940
right

2562
02:10:13,940 --> 02:10:16,739
the main people up there I've got DNS

2563
02:10:16,739 --> 02:10:18,840
certificate

2564
02:10:18,840 --> 02:10:21,659
authorities that sort of stuff right but

2565
02:10:21,659 --> 02:10:24,679
when you go to a big lab

2566
02:10:26,659 --> 02:10:28,619
you need a

2567
02:10:28,619 --> 02:10:31,619
is

2568
02:10:34,280 --> 02:10:36,840
very basic but it's also very much

2569
02:10:36,840 --> 02:10:38,880
necessity and you can get away without

2570
02:10:38,880 --> 02:10:40,739
all this

2571
02:10:40,739 --> 02:10:42,659
I'm sure but this museum has like a

2572
02:10:42,659 --> 02:10:44,099
couple people or you have remote workers

2573
02:10:44,099 --> 02:10:45,780
you absolutely

2574
02:10:45,780 --> 02:10:47,520
stuff

2575
02:10:47,520 --> 02:10:48,179
um

2576
02:10:48,179 --> 02:10:50,460
you also need various

2577
02:10:50,460 --> 02:10:52,560
as a vlogging of the gearing question

2578
02:10:52,560 --> 02:10:55,440
right and yeah I mentioned Sonic the

2579
02:10:55,440 --> 02:10:56,280
obviously even the one that's good

2580
02:10:56,280 --> 02:10:58,040
controls but what about

2581
02:10:58,040 --> 02:11:00,540
and storage utilization right like if

2582
02:11:00,540 --> 02:11:01,679
you're looking at your hardware and

2583
02:11:01,679 --> 02:11:04,139
hopefully it works patients you need to

2584
02:11:04,139 --> 02:11:05,099
know

2585
02:11:05,099 --> 02:11:08,340
um I hate workstation 10 is low on this

2586
02:11:08,340 --> 02:11:11,219
space on that specific archive things

2587
02:11:11,219 --> 02:11:14,760
right or you know hey workstation 3 has

2588
02:11:14,760 --> 02:11:16,139
been running out

2589
02:11:16,139 --> 02:11:19,639
December two weeks

2590
02:11:21,119 --> 02:11:23,239
um

2591
02:11:27,719 --> 02:11:31,760
like zavix or um

2592
02:11:34,340 --> 02:11:36,360
you know I'm not

2593
02:11:36,360 --> 02:11:39,360
foreign

2594
02:12:12,560 --> 02:12:15,239
it will vary but generally

2595
02:12:15,239 --> 02:12:17,060
one at the very least

2596
02:12:17,060 --> 02:12:20,239
three two one right three backups

2597
02:12:20,239 --> 02:12:23,820
ite so off-site will get a little bit

2598
02:12:23,820 --> 02:12:25,860
contentious especially have

2599
02:12:25,860 --> 02:12:28,980
some stuff that relationship building

2600
02:12:28,980 --> 02:12:32,239
um you know you need your backups

2601
02:12:35,520 --> 02:12:37,520
um

2602
02:12:41,480 --> 02:12:44,159
so what do you do man

2603
02:12:44,159 --> 02:12:47,159
foreign

2604
02:13:10,320 --> 02:13:13,320
foreign

2605
02:13:14,760 --> 02:13:16,860
for your company to be like a main group

2606
02:13:16,860 --> 02:13:19,219
you have

2607
02:13:19,320 --> 02:13:20,820
uh and you have to be using a certain

2608
02:13:20,820 --> 02:13:23,820
profile right so it's all lplc

2609
02:13:23,820 --> 02:13:25,739
to make sure no one gets in and no one

2610
02:13:25,739 --> 02:13:29,059
takes any data

2611
02:13:32,400 --> 02:13:35,400
uh

2612
02:13:36,239 --> 02:13:38,540
I hate networking

2613
02:13:38,540 --> 02:13:42,320
you have a couple of options

2614
02:13:42,800 --> 02:13:46,820
everything your gap which is fine

2615
02:13:48,139 --> 02:13:51,079
you know

2616
02:13:51,079 --> 02:13:54,060
you can't access Internet directly

2617
02:13:54,060 --> 02:13:56,639
all your updates don't use us or

2618
02:13:56,639 --> 02:13:59,760
whatever stcm or you can

2619
02:13:59,760 --> 02:14:01,679
have a million approach where yes you've

2620
02:14:01,679 --> 02:14:02,820
watched them to the internet that's

2621
02:14:02,820 --> 02:14:05,639
behind all of the Fireballs

2622
02:14:05,639 --> 02:14:07,290
um

2623
02:14:07,290 --> 02:14:10,420
[Music]

2624
02:14:11,540 --> 02:14:14,040
you've got like late security if you do

2625
02:14:14,040 --> 02:14:17,000
that approach or in general

2626
02:14:18,199 --> 02:14:19,739
DC

2627
02:14:19,739 --> 02:14:22,219
I'm not not entirely

2628
02:14:22,219 --> 02:14:25,320
this is legitimately like something I've

2629
02:14:25,320 --> 02:14:29,719
got I'm not ashamed to say it but

2630
02:14:30,739 --> 02:14:34,560
Hollow so you know layered security

2631
02:14:34,560 --> 02:14:37,560
defense attack right someone jokingly

2632
02:14:37,560 --> 02:14:39,239
well you may not have a checkpoint

2633
02:14:39,239 --> 02:14:41,520
Apollo with the same network like

2634
02:14:41,520 --> 02:14:44,960
you may have um

2635
02:14:51,599 --> 02:14:53,639
all right fun stuff so like I mentioned

2636
02:14:53,639 --> 02:14:55,139
up here

2637
02:14:55,139 --> 02:14:56,880
two and a half they got it Frameworks

2638
02:14:56,880 --> 02:14:59,000
right so please

2639
02:14:59,000 --> 02:15:01,800
153 and

2640
02:15:01,800 --> 02:15:03,260
um

2641
02:15:03,260 --> 02:15:06,000
yeah so

2642
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:07,579
um

2643
02:15:07,579 --> 02:15:11,400
right super not super easy but

2644
02:15:11,400 --> 02:15:13,760
just about everything positive

2645
02:15:13,760 --> 02:15:15,780
153 which

2646
02:15:15,780 --> 02:15:19,560
is actually a super set uh ISO

2647
02:15:19,560 --> 02:15:22,560
so

2648
02:15:25,820 --> 02:15:27,860
you're pretty much

2649
02:15:27,860 --> 02:15:31,440
the main difference is if you're like a

2650
02:15:31,440 --> 02:15:32,820
private partner not dealing with the

2651
02:15:32,820 --> 02:15:33,780
government you're gonna have your eyes

2652
02:15:33,780 --> 02:15:34,679
so if you're dealing with the Government

2653
02:15:34,679 --> 02:15:37,440
Federal open state agencies you're going

2654
02:15:37,440 --> 02:15:39,060
to want your best

2655
02:15:39,060 --> 02:15:42,060
um the third fun one is the fbic so I

2656
02:15:42,060 --> 02:15:44,579
have to think of it this way

2657
02:15:44,579 --> 02:15:46,260
I give you if you look at it the wrong

2658
02:15:46,260 --> 02:15:48,380
way

2659
02:15:52,460 --> 02:15:54,119
to him

2660
02:15:54,119 --> 02:15:56,040
comes up to another level both in what

2661
02:15:56,040 --> 02:15:58,199
you need to do and consequences of if

2662
02:15:58,199 --> 02:15:59,880
you screw up

2663
02:15:59,880 --> 02:16:03,420
so she just is uh

2664
02:16:03,420 --> 02:16:05,159
where if you have the hard drive in one

2665
02:16:05,159 --> 02:16:08,099
system that has CD's case on it

2666
02:16:08,099 --> 02:16:10,020
no one can touch it except for like lab

2667
02:16:10,020 --> 02:16:11,520
manager The Examiner

2668
02:16:11,520 --> 02:16:13,320
and maybe one certified time that has

2669
02:16:13,320 --> 02:16:14,940
all the packages

2670
02:16:14,940 --> 02:16:16,920
that's it even if it's just like oh the

2671
02:16:16,920 --> 02:16:18,179
ramps have died you just walk out of

2672
02:16:18,179 --> 02:16:21,440
nope it's to be certified

2673
02:16:22,219 --> 02:16:24,119
and then the next thing is like I

2674
02:16:24,119 --> 02:16:25,139
mentioned if you mess up with the

2675
02:16:25,139 --> 02:16:27,380
evidence

2676
02:16:30,079 --> 02:16:34,459
so it's really fun to work with that

2677
02:16:40,200 --> 02:16:42,920
price

2678
02:16:45,019 --> 02:16:47,638
these are all accreditations you get uh

2679
02:16:47,638 --> 02:16:50,000
foreign

2680
02:16:55,638 --> 02:16:57,359
if you're working with the government

2681
02:16:57,359 --> 02:16:58,379
and yeah

2682
02:16:58,379 --> 02:17:01,379
AWS

2683
02:17:02,218 --> 02:17:04,320
for your lab infrastructure your archive

2684
02:17:04,320 --> 02:17:05,580
giving us three button out there yeah

2685
02:17:05,580 --> 02:17:07,820
police

2686
02:17:07,859 --> 02:17:10,439
um as an example uh

2687
02:17:10,439 --> 02:17:13,580
like that stuff

2688
02:17:14,540 --> 02:17:17,280
which is very new to me

2689
02:17:17,280 --> 02:17:20,280
is

2690
02:17:21,859 --> 02:17:26,599
the point of this is again if you're

2691
02:17:28,340 --> 02:17:30,299
trust you

2692
02:17:30,299 --> 02:17:31,799
right other than like the list of

2693
02:17:31,799 --> 02:17:34,200
clients everywhere right this is the way

2694
02:17:34,200 --> 02:17:35,760
we have Verizon certified women's

2695
02:17:35,760 --> 02:17:37,740
certified uh we're fed them certified

2696
02:17:37,740 --> 02:17:39,000
like we are complying with everything

2697
02:17:39,000 --> 02:17:42,558
your data is safe with us um until it is

2698
02:17:42,558 --> 02:17:44,700
that's another story

2699
02:17:44,700 --> 02:17:47,519
but um this is your way of making sure

2700
02:17:47,519 --> 02:17:49,679
that you're alive and checking on

2701
02:17:49,679 --> 02:17:53,719
properly and to show classes

2702
02:18:00,299 --> 02:18:02,599
foreign

2703
02:18:24,420 --> 02:18:27,120
they have tests for the right blockers

2704
02:18:27,120 --> 02:18:29,099
I mentioned right like they're actually

2705
02:18:29,099 --> 02:18:32,040
listed certified to be a white walker

2706
02:18:32,040 --> 02:18:33,240
um you can run those tests yourself to

2707
02:18:33,240 --> 02:18:35,718
make sure they're actually

2708
02:18:36,740 --> 02:18:39,240
make sure they're not throwing Sparks

2709
02:18:39,240 --> 02:18:40,920
everywhere

2710
02:18:40,920 --> 02:18:43,320
got an update process for SCCM and W

2711
02:18:43,320 --> 02:18:45,359
class make sure you've got a test

2712
02:18:45,359 --> 02:18:46,879
environment

2713
02:18:46,879 --> 02:18:51,299
because um directly

2714
02:18:51,599 --> 02:18:53,478
going on Friday

2715
02:18:53,478 --> 02:18:58,019
unless you're useless things

2716
02:18:58,799 --> 02:19:02,218
um sometimes though everything needs to

2717
02:19:02,218 --> 02:19:04,938
be yeah

2718
02:19:06,500 --> 02:19:10,580
no funny business is happening

2719
02:19:10,799 --> 02:19:12,540
um you can roll that into your if you're

2720
02:19:12,540 --> 02:19:13,978
a live manager

2721
02:19:13,978 --> 02:19:16,580
are you excited to do this

2722
02:19:16,580 --> 02:19:21,620
very test route here make sure it works

2723
02:19:22,459 --> 02:19:24,299
stuff goes crazy it's got like 20

2724
02:19:24,299 --> 02:19:26,478
amounts coming in

2725
02:19:26,478 --> 02:19:28,740
to go and you don't have to fuss about

2726
02:19:28,740 --> 02:19:31,879
you know he's breaking

2727
02:19:32,299 --> 02:19:35,760
all right so this is a little bit more

2728
02:19:35,760 --> 02:19:38,420
of a traditional

2729
02:19:40,580 --> 02:19:42,959
I don't think

2730
02:19:42,959 --> 02:19:45,959
right

2731
02:19:47,058 --> 02:19:48,899
oversees everything we make sure that

2732
02:19:48,899 --> 02:19:50,939
everything's going well

2733
02:19:50,939 --> 02:19:52,939
um

2734
02:19:55,740 --> 02:19:59,700
and with another episode this is

2735
02:19:59,700 --> 02:20:02,640
something right your charge officers

2736
02:20:02,640 --> 02:20:04,020
looking at cases that come in and saying

2737
02:20:04,020 --> 02:20:05,399
okay we can take this on and we can't

2738
02:20:05,399 --> 02:20:06,720
take this on this is very important

2739
02:20:06,720 --> 02:20:08,880
because those first two interact a

2740
02:20:08,880 --> 02:20:11,119
little bit

2741
02:20:11,600 --> 02:20:13,680
a little bit on the

2742
02:20:13,680 --> 02:20:16,020
effort to speak great

2743
02:20:16,020 --> 02:20:18,020
um

2744
02:20:19,820 --> 02:20:22,280
images everything

2745
02:20:22,280 --> 02:20:24,359
and then you got the guy who's living in

2746
02:20:24,359 --> 02:20:25,140
life

2747
02:20:25,140 --> 02:20:27,800
in case

2748
02:20:29,520 --> 02:20:31,439
so this is like a more traditional lab

2749
02:20:31,439 --> 02:20:34,220
setup right uh nowadays we're moving

2750
02:20:34,220 --> 02:20:36,720
towards the sort of weird hybrid model

2751
02:20:36,720 --> 02:20:38,960
right

2752
02:20:46,939 --> 02:20:50,180
that's awesome

2753
02:20:50,180 --> 02:20:53,040
I'll keep on this cloud and stuff right

2754
02:20:53,040 --> 02:20:54,600
you're gonna need to automate things to

2755
02:20:54,600 --> 02:20:55,700
make sure

2756
02:20:55,700 --> 02:20:59,340
everything can go well right so a lot of

2757
02:20:59,340 --> 02:21:01,939
new backups

2758
02:21:04,620 --> 02:21:07,620
right

2759
02:21:07,680 --> 02:21:09,740
um

2760
02:21:12,500 --> 02:21:15,180
right we've got what your style said

2761
02:21:15,180 --> 02:21:17,580
you've got the client uh Council wants

2762
02:21:17,580 --> 02:21:19,979
you got weird people to park them on

2763
02:21:19,979 --> 02:21:21,780
same for audits or something's Best Buy

2764
02:21:21,780 --> 02:21:24,479
a legal retention time

2765
02:21:24,479 --> 02:21:26,939
maybe you need 90 days of attention but

2766
02:21:26,939 --> 02:21:30,140
you don't have the capacity

2767
02:21:30,140 --> 02:21:32,520
for that

2768
02:21:32,520 --> 02:21:34,520
um

2769
02:21:50,280 --> 02:21:51,840
um

2770
02:21:51,840 --> 02:21:54,840
so

2771
02:21:57,300 --> 02:22:00,259
different ways

2772
02:22:01,260 --> 02:22:03,319
um

2773
02:22:08,280 --> 02:22:10,340
promoting in you don't have the

2774
02:22:10,340 --> 02:22:13,819
capacity to fight

2775
02:22:13,880 --> 02:22:17,280
obviously it's the stupidest 100

2776
02:22:17,280 --> 02:22:20,280
sorry

2777
02:22:22,859 --> 02:22:25,859
people

2778
02:22:28,740 --> 02:22:30,439
think

2779
02:22:30,439 --> 02:22:33,800
file of tickets

2780
02:22:40,560 --> 02:22:43,819
but that is theme results

2781
02:23:01,140 --> 02:23:03,120
right either through you or the client

2782
02:23:03,120 --> 02:23:05,160
or the ingestion of that data needs to

2783
02:23:05,160 --> 02:23:06,479
complicated right

2784
02:23:06,479 --> 02:23:08,280
you can't have someone check in every 10

2785
02:23:08,280 --> 02:23:11,520
minutes on a random FTP server you've

2786
02:23:11,520 --> 02:23:14,960
got like you know that's something

2787
02:23:17,340 --> 02:23:19,399
um

2788
02:23:26,520 --> 02:23:29,160
you can't wear your open shift or what

2789
02:23:29,160 --> 02:23:32,520
have you oh I know

2790
02:23:32,520 --> 02:23:35,520
and

2791
02:23:36,780 --> 02:23:39,899
of course I'm an open shave or uh jrc

2792
02:23:39,899 --> 02:23:41,359
box

2793
02:23:41,359 --> 02:23:44,520
uh that's the thing unfortunately if you

2794
02:23:44,520 --> 02:23:45,800
caught money

2795
02:23:45,800 --> 02:23:48,479
after gcp

2796
02:23:48,479 --> 02:23:50,539
um

2797
02:23:55,500 --> 02:23:58,920
right maybe people log into PC or then

2798
02:23:58,920 --> 02:24:01,100
go

2799
02:24:02,120 --> 02:24:05,960
when they go to that point

2800
02:24:06,240 --> 02:24:08,460
um these are all options so when you

2801
02:24:08,460 --> 02:24:11,599
can't keep on buying boxes

2802
02:24:35,960 --> 02:24:38,460
all right

2803
02:24:38,460 --> 02:24:41,460
foreign

2804
02:25:06,080 --> 02:25:08,700
thank you

2805
02:25:08,700 --> 02:25:10,020

yeah

2807
02:25:40,439 --> 02:25:43,040
the songs

2808
02:25:50,420 --> 02:25:53,280
had a question from Discord a leading

2809
02:25:53,280 --> 02:25:56,160
forensic workstation software and do any

2810
02:25:56,160 --> 02:25:58,140
open source providers have solutions for

2811
02:25:58,140 --> 02:26:00,858
smaller use cases

2812
02:26:03,300 --> 02:26:06,140
the big companies and all

2813
02:26:06,180 --> 02:26:10,380
you know Axiom and case x-rays

2814
02:26:10,380 --> 02:26:12,619
foreign

2815
02:26:37,200 --> 02:26:42,000

2816
02:26:42,000 --> 02:26:43,439

strongest

your enemy will not attack you where

3292
04:31:51,659 --> 04:31:55,039
you're strongest who believes

3293
04:32:01,020 --> 04:32:04,199
right so today

additional things you need to know about

3300
04:34:00,419 --> 04:34:02,820
me my boss likes refers me as a recovery

3301
04:34:02,820 --> 04:34:04,320
pin tester

3302
04:34:04,320 --> 04:34:05,879
the fact of the matter is I have yet to

3303
04:34:05,879 --> 04:34:08,458
recover so that also flavors

3304
04:34:08,458 --> 04:34:10,699
from the perspective

3305
04:34:10,699 --> 04:34:13,020
lastly everything I'm about to tell you

3306
04:34:13,020 --> 04:34:15,840
is based on real world firsthand

3307
04:34:15,840 --> 04:34:17,219
experience these are things I have

3308
04:34:17,219 --> 04:34:19,500
stepped through in the last couple years

3309
04:34:19,500 --> 04:34:22,618
of my professional life so everything is

3310
04:34:22,618 --> 04:34:24,299
real everything is true everything is

3311
04:34:24,299 --> 04:34:25,500
firsthand

3312
04:34:25,500 --> 04:34:27,778
I cannot speak necessarily to the

3313
04:34:27,778 --> 04:34:30,299
statistical validity of my personal

3314
04:34:30,299 --> 04:34:34,438
experience but I can speak to them

3315
04:34:34,438 --> 04:34:36,840
this all actually happened and

3316
04:34:36,840 --> 04:34:38,219
everything I'm about to share with you

3317
04:34:38,219 --> 04:34:39,840
is real and how much because I've

3318
04:34:39,840 --> 04:34:42,061
responded to somewhere around 1820 I've

3319
04:34:42,061 --> 04:34:43,500
been to the technical lead on somewhere

3320
04:34:43,500 --> 04:34:45,180
on 18 to 20 significant incidents in the

3321
04:34:45,180 --> 04:34:46,320
last period

3322
04:34:46,320 --> 04:34:48,359
that feels like a lot sounds like this

3323
04:34:48,359 --> 04:34:49,458
moment

3324
04:34:49,458 --> 04:34:53,419
with me I also really hate talking

3325
04:34:53,419 --> 04:34:55,379
so even if you're not listening just

3326
04:34:55,379 --> 04:34:56,520
click this once in a while it makes me

3327
04:34:56,520 --> 04:34:58,500
feel better and if you think I said

3328
04:34:58,500 --> 04:35:00,118
something that I think was funny just go

3329
04:35:00,118 --> 04:35:02,239
ahead

3330
04:35:04,919 --> 04:35:06,900
before we jump in one more one more

3331
04:35:06,900 --> 04:35:09,320
caveat

3332
04:35:09,660 --> 04:35:12,180
every talk that anyone gives here is

3333
04:35:12,180 --> 04:35:14,099
built on a handful of present positions

3334
04:35:14,099 --> 04:35:15,660
once again I want to scare those in the

3335
04:35:15,660 --> 04:35:17,278
face and just be honest with you about

3336
04:35:17,278 --> 04:35:20,219
my Approach

3337
04:35:20,219 --> 04:35:21,958
please don't be insulted and offended at

3338
04:35:21,958 --> 04:35:23,660
work

3339
04:35:23,660 --> 04:35:26,580
people in positions in your roles

3340
04:35:26,580 --> 04:35:28,020
it's always good when somebody leads

3341
04:35:28,020 --> 04:35:30,141
them

3342
04:35:32,299 --> 04:35:34,799
in many instances I feel like we focus

3343
04:35:34,799 --> 04:35:36,539
on wrong things

3344
04:35:36,539 --> 04:35:38,759
at the wrong time

3345
04:35:38,759 --> 04:35:40,438
once again from a tactical perspective

3346
04:35:40,438 --> 04:35:42,118
after the scuff hits the fan Things

3347
04:35:42,118 --> 04:35:44,938
become really clear what's important

3348
04:35:44,938 --> 04:35:46,740
right here and right now becomes really

3349
04:35:46,740 --> 04:35:49,259
clear so my challenge today is to

3350
04:35:49,259 --> 04:35:50,820
disrupt your Paradigm just a little bit

3351
04:35:50,820 --> 04:35:54,240
to get you to maybe shift your focus a

3352
04:35:54,240 --> 04:35:55,379
tiny

3353
04:35:55,379 --> 04:35:57,660
so the hyperbolic component of this is I

3354
04:35:57,660 --> 04:35:59,340
am going to use some outliers I'm going

3355
04:35:59,340 --> 04:36:00,900
I'm not going to exaggerate the other

3356
04:36:00,900 --> 04:36:03,480
truth but I am going to draw on

3357
04:36:03,480 --> 04:36:06,240
outlets on Extreme examples to say to

3358
04:36:06,240 --> 04:36:08,759
you this is significant

3359
04:36:08,759 --> 04:36:11,039
the second piece is your

3360
04:36:11,039 --> 04:36:13,879
hate everything

3361
04:36:16,379 --> 04:36:18,480
unfortunately that wasn't a joke but I

3362
04:36:18,480 --> 04:36:21,000
appreciate it you do

3363
04:36:21,000 --> 04:36:22,799
and I mean you're in the general sense I

3364
04:36:22,799 --> 04:36:24,599
do too that's just I think that's part

3365
04:36:24,599 --> 04:36:25,740
of what makes us good at cyber security

3366
04:36:25,740 --> 04:36:27,299
that's part of what makes us confidence

3367
04:36:27,299 --> 04:36:29,340
so I'm gonna work really hard to keep

3368
04:36:29,340 --> 04:36:30,500
simple

3369
04:36:30,500 --> 04:36:32,400
I think it's important that you

3370
04:36:32,400 --> 04:36:35,039
recognize that propensity maybe that is

3371
04:36:35,039 --> 04:36:38,180
not a propensity but it

3372
04:36:41,061 --> 04:36:43,980
lastly I'm gonna generalize your

3373
04:36:43,980 --> 04:36:45,719
business is a snowfall

3374
04:36:45,719 --> 04:36:48,379
it just is

3375
04:36:48,660 --> 04:36:51,299
at the same time every snowflake has a

3376
04:36:51,299 --> 04:36:53,718
lot in common

3377
04:36:54,061 --> 04:36:55,141
so I'm gonna focus on those

3378
04:36:55,141 --> 04:36:56,699
commonalities and I'm gonna expect you

3379
04:36:56,699 --> 04:36:57,900
if you're willing to then take this

3380
04:36:57,900 --> 04:36:59,400
information and apply it to your

3381
04:36:59,400 --> 04:37:01,879
snowflake

3382
04:37:02,458 --> 04:37:05,419
you still Mighty quiet

3383
04:37:09,379 --> 04:37:11,879
so why are we here why are we talking

3384
04:37:11,879 --> 04:37:13,740
about this now

3385
04:37:13,740 --> 04:37:16,438
I know it's not obvious but I'm old

3386
04:37:16,438 --> 04:37:19,379
and I've literally been through

3387
04:37:19,379 --> 04:37:20,759
this conversation

3388
04:37:20,759 --> 04:37:23,160
this is an oversimplified

3389
04:37:23,160 --> 04:37:25,561
partially accurate history of cyber

3390
04:37:25,561 --> 04:37:26,641
security

3391
04:37:26,641 --> 04:37:28,740
from the way I seen it and experience it

3392
04:37:28,740 --> 04:37:30,778
wasn't that long ago

3393
04:37:30,778 --> 04:37:32,039
where we thought better worlds are

3394
04:37:32,039 --> 04:37:34,400
optional

3395
04:37:34,799 --> 04:37:36,118
anybody old enough to remember that you

3396
04:37:36,118 --> 04:37:37,379
don't have

3397
04:37:37,379 --> 04:37:39,719
I see someone

3398
04:37:39,719 --> 04:37:42,000
for real I remember the first time I

3399
04:37:42,000 --> 04:37:46,259
installed antivirus everything

3400
04:37:50,359 --> 04:37:52,618
patching applying critical security

3401
04:37:52,618 --> 04:37:57,199
updates we should probably do that

3402
04:37:57,240 --> 04:37:59,520
my point here is that we are

3403
04:37:59,520 --> 04:38:02,340
legitimately making progress on

3404
04:38:02,340 --> 04:38:03,599
glad

3405
04:38:03,599 --> 04:38:05,759
we're having this conversation right

3406
04:38:05,759 --> 04:38:07,080
here and right now if you're not if you

3407
04:38:07,080 --> 04:38:08,039
don't have a firewall then just get up

3408
04:38:08,039 --> 04:38:09,778
and leave right now you're not doing

3409
04:38:09,778 --> 04:38:12,061
some of these currently new issues of

3410
04:38:12,061 --> 04:38:13,320
concern

3411
04:38:13,320 --> 04:38:15,419
but at the same time again

3412
04:38:15,419 --> 04:38:19,320
I'm glad for your talk today about an

3413
04:38:19,320 --> 04:38:21,599
iot or unmanaged system strategy that's

3414
04:38:21,599 --> 04:38:25,759
progress to me are you with me

3415
04:38:28,141 --> 04:38:29,820
I want to remind you that the Internet

3416
04:38:29,820 --> 04:38:33,079
of Things is not new

3417
04:38:33,778 --> 04:38:35,099
it's not new

3418
04:38:35,099 --> 04:38:37,980
it is however growing

3419
04:38:37,980 --> 04:38:39,561
Carnegie Mellon

3420
04:38:39,561 --> 04:38:43,580
1982 First Internet of Things

3421
04:38:45,359 --> 04:38:47,580
been around for a long long time been a

3422
04:38:47,580 --> 04:38:49,919
concern and or a problem for a long long

3423
04:38:49,919 --> 04:38:52,141
time and I can throw up somewhat of a

3424
04:38:52,141 --> 04:38:54,778
hyperbolic use yes this is real we

3425
04:38:54,778 --> 04:38:57,180
engage with the hospital organization

3426
04:38:57,180 --> 04:38:59,400
in this past year and

3427
04:38:59,400 --> 04:39:02,759
one of the things we do is do an asset

3428
04:39:02,759 --> 04:39:04,740
inventory we do a discovery what is in

3429
04:39:04,740 --> 04:39:05,699
your environment I'm an important

3430
04:39:05,699 --> 04:39:07,919
question when you're in the middle of

3431
04:39:07,919 --> 04:39:09,299
really bad things happening throughout

3432
04:39:09,299 --> 04:39:10,680
your environment so one of the things we

3433
04:39:10,680 --> 04:39:12,419
do is try and get disability quickly

3434
04:39:12,419 --> 04:39:14,400
accurately and active

3435
04:39:14,400 --> 04:39:16,500
ly and this is again a real world

3436
04:39:16,500 --> 04:39:19,438
scenario with a modern sized hospital

3437
04:39:19,438 --> 04:39:21,240
they had about five to six thousand

3438
04:39:21,240 --> 04:39:24,539
overall hosts and doing active asset

3439
04:39:24,539 --> 04:39:26,458
enumeration in that environment as you

3440
04:39:26,458 --> 04:39:28,919
can see

3441
04:39:28,919 --> 04:39:31,618
it had a lot of window systems

3442
04:39:31,618 --> 04:39:33,299
tiny

3443
04:39:33,299 --> 04:39:37,860
submission of Linux systems and then

3444
04:39:37,860 --> 04:39:39,840
the mathematicians I mean you will note

3445
04:39:39,840 --> 04:39:43,500
that other cameras

3446
04:39:43,500 --> 04:39:47,400
more than 50 of the active systems in

3447
04:39:47,400 --> 04:39:50,100
their environment that is huge everyone

3448
04:39:50,100 --> 04:39:52,080
with more Lane could be honestly again

3449
04:39:52,080 --> 04:39:55,920
Healthcare is weird and they involved in

3450
04:39:55,920 --> 04:39:57,780
healthcare

3451
04:39:57,780 --> 04:39:58,980
I'm sorry

3452
04:39:58,980 --> 04:40:01,620
memory player a lot of my examples come

3453
04:40:01,620 --> 04:40:03,420
from Healthcare I love working in

3454
04:40:03,420 --> 04:40:04,440
healthcare space because it feels

3455
04:40:04,440 --> 04:40:06,180
altruistic yeah it's the opportunity to

3456
04:40:06,180 --> 04:40:08,700
help people for real but it's also

3457
04:40:08,700 --> 04:40:11,660
gigantic mess

3458
04:40:11,700 --> 04:40:14,040
this is huge this may be somewhat a

3459
04:40:14,040 --> 04:40:16,140
typical but every single business I'll

3460
04:40:16,140 --> 04:40:20,059
show you a uh

3461
04:40:20,780 --> 04:40:23,520
screenshot of asset discovery on my home

3462
04:40:23,520 --> 04:40:25,580
network

3463
04:40:25,580 --> 04:40:28,760
the percentages

3464
04:40:28,760 --> 04:40:31,440
I have a few Windows systems and then

3465
04:40:31,440 --> 04:40:33,298
all these other things

3466
04:40:33,298 --> 04:40:37,160
light bulb is attached to the network

3467
04:40:38,700 --> 04:40:41,218
before we talk about what I mean by

3468
04:40:41,218 --> 04:40:42,740
unmanaged let's talk about

3469
04:40:42,740 --> 04:40:45,360
and then remember this slide remember

3470
04:40:45,360 --> 04:40:48,718
the 43 to 50 that's huge this is

3471
04:40:48,718 --> 04:40:51,240
important this is not peripheral

3472
04:40:51,240 --> 04:40:54,120
this is simple this is half of the

3473
04:40:54,120 --> 04:40:56,718
network environment

3474
04:40:58,920 --> 04:41:00,360
you say to people manage systems and

3475
04:41:00,360 --> 04:41:01,378
they go yeah

3476
04:41:01,378 --> 04:41:04,520
I know what you mean

3477
04:41:04,860 --> 04:41:07,798
they're part of our security stack

3478
04:41:07,798 --> 04:41:09,840
hopefully you go through this process

3479
04:41:09,840 --> 04:41:11,580
hopefully you're in

3480
04:41:11,580 --> 04:41:13,560
volved in security preview before

3481
04:41:13,560 --> 04:41:15,780
purchase I hope

3482
04:41:15,780 --> 04:41:17,160
maybe not but hopefully you are

3483
04:41:17,160 --> 04:41:18,958
hopefully as a normal part of

3484
04:41:18,958 --> 04:41:21,859
procurement and

3485
04:41:22,138 --> 04:41:23,700
implementation you go through asset

3486
04:41:23,700 --> 04:41:24,780
tracking and you go for change

3487
04:41:24,780 --> 04:41:27,240
management and as part of that process

3488
04:41:27,240 --> 04:41:30,060
with previously referring steps you

3489
04:41:30,060 --> 04:41:31,500
harden the operating system you change

3490
04:41:31,500 --> 04:41:34,440
out the off credit you apply patches

3491
04:41:34,440 --> 04:41:36,420
you implement and incorporate into your

3492
04:41:36,420 --> 04:41:39,060
Management Systems your detection and

3493
04:41:39,060 --> 04:41:41,900
prevention systems

3494
04:41:42,420 --> 04:41:44,340
you incorporate visibility centralized

3495
04:41:44,340 --> 04:41:46,020
authentication all the things all this

3496
04:41:46,020 --> 04:41:46,680
stuff

3497
04:41:46,680 --> 04:41:48,120
importance you're doing all of this

3498
04:41:48,120 --> 04:41:51,240
right yeah you you probably are

3499
04:41:51,240 --> 04:41:52,740
for the most part

3500
04:41:52,740 --> 04:41:54,660
exceptions every rule but this is your

3501
04:41:54,660 --> 04:41:57,378
secures deck

3502
04:41:59,100 --> 04:42:02,400
before I further Define unmanned I just

3503
04:42:02,400 --> 04:42:04,440
want to tell you a quick story about the

3504
04:42:04,440 --> 04:42:06,660
importance of words talk about semantics

3505
04:42:06,660 --> 04:42:09,180
ever so ridiculously not some men Tech

3506
04:42:09,180 --> 04:42:11,160
semantic it's part of let's say it in

3507
04:42:11,160 --> 04:42:12,180
any case

3508
04:42:12,180 --> 04:42:15,360
words engage in a clinical environment

3509
04:42:15,360 --> 04:42:17,940
not that long ago okay maybe it was a

3510
04:42:17,940 --> 04:42:19,200
long time ago we were talking about

3511
04:42:19,200 --> 04:42:21,420
watercraft so it's been a few years but

3512
04:42:21,420 --> 04:42:22,138
just

3513
04:42:22,138 --> 04:42:23,940
this is a big deal specifically in

3514
04:42:23,940 --> 04:42:25,680
healthcare and talk about the

3515
04:42:25,680 --> 04:42:28,138
quintessential unmanaged systems we're

3516
04:42:28,138 --> 04:42:29,700
talking about everything in a hospital

3517
04:42:29,700 --> 04:42:31,740
it's plugged into the network and thank

3518
04:42:31,740 --> 04:42:34,440
you FDA it's probably not passionate it

3519
04:42:34,440 --> 04:42:35,520
probably doesn't have AV and it's

3520
04:42:35,520 --> 04:42:37,080
probably wondering

3521
04:42:37,080 --> 04:42:40,440
p and it sucks to be you in any case I

3522
04:42:40,440 --> 04:42:43,020
digress I'm engaged with clinical I.T

3523
04:42:43,020 --> 04:42:45,480
and biomed I feel really bad for those

3524
04:42:45,480 --> 04:42:46,860
people they actually have to use

3525
04:42:46,860 --> 04:42:49,860
technology and intersect with actual

3526
04:42:49,860 --> 04:42:52,138
human beings

3527
04:42:52,138 --> 04:42:53,520
anymore

3528
04:42:53,520 --> 04:42:55,680
in most cases they're trying to help

3529
04:42:55,680 --> 04:42:57,120
those people sometimes it's life and

3530
04:42:57,120 --> 04:42:59,218
death I'd like to rely on your Windows

3531
04:42:59,218 --> 04:43:01,320
XP machine they'll liken that situation

3532
04:43:01,320 --> 04:43:03,000
equipment

3533
04:43:03,000 --> 04:43:04,920
so I'm talking about this awful thing

3534
04:43:04,920 --> 04:43:05,878
called

3535
04:43:05,878 --> 04:43:08,840
ransomware

3536
04:43:08,940 --> 04:43:12,060
and as naive as I was at the time I may

3537
04:43:12,060 --> 04:43:13,740
have mentioned unauthenticated low code

3538
04:43:13,740 --> 04:43:14,820
execution

3539
04:43:14,820 --> 04:43:16,320
and wondered why they all looked at me

3540
04:43:16,320 --> 04:43:18,000
like

3541
04:43:18,000 --> 04:43:20,218
I've been on eloquently

3542
04:43:20,218 --> 04:43:22,080
describe the value of this new cool

3543
04:43:22,080 --> 04:43:24,680
thing called

3544
04:43:26,780 --> 04:43:30,298
if unprecedented disability into running

3545
04:43:30,298 --> 04:43:31,980
process and memory

3546
04:43:31,980 --> 04:43:33,840
can I please install it on electrical

3547
04:43:33,840 --> 04:43:36,320
workstations

3548
04:43:37,820 --> 04:43:40,138
they literally accused me of trying to

3549
04:43:40,138 --> 04:43:41,638
kill people

3550
04:43:41,638 --> 04:43:43,320
you are endangering the lives of our

3551
04:43:43,320 --> 04:43:45,360
patients

3552
04:43:45,360 --> 04:43:46,740
whoa

3553
04:43:46,740 --> 04:43:49,440
did not see that one coming Iris

3554
04:43:49,440 --> 04:43:51,240
bonded with boys and professionalism

3555
04:43:51,240 --> 04:43:53,100
would say how dare you accuse me of

3556
04:43:53,100 --> 04:43:54,240
trying to kill people and then it

3557
04:43:54,240 --> 04:43:55,620
evolved from there

3558
04:43:55,620 --> 04:43:58,100
I met with my boss not long after great

3559
04:43:58,100 --> 04:44:00,718
guys Super Wise he had this way of

3560
04:44:00,718 --> 04:44:03,298
looking at you like

3561
04:44:03,298 --> 04:44:06,260
you didn't have to say anything

3562
04:44:06,540 --> 04:44:08,580
he said to me maybe you want to use

3563
04:44:08,580 --> 04:44:11,120
different words

3564
04:44:12,718 --> 04:44:13,740
I think I may have been a little

3565
04:44:13,740 --> 04:44:15,320
offended to that much

3566
04:44:15,320 --> 04:44:18,600
I mean rce remote code execution

3567
04:44:18,600 --> 04:44:21,900
everybody knows that

3568
04:44:21,900 --> 04:44:25,440
next month 30 days later 30.

3569
04:44:25,440 --> 04:44:27,360
work with me here

3570
04:44:27,360 --> 04:44:29,100
two days later I met with that exact

3571
04:44:29,100 --> 04:44:31,458
same group of people

3572
04:44:31,458 --> 04:44:33,660
down and listen to the advice of my boss

3573
04:44:33,660 --> 04:44:36,360
and I walked into that same meeting that

3574
04:44:36,360 --> 04:44:38,100
would be okay if we installed our

3575
04:44:38,100 --> 04:44:42,138
next-gen antivirus I said

3576
04:44:47,600 --> 04:44:51,120
ours was they had it on their own PCS we

3577
04:44:51,120 --> 04:44:52,200
had

3578
04:44:52,200 --> 04:44:53,820
actually we discovered not long after

3579
04:44:53,820 --> 04:44:55,860
the the clinical Ice Cube biomed some of

3580
04:44:55,860 --> 04:44:57,780
the bottoman people who are talking come

3581
04:44:57,780 --> 04:45:00,000
on downloading ABG free and installing

3582
04:45:00,000 --> 04:45:01,740
on the Windows XP machines because they

3583
04:45:01,740 --> 04:45:02,940
thought that would probably be a good

3584
04:45:02,940 --> 04:45:04,798
idea

3585
04:45:04,798 --> 04:45:07,138
my overarching point again is the words

3586
04:45:07,138 --> 04:45:09,440
that you choose and use are important

3587
04:45:09,440 --> 04:45:12,000
and once again as a practitioner I am

3588
04:45:12,000 --> 04:45:13,680
concerned about the outcome

3589
04:45:13,680 --> 04:45:16,878
when I get over 100 feet

3590
04:45:16,980 --> 04:45:19,620
so I don't care what you call

3591
04:45:19,620 --> 04:45:21,600
I have had significant debate multiple

3592
04:45:21,600 --> 04:45:23,760
csos about the words on the slide I

3593
04:45:23,760 --> 04:45:25,440
don't care

3594
04:45:25,440 --> 04:45:27,900
you shouldn't you

3595
04:45:27,900 --> 04:45:29,718
what is important that's two things

3596
04:45:29,718 --> 04:45:31,980
unmanaged systems

3597
04:45:31,980 --> 04:45:33,600
ask me why I put systems first because

3598
04:45:33,600 --> 04:45:35,400
it is the second word

3599
04:45:35,400 --> 04:45:38,940
so what systems is simple

3600
04:45:38,940 --> 04:45:40,920
it's not a network that it's running and

3601
04:45:40,920 --> 04:45:42,360
operates

3602
04:45:42,360 --> 04:45:46,040
you with me straight up

3603
04:45:48,060 --> 04:45:50,400
he just means it falls outside of the

3604
04:45:50,400 --> 04:45:52,378
scope of your security stack

3605
04:45:52,378 --> 04:45:54,120
some

3606
04:45:54,120 --> 04:45:57,000
I don't know yeah I don't care is it

3607
04:45:57,000 --> 04:45:59,480
exposed

3608
04:45:59,700 --> 04:46:01,620
plugged into the network

3609
04:46:01,620 --> 04:46:04,440
from an operating system and my

3610
04:46:04,440 --> 04:46:06,298
perspective that is unmanaged system

3611
04:46:06,298 --> 04:46:07,500
we're going to talk with a little more

3612
04:46:07,500 --> 04:46:08,940
granularity about what I need and how we

3613
04:46:08,940 --> 04:46:12,420
approach that momentarily

3614
04:46:15,840 --> 04:46:18,420
I want you to know that this is real

3615
04:46:18,420 --> 04:46:20,160
that I'm just not up here spouting

3616
04:46:20,160 --> 04:46:23,160
hyperbolic

3617
04:46:25,560 --> 04:46:28,500
this is this is Roost off and so

3618
04:46:28,500 --> 04:46:30,180
get real number one two

3619
04:46:30,180 --> 04:46:31,680
we're gonna have three interjections in

3620
04:46:31,680 --> 04:46:33,480
here that are in real world exposes

3621
04:46:33,480 --> 04:46:35,040
include what I have experienced this

3622
04:46:35,040 --> 04:46:37,020
past year and this one in particular was

3623
04:46:37,020 --> 04:46:37,980
rough

3624
04:46:37,980 --> 04:46:39,420
this is one of the most challenging

3625
04:46:39,420 --> 04:46:40,980
investigations I've ever been involved

3626
04:46:40,980 --> 04:46:42,980
in

3627
04:46:42,980 --> 04:46:46,200
not least because they've engaged in all

3628
04:46:46,200 --> 04:46:48,840
IR for her they should have called us

3629
04:46:48,840 --> 04:46:50,580
first no I'm just gonna they were a very

3630
04:46:50,580 --> 04:46:52,320
capable firm they were just overwhelmed

3631
04:46:52,320 --> 04:46:54,000
it was a global Enterprise They had

3632
04:46:54,000 --> 04:46:56,780
physical locations all over the world

3633
04:46:56,780 --> 04:46:58,980
dozens of countries hundreds of

3634
04:46:58,980 --> 04:47:01,020
locations bad things

3635
04:47:01,020 --> 04:47:03,600
happen they went through the initial

3636
04:47:03,600 --> 04:47:05,400
containment process and the threat

3637
04:47:05,400 --> 04:47:08,280
actors kept coming back

3638
04:47:08,280 --> 04:47:10,260
kept finding new indicators and new

3639
04:47:10,260 --> 04:47:12,298
alarms and new alerts and I roll in

3640
04:47:12,298 --> 04:47:13,740
because this is just part of my

3641
04:47:13,740 --> 04:47:16,320
simplified approach

3642
04:47:16,320 --> 04:47:17,820
and I want to talk about two things

3643
04:47:17,820 --> 04:47:18,840
right now again I want to talk about

3644
04:47:18,840 --> 04:47:20,160
egress

3645
04:47:20,160 --> 04:47:22,080
outbound internet and I want to talk

3646
04:47:22,080 --> 04:47:23,340
about Authentication

3647
04:47:23,340 --> 04:47:25,138
in an IR perspective because if we can

3648
04:47:25,138 --> 04:47:26,520
take control

3649
04:47:26,520 --> 04:47:28,320
those two things we have a Fighting

3650
04:47:28,320 --> 04:47:30,240
Chance containing the threat after

3651
04:47:30,240 --> 04:47:32,700
catching our breath

3652
04:47:32,700 --> 04:47:34,138
evicting

3653
04:47:34,138 --> 04:47:36,420
and winning the day so I'm new to the

3654
04:47:36,420 --> 04:47:37,378
conversation they've been working on

3655
04:47:37,378 --> 04:47:38,580
this for a while I come and say let's

3656
04:47:38,580 --> 04:47:40,260
talk about egress

3657
04:47:40,260 --> 04:47:42,000
and Authentication

3658
04:47:42,000 --> 04:47:44,820
and I legitimately as I like them all

3659
04:47:44,820 --> 04:47:47,580
that's too simple that's fine humor me

3660
04:47:47,580 --> 04:47:49,138
and then we can start talking about

3661
04:47:49,138 --> 04:47:51,420
egress and we realize okay this is

3662
04:47:51,420 --> 04:47:53,458
ability they have distributed internet

3663
04:47:53,458 --> 04:47:55,080
in hundreds of places around the world

3664
04:47:55,080 --> 04:47:57,660
with no centralized management

3665
04:47:57,660 --> 04:48:00,000
let's forget address for just a minute

3666
04:48:00,000 --> 04:48:02,638
how about authentication and I say but

3667
04:48:02,638 --> 04:48:06,120
we've already reset all passwords

3668
04:48:06,120 --> 04:48:08,760
all of them yep

3669
04:48:08,760 --> 04:48:11,040
I'm talking to very capable Folk

3670
04:48:11,040 --> 04:48:12,540
I'm talking to

3671
04:48:12,540 --> 04:48:15,680
very intelligent security

3672
04:48:16,740 --> 04:48:18,900
pop store around the corner you reset

3673
04:48:18,900 --> 04:48:21,860
all of the passwords

3674
04:48:22,798 --> 04:48:24,660
no

3675
04:48:24,660 --> 04:48:27,500
so what we found after

3676
04:48:27,500 --> 04:48:30,780
Monumental manual analysis there's a

3677
04:48:30,780 --> 04:48:33,120
final iteration right there was that the

3678
04:48:33,120 --> 04:48:35,218
three actors they had reset all accurate

3679
04:48:35,218 --> 04:48:36,718
free passwords

3680
04:48:36,718 --> 04:48:39,660
sweet that's a really good start is

3681
04:48:39,660 --> 04:48:43,798
everything in your environment yes

3682
04:48:47,040 --> 04:48:49,920
I told the print actor popped default

3683
04:48:49,920 --> 04:48:52,440
creds on a bunch of Nas devices all of

3684
04:48:52,440 --> 04:48:53,340
course

3685
04:48:53,340 --> 04:48:55,440
to run Linux in the background and had a

3686
04:48:55,440 --> 04:48:57,718
heyday they moved laterally throughout

3687
04:48:57,718 --> 04:48:58,980
that environment

3688
04:48:58,980 --> 04:49:02,040
I suspect admin admin or something along

3689
04:49:02,040 --> 04:49:03,240
those lines I don't actually know I

3690
04:49:03,240 --> 04:49:04,740
didn't have that visibility it was

3691
04:49:04,740 --> 04:49:07,440
brutal they literally had to go one by

3692
04:49:07,440 --> 04:49:08,340
one

3693
04:49:08,340 --> 04:49:10,560
route this distributed Enterprise and

3694
04:49:10,560 --> 04:49:13,020
many enumerate all these

3695
04:49:13,020 --> 04:49:15,180
places and where else did they go to

3696
04:49:15,180 --> 04:49:17,100
this day I'm not sure

3697
04:49:17,100 --> 04:49:20,298
but they have no disability

3698
04:49:21,780 --> 04:49:24,440
big deal

3699
04:49:26,400 --> 04:49:28,200
this is one of a pair of shippers if

3700
04:49:28,200 --> 04:49:29,400
you're not familiar with the idea of

3701
04:49:29,400 --> 04:49:31,920
inattentional blindness you are now that

3702
04:49:31,920 --> 04:49:34,138
means looking at the wrong thing

3703
04:49:34,138 --> 04:49:36,060
and if you're a human being which I

3704
04:49:36,060 --> 04:49:38,638
think most of you are

3705
04:49:38,638 --> 04:49:41,780
the exception

3706
04:49:42,660 --> 04:49:44,700
you're focusing on the darn near

3707
04:49:44,700 --> 04:49:46,680
straight that you've drawn you're

3708
04:49:46,680 --> 04:49:48,420
focusing on your cards and if you're not

3709
04:49:48,420 --> 04:49:49,920
careful you don't notice something's

3710
04:49:49,920 --> 04:49:52,638
wrong with the four

3711
04:49:53,400 --> 04:49:54,900
and when I roll into an investigation

3712
04:49:54,900 --> 04:49:56,458
that last example was pretty normal I

3713
04:49:56,458 --> 04:50:00,138
say tell me about your environment

3714
04:50:00,360 --> 04:50:02,520
tell me about their managed systems they

3715
04:50:02,520 --> 04:50:04,020
tell me about the application of their

3716
04:50:04,020 --> 04:50:05,458
security stack and they they're very

3717
04:50:05,458 --> 04:50:08,540
proud of it and I'm glad for them

3718
04:50:08,540 --> 04:50:11,660
and then they often completely neglect

3719
04:50:11,660 --> 04:50:14,400
all the other things so it's really

3720
04:50:14,400 --> 04:50:16,138
important you remember the slide I put

3721
04:50:16,138 --> 04:50:18,060
it in twice just for fun

3722
04:50:18,060 --> 04:50:20,638
this is a big deal this is not a tiny

3723
04:50:20,638 --> 04:50:22,080
portion of your environment it's not a

3724
04:50:22,080 --> 04:50:26,120
side note especially if you're not there

3725
04:50:28,138 --> 04:50:30,780
unmanaged systems on the network

3726
04:50:30,780 --> 04:50:32,878
running an operating system

3727
04:50:32,878 --> 04:50:34,680
outside of the scope some are all of

3728
04:50:34,680 --> 04:50:37,020
your security staff

3729
04:50:37,020 --> 04:50:38,718
what are they

3730
04:50:38,718 --> 04:50:42,420
let's go on and on and on and on

3731
04:50:42,420 --> 04:50:44,820
microcomputers are my favorite amongst

3732
04:50:44,820 --> 04:50:46,020
them

3733
04:50:46,020 --> 04:50:48,000
by the way although I'm not speaking

3734
04:50:48,000 --> 04:50:51,000
directly to you off SEC folks

3735
04:50:51,000 --> 04:50:52,980
there's so many opportunities here from

3736
04:50:52,980 --> 04:50:55,160
a 10 best renting perspective

3737
04:50:55,160 --> 04:50:59,600
just keep that in mind moving forward

3738
04:51:00,060 --> 04:51:01,560
what are they where are they these are

3739
04:51:01,560 --> 04:51:03,718
again real world campus most of them

3740
04:51:03,718 --> 04:51:05,520
won't surprise you you could rattle off

3741
04:51:05,520 --> 04:51:07,680
this list it won't surprise you that

3742
04:51:07,680 --> 04:51:09,180
some of the debt Department plugged in a

3743
04:51:09,180 --> 04:51:12,540
switch under the desk that shock anyone

3744
04:51:12,540 --> 04:51:14,700
well it's surprise you that an

3745
04:51:14,700 --> 04:51:15,958
Enterprise environment and you do an

3746
04:51:15,958 --> 04:51:17,040
active scan you find a bunch of

3747
04:51:17,040 --> 04:51:18,240
raspberry pies wait you don't have

3748
04:51:18,240 --> 04:51:20,400
raspberry pies yes you do

3749
04:51:20,400 --> 04:51:23,700
branded and relabeled in a quarter box

3750
04:51:23,700 --> 04:51:26,520
[Music]

3751
04:51:26,520 --> 04:51:30,000
es conference room systems

3752
04:51:30,000 --> 04:51:33,000
option

3753
04:51:33,000 --> 04:51:34,980
yeah I mean aquariums talk about

3754
04:51:34,980 --> 04:51:37,579
Healthcare

3755
04:51:38,760 --> 04:51:40,680
is plugged into the network and I'm not

3756
04:51:40,680 --> 04:51:42,660
kidding and then from there all the

3757
04:51:42,660 --> 04:51:44,280
things that you all have from HVAC to

3758
04:51:44,280 --> 04:51:45,780
physical security systems to who has

3759
04:51:45,780 --> 04:51:48,620
surveillance cameras

3760
04:51:52,040 --> 04:51:54,900
who uses prayers

3761
04:51:54,900 --> 04:51:57,320
mark

3762
04:52:00,360 --> 04:52:02,540
um back to the rce conversation

3763
04:52:02,540 --> 04:52:05,780
to the news

3764
04:52:06,320 --> 04:52:09,360
tablets phones oh no you get it lots and

3765
04:52:09,360 --> 04:52:10,860
lots of stuff

3766
04:52:10,860 --> 04:52:12,360
where are they I've started on the slide

3767
04:52:12,360 --> 04:52:14,100
where are they because they're all over

3768
04:52:14,100 --> 04:52:15,120
the place

3769
04:52:15,120 --> 04:52:19,560
literally above the door next door under

3770
04:52:19,560 --> 04:52:23,420
the desk in people's pockets

3771
04:52:24,860 --> 04:52:27,900
challenge number one

3772
04:52:27,900 --> 04:52:31,500
we now have a thorough understanding

3773
04:52:31,500 --> 04:52:33,240
what the heck we're talking about when I

3774
04:52:33,240 --> 04:52:34,920
say unmanaged systems what are we going

3775
04:52:34,920 --> 04:52:37,260
to do about it remembering that there's

3776
04:52:37,260 --> 04:52:39,000
some attack on perspective this is stuff

3777
04:52:39,000 --> 04:52:40,378
that we can do

3778
04:52:40,378 --> 04:52:42,180
pretty quickly and pretty easily from my

3779
04:52:42,180 --> 04:52:44,340
perspective

3780
04:52:44,340 --> 04:52:47,718
number one is we're gonna find them

3781
04:52:48,378 --> 04:52:52,080
top of your most thrilling list right

3782
04:52:52,080 --> 04:52:54,600
so so important

3783
04:52:54,600 --> 04:52:57,540
sounds great it sounds sort of lame to

3784
04:52:57,540 --> 04:53:00,260
say it if you don't know

3785
04:53:01,378 --> 04:53:03,780
it's the truth

3786
04:53:03,780 --> 04:53:05,400
so you gotta find this stuff and you

3787
04:53:05,400 --> 04:53:08,040
need some sort of active asset

3788
04:53:08,040 --> 04:53:10,680
enumeration I don't care what you use

3789
04:53:10,680 --> 04:53:12,180
if you're on a really strict budget and

3790
04:53:12,180 --> 04:53:13,440
you want to use in math and Target

3791
04:53:13,440 --> 04:53:15,540
specific parts and services and then do

3792
04:53:15,540 --> 04:53:16,980
a running in map

3793
04:53:16,980 --> 04:53:18,480
with in-depth so you can see what

3794
04:53:18,480 --> 04:53:20,520
changed from last week

3795
04:53:20,520 --> 04:53:23,340
go for it you have some budget there are

3796
04:53:23,340 --> 04:53:24,718
lots of solutions

3797
04:53:24,718 --> 04:53:28,100
I used run zero

3798
04:53:29,400 --> 04:53:32,638
we use run zero I like it I don't

3799
04:53:32,638 --> 04:53:34,620
commission I'm just here to say I think

3800
04:53:34,620 --> 04:53:38,160
it's cool if you're unfamiliar you speak

3801
04:53:38,160 --> 04:53:41,900
it's possible I'm an 18 more fanboy

3802
04:53:42,060 --> 04:53:43,500
but it's cool

3803
04:53:43,500 --> 04:53:46,138
and the reason for this screenshot is to

3804
04:53:46,138 --> 04:53:48,600
suggest you need this information you

3805
04:53:48,600 --> 04:53:49,798
need to be armed with the kind of

3806
04:53:49,798 --> 04:53:52,760
information on this screen

3807
04:53:59,700 --> 04:54:01,820
um

3808
04:54:02,280 --> 04:54:04,680
we're gonna talk about some additional

3809
04:54:04,680 --> 04:54:06,540
strategies that are all predicated on

3810
04:54:06,540 --> 04:54:07,860
knowing it's there and knowing at least

3811
04:54:07,860 --> 04:54:10,320
to a certain extent what is it and so we

3812
04:54:10,320 --> 04:54:12,020
want to know things like IP address

3813
04:54:12,020 --> 04:54:16,040
hostname operating system

3814
04:54:16,080 --> 04:54:17,340
runs here will help us go a little

3815
04:54:17,340 --> 04:54:19,500
further and list out supportive

3816
04:54:19,500 --> 04:54:22,200
protocols Services which helps a bunch

3817
04:54:22,200 --> 04:54:23,760
especially if you don't know exactly

3818
04:54:23,760 --> 04:54:25,020
what it is

3819
04:54:25,020 --> 04:54:26,878
Again full featured inventory there's

3820
04:54:26,878 --> 04:54:28,260
some statistical analysis and we'll even

3821
04:54:28,260 --> 04:54:29,280
give you recording on into black

3822
04:54:29,280 --> 04:54:31,980
operating systems

3823
04:54:31,980 --> 04:54:34,020
yeah I think it's cool you don't have to

3824
04:54:34,020 --> 04:54:36,180
use this tool but you need to use a tool

3825
04:54:36,180 --> 04:54:38,100
that you can run on a regular basis for

3826
04:54:38,100 --> 04:54:40,080
consistent visibility because when did

3827
04:54:40,080 --> 04:54:44,120
the plug plug a switch in under his desk

3828
04:54:44,218 --> 04:54:47,958
today and tomorrow

3829
04:54:48,180 --> 04:54:49,798
so number one is we gotta find it again

3830
04:54:49,798 --> 04:54:52,138
I don't care what to use but you need an

3831
04:54:52,138 --> 04:54:55,940
active asset inventory

3832
04:55:04,138 --> 04:55:06,440
foreign

3833
04:55:10,440 --> 04:55:13,440
but of course one more get real story

3834
04:55:13,440 --> 04:55:15,540
number two

3835
04:55:15,540 --> 04:55:17,940
yeah I'm in healthcare again it's been a

3836
04:55:17,940 --> 04:55:19,920
long time in healthcare it's right for

3837
04:55:19,920 --> 04:55:21,240
the picking

3838
04:55:21,240 --> 04:55:23,820
we're actually doing some enumeration of

3839
04:55:23,820 --> 04:55:27,260
a Windows workstations

3840
04:55:30,480 --> 04:55:32,458
a bunch of systems listening on Port 22

3841
04:55:32,458 --> 04:55:35,160
Port 80 and 443

3842
04:55:35,160 --> 04:55:37,560
okay my curiosity's Peak that does not

3843
04:55:37,560 --> 04:55:39,480
sound like a Windows workstation to me

3844
04:55:39,480 --> 04:55:42,420
could be any more 22 maybe listening on

3845
04:55:42,420 --> 04:55:43,440
Windows but

3846
04:55:43,440 --> 04:55:46,680
you do a little additional enumeration

3847
04:55:46,680 --> 04:55:48,718
we discovered that these are Linux based

3848
04:55:48,718 --> 04:55:52,560
label printers medical label printers do

3849
04:55:52,560 --> 04:55:55,320
you know what automatically

3850
04:55:55,320 --> 04:55:57,240
every day

3851
04:55:57,240 --> 04:55:58,740
MRN

3852
04:55:58,740 --> 04:56:01,620
name address sometimes date of birth and

3853
04:56:01,620 --> 04:56:03,000
social security number

3854
04:56:03,000 --> 04:56:05,160
it's the motherboard

3855
04:56:05,160 --> 04:56:07,080
trying to see if we can enumerate

3856
04:56:07,080 --> 04:56:08,580
protective health information from this

3857
04:56:08,580 --> 04:56:10,680
hospital and the unique component in

3858
04:56:10,680 --> 04:56:12,120
this environment

3859
04:56:12,120 --> 04:56:15,020
S have a badass security

3860
04:56:15,020 --> 04:56:17,580
this is a hard place to do Ben test

3861
04:56:17,580 --> 04:56:22,280
printing they've got it all from uh

3862
04:56:22,760 --> 04:56:26,539
secure proxy to

3863
04:56:28,520 --> 04:56:31,020
segmented Network to On and On they can

3864
04:56:31,020 --> 04:56:32,160
check all the boxes in fact they have

3865
04:56:32,160 --> 04:56:33,660
multiple input particular layers on each

3866
04:56:33,660 --> 04:56:35,400
endpoint and it's impressive they've

3867
04:56:35,400 --> 04:56:37,620
worked really hard

3868
04:56:37,620 --> 04:56:39,420
and in this environment we're trying to

3869
04:56:39,420 --> 04:56:42,660
simulate expectation of Phi and we're

3870
04:56:42,660 --> 04:56:44,218
thinking about how are we going to get

3871
04:56:44,218 --> 04:56:46,320
onto these boxes and how are we going to

3872
04:56:46,320 --> 04:56:49,080
avoid EDR in conjunction with ADD it's

3873
04:56:49,080 --> 04:56:50,760
actually going to matter the whole job

3874
04:56:50,760 --> 04:56:52,798
of having them work together which is

3875
04:56:52,798 --> 04:56:54,180
hard to do

3876
04:56:54,180 --> 04:56:56,160
two layers on the endpoint

3877
04:56:56,160 --> 04:56:58,440
and I will tell you again offset folks

3878
04:56:58,440 --> 04:57:01,020
the most consistent way I have found to

3879
04:57:01,020 --> 04:57:04,200
work around customer security stack is

3880
04:57:04,200 --> 04:57:06,000
to operate

3881
04:57:06,000 --> 04:57:09,500
it's not installed

3882
04:57:09,560 --> 04:57:11,878
so we get on that box it turns out it's

3883
04:57:11,878 --> 04:57:14,840
busy box winnings

3884
04:57:18,620 --> 04:57:21,660
medical record printers they cash copies

3885
04:57:21,660 --> 04:57:23,638
of all the printer labels for an

3886
04:57:23,638 --> 04:57:26,218
indeterminate period of time

3887
04:57:26,218 --> 04:57:28,920
we use our lead hacking skills query DNS

3888
04:57:28,920 --> 04:57:32,420
and funnel 7 800 more

3889
04:57:32,760 --> 04:57:34,200
because of course their name would be

3890
04:57:34,200 --> 04:57:36,120
one two three four

3891
04:57:36,120 --> 04:57:38,400
so we hang out on those boxes for just a

3892
04:57:38,400 --> 04:57:40,260
short period of time it's a high

3893
04:57:40,260 --> 04:57:42,120
velocity

3894
04:57:42,120 --> 04:57:43,920
hospital system and each of those

3895
04:57:43,920 --> 04:57:47,400
systems has 50 to 100 pieces of discrete

3896
04:57:47,400 --> 04:57:53,520
Phi every single day times 500. services

3897
04:57:59,638 --> 04:58:03,480
it has full unauthenticated unfiltered

3898
04:58:03,480 --> 04:58:04,500
outbound internet access because

3899
04:58:04,500 --> 04:58:06,080
somebody somewhere

3900
04:58:06,080 --> 04:58:08,400
Runners at some point in time so they

3901
04:58:08,400 --> 04:58:10,320
poke the hole through the process thank

3902
04:58:10,320 --> 04:58:12,680
you very much

3903
04:58:14,040 --> 04:58:16,080
that was a good day and a bad day all at

3904
04:58:16,080 --> 04:58:17,580
the same time

3905
04:58:17,580 --> 04:58:20,280
again another quintessential example of

3906
04:58:20,280 --> 04:58:21,958
an unmanaged system sitting with an

3907
04:58:21,958 --> 04:58:23,100
infinite

3908
04:58:23,100 --> 04:58:26,218
a forest in many ways and shapes

3909
04:58:26,218 --> 04:58:29,040
more to the point it'll help the keys to

3910
04:58:29,040 --> 04:58:31,160
the king

3911
04:58:33,420 --> 04:58:35,638
of the key story

3912
04:58:35,638 --> 04:58:41,000
who cares you're there a great vhi

3913
04:58:43,740 --> 04:58:45,000
number two

3914
04:58:45,000 --> 04:58:47,040
once you do academic

3915
04:58:47,040 --> 04:58:48,360
story and you've learned what you can

3916
04:58:48,360 --> 04:58:50,040
you've identified these devices that are

3917
04:58:50,040 --> 04:58:50,940
next

3918
04:58:50,940 --> 04:58:52,920
opportunity from my perspective just

3919
04:58:52,920 --> 04:58:54,900
prioritization what

3920
04:58:54,900 --> 04:58:58,080
are they and the primary criteria for me

3921
04:58:58,080 --> 04:59:00,600
is the sensitivity of the data and the

3922
04:59:00,600 --> 04:59:02,878
functionality of the device

3923
04:59:02,878 --> 04:59:04,320
we're looking at some Network tab we're

3924
04:59:04,320 --> 04:59:05,458
talking about some Network cache devices

3925
04:59:05,458 --> 04:59:10,699
yesterday the connect via IR port

3926
04:59:12,240 --> 04:59:14,160
Al you use it a proprietorical and it

3927
04:59:14,160 --> 04:59:16,520
contains

3928
04:59:19,320 --> 04:59:21,360
the bottom of the priority list that is

3929
04:59:21,360 --> 04:59:24,240
not important to me versus printer that

3930
04:59:24,240 --> 04:59:27,180
actually houses multiple pieces

3931
04:59:27,180 --> 04:59:29,360
foreign

3932
04:59:32,120 --> 04:59:34,260
function for that business to operate

3933
04:59:34,260 --> 04:59:37,458
these are not just average

3934
04:59:39,780 --> 04:59:42,540
so if I conquer develop criteria based

3935
04:59:42,540 --> 04:59:44,520
on your snowflake and then build that

3936
04:59:44,520 --> 04:59:45,958
turning system if you have not done this

3937
04:59:45,958 --> 04:59:48,600
for other systems you should

3938
04:59:48,600 --> 04:59:51,240
hear zero you're more critical

3939
04:59:51,240 --> 04:59:53,100
unto whatever works for your environment

3940
04:59:53,100 --> 04:59:57,260
well you can't boil the ocean

3941
04:59:57,900 --> 05:00:00,000
I can't even say that but you can't

3942
05:00:00,000 --> 05:00:02,040
right you need to divide a company you

3943
05:00:02,040 --> 05:00:03,840
need to strategize and decide what

3944
05:00:03,840 --> 05:00:06,060
you're going to work on first

3945
05:00:06,060 --> 05:00:08,040
what's most important to your business I

3946
05:00:08,040 --> 05:00:10,980
don't know that again I would suggest

3947
05:00:10,980 --> 05:00:13,860
that you evaluate the nature of

3948
05:00:13,860 --> 05:00:15,360
information nature of data on those

3949
05:00:15,360 --> 05:00:16,798
systems

3950
05:00:16,798 --> 05:00:19,378
and also the functionality again the nas

3951
05:00:19,378 --> 05:00:21,660
was

3952
05:00:21,660 --> 05:00:24,298
exceptionally but had a dark

3953
05:00:24,298 --> 05:00:26,100
full-fledged Linux Pro right out of the

3954
05:00:26,100 --> 05:00:27,718
gate so what could they do with that

3955
05:00:27,718 --> 05:00:30,060
anything they wanted first is again my

3956
05:00:30,060 --> 05:00:31,920
previous example that all it did was

3957
05:00:31,920 --> 05:00:34,638
mess

3958
05:00:38,900 --> 05:00:42,138
step three

3959
05:00:43,138 --> 05:00:46,200
cutting out the stupid credits

3960
05:00:46,200 --> 05:00:48,240
printer

3961
05:00:48,240 --> 05:00:52,040
here we go I guess username

3962
05:00:53,160 --> 05:00:55,218
the password was

3963
05:00:55,218 --> 05:00:57,298
can you believe they didn't even have

3964
05:00:57,298 --> 05:01:00,200
the common decency to spell out password

3965
05:01:00,200 --> 05:01:02,760
it was pass

3966
05:01:02,760 --> 05:01:04,760
Ed

3967
05:01:06,378 --> 05:01:09,420
ironically I almost missed it

3968
05:01:09,420 --> 05:01:10,740
they're like

3969
05:01:10,740 --> 05:01:13,320
are you kidding me right now admin and

3970
05:01:13,320 --> 05:01:15,240
pass thank you very much Nick cat away

3971
05:01:15,240 --> 05:01:16,680
we go

3972
05:01:16,680 --> 05:01:19,080
so again to me if I already won the only

3973
05:01:19,080 --> 05:01:21,000
reason the threat actors bounced in my

3974
05:01:21,000 --> 05:01:22,980
last scenario is because of ease of

3975
05:01:22,980 --> 05:01:25,080
action they were not wielding remote

3976
05:01:25,080 --> 05:01:26,458
code execution vulnerabilities against

3977
05:01:26,458 --> 05:01:28,860
the nas devices they

3978
05:01:28,860 --> 05:01:31,378
it was unlikely to be an issue in the

3979
05:01:31,378 --> 05:01:34,580
first place but why Bob

3980
05:01:37,820 --> 05:01:39,958
and pass

3981
05:01:39,958 --> 05:01:42,120
sweet is that and who picks up on that

3982
05:01:42,120 --> 05:01:44,340
that's normal

3983
05:01:44,340 --> 05:01:46,860
so no more stupid crabs

3984
05:01:46,860 --> 05:01:49,320
that's the Tactical term

3985
05:01:49,320 --> 05:01:51,240
and it doesn't have to be masterful

3986
05:01:51,240 --> 05:01:52,500
again

3987
05:01:52,500 --> 05:01:54,718
tactically speaking art of the possible

3988
05:01:54,718 --> 05:01:58,020
change it to admin and then the freaking

3989
05:01:58,020 --> 05:02:00,298
Mac address or the

3990
05:02:00,298 --> 05:02:02,638
something I don't care you use the same

3991
05:02:02,638 --> 05:02:04,860
password for all of them that would be

3992
05:02:04,860 --> 05:02:07,680
way better than admin and past

3993
05:02:07,680 --> 05:02:10,138
that's not the highest ideal but if we

3994
05:02:10,138 --> 05:02:11,760
were there at least make them work for

3995
05:02:11,760 --> 05:02:13,940
him

3996
05:02:17,420 --> 05:02:19,920
oh there you go that'll be like this is

3997
05:02:19,920 --> 05:02:21,958
way too easy and too obvious

3998
05:02:21,958 --> 05:02:25,020
no it's Healthcare

3999
05:02:25,020 --> 05:02:26,940
additionally there are lots of tools in

4000
05:02:26,940 --> 05:02:28,680
solution the minute this gets on your

4001
05:02:28,680 --> 05:02:30,120
priority list and let's just say you're

4002
05:02:30,120 --> 05:02:31,080
right

4003
05:02:31,080 --> 05:02:33,000
that hospital environment and you do an

4004
05:02:33,000 --> 05:02:34,798
asset Discovery and you go

4005
05:02:34,798 --> 05:02:36,200
50

4006
05:02:36,200 --> 05:02:38,940
then things should change for you your

4007
05:02:38,940 --> 05:02:40,560
budgets have changed your conversation

4008
05:02:40,560 --> 05:02:42,360
with your boss your boss's boss to

4009
05:02:42,360 --> 05:02:46,020
change and then you have lots of options

4010
05:02:46,020 --> 05:02:47,700
maybe I think you're unfamiliar with but

4011
05:02:47,700 --> 05:02:49,560
that's okay there are lots of Management

4012
05:02:49,560 --> 05:02:51,780
Solutions that can help you with this

4013
05:02:51,780 --> 05:02:55,458
product most of those are free

4014
05:02:55,500 --> 05:02:57,120
how many cameras do you have in your

4015
05:02:57,120 --> 05:02:59,340
environment are they accessed it's very

4016
05:02:59,340 --> 05:03:00,480
common there's a free management

4017
05:03:00,480 --> 05:03:03,980
solution that nobody uses

4018
05:03:04,200 --> 05:03:05,820
I'm trying to think of time I was unable

4019
05:03:05,820 --> 05:03:08,780
to log into an access

4020
05:03:09,480 --> 05:03:12,240
no I can't think of it because

4021
05:03:12,240 --> 05:03:15,440
no defaults

4022
05:03:17,540 --> 05:03:19,798
centralized Solution that's just one one

4023
05:03:19,798 --> 05:03:21,958
example I'm sure you've heard of legit

4024
05:03:21,958 --> 05:03:23,400
Evan that's been around for as long as

4025
05:03:23,400 --> 05:03:27,298
priority it's all lots of different off

4026
05:03:27,298 --> 05:03:29,340
so you have choices you just need to

4027
05:03:29,340 --> 05:03:31,798
make these things a priority

4028
05:03:31,798 --> 05:03:33,840
again in my humble opinion not always

4029
05:03:33,840 --> 05:03:35,340
free incidentally you might need to

4030
05:03:35,340 --> 05:03:37,860
spend some money it might be worth it

4031
05:03:37,860 --> 05:03:41,298
sometimes the free version

4032
05:03:43,138 --> 05:03:46,520
you need to fix that

4033
05:03:50,638 --> 05:03:52,560
in this particular instance this is back

4034
05:03:52,560 --> 05:03:53,878
in the Glory Days

4035
05:03:53,878 --> 05:03:56,160
when we actually did on-site physical

4036
05:03:56,160 --> 05:03:59,458
evacuations so we visit this facility

4037
05:03:59,458 --> 05:04:01,560
it's a large

4038
05:04:01,560 --> 05:04:04,080
Enterprise physical location

4039
05:04:04,080 --> 05:04:06,660
this is the same this is not quite to

4040
05:04:06,660 --> 05:04:08,638
scale but a real moral drawing of the

4041
05:04:08,638 --> 05:04:11,218
situation they have a Public Act it says

4042
05:04:11,218 --> 05:04:13,138
entry and right inside the door thank

4043
05:04:13,138 --> 05:04:17,160
you very much there's a Windows kiosk

4044
05:04:17,160 --> 05:04:19,378
you'll note that it is in proximity to

4045
05:04:19,378 --> 05:04:20,520
security but Securities around the

4046
05:04:20,520 --> 05:04:21,958
corner so you can sit at this kiosk well

4047
05:04:21,958 --> 05:04:23,280
all day

4048
05:04:23,280 --> 05:04:25,320
research

4049
05:04:25,320 --> 05:04:27,540
and do what you felt like

4050
05:04:27,540 --> 05:04:29,458
actually

4051
05:04:29,458 --> 05:04:32,040
so if you walk in the door and you're a

4052
05:04:32,040 --> 05:04:34,080
salesperson cool idea you sit down at

4053
05:04:34,080 --> 05:04:35,580
this Gene you log in you make your time

4054
05:04:35,580 --> 05:04:37,200
you print your own badge stick it on

4055
05:04:37,200 --> 05:04:38,520
your shirt you walk security they let

4056
05:04:38,520 --> 05:04:40,080
you in

4057
05:04:40,080 --> 05:04:41,580
Andy

4058
05:04:41,580 --> 05:04:44,638
this is again the quintessential

4059
05:04:44,638 --> 05:04:46,860
example of a partially managed system

4060
05:04:46,860 --> 05:04:49,378
and it's not good

4061
05:04:49,378 --> 05:04:51,480
so I sit down again with my super lead

4062
05:04:51,480 --> 05:04:55,740
hacking skills and I boot into safe mode

4063
05:04:55,740 --> 05:04:57,298
I've heard of that one have you and

4064
05:04:57,298 --> 05:04:59,580
bounce out of kiosk mode

4065
05:04:59,580 --> 05:05:02,160
and find that it is domain join I'm

4066
05:05:02,160 --> 05:05:03,600
smart enough to note

4067
05:05:03,600 --> 05:05:05,700
that the vendors are not putting in

4068
05:05:05,700 --> 05:05:09,060
credential every time that system moves

4069
05:05:09,060 --> 05:05:11,218
I use once again my lead hacking skilled

4070
05:05:11,218 --> 05:05:13,760
and run a reg prayer

4071
05:05:13,760 --> 05:05:16,440
looking for passwords and that's the

4072
05:05:16,440 --> 05:05:18,718
easiest way to do an auto login system

4073
05:05:18,718 --> 05:05:20,820
password plain text in the registry so

4074
05:05:20,820 --> 05:05:22,798
now I have the main account I'm staying

4075
05:05:22,798 --> 05:05:24,298
in a foyer I'm starting to call this

4076
05:05:24,298 --> 05:05:27,680
from making friends

4077
05:05:28,798 --> 05:05:31,260
that was too hard to say repeatedly I'm

4078
05:05:31,260 --> 05:05:32,580
literally there on a Friday afternoon my

4079
05:05:32,580 --> 05:05:33,660
first thought is man I'm gonna get

4080
05:05:33,660 --> 05:05:35,700
caught yeah it takes some time to get

4081
05:05:35,700 --> 05:05:36,958
into this apron put some time to do

4082
05:05:36,958 --> 05:05:38,400
register it takes some time to begin to

4083
05:05:38,400 --> 05:05:39,480
enumerate the network and I'm

4084
05:05:39,480 --> 05:05:41,040
enumerating the network I'm looking

4085
05:05:41,040 --> 05:05:43,320
for cool stuff like open file shares and

4086
05:05:43,320 --> 05:05:45,180
FTP servers and I'm scrambling because

4087
05:05:45,180 --> 05:05:48,020
someone's gonna be mad

4088
05:05:49,920 --> 05:05:51,240
they're all in such a good mood I made

4089
05:05:51,240 --> 05:05:53,820
so many friends a day hey Bill

4090
05:05:53,820 --> 05:05:56,180
bill

4091
05:05:56,940 --> 05:05:58,440
hey Mike

4092
05:05:58,440 --> 05:06:00,718
a social experiment in addition to

4093
05:06:00,718 --> 05:06:05,240
technical experiment I found temporary

4094
05:06:07,878 --> 05:06:09,660
very well

4095
05:06:09,660 --> 05:06:12,660
feet and then system by accident

4096
05:06:12,660 --> 05:06:14,878
so we actually shortly thereafter

4097
05:06:14,878 --> 05:06:16,700
discovered an HR

4098
05:06:16,700 --> 05:06:20,340
Firehouse Jordan had 17 000 W2s

4099
05:06:20,340 --> 05:06:23,878
for all employees I'm sitting outside of

4100
05:06:23,878 --> 05:06:26,040
the secure physical area I'm sitting in

4101
05:06:26,040 --> 05:06:27,060
a kiosks that's intentionally

4102
05:06:27,060 --> 05:06:29,600
provisioned

4103
05:06:30,980 --> 05:06:33,420
I have the social security number for

4104
05:06:33,420 --> 05:06:36,019
every employee

4105
05:06:36,840 --> 05:06:39,260
thank you

4106
05:06:39,260 --> 05:06:42,440
so I don't want to share them

4107
05:06:42,440 --> 05:06:45,060
put it on this

4108
05:06:45,060 --> 05:06:48,060
wait

4109
05:06:51,540 --> 05:06:56,100
it's my social limit like

4110
05:06:57,480 --> 05:07:00,560
it went higher on the list

4111
05:07:01,500 --> 05:07:05,718
that was I'll always cherish that moment

4112
05:07:06,660 --> 05:07:10,218
the moral to that story is

4113
05:07:11,040 --> 05:07:14,040
segregation is really really cool

4114
05:07:14,040 --> 05:07:17,820
no segmentation we're all going down

4115
05:07:17,820 --> 05:07:20,040
no segmentation that was a tough one

4116
05:07:20,040 --> 05:07:22,200
they were actually trying to

4117
05:07:22,200 --> 05:07:24,298
partially managed and they joined to The

4118
05:07:24,298 --> 05:07:26,520
Domain so that they could apply patches

4119
05:07:26,520 --> 05:07:28,620
God bless them trying

4120
05:07:28,620 --> 05:07:30,480
and really what they did sort of create

4121
05:07:30,480 --> 05:07:32,100
a minimal exposure

4122
05:07:32,100 --> 05:07:34,260
worst part total side note it was no

4123
05:07:34,260 --> 05:07:36,798
longer production

4124
05:07:36,840 --> 05:07:38,218
when we actually contacted the screen

4125
05:07:38,218 --> 05:07:39,620
Department

4126
05:07:39,620 --> 05:07:42,298
we don't use it anymore

4127
05:07:42,298 --> 05:07:45,500
you need to network him faster

4128
05:07:46,320 --> 05:07:47,878
so segmentation

4129
05:07:47,878 --> 05:07:50,718
subscribe you

4130
05:07:51,180 --> 05:07:52,920
and if we're gonna be real micro

4131
05:07:52,920 --> 05:07:54,958
segmentation news the coolest and it's

4132
05:07:54,958 --> 05:07:57,138
impossible

4133
05:08:00,060 --> 05:08:01,980
but only a little in our perfect world

4134
05:08:01,980 --> 05:08:03,480
we segment the holy heck out of

4135
05:08:03,480 --> 05:08:05,520
everything and that's awesome

4136
05:08:05,520 --> 05:08:09,260
when are you gonna get it done

4137
05:08:09,900 --> 05:08:11,638
speaking from personal experience and

4138
05:08:11,638 --> 05:08:13,378
multiple large Enterprises

4139
05:08:13,378 --> 05:08:15,298
typically Healthcare approximately never

4140
05:08:15,298 --> 05:08:18,480
so let's get real

4141
05:08:18,480 --> 05:08:21,000
let's talk about macro segmentation

4142
05:08:21,000 --> 05:08:22,320
that is

4143
05:08:22,320 --> 05:08:25,980
if you can do nothing other than bicep

4144
05:08:25,980 --> 05:08:27,240
your entire environment to block four

4145
05:08:27,240 --> 05:08:29,638
four five you should do it

4146
05:08:29,638 --> 05:08:32,160
do you need 445 access to your security

4147
05:08:32,160 --> 05:08:34,200
cameras

4148
05:08:34,200 --> 05:08:37,458
and yes I'm yelling at you

4149
05:08:38,700 --> 05:08:41,160
do you

4150
05:08:41,160 --> 05:08:44,100
do you need FTP access

4151
05:08:44,100 --> 05:08:47,820
to your biomedical systems I don't know

4152
05:08:47,820 --> 05:08:50,458
but probably no

4153
05:08:50,458 --> 05:08:53,160
and what I'm suggesting again is that

4154
05:08:53,160 --> 05:08:55,440
you do something you take decisive

4155
05:08:55,440 --> 05:08:56,820
action

4156
05:08:56,820 --> 05:08:58,740
I don't know exactly what's applicable

4157
05:08:58,740 --> 05:09:00,480
in your environment but I put them in

4158
05:09:00,480 --> 05:09:03,000
priority of evil ports

4159
05:09:03,000 --> 05:09:05,760
on the slide just for a cheat sheet

4160
05:09:05,760 --> 05:09:08,218
we all know fullwell SMD stands for show

4161
05:09:08,218 --> 05:09:11,240
my box right

4162
05:09:12,020 --> 05:09:15,480
if you've got to start somewhere start

4163
05:09:15,480 --> 05:09:16,820
there

4164
05:09:16,820 --> 05:09:22,080
33.89 for RDP for SSH why on Earth would

4165
05:09:22,080 --> 05:09:24,718
you be using FTP

4166
05:09:24,718 --> 05:09:27,440
stop it

4167
05:09:28,020 --> 05:09:30,660
once again macro second day just just do

4168
05:09:30,660 --> 05:09:31,500
something

4169
05:09:31,500 --> 05:09:34,440
huge huge huge impact I have done this

4170
05:09:34,440 --> 05:09:36,500
in highly

4171
05:09:36,500 --> 05:09:38,940
complicated specific healthcare pharmacy

4172
05:09:38,940 --> 05:09:41,340
and we block four for five for all

4173
05:09:41,340 --> 05:09:42,600
biomed

4174
05:09:42,600 --> 05:09:43,980
yes

4175
05:09:43,980 --> 05:09:47,700
huge 24 hours done

4176
05:09:47,700 --> 05:09:50,700
does it replace microwave no you should

4177
05:09:50,700 --> 05:09:52,680
still work for that as an outcome as a

4178
05:09:52,680 --> 05:09:54,920
goal

4179
05:09:55,320 --> 05:09:56,760
but do something

4180
05:09:56,760 --> 05:10:00,500
and this can be huge

4181
05:10:01,500 --> 05:10:04,160
all done

4182
05:10:05,180 --> 05:10:08,660
step number a

4183
05:10:09,420 --> 05:10:11,780
yes

4184
05:10:11,940 --> 05:10:13,798
I don't know where this fits this is a

4185
05:10:13,798 --> 05:10:17,340
hard one ideally you're engaged in the

4186
05:10:17,340 --> 05:10:18,298
process

4187
05:10:18,298 --> 05:10:20,280
system evaluation and implementation

4188
05:10:20,280 --> 05:10:23,580
before somebody signs the PO

4189
05:10:23,580 --> 05:10:25,798
that is hard you're not going to do that

4190
05:10:25,798 --> 05:10:28,080
tomorrow this is a strategic departure

4191
05:10:28,080 --> 05:10:30,480
for me I apologize in advance

4192
05:10:30,480 --> 05:10:31,620
but you should start this conversation

4193
05:10:31,620 --> 05:10:34,798
if you're not doing this now you need to

4194
05:10:34,798 --> 05:10:36,660
be involved from a security perspective

4195
05:10:36,660 --> 05:10:38,638
before somebody cuts a check

4196
05:10:38,638 --> 05:10:40,860
and you lose all Leverage

4197
05:10:40,860 --> 05:10:42,298
because managing vendor management

4198
05:10:42,298 --> 05:10:45,000
system is tough managing anything that

4199
05:10:45,000 --> 05:10:46,560
you did not Build and Grow in-house it

4200
05:10:46,560 --> 05:10:48,298
can be hard

4201
05:10:48,298 --> 05:10:50,100
so

4202
05:10:50,100 --> 05:10:52,200
early is the time get in on the

4203
05:10:52,200 --> 05:10:54,900
conversation develop a

4204
05:10:54,900 --> 05:10:57,718
a list of security requirements

4205
05:10:57,718 --> 05:11:00,298
before anybody can cut a PO

4206
05:11:00,298 --> 05:11:02,700
or you're gonna have to be

4207
05:11:02,700 --> 05:11:04,378
especially in healthcare I have gone

4208
05:11:04,378 --> 05:11:06,298
toe-to-toe multiple times with Fuji

4209
05:11:06,298 --> 05:11:08,360
Phillips

4210
05:11:08,360 --> 05:11:12,080
guess how many times I want

4211
05:11:12,180 --> 05:11:15,180
however

4212
05:11:17,040 --> 05:11:19,138
we can't come up with the conditions we

4213
05:11:19,138 --> 05:11:20,458
can come up with literally things like

4214
05:11:20,458 --> 05:11:22,860
flying four four five

4215
05:11:22,860 --> 05:11:26,060
to those Services blocking RDP it's

4216
05:11:26,060 --> 05:11:29,600
minimal but it's something

4217
05:11:35,580 --> 05:11:37,200
we're not automatic customer stories in

4218
05:11:37,200 --> 05:11:39,240
any case

4219
05:11:39,240 --> 05:11:41,700
have a pre-purchase plan it just might

4220
05:11:41,700 --> 05:11:44,480
not work sometimes

4221
05:11:54,680 --> 05:11:57,000
write a policy somebody needs to write a

4222
05:11:57,000 --> 05:11:59,700
policy will it work most of the time no

4223
05:11:59,700 --> 05:12:03,840
but if it works a corner of time then

4224
05:12:03,840 --> 05:12:04,940
it's a winner

4225
05:12:04,940 --> 05:12:08,100
last bullet on this is be flexible

4226
05:12:08,100 --> 05:12:11,480
don't run out of the room

4227
05:12:11,900 --> 05:12:16,040
we don't need no stinking MRIS

4228
05:12:16,860 --> 05:12:19,620
that won't go well so be flexible have

4229
05:12:19,620 --> 05:12:21,298
some alternate Solutions and

4230
05:12:21,298 --> 05:12:23,280
between some hybridization that says

4231
05:12:23,280 --> 05:12:26,780
well what could we just do this

4232
05:12:32,180 --> 05:12:35,040
last and certainly not least think about

4233
05:12:35,040 --> 05:12:36,660
how these things are incorporated into

4234
05:12:36,660 --> 05:12:39,360
your active incident response plan

4235
05:12:39,360 --> 05:12:41,780
please

4236
05:12:42,660 --> 05:12:44,458
do you have visibility into this stuff

4237
05:12:44,458 --> 05:12:45,900
if

4238
05:12:45,900 --> 05:12:48,120
you have a really bad day

4239
05:12:48,120 --> 05:12:49,980
a global Enterprise we talked about just

4240
05:12:49,980 --> 05:12:52,760
a few minutes ago

4241
05:12:52,860 --> 05:12:55,020
the threat actors are too pivot

4242
05:12:55,020 --> 05:12:57,060
two unmanaged systems what are you gonna

4243
05:12:57,060 --> 05:12:58,260
do about it

4244
05:12:58,260 --> 05:13:00,900
should this stuff incorporated into your

4245
05:13:00,900 --> 05:13:02,820
sim sim

4246
05:13:02,820 --> 05:13:05,958
security whatever

4247
05:13:06,180 --> 05:13:08,600
at least

4248
05:13:09,958 --> 05:13:12,060
the middle of the storm is the wrong

4249
05:13:12,060 --> 05:13:13,740
time to do that you know that this

4250
05:13:13,740 --> 05:13:17,878
doesn't have to be you

4251
05:13:21,060 --> 05:13:22,500
but think about it how are you gonna

4252
05:13:22,500 --> 05:13:23,218
gain

4253
05:13:23,218 --> 05:13:24,958
any disability and maybe it's just

4254
05:13:24,958 --> 05:13:26,940
preparing some stress

4255
05:13:26,940 --> 05:13:30,240
the ultimate win in the previous party

4256
05:13:30,240 --> 05:13:33,240
was some very basic bash scripts that

4257
05:13:33,240 --> 05:13:34,980
pull bash history from all those Nas

4258
05:13:34,980 --> 05:13:37,138
devices that allow us to go hello this

4259
05:13:37,138 --> 05:13:39,600
shouldn't be happening it wasn't again

4260
05:13:39,600 --> 05:13:42,060
super Elite but I wish we'd have

4261
05:13:42,060 --> 05:13:44,100
said because it did take some work to

4262
05:13:44,100 --> 05:13:45,200
get them to work

4263
05:13:45,200 --> 05:13:49,320
the devices were authentication which

4264
05:13:49,320 --> 05:13:51,900
has been home as you imagined but I

4265
05:13:51,900 --> 05:13:54,860
don't think that's approved

4266
05:13:55,820 --> 05:13:57,718
hopefully we touch on this storm

4267
05:13:57,718 --> 05:14:00,360
tangentially previously and that is

4268
05:14:00,360 --> 05:14:02,100
you have some sort of management in

4269
05:14:02,100 --> 05:14:02,820
place

4270
05:14:02,820 --> 05:14:04,200
some sort of centralized credential

4271
05:14:04,200 --> 05:14:07,020
management is super huge it's Monumental

4272
05:14:07,020 --> 05:14:10,080
it would have been a gaming here in my

4273
05:14:10,080 --> 05:14:12,780
previous examples and

4274
05:14:12,780 --> 05:14:13,920
actually

4275
05:14:13,920 --> 05:14:16,920
oh

4276
05:14:16,980 --> 05:14:18,660
pretty much that was the overarching

4277
05:14:18,660 --> 05:14:20,760
theme for every single story opportunity

4278
05:14:20,760 --> 05:14:22,500
there's some issue with authentication

4279
05:14:22,500 --> 05:14:25,260
which is why again to me retinol Ingress

4280
05:14:25,260 --> 05:14:28,560
and off egress I think

4281
05:14:28,560 --> 05:14:31,020
because those are super critical when

4282
05:14:31,020 --> 05:14:33,360
stuffed into fan we need to be able to

4283
05:14:33,360 --> 05:14:35,580
control these

4284
05:14:35,580 --> 05:14:37,560
I forgot a way to intentionally manage

4285
05:14:37,560 --> 05:14:39,980
those things

4286
05:14:54,718 --> 05:14:56,040
so

4287
05:14:56,040 --> 05:14:57,798
you're gonna find an actor

4288
05:14:57,798 --> 05:15:00,240
you're gonna find the stuff in your

4289
05:15:00,240 --> 05:15:03,440
network of all the bad guys do

4290
05:15:03,600 --> 05:15:06,600
Matrix

4291
05:15:13,680 --> 05:15:15,180
to decide what you're going to practice

4292
05:15:15,180 --> 05:15:18,718
first second third

4293
05:15:18,718 --> 05:15:19,860
one

4294
05:15:19,860 --> 05:15:21,540
figure out a way to eliminate stupid

4295
05:15:21,540 --> 05:15:24,080
threats

4296
05:15:24,780 --> 05:15:28,260
whether that's manually doing so

4297
05:15:28,260 --> 05:15:30,480
literally when I did the engagement for

4298
05:15:30,480 --> 05:15:31,878
the busy

4299
05:15:31,878 --> 05:15:34,260
it couldn't come up with a really great

4300
05:15:34,260 --> 05:15:35,400
solution

4301
05:15:35,400 --> 05:15:37,500
so they legitimately passed about six

4302
05:15:37,500 --> 05:15:39,860
members

4303
05:15:41,180 --> 05:15:43,620
manually change passwords on all of

4304
05:15:43,620 --> 05:15:45,660
those devices I'm sorry

4305
05:15:45,660 --> 05:15:48,480
but it took him a day

4306
05:15:48,480 --> 05:15:52,700
and that problem was largely mitigated

4307
05:15:53,760 --> 05:15:54,958
you haven't thought about Mac for

4308
05:15:54,958 --> 05:15:56,820
segmentation before

4309
05:15:56,820 --> 05:15:59,100
you should think about it I think again

4310
05:15:59,100 --> 05:16:01,798
low barrier entry possibly significant

4311
05:16:01,798 --> 05:16:03,840
Roi

4312
05:16:03,840 --> 05:16:05,458
especially if you choose your ports and

4313
05:16:05,458 --> 05:16:08,218
protocols wisely

4314
05:16:08,218 --> 05:16:10,798
you're gonna think about at least

4315
05:16:10,798 --> 05:16:12,718
injecting yourself into the vendor

4316
05:16:12,718 --> 05:16:14,940
management purchasing process

4317
05:16:14,940 --> 05:16:17,520
start writing a policy engaging in that

4318
05:16:17,520 --> 05:16:19,620
conversation

4319
05:16:19,620 --> 05:16:22,138
if you have good vendors they should be

4320
05:16:22,138 --> 05:16:25,579
willing to engage in that conversation

4321
05:16:26,760 --> 05:16:28,138
last and definitely not least you're

4322
05:16:28,138 --> 05:16:30,600
going to consider how you're going to

4323
05:16:30,600 --> 05:16:32,340
detect respond

4324
05:16:32,340 --> 05:16:35,638
should bad things happen hopefully

4325
05:16:35,638 --> 05:16:37,320
by implementing some of these other

4326
05:16:37,320 --> 05:16:40,080
changes and suggestions you don't get to

4327
05:16:40,080 --> 05:16:42,060
this point

4328
05:16:42,060 --> 05:16:45,480
but be prepared think about how you're

4329
05:16:45,480 --> 05:16:46,860
going to gain visibility into the

4330
05:16:46,860 --> 05:16:48,360
systems think about how you might

4331
05:16:48,360 --> 05:16:51,378
contain sequester

4332
05:16:51,980 --> 05:16:54,360
change off in a

4333
05:16:54,360 --> 05:16:57,798
hurry shoot you have to

4334
05:16:59,360 --> 05:17:02,540
the end

4335
05:17:09,298 --> 05:17:11,100
I think that we have a few minutes for

4336
05:17:11,100 --> 05:17:12,180
questions

4337
05:17:12,180 --> 05:17:15,480
as long as they're easy questions

4338
05:17:15,480 --> 05:17:18,920
before the next presentation

4339
05:17:29,400 --> 05:17:31,798
the

4340
05:17:31,798 --> 05:17:35,100
I feel like a lot of a lot of the same

4341
05:17:35,100 --> 05:17:37,440
things come into play in terms of

4342
05:17:37,440 --> 05:17:39,420
distribution and management of those

4343
05:17:39,420 --> 05:17:43,320
same devices I think it is a possible

4344
05:17:43,320 --> 05:17:46,760
potential solution

4345
05:17:47,000 --> 05:17:50,160
definitely definitely I have seen

4346
05:17:50,160 --> 05:17:52,260
attempts at large-scale implementation

4347
05:17:52,260 --> 05:17:54,420
on some of those sort of obfuscating

4348
05:17:54,420 --> 05:17:56,700
hide them on the network

4349
05:17:56,700 --> 05:17:59,580
and I never saw them come to fruition

4350
05:17:59,580 --> 05:18:02,340
because of the additional layer of

4351
05:18:02,340 --> 05:18:04,700
management and complexity and

4352
05:18:04,700 --> 05:18:09,240
so I like it but I haven't seen it

4353
05:18:09,240 --> 05:18:10,980
through to solve the problem and kind of

4354
05:18:10,980 --> 05:18:13,520
created another problem

4355
05:18:20,718 --> 05:18:22,680
thank you

4356
05:18:22,680 --> 05:18:25,218
for coming

4357
05:18:27,680 --> 05:18:31,400
I really appreciate that

4358
05:18:32,040 --> 05:18:34,700
appreciate it

4393
05:27:54,120 --> 05:27:56,878
hi everyone uh thank you so much for

4394
05:27:56,878 --> 05:27:58,560
coming to my talk I hope everyone's

4395
05:27:58,560 --> 05:28:01,080
having a great conference so far

4396
05:28:01,080 --> 05:28:03,480
yeah awesome

4397
05:28:03,480 --> 05:28:04,500
um

4398
05:28:04,500 --> 05:28:07,080
so

4399
05:28:07,080 --> 05:28:09,440
this talk is about an idea that I had

4400
05:28:09,440 --> 05:28:13,560
about a year ago that I want to call uh

4401
05:28:13,560 --> 05:28:15,660
text me through and first a little bit

4402
05:28:15,660 --> 05:28:17,100
about myself

4403
05:28:17,100 --> 05:28:19,798
um I'm an industry professional uh I do

4404
05:28:19,798 --> 05:28:21,298
a little bit of threat hunting I do a

4405
05:28:21,298 --> 05:28:24,360
little bit of malware analysis

4406
05:28:24,360 --> 05:28:26,280
tiny little sprinkles of automation on

4407
05:28:26,280 --> 05:28:29,400
his side so it's mostly my perspective

4408
05:28:29,400 --> 05:28:30,780
for your understanding it's really

4409
05:28:30,780 --> 05:28:33,020
coming

4410
05:28:35,700 --> 05:28:37,820
um

4411
05:28:38,340 --> 05:28:40,740
I wanted to say that I'm just

4412
05:28:40,740 --> 05:28:43,798
representing myself not my employer

4413
05:28:43,798 --> 05:28:46,378
any all things are my own uh they're

4414
05:28:46,378 --> 05:28:48,180
uniquely my own so if you start agreeing

4415
05:28:48,180 --> 05:28:51,600
with me you're doing it wrong and uh

4416
05:28:51,600 --> 05:28:53,638
you should stop

4417
05:28:53,638 --> 05:28:54,718
um

4418
05:28:54,718 --> 05:28:57,600
so yeah uh

4419
05:28:57,600 --> 05:28:59,040
talk um

4420
05:28:59,040 --> 05:29:00,480
first you'll notice that there are no

4421
05:29:00,480 --> 05:29:02,420
slides which is unfortunate

4422
05:29:02,420 --> 05:29:04,980
these are technical difficulties that we

4423
05:29:04,980 --> 05:29:06,660
can overcome I like it because I think

4424
05:29:06,660 --> 05:29:08,218
it's kind of old school and retro so

4425
05:29:08,218 --> 05:29:11,160
we're just gonna go right ahead

4426
05:29:11,160 --> 05:29:13,620
um in lieu of visual aids I invite you

4427
05:29:13,620 --> 05:29:15,060
to kind of join

4428
05:29:15,060 --> 05:29:16,680
looking at us in the theater of the Mind

4429
05:29:16,680 --> 05:29:19,440
If ever my like visual presence has been

4430
05:29:19,440 --> 05:29:21,540
uh quite interesting you feel free to

4431
05:29:21,540 --> 05:29:22,320
close

4432
05:29:22,320 --> 05:29:24,920
your eyes

4433
05:29:25,798 --> 05:29:26,458
um

4434
05:29:26,458 --> 05:29:27,600
so

4435
05:29:27,600 --> 05:29:29,940
I want to start at the beginning uh the

4436
05:29:29,940 --> 05:29:34,500
year is 2022 if you can imagine that

4437
05:29:34,500 --> 05:29:36,138
um back in July

4438
05:29:36,138 --> 05:29:39,840
headline uh twilio

4439
05:29:39,840 --> 05:29:41,638
by fishing campaign targeting internet

4440
05:29:41,638 --> 05:29:43,378
companies

4441
05:29:43,378 --> 05:29:45,980
foreign

4442
05:29:50,700 --> 05:29:51,660
um

4443
05:29:51,660 --> 05:29:54,298
this was according to various media the

4444
05:29:54,298 --> 05:29:57,360
kind of Reports say a sophisticated SMS

4445
05:29:57,360 --> 05:29:59,458
fishing campaign uh

4446
05:29:59,458 --> 05:30:01,320
which kind of started to get me engaged

4447
05:30:01,320 --> 05:30:03,718
and I do uh my thread hunting dance I

4448
05:30:03,718 --> 05:30:07,620
begin looking at what little kind of

4449
05:30:07,620 --> 05:30:09,240
short links were already out there that

4450
05:30:09,240 --> 05:30:11,420
described yes

4451
05:30:11,420 --> 05:30:14,340
I did from those two

4452
05:30:14,340 --> 05:30:19,100
fishing domains are actually hosting uh

4453
05:30:22,040 --> 05:30:25,860
this kind of news cycle this is uh some

4454
05:30:25,860 --> 05:30:28,200
of the original octopus attacks that

4455
05:30:28,200 --> 05:30:31,020
occurred in last year summer

4456
05:30:31,020 --> 05:30:34,500
it seemed interesting because they're

4457
05:30:34,500 --> 05:30:36,138
kind of targeting

4458
05:30:36,138 --> 05:30:41,520
so and they were stealing uh MFA which

4459
05:30:41,520 --> 05:30:43,320
is not something that I had really seen

4460
05:30:43,320 --> 05:30:44,400
in a new

4461
05:30:44,400 --> 05:30:46,620
music cycle report so my engagement kind

4462
05:30:46,620 --> 05:30:48,660
of went down the road of well who else

4463
05:30:48,660 --> 05:30:51,320
would they party games

4464
05:30:51,500 --> 05:30:54,180
so and I started looking at some of the

4465
05:30:54,180 --> 05:30:56,700
patterns and kind of the domain

4466
05:30:56,700 --> 05:30:59,040
names and kind of enumerating what other

4467
05:30:59,040 --> 05:31:01,138
targets they might have

4468
05:31:01,138 --> 05:31:04,560
uh all of this was aided Honestly by

4469
05:31:04,560 --> 05:31:07,620
the community and the I.T Community to

4470
05:31:07,620 --> 05:31:09,780
impose screenshots of some of the more

4471
05:31:09,780 --> 05:31:13,520
interesting uh SMS fish

4472
05:31:13,520 --> 05:31:16,138
uh texts that they were getting on

4473
05:31:16,138 --> 05:31:19,740
Twitter so I found that uh extremely

4474
05:31:19,740 --> 05:31:23,100
helpful but I noted to myself this

4475
05:31:23,100 --> 05:31:27,360
is an area in which I as an analyst as a

4476
05:31:27,360 --> 05:31:29,040
threat Intel researcher don't

4477
05:31:29,040 --> 05:31:32,000
necessarily have a

4478
05:31:32,480 --> 05:31:35,280
I don't have an ability to say

4479
05:31:35,280 --> 05:31:37,860
what domains are being targeted by

4480
05:31:37,860 --> 05:31:40,160
customization today

4481
05:31:40,160 --> 05:31:42,958
are kind of kind of out there who's

4482
05:31:42,958 --> 05:31:45,660
being part of what numbers are kind of

4483
05:31:45,660 --> 05:31:48,138
specifically

4484
05:31:48,480 --> 05:31:51,060
um so that kind of got my my thoughts

4485
05:31:51,060 --> 05:31:53,718
turning about it

4486
05:31:55,500 --> 05:31:57,540
but um of course as you know the the

4487
05:31:57,540 --> 05:31:59,280
original octopus

4488
05:31:59,280 --> 05:32:02,180
breaches didn't stop there there's

4489
05:32:02,180 --> 05:32:05,760
sophisticated after breach uh steps for

4490
05:32:05,760 --> 05:32:08,458
the control various failing application

4491
05:32:08,458 --> 05:32:09,840
accounts

4492
05:32:09,840 --> 05:32:12,378
to use that to further reach

4493
05:32:12,378 --> 05:32:15,120
be severe in terms of

4494
05:32:15,120 --> 05:32:18,540
in terms of sophistication uh maybe not

4495
05:32:18,540 --> 05:32:20,638
so much

4496
05:32:20,638 --> 05:32:22,760
um

4497
05:32:24,420 --> 05:32:28,200
so because primarily on Twitter

4498
05:32:28,200 --> 05:32:32,940
um I look into kind of why this was more

4499
05:32:32,940 --> 05:32:34,500
of a problem

4500
05:32:34,500 --> 05:32:38,160
compared to say an email there's not a

4501
05:32:38,160 --> 05:32:40,020
long list a different defensive measures

4502
05:32:40,020 --> 05:32:42,958
that kind of already exists there's a

4503
05:32:42,958 --> 05:32:45,840
widely known kind of Defense in debt uh

4504
05:32:45,840 --> 05:32:48,958
kind of framework around email phishing

4505
05:32:48,958 --> 05:32:50,878
why is there not kind of the same thing

4506
05:32:50,878 --> 05:32:52,040
around

4507
05:32:52,040 --> 05:32:55,138
it's uh kind of a difficult problem

4508
05:32:55,138 --> 05:32:58,440
because the determination of who gets

4509
05:32:58,440 --> 05:33:01,320
literally blood messages is not

4510
05:33:01,320 --> 05:33:03,120
controlled by Telecom

4511
05:33:03,120 --> 05:33:07,320
um it's controlled by uh providers

4512
05:33:08,340 --> 05:33:11,040
um and there may be isn't as much

4513
05:33:11,040 --> 05:33:13,920
ability for us to gain wide-ranging

4514
05:33:13,920 --> 05:33:15,180
information

4515
05:33:15,180 --> 05:33:17,878
that was interested in public parties

4516
05:33:17,878 --> 05:33:21,860
into what's being really sent over

4517
05:33:23,638 --> 05:33:25,680
um so I don't think it would like the

4518
05:33:25,680 --> 05:33:27,298
threat the

4519
05:33:27,298 --> 05:33:29,580
the metaphora Swiss cheese and my abuse

4520
05:33:29,580 --> 05:33:31,260
with cheese is probably one of the worst

4521
05:33:31,260 --> 05:33:32,580
cheeses

4522
05:33:32,580 --> 05:33:34,620
um but if you think about this in terms

4523
05:33:34,620 --> 05:33:36,360
of that you have many different layers

4524
05:33:36,360 --> 05:33:39,020
of Swiss cheese

4525
05:33:39,780 --> 05:33:42,060
and you have maybe two or three

4526
05:33:42,060 --> 05:33:43,260
different

4527
05:33:43,260 --> 05:33:45,120
layers of Swiss cheese when you're

4528
05:33:45,120 --> 05:33:46,920
thinking about it

4529
05:33:46,920 --> 05:33:49,560
coupled with the fact that SMS is kind

4530
05:33:49,560 --> 05:33:54,240
of a directly to a person

4531
05:33:54,240 --> 05:33:57,260
or the victim of the attack

4532
05:34:00,480 --> 05:34:02,540
um

4533
05:34:04,638 --> 05:34:07,440
no this is definitely malicious we're

4534
05:34:07,440 --> 05:34:10,100
going to take this out of the stream and

4535
05:34:10,100 --> 05:34:13,620
uh not show it to you so those are what

4536
05:34:13,620 --> 05:34:16,040
I think of as like kind of free filters

4537
05:34:16,040 --> 05:34:18,600
uh Gmail and Microsoft would be great

4538
05:34:18,600 --> 05:34:21,120
monster Point too and say look they just

4539
05:34:21,120 --> 05:34:22,860
take the fishing

4540
05:34:22,860 --> 05:34:25,138
emails out of the inbox it doesn't

4541
05:34:25,138 --> 05:34:28,378
really appear in a patch you don't have

4542
05:34:28,378 --> 05:34:32,280
the same benefit it might be with SMS

4543
05:34:32,280 --> 05:34:33,060
um

4544
05:34:33,060 --> 05:34:35,340
because they go direct to a consumer

4545
05:34:35,340 --> 05:34:38,580
device if you have a system admin who

4546
05:34:38,580 --> 05:34:39,718
may have

4547
05:34:39,718 --> 05:34:43,440
access to internal corporate systems um

4548
05:34:43,440 --> 05:34:45,980
yeah

4549
05:34:46,340 --> 05:34:50,298
because that's good

4550
05:34:51,060 --> 05:34:53,160
um and it bypasses many of the corporate

4551
05:34:53,160 --> 05:34:55,200
protections you might otherwise see

4552
05:34:55,200 --> 05:34:57,200
um

4553
05:35:01,620 --> 05:35:03,298
um so my goodness is perhaps we can look

4554
05:35:03,298 --> 05:35:05,480
at

4555
05:35:06,240 --> 05:35:08,580
I say it's different from email it's a

4556
05:35:08,580 --> 05:35:09,958
little bit more difficult than it is and

4557
05:35:09,958 --> 05:35:12,360
we'll get into kind of the challenges

4558
05:35:12,360 --> 05:35:13,920
but in my view

4559
05:35:13,920 --> 05:35:16,020
um that's my destiny pop would be able

4560
05:35:16,020 --> 05:35:18,480
to accept text messages to specific

4561
05:35:18,480 --> 05:35:20,040
phone numbers

4562
05:35:20,040 --> 05:35:22,500
um Parts out kind of domain names or any

4563
05:35:22,500 --> 05:35:24,980
technical indicators that might be there

4564
05:35:24,980 --> 05:35:27,900
and throw those into your particular

4565
05:35:27,900 --> 05:35:29,958
threat functions

4566
05:35:29,958 --> 05:35:33,298
whatever that may be in my case I would

4567
05:35:33,298 --> 05:35:34,680
definitely

4568
05:35:34,680 --> 05:35:38,520
and domains associated with IP address

4569
05:35:38,520 --> 05:35:40,320
I'll get redirects and look at perhaps

4570
05:35:40,320 --> 05:35:43,020
open directories and

4571
05:35:43,020 --> 05:35:45,240
try and get an idea of what brand is

4572
05:35:45,240 --> 05:35:48,000
being targeted and whether or not

4573
05:35:48,000 --> 05:35:50,458
the target list my employees or my

4574
05:35:50,458 --> 05:35:52,760
customers

4575
05:35:54,840 --> 05:35:57,540
um so what I did was

4576
05:35:57,540 --> 05:35:59,340
set up over

4577
05:35:59,340 --> 05:36:00,718
the course of the weekend

4578
05:36:00,718 --> 05:36:05,820
a account with polio and

4579
05:36:05,820 --> 05:36:10,440
thankfully they're able to release me

4580
05:36:10,440 --> 05:36:12,780
different phone numbers which I've been

4581
05:36:12,780 --> 05:36:14,760
kind of listened to and home around with

4582
05:36:14,760 --> 05:36:17,958
as I kind of political system

4583
05:36:18,240 --> 05:36:20,360
um

4584
05:36:21,780 --> 05:36:24,600
if you would like to text one of these

4585
05:36:24,600 --> 05:36:26,458
numbers and

4586
05:36:26,458 --> 05:36:28,860
assist me with data Gathering you can

4587
05:36:28,860 --> 05:36:32,040
absolutely test nine seven zero

4588
05:36:32,040 --> 05:36:36,020
three two nine nine uh

4589
05:36:36,020 --> 05:36:40,940
and that should go to an SMS

4590
05:36:41,458 --> 05:36:43,080
um that should parse out and go out

4591
05:36:43,080 --> 05:36:47,060
before coming and throw it

4592
05:36:50,100 --> 05:36:51,360
um

4593
05:36:51,360 --> 05:36:53,520
one of the key problems with

4594
05:36:53,520 --> 05:36:57,680
a honey pot and kind of

4595
05:36:58,138 --> 05:37:00,320
um

4596
05:37:01,560 --> 05:37:06,620
there are approximately 400 million

4597
05:37:06,620 --> 05:37:10,860
assignable no numbers in just kind of

4598
05:37:10,860 --> 05:37:13,500
the US market

4599
05:37:13,500 --> 05:37:15,060
um not all of those apparently are used

4600
05:37:15,060 --> 05:37:16,980
so one of the biggest

4601
05:37:16,980 --> 05:37:19,798
problems is that threat actors can't

4602
05:37:19,798 --> 05:37:20,520
really

4603
05:37:20,520 --> 05:37:26,400
do pray and pray uh in kind of the SMS

4604
05:37:26,400 --> 05:37:28,378
um but they would do for example

4605
05:37:28,378 --> 05:37:31,740
scanning for exploits uh

4606
05:37:31,740 --> 05:37:33,840
that sort of thing they would pop up on

4607
05:37:33,840 --> 05:37:36,060
honey pots that are looking for that

4608
05:37:36,060 --> 05:37:38,718
kind of activity but in terms of SMS

4609
05:37:38,718 --> 05:37:41,040
spraying and praying will very very

4610
05:37:41,040 --> 05:37:42,860
quickly get you

4611
05:37:42,860 --> 05:37:45,420
identified by the Telecom

4612
05:37:45,420 --> 05:37:47,480
networks these Network you're abusing

4613
05:37:47,480 --> 05:37:50,458
and probably shut down fairly quickly

4614
05:37:50,458 --> 05:37:52,920
so threat actors have to be a lot more

4615
05:37:52,920 --> 05:37:54,958
targeted about

4616
05:37:54,958 --> 05:37:57,060
where those potential efficient SMS

4617
05:37:57,060 --> 05:38:00,060
messages are going to

4618
05:38:00,060 --> 05:38:00,958
um

4619
05:38:00,958 --> 05:38:03,180
and that kind of implies difficulty for

4620
05:38:03,180 --> 05:38:06,860
a Defender who wants to run an SMS

4621
05:38:08,218 --> 05:38:09,600
um

4622
05:38:09,600 --> 05:38:12,980
and I call that problem uh in testing or

4623
05:38:12,980 --> 05:38:16,440
listening for the first long while of

4624
05:38:16,440 --> 05:38:18,660
trying to just run a number from polio I

4625
05:38:18,660 --> 05:38:21,060
got nothing until I found out I hope

4626
05:38:21,060 --> 05:38:22,798
that well they actually age their

4627
05:38:22,798 --> 05:38:27,120
numbers until they're satisfied that uh

4628
05:38:27,120 --> 05:38:28,920
no fraudulent messages are being passed

4629
05:38:28,920 --> 05:38:30,480
that number so that's very

4630
05:38:30,480 --> 05:38:33,060
useful if you're not intending to use

4631
05:38:33,060 --> 05:38:35,298
this to receive Melissa

4632
05:38:35,298 --> 05:38:37,378
malicious messages but that's actually

4633
05:38:37,378 --> 05:38:41,420
kind of what we wanted in this project

4634
05:38:42,958 --> 05:38:46,980
um so the idea was that I need to uh

4635
05:38:46,980 --> 05:38:50,218
elicit or entice for actors kind of send

4636
05:38:50,218 --> 05:38:51,600
me a malicious text

4637
05:38:51,600 --> 05:38:54,120
messages and I was kind of in order to

4638
05:38:54,120 --> 05:38:57,000
get things rolling I came up with kind

4639
05:38:57,000 --> 05:39:00,060
of several ideas of how to do that

4640
05:39:00,060 --> 05:39:01,378
um

4641
05:39:01,378 --> 05:39:03,958
and I'll talk about them a little bit

4642
05:39:03,958 --> 05:39:05,580
right now

4643
05:39:05,580 --> 05:39:06,900
uh the first would be direct

4644
05:39:06,900 --> 05:39:08,458
solicitation which I've already done in

4645
05:39:08,458 --> 05:39:11,340
this talk by inviting you to kind of

4646
05:39:11,340 --> 05:39:14,280
send me text messages how many of you

4647
05:39:14,280 --> 05:39:15,420
maybe

4648
05:39:15,420 --> 05:39:18,060
have a defensive socket your place of

4649
05:39:18,060 --> 05:39:19,920
work that has a number for kind of this

4650
05:39:19,920 --> 05:39:22,378
purpose hey if you get a phishing mess

4651
05:39:22,378 --> 05:39:25,138
the on your phone kind of send it to us

4652
05:39:25,138 --> 05:39:28,138
is anybody is that kind of yeah

4653
05:39:28,138 --> 05:39:30,420
um how many of you

4654
05:39:30,420 --> 05:39:35,539
have sent a message to that song number

4655
05:39:36,420 --> 05:39:40,500
so in my view it kind of helps to have a

4656
05:39:40,500 --> 05:39:44,760
more proactive approach in terms of

4657
05:39:44,760 --> 05:39:48,420
uh generating malicious activity towards

4658
05:39:48,420 --> 05:39:51,660
these numbers and I thought of kind of

4659
05:39:51,660 --> 05:39:53,160
ways that you might do that that I think

4660
05:39:53,160 --> 05:39:55,020
kind of takes

4661
05:39:55,020 --> 05:39:56,458
what are typically privacy

4662
05:39:56,458 --> 05:39:58,260
recommendations or ocean recommendations

4663
05:39:58,260 --> 05:40:00,000
and turns them on their head a little

4664
05:40:00,000 --> 05:40:01,080
bit

4665
05:40:01,080 --> 05:40:04,260
in this case you want to expose

4666
05:40:04,260 --> 05:40:05,878
phone numbers that are designed to be

4667
05:40:05,878 --> 05:40:08,400
captured by scrapers or you want to kind

4668
05:40:08,400 --> 05:40:09,900
of expose a sensitive phone number and

4669
05:40:09,900 --> 05:40:11,780
who is information

4670
05:40:11,780 --> 05:40:15,840
maybe you want a exposed database that

4671
05:40:15,840 --> 05:40:17,700
includes a list of

4672
05:40:17,700 --> 05:40:21,298
employees I'm using quotes not that you

4673
05:40:21,298 --> 05:40:22,560
would actually publish a list of your

4674
05:40:22,560 --> 05:40:24,600
employees if we all understand that

4675
05:40:24,600 --> 05:40:25,340
right

4676
05:40:25,340 --> 05:40:28,440
I'm using air quotes to say you can

4677
05:40:28,440 --> 05:40:30,718
generate fit information that includes

4678
05:40:30,718 --> 05:40:34,620
your hunting pot SMS numbers and thereby

4679
05:40:34,620 --> 05:40:37,138
maybe get some more interesting traffic

4680
05:40:37,138 --> 05:40:40,160
in that way

4681
05:40:41,400 --> 05:40:42,360
um

4682
05:40:42,360 --> 05:40:45,240
you can also elicit it by doing things

4683
05:40:45,240 --> 05:40:47,878
that are just generally against privacy

4684
05:40:47,878 --> 05:40:51,000
recommendations things like signing up

4685
05:40:51,000 --> 05:40:54,840
to in a free car at the mall or uh you

4686
05:40:54,840 --> 05:40:57,840
know filling out magazine subscriptions

4687
05:40:57,840 --> 05:41:00,060
um etc etc so those are all options as

4688
05:41:00,060 --> 05:41:00,958
well

4689
05:41:00,958 --> 05:41:01,860
um

4690
05:41:01,860 --> 05:41:04,138
it's not clear how every thread actor

4691
05:41:04,138 --> 05:41:06,298
gets access to kind of

4692
05:41:06,298 --> 05:41:08,820
telephone and personal information that

4693
05:41:08,820 --> 05:41:11,120
they use to Target SMS fishing campaigns

4694
05:41:11,120 --> 05:41:14,040
but a lot of it can be traced back to

4695
05:41:14,040 --> 05:41:17,600
more marketing uh

4696
05:41:17,600 --> 05:41:20,060
generic legitimate marketing activities

4697
05:41:20,060 --> 05:41:22,080
unfortunately there seems to be kind of

4698
05:41:22,080 --> 05:41:24,138
a porous surface between

4699
05:41:24,138 --> 05:41:27,180
those data sets and the thracter

4700
05:41:27,180 --> 05:41:28,680
activity

4701
05:41:28,680 --> 05:41:30,620
um but probably a more substantial

4702
05:41:30,620 --> 05:41:33,120
aspect of how producters acquire this

4703
05:41:33,120 --> 05:41:35,218
targeting information

4704
05:41:35,218 --> 05:41:38,820
um is what we call the dark web I'm sure

4705
05:41:38,820 --> 05:41:40,560
we're all familiar with

4706
05:41:40,560 --> 05:41:44,298
various hacker forums

4707
05:41:44,638 --> 05:41:46,798
um and kind of the breaches and leak

4708
05:41:46,798 --> 05:41:48,420
sections of those forms where threat

4709
05:41:48,420 --> 05:41:50,218
actors will

4710
05:41:50,218 --> 05:41:53,040
hack into websites legally attempt to

4711
05:41:53,040 --> 05:41:56,700
publish personal information

4712
05:41:56,700 --> 05:41:59,580
to the form for the benefit of

4713
05:41:59,580 --> 05:42:02,900
themselves team notoriety Etc

4714
05:42:02,900 --> 05:42:05,160
and that seems to be kind of a major

4715
05:42:05,160 --> 05:42:07,378
Vector for kind of obtaining these

4716
05:42:07,378 --> 05:42:09,600
numbers for threat actors

4717
05:42:09,600 --> 05:42:10,980
and this is where we kind of have to

4718
05:42:10,980 --> 05:42:11,900
talk about

4719
05:42:11,900 --> 05:42:15,420
ethics of kind of running hypots and

4720
05:42:15,420 --> 05:42:18,660
enticing and eliciting activity

4721
05:42:18,660 --> 05:42:20,760
to the Honeypot

4722
05:42:20,760 --> 05:42:22,620
um obviously I'm not a lawyer and I

4723
05:42:22,620 --> 05:42:24,718
would never recommend that anyone here

4724
05:42:24,718 --> 05:42:28,320
break the law certainly uh ever

4725
05:42:28,320 --> 05:42:29,520
um

4726
05:42:29,520 --> 05:42:31,200
but it is kind of an interesting

4727
05:42:31,200 --> 05:42:33,298
experiment to say well

4728
05:42:33,298 --> 05:42:34,920
what if I were to generate some fake

4729
05:42:34,920 --> 05:42:37,920
data and propose it as a lead to these

4730
05:42:37,920 --> 05:42:43,320
forums and say yes these uh seven people

4731
05:42:43,320 --> 05:42:45,900
definitely own cryptocurrency accounts

4732
05:42:45,900 --> 05:42:47,900
in excess of one million dollars

4733
05:42:47,900 --> 05:42:50,458
here are their phone numbers

4734
05:42:50,458 --> 05:42:51,360
um

4735
05:42:51,360 --> 05:42:52,620
I think that that would be an

4736
05:42:52,620 --> 05:42:56,100
interesting tactic to elicit some level

4737
05:42:56,100 --> 05:42:57,718
uh

4738
05:42:57,718 --> 05:42:59,700
activity towards those numbers it might

4739
05:42:59,700 --> 05:43:02,580
not be phishing text messages but it

4740
05:43:02,580 --> 05:43:05,120
might include other kind of more

4741
05:43:05,120 --> 05:43:08,218
sophisticated attacks as well so your

4742
05:43:08,218 --> 05:43:10,500
mileage may vary on that one obviously

4743
05:43:10,500 --> 05:43:12,540
you would never want to expose uh

4744
05:43:12,540 --> 05:43:15,060
personal information of anyone even if

4745
05:43:15,060 --> 05:43:16,560
that's already public information on

4746
05:43:16,560 --> 05:43:18,780
these forms uh to kind of enhance the

4747
05:43:18,780 --> 05:43:21,900
legitimacy see us you know your your

4748
05:43:21,900 --> 05:43:24,660
fake leak is essentially

4749
05:43:24,660 --> 05:43:26,218
um so that's something to be very

4750
05:43:26,218 --> 05:43:27,540
careful about when you're working

4751
05:43:27,540 --> 05:43:30,060
through these problems

4752
05:43:30,060 --> 05:43:32,700
um I know it says in your program uh

4753
05:43:32,700 --> 05:43:35,700
kind of the develop SMS Honeypot I was

4754
05:43:35,700 --> 05:43:38,400
really able to kind of knock out uh 90

4755
05:43:38,400 --> 05:43:40,740
of about what I wanted as far as

4756
05:43:40,740 --> 05:43:42,840
receiving text messages over about a

4757
05:43:42,840 --> 05:43:44,878
weekend but that said it's not quite in

4758
05:43:44,878 --> 05:43:46,020
place where I would feel comfortable

4759
05:43:46,020 --> 05:43:47,820
like demoing it or giving away that code

4760
05:43:47,820 --> 05:43:51,900
uh just yet apologies on that we'll just

4761
05:43:51,900 --> 05:43:54,180
have to take a rain check

4762
05:43:54,180 --> 05:43:55,138
um

4763
05:43:55,138 --> 05:43:56,340
yep

4764
05:43:56,340 --> 05:43:58,860
and that's all the material I have lined

4765
05:43:58,860 --> 05:43:59,700
up

4766
05:43:59,700 --> 05:44:03,620
does anybody want to ask questions

4767
05:44:05,580 --> 05:44:09,200
oh absolutely I would love to

4768
05:44:10,020 --> 05:44:13,378
uh that is nine seven zero three two

4769
05:44:13,378 --> 05:44:15,240
nine nine

4770
05:44:15,240 --> 05:44:17,878
two eight three I promise that I will

4771
05:44:17,878 --> 05:44:21,240
anonymize uh any like from uh numbers

4772
05:44:21,240 --> 05:44:23,040
and information that twilio kind of

4773
05:44:23,040 --> 05:44:24,840
presents to me I

4774
05:44:24,840 --> 05:44:26,580
can't make that promise on behalf of

4775
05:44:26,580 --> 05:44:29,638
twilio unfortunately but in any future

4776
05:44:29,638 --> 05:44:31,440
research or data sets I will absolutely

4777
05:44:31,440 --> 05:44:34,340
be deleting that information

4778
05:44:34,860 --> 05:44:37,320
so if you for example were just test

4779
05:44:37,320 --> 05:44:40,200
that number I'm not publishing uh

4780
05:44:40,200 --> 05:44:43,638
number that it comes from Etc

4781
05:45:04,798 --> 05:45:06,180
but

4782
05:45:06,180 --> 05:45:10,340
you always have bills hey

4783
05:45:18,360 --> 05:45:20,958
certainly

4784
05:45:38,160 --> 05:45:40,160
um

4785
05:46:12,958 --> 05:46:14,280
trouble

4786
05:46:14,280 --> 05:46:16,638
yourself

4787
05:46:18,718 --> 05:46:21,180
um so the first question

4788
05:46:21,180 --> 05:46:23,700
um well there's nothing uh super helpful

4789
05:46:23,700 --> 05:46:26,100
like fish tank

4790
05:46:26,100 --> 05:46:27,600
um I did want to mention that there is

4791
05:46:27,600 --> 05:46:30,600
actually an SEC in Industry uh group

4792
05:46:30,600 --> 05:46:32,878
where you can

4793
05:46:32,878 --> 05:46:35,280
forward any malicious text messages that

4794
05:46:35,280 --> 05:46:38,940
you might get uh that is

4795
05:46:38,940 --> 05:46:41,480
sir

4796
05:46:41,940 --> 05:46:44,180
no

4797
05:46:45,900 --> 05:46:48,840
yes I agree I want them I want to

4798
05:46:48,840 --> 05:46:50,458
publish uh the data that they're getting

4799
05:46:50,458 --> 05:46:52,740
I think that that would be fantastic and

4800
05:46:52,740 --> 05:46:55,680
since it's a public kind of uh

4801
05:46:55,680 --> 05:46:57,540
partnership I feel like that that should

4802
05:46:57,540 --> 05:46:59,298
be uneasy

4803
05:46:59,298 --> 05:47:02,340
forwards and text messages to the number

4804
05:47:02,340 --> 05:47:04,798
spam 7726

4805
05:47:04,798 --> 05:47:07,320
um maybe something magic happens uh but

4806
05:47:07,320 --> 05:47:08,638
like you said yeah they don't share that

4807
05:47:08,638 --> 05:47:10,798
data and it's

4808
05:47:10,798 --> 05:47:13,039
yeah

4809
05:47:13,680 --> 05:47:15,958
yeah it's

4810
05:47:15,958 --> 05:47:18,540
aggravating but I haven't manual so I

4811
05:47:18,540 --> 05:47:21,620
appreciate the opportunity to mention

4812
05:47:21,840 --> 05:47:23,840
Ed

4813
05:47:26,100 --> 05:47:28,980
and the second part as you mentioned

4814
05:47:28,980 --> 05:47:31,500
um yeah limited layers of kind of

4815
05:47:31,500 --> 05:47:34,500
protection for you in terms of SMS uh

4816
05:47:34,500 --> 05:47:36,600
one of those things

4817
05:47:36,600 --> 05:47:38,878
um that you could do is install a a

4818
05:47:38,878 --> 05:47:41,100
service an app a True caller kind of

4819
05:47:41,100 --> 05:47:43,200
came up but I'm in no way like endorsing

4820
05:47:43,200 --> 05:47:45,360
that particular service

4821
05:47:45,360 --> 05:47:46,320
um

4822
05:47:46,320 --> 05:47:49,378
that will kind of supposedly index the

4823
05:47:49,378 --> 05:47:51,058
numbers that call you or text you of

4824
05:47:51,058 --> 05:47:53,340
course yeah give them access to kind of

4825
05:47:53,340 --> 05:47:54,600
this information on your phone which is

4826
05:47:54,600 --> 05:47:57,180
maybe a non-starter for probably most of

4827
05:47:57,180 --> 05:47:58,440
us

4828
05:47:58,440 --> 05:48:00,420
um and we'll supposedly tell you whether

4829
05:48:00,420 --> 05:48:01,798
or not this number is more or less

4830
05:48:01,798 --> 05:48:03,000
trustworthy

4831
05:48:03,000 --> 05:48:04,080
but

4832
05:48:04,080 --> 05:48:05,580
it's your knowledge

4833
05:48:05,580 --> 05:48:08,580
there

4834
05:48:24,298 --> 05:48:26,899
abilities

4835
05:48:56,638 --> 05:48:59,239
I'm sorry

4836
05:49:00,540 --> 05:49:02,540
um

4837
05:49:10,820 --> 05:49:14,480
I'm so curious

4838
05:49:19,500 --> 05:49:21,780
thank you for allowing me clarify

4839
05:49:21,780 --> 05:49:25,020
I think so so

4840
05:49:25,020 --> 05:49:26,820
I don't have any internal information as

4841
05:49:26,820 --> 05:49:29,820
to what goes on at ctia FCC around like

4842
05:49:29,820 --> 05:49:31,080
the spam

4843
05:49:31,080 --> 05:49:33,718
number but it is aggravating that it's

4844
05:49:33,718 --> 05:49:35,100
kind of a black hole for us as threat

4845
05:49:35,100 --> 05:49:36,480
researchers to get no information back

4846
05:49:36,480 --> 05:49:38,400
about you know did this change

4847
05:49:38,400 --> 05:49:40,440
something are other people being

4848
05:49:40,440 --> 05:49:42,360
targeted do I need to warn my customers

4849
05:49:42,360 --> 05:49:44,580
uh this week that it might be increased

4850
05:49:44,580 --> 05:49:46,860
phishing attacks against them uh that

4851
05:49:46,860 --> 05:49:48,180
kind of thing

4852
05:49:48,180 --> 05:49:48,780
um

4853
05:49:48,780 --> 05:49:52,440
so that's kind of very aggravating to me

4854
05:49:52,440 --> 05:49:54,600
personally I assume that there were

4855
05:49:54,600 --> 05:49:57,000
looking for for everyone's uh best

4856
05:49:57,000 --> 05:49:58,620
interest

4857
05:49:58,620 --> 05:50:02,700
um but but I will fingers crossed and I

4858
05:50:02,700 --> 05:50:03,900
would like to you know have my own

4859
05:50:03,900 --> 05:50:05,820
sensors on that Network I would like to

4860
05:50:05,820 --> 05:50:07,378
understand what's actually happening

4861
05:50:07,378 --> 05:50:10,200
rather than trusting their uh

4862
05:50:10,200 --> 05:50:13,200
you know diligent work

4863
05:50:13,200 --> 05:50:15,540
um I would also

4864
05:50:15,540 --> 05:50:16,860
kind of mention like yeah there does

4865
05:50:16,860 --> 05:50:18,058
seem to be a

4866
05:50:18,058 --> 05:50:20,458
kind of prefer first incentive thing

4867
05:50:20,458 --> 05:50:22,680
happening as far as SMS and how that's

4868
05:50:22,680 --> 05:50:24,420
handled

4869
05:50:24,420 --> 05:50:25,680
um

4870
05:50:25,680 --> 05:50:28,320
in terms of where does disruptable

4871
05:50:28,320 --> 05:50:31,138
information or information on reputation

4872
05:50:31,138 --> 05:50:33,660
different numbers actually go uh like

4873
05:50:33,660 --> 05:50:36,480
you mentioned Google for email that's

4874
05:50:36,480 --> 05:50:38,700
one of the great filters of spam and

4875
05:50:38,700 --> 05:50:40,558
fishing on the internet right

4876
05:50:40,558 --> 05:50:42,360
account is it doesn't go to your mom's

4877
05:50:42,360 --> 05:50:43,980
Gmail address because Google just

4878
05:50:43,980 --> 05:50:46,820
recognize it as a Spam Port fishing

4879
05:50:46,820 --> 05:50:49,798
and the exit out of the queue

4880
05:50:49,798 --> 05:50:52,860
um so there's some benefit I think

4881
05:50:52,860 --> 05:50:56,280
system of that but I'm equally uh

4882
05:50:56,280 --> 05:50:58,320
skeptical of that as I am any other

4883
05:50:58,320 --> 05:51:01,260
party I would prefer to have sensors

4884
05:51:01,260 --> 05:51:03,240
myself and I'm sure most of you would

4885
05:51:03,240 --> 05:51:05,480
feel the same right do we like having

4886
05:51:05,480 --> 05:51:07,740
equipment that doesn't provide us

4887
05:51:07,740 --> 05:51:10,558
meaningful diagnostic information well

4888
05:51:10,558 --> 05:51:13,280
usually not

4889
05:51:14,400 --> 05:51:16,138
yeah

4890
05:51:16,138 --> 05:51:19,039
oh sorry

4891
05:51:31,980 --> 05:51:33,780
oh gosh uh you're really taking that

4892
05:51:33,780 --> 05:51:35,820
initial uh

4893
05:51:35,820 --> 05:51:38,700
uh these are my opinions and things I'm

4894
05:51:38,700 --> 05:51:41,160
making making that do the maximum amount

4895
05:51:41,160 --> 05:51:43,138
of work

4896
05:51:43,138 --> 05:51:46,378
yeah that's I don't particularly have an

4897
05:51:46,378 --> 05:51:48,120
opinion I'd like to just kind of live in

4898
05:51:48,120 --> 05:51:50,040
the now and this is kind of the shape of

4899
05:51:50,040 --> 05:51:52,320
things at the moment and this is kind of

4900
05:51:52,320 --> 05:51:54,840
what we have to deal with so

4901
05:51:54,840 --> 05:51:58,200
um ideally this kind of

4902
05:51:58,200 --> 05:52:01,500
expand information would be more or less

4903
05:52:01,500 --> 05:52:03,780
public it'd be a place I would like it

4904
05:52:03,780 --> 05:52:05,100
to be a little

4905
05:52:05,100 --> 05:52:06,840
bit like fish tank where you can kind of

4906
05:52:06,840 --> 05:52:08,520
go and look these things obviously

4907
05:52:08,520 --> 05:52:10,440
get an idea of who's being targeted this

4908
05:52:10,440 --> 05:52:12,660
weekend uh who we should be concerned

4909
05:52:12,660 --> 05:52:14,718
about

4910
05:52:16,558 --> 05:52:18,180
all right well thank you all so much for

4911

last Talk of the day we've got Christian

4931
05:57:22,400 --> 05:57:25,080
and presentations and Ducks teach us how

4932
05:57:25,080 --> 05:57:27,180
to share what hunting quack bought and

4933
05:57:27,180 --> 05:57:30,180
other threats teach us about CTI

4934
05:57:30,180 --> 05:57:32,580
hey everybody

4935
05:57:32,580 --> 05:57:34,860
some familiar faces filtering in a room

4936
05:57:34,860 --> 05:57:36,000
so I'll give you guys a moment to get

4937
05:57:36,000 --> 05:57:38,100
settled but

4938
05:57:38,100 --> 05:57:41,160
I'm back excited for this talk I guess

4939
05:57:41,160 --> 05:57:43,200
my co-workers told me last year um my

4940
05:57:43,200 --> 05:57:44,580
live stream was in this room so I

4941
05:57:44,580 --> 05:57:46,138
decided to come

4942
05:57:46,138 --> 05:57:48,840
out and be here in person for this talk

4943
05:57:48,840 --> 05:57:49,680
and

4944
05:57:49,680 --> 05:57:51,240
um

4945
05:57:51,240 --> 05:57:53,040
yeah let's get let's get right into it I

4946
05:57:53,040 --> 05:57:54,420
just want to get some obligatory stuff

4947
05:57:54,420 --> 05:57:57,000
about me I'm involved with a lot of

4948
05:57:57,000 --> 05:57:58,200
different groups and I'm really excited

4949
05:57:58,200 --> 05:57:59,218
to be a part of this community I'm

4950
05:57:59,218 --> 05:58:00,480
encourage you guys to get involved in

4951
05:58:00,480 --> 05:58:02,340
the community

4952
05:58:02,340 --> 05:58:03,780
um the ones I wanted to kind of point

4953
05:58:03,780 --> 05:58:05,458
out that'll be relevant really relevant

4954
05:58:05,458 --> 05:58:08,340
for this talk are my day job I work at

4955
05:58:08,340 --> 05:58:10,440
Grand Canyon Education data with Grand

4956
05:58:10,440 --> 05:58:13,020
Canyon University and uh the Acura

4957
05:58:13,020 --> 05:58:14,340
organization if you've heard of that

4958
05:58:14,340 --> 05:58:15,958
it's the Arizona cyber threat response

4959
05:58:15,958 --> 05:58:18,298
Alliance and that's where

4960
05:58:18,298 --> 05:58:19,860
a lot of the conversation is going to

4961
05:58:19,860 --> 05:58:21,180
intersect is this

4962
05:58:21,180 --> 05:58:22,920
um taking threat intelligence consuming

4963
05:58:22,920 --> 05:58:25,020
it we're gonna focus on the quack bot I

4964
05:58:25,020 --> 05:58:26,100
was got to talk to a lot of people at

4965
05:58:26,100 --> 05:58:27,480
the conference I was

4966
05:58:27,480 --> 05:58:29,700
excited to see a lot of people have some

4967
05:58:29,700 --> 05:58:31,558
familiarity with it which is really

4968
05:58:31,558 --> 05:58:33,180
great I that's one of the reasons I

4969
05:58:33,180 --> 05:58:37,200
selected this piece of malware and

4970
05:58:37,200 --> 05:58:38,160
um

4971
05:58:38,160 --> 05:58:40,080
some disclaimer my thoughts are my own

4972
05:58:40,080 --> 05:58:42,180
my opinions are my own if there's silly

4973
05:58:42,180 --> 05:58:43,440
silly opinions that don't age well

4974
05:58:43,440 --> 05:58:46,500
they're not reflect on the organization

4975
05:58:46,500 --> 05:58:50,820
but it's also not fairly true because a

4976
05:58:50,820 --> 05:58:52,440
lot of my teams sitting here and a lot

4977
05:58:52,440 --> 05:58:54,058
of people I work with in actra are

4978
05:58:54,058 --> 05:58:56,458
sitting up here so reality is

4979
05:58:56,458 --> 05:58:58,020
um my opinions on my own this talk but

4980
05:58:58,020 --> 05:58:59,400
this is really a culmination of a lot of

4981
05:58:59,400 --> 05:59:00,660
people's ideas and experiences over

4982
05:59:00,660 --> 05:59:02,040
several years of trying to do in threat

4983
05:59:02,040 --> 05:59:03,120
intelligence

4984
05:59:03,120 --> 05:59:06,480
strong and trying to do it well and so

4985
05:59:06,480 --> 05:59:09,500
coffee by the way

4986
05:59:10,378 --> 05:59:13,558
um so uh a lot of what I'm going to talk

4987
05:59:13,558 --> 05:59:15,120
about I've there's public information

4988
05:59:15,120 --> 05:59:16,920
about there so I just wanted to kind of

4989
05:59:16,920 --> 05:59:18,780
encourage almost

4990
05:59:18,780 --> 05:59:20,458
everything I'm talking about I have

4991
05:59:20,458 --> 05:59:21,900
public resources for if you're kind of

4992
05:59:21,900 --> 05:59:23,040
curious about it to dive into the

4993
05:59:23,040 --> 05:59:24,660
details we'll get to go through some of

4994
05:59:24,660 --> 05:59:27,780
the details um which is super exciting

4995
05:59:27,780 --> 05:59:29,520
but then if there's anything more

4996
05:59:29,520 --> 05:59:31,138
interesting or kind of wanting to

4997
05:59:31,138 --> 05:59:33,320
perform these threat hunts yourself

4998
05:59:33,320 --> 05:59:35,878
there's a guides actually that I have

4999
05:59:35,878 --> 05:59:37,980
available to do these hunts in the lab

5000
05:59:37,980 --> 05:59:39,360
or to do these at your own organization

5001
05:59:39,360 --> 05:59:43,040
so if that's interesting to you

5002
05:59:43,080 --> 05:59:44,760
um

5003
05:59:44,760 --> 05:59:46,080
oops

5004
05:59:46,080 --> 05:59:49,638
all right and

5005
05:59:50,040 --> 05:59:51,840
yeah yeah this is my Linux yeah it's

5006
05:59:51,840 --> 05:59:53,218
probably missing a driver there didn't

5007
05:59:53,218 --> 05:59:55,500
pay Microsoft for the right driver

5008
05:59:55,500 --> 05:59:57,180
but

5009
05:59:57,180 --> 05:59:59,820
anyways it's Christian t.io is just a

5010
05:59:59,820 --> 06:00:01,440
site that has all those hunts and

5011
06:00:01,440 --> 06:00:02,638
resources

5012
06:00:02,638 --> 06:00:05,180
so

5013
06:00:05,458 --> 06:00:07,138
all right

5014
06:00:07,138 --> 06:00:09,420
so the objectives of the agenda um

5015
06:00:09,420 --> 06:00:12,000
pretty straightforward uh we're gonna

5016
06:00:12,000 --> 06:00:13,740
walk through

5017
06:00:13,740 --> 06:00:16,260
um I want to talk about the definitions

5018
06:00:16,260 --> 06:00:17,820
that we're going to be using because

5019
06:00:17,820 --> 06:00:19,138
there's a lot of different things that

5020
06:00:19,138 --> 06:00:20,160
people think about when you talk about

5021
06:00:20,160 --> 06:00:22,020
threat hunting and threat intelligence

5022
06:00:22,020 --> 06:00:24,080
so I kind of want to level set the

5023
06:00:24,080 --> 06:00:27,000
fields and spend some time talking about

5024
06:00:27,000 --> 06:00:29,218
those terms and what what definitions

5025
06:00:29,218 --> 06:00:31,200
we'll be using for

5026
06:00:31,200 --> 06:00:32,218
um

5027
06:00:32,218 --> 06:00:33,718
for kind of the duration of this talk

5028
06:00:33,718 --> 06:00:36,600
and then we're going to go over trying

5029
06:00:36,600 --> 06:00:37,980
to threat hunt on zero days but for

5030
06:00:37,980 --> 06:00:39,718
intelligence which is kind of

5031
06:00:39,718 --> 06:00:41,280
interesting answer post question heads

5032
06:00:41,280 --> 06:00:43,980
about that one we do this often we're

5033
06:00:43,980 --> 06:00:46,500
going to go into quack block

5034
06:00:46,500 --> 06:00:47,820
certainly

5035
06:00:47,820 --> 06:00:49,980
and we're going to talk about how these

5036
06:00:49,980 --> 06:00:51,620
threats are kind of adopting both

5037
06:00:51,620 --> 06:00:53,820
hunting and threat intelligence and

5038
06:00:53,820 --> 06:00:54,958
implications

5039
06:00:54,958 --> 06:00:57,900
they have briefly talk about the history

5040
06:00:57,900 --> 06:01:00,058
of the of these disciplines in our

5041
06:01:00,058 --> 06:01:01,500
industry overall

5042
06:01:01,500 --> 06:01:03,360
the different tools and Frameworks that

5043
06:01:03,360 --> 06:01:04,200
we have

5044
06:01:04,200 --> 06:01:07,020
to be able to operationalize those

5045
06:01:07,020 --> 06:01:09,240
and then finally wrap it up with how you

5046
06:01:09,240 --> 06:01:11,458
guys can pull out every presentation the

5047
06:01:11,458 --> 06:01:13,740
goal should be to take action into

5048
06:01:13,740 --> 06:01:15,480
that affect some sort of change so

5049
06:01:15,480 --> 06:01:18,058
whether you're just learning and wanting

5050
06:01:18,058 --> 06:01:19,260
to contribute to the threat intelligence

5051
06:01:19,260 --> 06:01:20,638
Community or you're at your own

5052
06:01:20,638 --> 06:01:22,680
organization you have some time

5053
06:01:22,680 --> 06:01:26,160
to spend on Fret hunting but you want to

5054
06:01:26,160 --> 06:01:27,600
do so with effectively and efficiently

5055
06:01:27,600 --> 06:01:28,980
and hustling to show for at the end of

5056
06:01:28,980 --> 06:01:29,760
the day

5057
06:01:29,760 --> 06:01:33,440
um we'll get to talk about those as well

5058
06:01:35,160 --> 06:01:36,840
so

5059
06:01:36,840 --> 06:01:37,980
thank you

5060
06:01:37,980 --> 06:01:41,760
gotcha interesting well let me just take

5061
06:01:41,760 --> 06:01:43,440
a quick moment

5062
06:01:43,440 --> 06:01:46,160
to see

5063
06:01:57,420 --> 06:02:00,360
well the next technical difficulties but

5064
06:02:00,360 --> 06:02:01,798
we'll see

5065
06:02:01,798 --> 06:02:04,940
if we can

5066
06:02:07,200 --> 06:02:09,298
hey that's great

5067
06:02:09,298 --> 06:02:10,620
just told that they're the whole

5068
06:02:10,620 --> 06:02:13,458
presentation if that's okay

5069
06:02:15,298 --> 06:02:17,940
all right so um there's two hats that I

5070
06:02:17,940 --> 06:02:19,200
wear and I encourage you guys whatever

5071
06:02:19,200 --> 06:02:21,180
hat whatever side of the house you um

5072
06:02:21,180 --> 06:02:23,760
relate to more

5073
06:02:23,760 --> 06:02:25,860
take adopt that mind setting that adopt

5074
06:02:25,860 --> 06:02:28,080
that perspective but in threat

5075
06:02:28,080 --> 06:02:30,420
intelligence there's consuming uh threat

5076
06:02:30,420 --> 06:02:33,660
intelligence and uh creating it and like

5077
06:02:33,660 --> 06:02:35,160
I said through the actual organization

5078
06:02:35,160 --> 06:02:36,780
and other organizations

5079
06:02:36,780 --> 06:02:38,760
stations that I get to work with many

5080
06:02:38,760 --> 06:02:40,500
people in the room in

5081
06:02:40,500 --> 06:02:41,940
um we are trying

5082
06:02:41,940 --> 06:02:43,558
to generate fret intelligence we're

5083
06:02:43,558 --> 06:02:44,280
trying to create something that's

5084
06:02:44,280 --> 06:02:48,058
actionable and usable for the recipients

5085
06:02:48,058 --> 06:02:51,058
and then also I want to be able to take

5086
06:02:51,058 --> 06:02:52,260
action and be able to utilize that

5087
06:02:52,260 --> 06:02:53,580
threat intelligence too so these are

5088
06:02:53,580 --> 06:02:55,080
some of the attributes about that

5089
06:02:55,080 --> 06:02:56,280
intelligence that we look forward to

5090
06:02:56,280 --> 06:02:57,840
make sure it's useful make sure it's

5091
06:02:57,840 --> 06:03:00,900
recent we want we don't want to just be

5092
06:03:00,900 --> 06:03:02,218
spending a bunch of clock Cycles or

5093
06:03:02,218 --> 06:03:04,680
Worse human hours on trying to consume

5094
06:03:04,680 --> 06:03:07,500
threat intelligence that's either dead

5095
06:03:07,500 --> 06:03:10,920
outdated or already it's pertaining to a

5096
06:03:10,920 --> 06:03:12,000
threat that we're already going to be

5097
06:03:12,000 --> 06:03:14,160
blocking with our automated security

5098
06:03:14,160 --> 06:03:16,440
controls anyways

5099
06:03:16,440 --> 06:03:17,700
so

5100
06:03:17,700 --> 06:03:20,298
oops

5101
06:03:22,260 --> 06:03:24,920
all right

5102
06:03:27,840 --> 06:03:31,320
so we've the industry's been doing uh

5103
06:03:31,320 --> 06:03:33,480
threat intelligence uh for quite some

5104
06:03:33,480 --> 06:03:35,100
time and I think we've gotten really

5105
06:03:35,100 --> 06:03:36,718
good at identifying what sort of threats

5106
06:03:36,718 --> 06:03:38,100
are worth spend our time doing threat

5107
06:03:38,100 --> 06:03:39,480
Intelligence on

5108
06:03:39,480 --> 06:03:41,280
how we disseminate that intelligence is

5109
06:03:41,280 --> 06:03:43,680
a little bit difficult we're gonna

5110
06:03:43,680 --> 06:03:46,200
um we we not I'm not just talking about

5111
06:03:46,200 --> 06:03:50,218
lists of iocs and threat and tell feeds

5112
06:03:50,218 --> 06:03:51,600
um

5113
06:03:51,600 --> 06:03:54,420
so I wanted to actually talk about what

5114
06:03:54,420 --> 06:03:56,280
type of threat intelligence and kind of

5115
06:03:56,280 --> 06:03:58,440
go over what there's more there's threat

5116
06:03:58,440 --> 06:04:00,660
intelligence than those Feats

5117
06:04:00,660 --> 06:04:03,240
um this is a really good definition that

5118
06:04:03,240 --> 06:04:06,540
I liked about threat intelligence

5119
06:04:06,540 --> 06:04:09,260
sorry let me

5120
06:04:11,520 --> 06:04:13,440
all right uh data that's collected

5121
06:04:13,440 --> 06:04:15,000
process analyzed to understand the

5122
06:04:15,000 --> 06:04:16,200
threat actors

5123
06:04:16,200 --> 06:04:19,080
motives targets and attack behaviors and

5124
06:04:19,080 --> 06:04:20,820
ultimately there's a lot of different

5125
06:04:20,820 --> 06:04:23,400
goals depending on what how you're using

5126
06:04:23,400 --> 06:04:24,780
threat intelligence business

5127
06:04:24,780 --> 06:04:27,120
intelligence analysts can use that to

5128
06:04:27,120 --> 06:04:29,160
try to quantitate risk

5129
06:04:29,160 --> 06:04:30,900
um you might want to understand the

5130
06:04:30,900 --> 06:04:32,520
landscape for your organization what

5131
06:04:32,520 --> 06:04:34,620
sort of adversaries you might be facing

5132
06:04:34,620 --> 06:04:37,080
what sort of threats you might want to

5133
06:04:37,080 --> 06:04:38,638
invest in security controls to defend

5134
06:04:38,638 --> 06:04:39,480
against

5135
06:04:39,480 --> 06:04:41,280
you might be looking to triage faster if

5136
06:04:41,280 --> 06:04:42,840
you're in a sock you might be wanting to

5137
06:04:42,840 --> 06:04:44,280
rush your instance to give additional

5138
06:04:44,280 --> 06:04:45,718
context if you're in a soccer instant

5139
06:04:45,718 --> 06:04:47,340
response so there's a lot of different

5140
06:04:47,340 --> 06:04:49,798
use cases for this threat intelligence

5141
06:04:49,798 --> 06:04:52,200
but what we're

5142
06:04:52,200 --> 06:04:54,120
looking at I'm second guessing now

5143
06:04:54,120 --> 06:04:55,620
making sure it's up on

5144
06:04:55,620 --> 06:04:57,180
um

5145
06:04:57,180 --> 06:04:58,680
but what we're wanting to get into with

5146
06:04:58,680 --> 06:05:00,900
threat intelligence really in a day is

5147
06:05:00,900 --> 06:05:02,638
this idea of an adversarial intelligence

5148
06:05:02,638 --> 06:05:05,940
feedback loop something popularized by

5149
06:05:05,940 --> 06:05:08,520
Lockheed Martin's on publication in 2010

5150
06:05:08,520 --> 06:05:10,378
that included the introduction of the

5151
06:05:10,378 --> 06:05:12,900
build chain but it's but there's this

5152
06:05:12,900 --> 06:05:15,360
idea that with each additional attack in

5153
06:05:15,360 --> 06:05:17,340
the adversary Liam we learn more about

5154
06:05:17,340 --> 06:05:20,040
them and we use that information that

5155
06:05:20,040 --> 06:05:21,120
use intelligence to reduce the

5156
06:05:21,120 --> 06:05:22,620
likelihood of a material impact to

5157
06:05:22,620 --> 06:05:25,080
organization because this fund on the

5158
06:05:25,080 --> 06:05:26,638
threat research side to just research

5159
06:05:26,638 --> 06:05:28,080
threats and adversaries for the sake of

5160
06:05:28,080 --> 06:05:29,100
it

5161
06:05:29,100 --> 06:05:30,780
but really what we're wanting to

5162
06:05:30,780 --> 06:05:32,638
accomplish is to reduce the likelihood

5163
06:05:32,638 --> 06:05:36,840
that their next attack be successful

5164
06:05:36,840 --> 06:05:38,580
um so we can use that threat

5165
06:05:38,580 --> 06:05:40,080
intelligence to inform our own defenses

5166
06:05:40,080 --> 06:05:41,160
at our own

5167
06:05:41,160 --> 06:05:43,500
organizations or what I get excited

5168
06:05:43,500 --> 06:05:45,120
about is we can share that information

5169
06:05:45,120 --> 06:05:47,520
with others at other organizations

5170
06:05:47,520 --> 06:05:49,020
um so that they can benefit from our

5171
06:05:49,020 --> 06:05:50,280
experiences in the past and a lot of six

5172
06:05:50,280 --> 06:05:52,680
cyber security vendors do this for us

5173
06:05:52,680 --> 06:05:53,760
there's a lot of really good research

5174
06:05:53,760 --> 06:05:55,740
companies a lot of big money involved in

5175
06:05:55,740 --> 06:05:56,700
this

5176
06:05:56,700 --> 06:05:57,298
um

5177
06:05:57,298 --> 06:05:59,218
a lot of us in the room probably

5178
06:05:59,218 --> 06:06:00,718
consumed threat intelligence feeds but

5179
06:06:00,718 --> 06:06:02,638
like I said there's a

5180
06:06:02,638 --> 06:06:04,860
there's a quite a depth and a

5181
06:06:04,860 --> 06:06:08,218
breath to threat intelligence so I don't

5182
06:06:08,218 --> 06:06:09,540
want to just

5183
06:06:09,540 --> 06:06:11,660
um

5184
06:06:12,840 --> 06:06:14,400
indicators of attack indicators of

5185
06:06:14,400 --> 06:06:16,378
compromise is there something that we

5186
06:06:16,378 --> 06:06:18,540
know um the longevity

5187
06:06:18,540 --> 06:06:20,160
the likelihood that they'll be useful

5188
06:06:20,160 --> 06:06:21,120
for us

5189
06:06:21,120 --> 06:06:22,378
they've been diminishing an industry as

5190
06:06:22,378 --> 06:06:24,298
adversaries go more ephemeral so this is

5191
06:06:24,298 --> 06:06:25,680
a new concept of us we call as the

5192
06:06:25,680 --> 06:06:27,900
parent of pain it's been

5193
06:06:27,900 --> 06:06:28,860
um

5194
06:06:28,860 --> 06:06:31,680
used to communicate this idea that some

5195
06:06:31,680 --> 06:06:33,180
of the intelligence that we gather from

5196
06:06:33,180 --> 06:06:34,920
attacks that are successful or not

5197
06:06:34,920 --> 06:06:37,020
successful

5198
06:06:37,020 --> 06:06:38,520
um there there's varying levels of how

5199
06:06:38,520 --> 06:06:39,780
difficult it is for an adversary to

5200
06:06:39,780 --> 06:06:41,940
change that right so uh the indicators

5201
06:06:41,940 --> 06:06:44,218
that we share in these feeds that's

5202
06:06:44,218 --> 06:06:45,780
trivial for adversaries to change these

5203
06:06:45,780 --> 06:06:46,680
days

5204
06:06:46,680 --> 06:06:47,638
um especially if you're looking at

5205
06:06:47,638 --> 06:06:49,260
adversary that uses automation automated

5206
06:06:49,260 --> 06:06:50,340
infrastructure

5207
06:06:50,340 --> 06:06:53,600
or leverages botnets but wholesale

5208
06:06:53,600 --> 06:06:55,558
changing your tools tactics and

5209
06:06:55,558 --> 06:06:57,000
procedures we know that's more difficult

5210
06:06:57,000 --> 06:06:59,820
so we like to focus on those but this is

5211
06:06:59,820 --> 06:07:01,798
really mature conceptually

5212
06:07:01,798 --> 06:07:03,298
um it's well understood in our community

5213
06:07:03,298 --> 06:07:05,638
but it's really hard to take action on

5214
06:07:05,638 --> 06:07:07,558
how do you actually look in your

5215
06:07:07,558 --> 06:07:09,718
environment for the tools well the tools

5216
06:07:09,718 --> 06:07:10,920
you might look for signatures but really

5217
06:07:10,920 --> 06:07:12,120
when we're talking about the new pack

5218
06:07:12,120 --> 06:07:14,340
needs 7 adversaries using the stuff that

5219
06:07:14,340 --> 06:07:15,900
they learn something works for them

5220
06:07:15,900 --> 06:07:17,160
they're keep doing that how do we

5221
06:07:17,160 --> 06:07:18,900
actually take that

5222
06:07:18,900 --> 06:07:20,638
and apply it to our organization in a

5223
06:07:20,638 --> 06:07:22,320
way that reduces their chances of being

5224
06:07:22,320 --> 06:07:23,940
successful so that's what we're gonna

5225
06:07:23,940 --> 06:07:25,200
we're gonna

5226
06:07:25,200 --> 06:07:26,760
go on to and I don't want to be

5227
06:07:26,760 --> 06:07:28,080
misunderstood I'm not saying that the

5228
06:07:28,080 --> 06:07:30,120
ioc is dead or that cyber observables

5229
06:07:30,120 --> 06:07:31,798
are dead I think there's a lot of

5230
06:07:31,798 --> 06:07:35,100
um value that I I've seen us like as

5231
06:07:35,100 --> 06:07:37,200
we're putting on my hat for GCE I've

5232
06:07:37,200 --> 06:07:39,420
seen getting value out of that

5233
06:07:39,420 --> 06:07:41,480
um

5234
06:07:41,520 --> 06:07:43,440
and sometimes when we're producing

5235
06:07:43,440 --> 06:07:45,180
intelligence we add those in reports and

5236
06:07:45,180 --> 06:07:46,740
it's like why not they're they're cheap

5237
06:07:46,740 --> 06:07:49,080
both computationally

5238
06:07:49,080 --> 06:07:51,240
they're cheap for human skills to

5239
06:07:51,240 --> 06:07:52,440
produce we can extract them very easily

5240
06:07:52,440 --> 06:07:54,000
it's an easy way to communicate humans

5241
06:07:54,000 --> 06:07:54,900
can read

5242
06:07:54,900 --> 06:07:55,980
if they know what they're looking at

5243
06:07:55,980 --> 06:07:57,180
computers can read it they know what

5244
06:07:57,180 --> 06:07:58,260
they're looking at and we have a lot of

5245
06:07:58,260 --> 06:07:59,820
mature processes around that so this

5246
06:07:59,820 --> 06:08:01,500
isn't just saying I have a picture of a

5247
06:08:01,500 --> 06:08:04,138
GitHub here with crocbot iocs that we

5248
06:08:04,138 --> 06:08:05,520
aggregate

5249
06:08:05,520 --> 06:08:07,740
in their September search that you all

5250
06:08:07,740 --> 06:08:10,200
saw but

5251
06:08:10,200 --> 06:08:12,120
those were they're still

5252
06:08:12,120 --> 06:08:15,540
very ephemeral and uh so I don't think

5253
06:08:15,540 --> 06:08:17,040
we should be abandoning these but these

5254
06:08:17,040 --> 06:08:18,718
certainly aren't what we're going to be

5255
06:08:18,718 --> 06:08:21,780
using it today to stop the adversaries

5256
06:08:21,780 --> 06:08:24,000
that we're afraid of that are bypassing

5257
06:08:24,000 --> 06:08:25,200
a lot of our existing security control

5258
06:08:25,200 --> 06:08:26,820
because a lot of great vendors consume

5259
06:08:26,820 --> 06:08:28,138
this stuff and give it put it out to us

5260
06:08:28,138 --> 06:08:31,080
very quickly and efficiently so it's you

5261
06:08:31,080 --> 06:08:33,240
just have to consider the timeliness of

5262
06:08:33,240 --> 06:08:34,558
those indicators and compromise that we

5263
06:08:34,558 --> 06:08:36,058
want to use them effectively

5264
06:08:36,058 --> 06:08:38,878
um if you're if you're going to be using

5265
06:08:38,878 --> 06:08:40,138
them for

5266
06:08:40,138 --> 06:08:41,580
active defensive measure again it's

5267
06:08:41,580 --> 06:08:44,100
computationally cheap why not but

5268
06:08:44,100 --> 06:08:46,260
I think where they uh hold

5269
06:08:46,260 --> 06:08:48,180
their value a lot longer is looking at

5270
06:08:48,180 --> 06:08:49,440
historical searches this is where we

5271
06:08:49,440 --> 06:08:51,480
start to get into this idea of of threat

5272
06:08:51,480 --> 06:08:52,558
hunting

5273
06:08:52,558 --> 06:08:55,080
um and using this data

5274
06:08:55,080 --> 06:08:56,820
retroactively so that's a little bit

5275
06:08:56,820 --> 06:08:58,558
about the intelligence what's the threat

5276
06:08:58,558 --> 06:09:00,240
hunting as you start to look at those

5277
06:09:00,240 --> 06:09:02,280
lines intersecting this is kind of the

5278
06:09:02,280 --> 06:09:04,558
next side of this conversation

5279
06:09:04,558 --> 06:09:06,180
um the purpose defined threat hunting

5280
06:09:06,180 --> 06:09:08,520
needs to be something like

5281
06:09:08,520 --> 06:09:10,260
reducing the like

5282
06:09:10,260 --> 06:09:12,000
likelihood of material impact due to

5283
06:09:12,000 --> 06:09:13,860
cyber attacks so and that was kind of a

5284
06:09:13,860 --> 06:09:15,000
part of

5285
06:09:15,000 --> 06:09:16,260
the definition I use for threat

5286
06:09:16,260 --> 06:09:18,120
intelligence too the value that we want

5287
06:09:18,120 --> 06:09:19,500
to extract from the bank

5288
06:09:19,500 --> 06:09:20,940
um and this is a good thing to check

5289
06:09:20,940 --> 06:09:21,958
your own threat hunting practices

5290
06:09:21,958 --> 06:09:23,638
against there are ways and if you're

5291
06:09:23,638 --> 06:09:24,480
curious

5292
06:09:24,480 --> 06:09:25,798
about this

5293
06:09:25,798 --> 06:09:28,080
um ironically I talked last year for

5294
06:09:28,080 --> 06:09:29,878
cactus con uh I went into detail about

5295
06:09:29,878 --> 06:09:31,500
how you can do this taking a statistical

5296
06:09:31,500 --> 06:09:33,058
and

5297
06:09:33,058 --> 06:09:34,740
some threatened intelligence driven

5298
06:09:34,740 --> 06:09:37,260
approach to performing threat hunting

5299
06:09:37,260 --> 06:09:38,700
and then measuring that and making sure

5300
06:09:38,700 --> 06:09:40,200
that we're growing and maturing and not

5301
06:09:40,200 --> 06:09:41,760
just spinning our Wheels

5302
06:09:41,760 --> 06:09:46,399
uh spinning our Wheels to no effect

5303
06:09:46,620 --> 06:09:47,218
but

5304
06:09:47,218 --> 06:09:51,058
um threat hunting uh can I think is best

5305
06:09:51,058 --> 06:09:52,378
and it's going to be most efficient one

5306
06:09:52,378 --> 06:09:53,940
is informed or driven

5307
06:09:53,940 --> 06:09:55,680
by something I think there's a case to

5308
06:09:55,680 --> 06:09:57,058
make but we can use the threat

5309
06:09:57,058 --> 06:09:58,558
intelligence about the evasive threats

5310
06:09:58,558 --> 06:10:00,000
that we face today

5311
06:10:00,000 --> 06:10:02,340
um we can use those that intelligence to

5312
06:10:02,340 --> 06:10:04,260
inform the fact that we actually go into

5313
06:10:04,260 --> 06:10:06,120
our environment

5314
06:10:06,120 --> 06:10:08,638
and create but threat hunting in general

5315
06:10:08,638 --> 06:10:11,700
just in case this is a new New Concept

5316
06:10:11,700 --> 06:10:12,840
for some or I think it's kind of a

5317
06:10:12,840 --> 06:10:14,160
misunderstood Concept in the industry a

5318
06:10:14,160 --> 06:10:15,540
little bit too and I certainly have

5319
06:10:15,540 --> 06:10:17,340
learned a lot about it in less of four

5320
06:10:17,340 --> 06:10:19,620
years is it's it's very involves a lot

5321
06:10:19,620 --> 06:10:21,000
of creativity

5322
06:10:21,000 --> 06:10:21,780
um

5323
06:10:21,780 --> 06:10:24,420
it's uh curiosity driven it's

5324
06:10:24,420 --> 06:10:25,860
explorative it's using your own

5325
06:10:25,860 --> 06:10:28,200
environment using Telemetry sometimes

5326
06:10:28,200 --> 06:10:29,340
that you wouldn't maybe have thought of

5327
06:10:29,340 --> 06:10:30,540
to use just for

5328
06:10:30,540 --> 06:10:32,340
cyber security data we're not looking at

5329
06:10:32,340 --> 06:10:34,260
the detections itself you know we're

5330
06:10:34,260 --> 06:10:37,260
looking at perhaps we're looking at

5331
06:10:37,260 --> 06:10:41,040
Telemetry generated by those devices

5332
06:10:41,040 --> 06:10:43,138
um just try to identify attacks that are

5333
06:10:43,138 --> 06:10:45,360
depressions failed to identify in the

5334
06:10:45,360 --> 06:10:47,580
first place so

5335
06:10:47,580 --> 06:10:49,558
hopefully yeah this is hopefully you

5336
06:10:49,558 --> 06:10:51,420
guys can read that in the back but

5337
06:10:51,420 --> 06:10:53,458
this is where threat intelligence and

5338
06:10:53,458 --> 06:10:54,958
threat hunting I think can intersect in

5339
06:10:54,958 --> 06:10:57,718
a way that that's uh improving value to

5340
06:10:57,718 --> 06:10:58,500
both

5341
06:10:58,500 --> 06:11:00,480
um so this idea threatened intelligence

5342
06:11:00,480 --> 06:11:03,420
or intelligence driven threat hunting is

5343
06:11:03,420 --> 06:11:04,798
is kind of

5344
06:11:04,798 --> 06:11:07,340
getting that if you have

5345
06:11:07,340 --> 06:11:09,420
threat intelligence and you employ it

5346
06:11:09,420 --> 06:11:10,500
you know

5347
06:11:10,500 --> 06:11:12,480
way that you're intending to protect

5348
06:11:12,480 --> 06:11:13,680
yourself from attacks that are going to

5349
06:11:13,680 --> 06:11:15,058
happen in the future that's that's a

5350
06:11:15,058 --> 06:11:16,080
really that's

5351
06:11:16,080 --> 06:11:18,480
um threat intelligence driven defense

5352
06:11:18,480 --> 06:11:19,798
perhaps

5353
06:11:19,798 --> 06:11:21,900
so again the Lockheed term Lockheed

5354
06:11:21,900 --> 06:11:23,820
Martin and that's great and that's a

5355
06:11:23,820 --> 06:11:26,878
very useful and uh that's a that's a

5356
06:11:26,878 --> 06:11:29,520
great way to employ it again we have

5357
06:11:29,520 --> 06:11:30,840
Integrations and sometimes that's really

5358
06:11:30,840 --> 06:11:34,740
easy to do but to retroactively hunt for

5359
06:11:34,740 --> 06:11:36,420
events in your environment based off of

5360
06:11:36,420 --> 06:11:37,500
that intelligence that you received now

5361
06:11:37,500 --> 06:11:39,540
because if you think about intelligence

5362
06:11:39,540 --> 06:11:41,340
how that really comes again

5363
06:11:41,340 --> 06:11:43,200
there sometimes there's a you know

5364
06:11:43,200 --> 06:11:45,360
there's a compromise um they find talks

5365
06:11:45,360 --> 06:11:48,000
several weeks later due to a compromise

5366
06:11:48,000 --> 06:11:51,000
becoming much more severe and that

5367
06:11:51,000 --> 06:11:52,680
escalates to a cyber street vendor they

5368
06:11:52,680 --> 06:11:54,058
get to learn hopefully there's this new

5369
06:11:54,058 --> 06:11:55,558
attack that is

5370
06:11:55,558 --> 06:11:57,600
customer was compromised and we didn't

5371
06:11:57,600 --> 06:11:59,520
catch it let's update our our stuffs

5372
06:11:59,520 --> 06:12:00,718
that we can't

5373
06:12:00,718 --> 06:12:02,878
and by the time it's on the traditional

5374
06:12:02,878 --> 06:12:06,180
threat intelligence is coming back to us

5375
06:12:06,180 --> 06:12:07,920
um that threat actors moved on sometimes

5376
06:12:07,920 --> 06:12:10,260
they've changed their tactics and

5377
06:12:10,260 --> 06:12:11,340
sometimes they got into that higher

5378
06:12:11,340 --> 06:12:11,878
level maybe they're using

5379
06:12:11,878 --> 06:12:13,320
vulnerabilities that aren't relevant

5380
06:12:13,320 --> 06:12:16,138
today or maybe they're just using

5381
06:12:16,138 --> 06:12:17,458
ephemeral infrastructure and

5382
06:12:17,458 --> 06:12:19,620
digitalocean or using

5383
06:12:19,620 --> 06:12:22,320
net and you're blocking some poor other

5384
06:12:22,320 --> 06:12:23,820
victim's IP address from being able to

5385
06:12:23,820 --> 06:12:25,500
communicate to your network you're not

5386
06:12:25,500 --> 06:12:27,360
doing anything to actually make progress

5387
06:12:27,360 --> 06:12:29,520
against the adversary

5388
06:12:29,520 --> 06:12:31,980
so I know a lot of people might be

5389
06:12:31,980 --> 06:12:33,120
getting a little nervous and starting to

5390
06:12:33,120 --> 06:12:34,920
think okay is this

5391
06:12:34,920 --> 06:12:36,660
guy getting that threat hunting is just

5392
06:12:36,660 --> 06:12:38,878
looking for IC iocs and that's not the

5393
06:12:38,878 --> 06:12:40,440
case it's not bad I'll say I'll just

5394
06:12:40,440 --> 06:12:42,000
throw out there if you have a list of

5395
06:12:42,000 --> 06:12:43,500
iocs and you're asked Haze this in your

5396
06:12:43,500 --> 06:12:44,940
environment that's not bad

5397
06:12:44,940 --> 06:12:46,680
practice but that's not what we mean

5398
06:12:46,680 --> 06:12:48,120
when we say threat hunting and there's

5399
06:12:48,120 --> 06:12:50,058
great memes about this in our industry

5400
06:12:50,058 --> 06:12:52,500
that a lot of people want to make sure

5401
06:12:52,500 --> 06:12:53,580
that we're making threat hunting

5402
06:12:53,580 --> 06:12:55,798
something more than just taking a hash

5403
06:12:55,798 --> 06:12:57,058
down

5404
06:12:57,058 --> 06:12:59,940
seeing if it's brand in our environment

5405
06:12:59,940 --> 06:13:02,040
so that's a little bit about threat

5406
06:13:02,040 --> 06:13:03,480
hunting and threat intelligence I hope

5407
06:13:03,480 --> 06:13:05,040
that kind of gives us some common ground

5408
06:13:05,040 --> 06:13:08,340
for discussing the uh describe we kind

5409
06:13:08,340 --> 06:13:10,138
of debate about discuss the definitions

5410
06:13:10,138 --> 06:13:11,878
a lot in the industry so I hope this

5411
06:13:11,878 --> 06:13:13,980
gives us Common Ground so we can

5412
06:13:13,980 --> 06:13:15,298
talk about the things that I think we

5413
06:13:15,298 --> 06:13:16,740
should be debating more which is um how

5414
06:13:16,740 --> 06:13:20,160
the two can be combined maybe so

5415
06:13:20,160 --> 06:13:23,820
the problem is that by uh

5416
06:13:23,820 --> 06:13:25,920
tensionality of the adversary by Design

5417
06:13:25,920 --> 06:13:27,660
and some are sometimes again if you're

5418
06:13:27,660 --> 06:13:29,718
talking about botnet by its very nature

5419
06:13:29,718 --> 06:13:32,820
threats are becoming more and more

5420
06:13:32,820 --> 06:13:35,638
inclusive and evasive or at least very

5421
06:13:35,638 --> 06:13:37,980
ephemeral adversaries are obviously a

5422
06:13:37,980 --> 06:13:38,878
Time

5423
06:13:38,878 --> 06:13:41,638
to accomplish their evasiveness because

5424
06:13:41,638 --> 06:13:43,080
they don't want to burn infrastructure

5425
06:13:43,080 --> 06:13:45,620
unnecessarily not talking about those

5426
06:13:45,620 --> 06:13:48,240
IPS that scan you thousands of times a

5427
06:13:48,240 --> 06:13:50,458
day but I am talking about organizations

5428
06:13:50,458 --> 06:13:53,940
like quack bot who have large access to

5429
06:13:53,940 --> 06:13:55,620
large mature

5430
06:13:55,620 --> 06:13:58,620
um well-grown botnets of hundreds tens

5431
06:13:58,620 --> 06:14:00,360
of thousands of compromised

5432
06:14:00,360 --> 06:14:01,500
infrastructure

5433
06:14:01,500 --> 06:14:04,740
sure that they develop a development and

5434
06:14:04,740 --> 06:14:07,440
operational tempo for that they use

5435
06:14:07,440 --> 06:14:09,718
and surges so that they can try to get

5436
06:14:09,718 --> 06:14:11,040
the most out of these compromised

5437
06:14:11,040 --> 06:14:12,980
devices or I'm talking about

5438
06:14:12,980 --> 06:14:15,480
organizations that stand up their own

5439
06:14:15,480 --> 06:14:18,120
infrastructure too certainly there's

5440
06:14:18,120 --> 06:14:20,820
compromises that service there's pay per

5441
06:14:20,820 --> 06:14:22,740
install there's email botnets you can

5442
06:14:22,740 --> 06:14:24,718
buy services for if we try to block that

5443
06:14:24,718 --> 06:14:26,580
keys and the email addresses and the

5444
06:14:26,580 --> 06:14:28,320
fake domains or the real compromise

5445
06:14:28,320 --> 06:14:30,180
domains that's kind of what we're

5446
06:14:30,180 --> 06:14:32,218
attempting to do but we're always going

5447
06:14:32,218 --> 06:14:33,480
to be behind because someone else has to

5448
06:14:33,480 --> 06:14:35,940
figure out that hey this domain's been

5449
06:14:35,940 --> 06:14:37,558
compromised it's malicious let's block

5450
06:14:37,558 --> 06:14:38,878
it we're going to be a little bit behind

5451
06:14:38,878 --> 06:14:40,558
we're just trying to rely on that to

5452
06:14:40,558 --> 06:14:43,620
defend proactively but what about

5453
06:14:43,620 --> 06:14:46,378
show back dippling

5454
06:14:46,378 --> 06:14:48,298
um so this is where we go into logfort

5455
06:14:48,298 --> 06:14:50,700
log forward slog for shell and again

5456
06:14:50,700 --> 06:14:52,378
maybe some people might be I know I

5457
06:14:52,378 --> 06:14:54,420
would be kind of like hesitating you

5458
06:14:54,420 --> 06:14:55,798
know trying to hold back rolling my eyes

5459
06:14:55,798 --> 06:14:58,200
it's kind of been a a threat that's been

5460
06:14:58,200 --> 06:15:00,600
talked about to a great extent

5461
06:15:00,600 --> 06:15:02,040
and

5462
06:15:02,040 --> 06:15:03,298
um it's kind of funny you kind of sit

5463
06:15:03,298 --> 06:15:04,080
through some of these things and you're

5464
06:15:04,080 --> 06:15:05,760
hearing about log Forge or solarwinds

5465
06:15:05,760 --> 06:15:07,920
for the 15th time and but I think it's

5466
06:15:07,920 --> 06:15:11,760
actually great uh subject to introduce

5467
06:15:11,760 --> 06:15:14,280
this idea because of the nature of the

5468
06:15:14,280 --> 06:15:15,000
problem

5469
06:15:15,000 --> 06:15:17,458
problem because it's also so well known

5470
06:15:17,458 --> 06:15:19,200
and if log Forge isn't something you're

5471
06:15:19,200 --> 06:15:20,580
familiar with

5472
06:15:20,580 --> 06:15:22,740
um I highly encourage you to kind of

5473
06:15:22,740 --> 06:15:25,400
look into it and do some research

5474
06:15:25,400 --> 06:15:28,200
some people are again just this saying

5475
06:15:28,200 --> 06:15:29,878
this is the 15th time I've heard about

5476
06:15:29,878 --> 06:15:30,600
this

5477
06:15:30,600 --> 06:15:32,340
threat and other people are starting

5478
06:15:32,340 --> 06:15:33,540
their blood pressure is starting to

5479
06:15:33,540 --> 06:15:35,940
raise their like his lock work out of my

5480
06:15:35,940 --> 06:15:37,200
environment still or is it still

5481
06:15:37,200 --> 06:15:39,298
something I need to go back into it was

5482
06:15:39,298 --> 06:15:41,340
a mess it messed up a lot of people's

5483
06:15:41,340 --> 06:15:42,900
holidays

5484
06:15:42,900 --> 06:15:47,218
and that was what oh dear wow

5485
06:15:47,218 --> 06:15:48,480
that was

5486
06:15:48,480 --> 06:15:51,780
that that was worth it has anyone else

5487
06:15:51,780 --> 06:15:52,860
feel like there would be law enforger

5488
06:15:52,860 --> 06:15:54,120
solarwinds event this last Christmas

5489
06:15:54,120 --> 06:15:55,500
who's been in the industry for a few

5490
06:15:55,500 --> 06:15:57,780
years I felt like I was looking on

5491
06:15:57,780 --> 06:15:59,760
Twitter we're kind of like

5492
06:15:59,760 --> 06:16:01,378
halfway through December and so nothing

5493
06:16:01,378 --> 06:16:03,180
happened and then we'd go on PTO and

5494
06:16:03,180 --> 06:16:05,458
it's like always watching your back but

5495
06:16:05,458 --> 06:16:08,100
uh let's just be thankful and celebrate

5496
06:16:08,100 --> 06:16:09,058
that there wasn't anything that

5497
06:16:09,058 --> 06:16:10,620
tremendously terrible that we had to

5498
06:16:10,620 --> 06:16:12,058
deal with this Christmas season

5499
06:16:12,058 --> 06:16:14,520
but um one of the interesting things one

5500
06:16:14,520 --> 06:16:18,000
of the challenges is this this Threat

5501
06:16:18,000 --> 06:16:19,680
Vector that or this vulnerability was

5502
06:16:19,680 --> 06:16:21,480
evolving faster than we as an industry

5503
06:16:21,480 --> 06:16:22,980
could keep up with

5504
06:16:22,980 --> 06:16:25,200
um there here's a list and this is

5505
06:16:25,200 --> 06:16:26,638
actually I actually think and this is

5506
06:16:26,638 --> 06:16:27,958
just my opinion not like part of the

5507
06:16:27,958 --> 06:16:29,280
informative part of the presentation I

5508
06:16:29,280 --> 06:16:30,958
think Paul valdo did admirable job

5509
06:16:30,958 --> 06:16:34,138
creating signatures to respond

5510
06:16:34,138 --> 06:16:35,520
as to what people were discovering about

5511
06:16:35,520 --> 06:16:36,718
this vulnerability we were all

5512
06:16:36,718 --> 06:16:38,580
discovering it in real time people were

5513
06:16:38,580 --> 06:16:40,620
very intelligent researchers and

5514
06:16:40,620 --> 06:16:42,058
sometimes bad guys were figuring out

5515
06:16:42,058 --> 06:16:43,740
ways to abuse it

5516
06:16:43,740 --> 06:16:45,480
and fade The Way We Were detecting and

5517
06:16:45,480 --> 06:16:47,340
it was just kind of a mess but this goes

5518
06:16:47,340 --> 06:16:48,240
to show

5519
06:16:48,240 --> 06:16:50,040
you there's quite some time in between

5520
06:16:50,040 --> 06:16:53,040
uh the first December 12th December 18th

5521
06:16:53,040 --> 06:16:54,180
we had

5522
06:16:54,180 --> 06:16:56,298
various iterations of signatures because

5523
06:16:56,298 --> 06:16:58,740
the thought kept it evolving we thought

5524
06:16:58,740 --> 06:17:00,058
it was just this little string that

5525
06:17:00,058 --> 06:17:01,260
would never

5526
06:17:01,260 --> 06:17:03,058
I mean like that was kind of the

5527
06:17:03,058 --> 06:17:04,200
vulnerability was this little string

5528
06:17:04,200 --> 06:17:05,638
that when it was present it would allow

5529
06:17:05,638 --> 06:17:07,440
you remote code execution into an

5530
06:17:07,440 --> 06:17:09,718
environment and onto servers and it's

5531
06:17:09,718 --> 06:17:11,100
kind of like the worst case scenario was

5532
06:17:11,100 --> 06:17:12,840
it was everywhere

5533
06:17:12,840 --> 06:17:15,718
and then people started to realize oh

5534
06:17:15,718 --> 06:17:17,100
well we can call these environmental

5535
06:17:17,100 --> 06:17:18,718
variables and we can opticate it and we

5536
06:17:18,718 --> 06:17:21,298
can bypass the detections and then all

5537
06:17:21,298 --> 06:17:23,218
of a sudden we're like hey people are

5538
06:17:23,218 --> 06:17:24,718
bypassing our detections let's update

5539
06:17:24,718 --> 06:17:26,400
them and and all this

5540
06:17:26,400 --> 06:17:29,280
this whole week or two weeks really

5541
06:17:29,280 --> 06:17:30,958
um people were trying to keep up with

5542
06:17:30,958 --> 06:17:33,540
the landscape and that was and there's

5543
06:17:33,540 --> 06:17:34,798
no way you can look at this problem say

5544
06:17:34,798 --> 06:17:37,200
okay just give me an IP list and I'll

5545
06:17:37,200 --> 06:17:39,180
block those IPS and I'll be good or give

5546
06:17:39,180 --> 06:17:40,680
me file hash list of the shells that

5547
06:17:40,680 --> 06:17:42,360
they're trying to drop none of those

5548
06:17:42,360 --> 06:17:44,458
traditional indicators work there again

5549
06:17:44,458 --> 06:17:45,958
there's no problem with trying to figure

5550
06:17:45,958 --> 06:17:47,700
out who those are and pull into your

5551
06:17:47,700 --> 06:17:49,138
environment and maybe statistically

5552
06:17:49,138 --> 06:17:51,000
reduce their likelihood of being

5553
06:17:51,000 --> 06:17:53,218
compromised by one of those that's not a

5554
06:17:53,218 --> 06:17:55,260
bad thing but the problem was it

5555
06:17:55,260 --> 06:17:57,240
certainly wasn't sufficient and it

5556
06:17:57,240 --> 06:17:59,520
wasn't sufficient to rely on that at the

5557
06:17:59,520 --> 06:18:01,980
time defenses that we had

5558
06:18:01,980 --> 06:18:03,540
so that get some threat hunting and this

5559
06:18:03,540 --> 06:18:05,100
is just a fair warning the following

5560
06:18:05,100 --> 06:18:07,260
content has been known to cause anxiety

5561
06:18:07,260 --> 06:18:09,240
flashbacks heartburns hypertension rapid

5562
06:18:09,240 --> 06:18:10,980
aging of anyone involved in information

5563
06:18:10,980 --> 06:18:14,100
security or I.T even during this time

5564
06:18:14,100 --> 06:18:16,260
but so here's some here's some strings

5565
06:18:16,260 --> 06:18:18,780
that some of you may be familiar with

5566
06:18:18,780 --> 06:18:21,798
um it's uh

5567
06:18:21,840 --> 06:18:24,000
oh man that was so much better when I

5568
06:18:24,000 --> 06:18:25,200
was setting it up but let's see if we

5569
06:18:25,200 --> 06:18:26,400
can get that again

5570
06:18:26,400 --> 06:18:29,420
I don't know how that really

5571
06:18:31,740 --> 06:18:34,138
translated okay well you get the idea

5572
06:18:34,138 --> 06:18:37,080
anyways so here's a list I have compiled

5573
06:18:37,080 --> 06:18:38,520
this and this is on the GitHub too if

5574
06:18:38,520 --> 06:18:40,020
you're interested lobbying this out this

5575
06:18:40,020 --> 06:18:42,298
is this is really really cool stuff it

5576
06:18:42,298 --> 06:18:45,360
was a great example it was so by Nature

5577
06:18:45,360 --> 06:18:46,980
everywhere that was

5578
06:18:46,980 --> 06:18:49,080
blogging you're like am I affected that

5579
06:18:49,080 --> 06:18:51,180
was painful right but for threat Hunters

5580
06:18:51,180 --> 06:18:53,400
we're like it's logged everywhere and

5581
06:18:53,400 --> 06:18:55,080
it's there's so many logs we can look in

5582
06:18:55,080 --> 06:18:56,580
and we have these strings and so it was

5583
06:18:56,580 --> 06:18:58,860
a great uh example of something that we

5584
06:18:58,860 --> 06:18:59,878
can fret on

5585
06:18:59,878 --> 06:19:02,160
we could we combined basically this idea

5586
06:19:02,160 --> 06:19:04,080
of this Intelligence coming about at on

5587
06:19:04,080 --> 06:19:05,878
this threat that's emerging

5588
06:19:05,878 --> 06:19:09,240
in real time and we said hey we know

5589
06:19:09,240 --> 06:19:11,400
that uh our vendors they were doing

5590
06:19:11,400 --> 06:19:12,480
great

5591
06:19:12,480 --> 06:19:14,160
but they weren't keeping up with the

5592
06:19:14,160 --> 06:19:15,900
threats we know that attacks got through

5593
06:19:15,900 --> 06:19:16,980
how do we figure out where we were

5594
06:19:16,980 --> 06:19:18,660
compromised and so we were able to

5595
06:19:18,660 --> 06:19:20,638
develop this way

5596
06:19:20,638 --> 06:19:22,440
to combine what we were learning about

5597
06:19:22,440 --> 06:19:25,860
it with our you know seven

5598
06:19:25,860 --> 06:19:29,040
weeks or seven days one month 30 days of

5599
06:19:29,040 --> 06:19:30,958
data at night any days of data whatever

5600
06:19:30,958 --> 06:19:32,638
you have and just be able to apply this

5601
06:19:32,638 --> 06:19:35,280
intelligence and say well let's look

5602
06:19:35,280 --> 06:19:38,100
for let's let's not rely on Palo Alto or

5603
06:19:38,100 --> 06:19:40,080
other security controls to identify when

5604
06:19:40,080 --> 06:19:41,160
it's coming in but let's look for the

5605
06:19:41,160 --> 06:19:42,840
evidence that would have been generated

5606
06:19:42,840 --> 06:19:45,120
by this once it did come in and that way

5607
06:19:45,120 --> 06:19:47,340
we were able to find compromises that

5608
06:19:47,340 --> 06:19:48,780
again not the offenders might not have

5609
06:19:48,780 --> 06:19:50,400
known about based off of using these

5610
06:19:50,400 --> 06:19:54,240
evasive techniques and tactics so it's

5611
06:19:54,240 --> 06:19:55,740
kind of a way

5612
06:19:55,740 --> 06:19:57,900
we weren't relying on our detection

5613
06:19:57,900 --> 06:19:59,638
prevention capabilities because it

5614
06:19:59,638 --> 06:20:01,920
wasn't sufficient at the time

5615
06:20:01,920 --> 06:20:03,718
um this brings us into I hope that was a

5616
06:20:03,718 --> 06:20:05,280
kind of helpful slight introduction

5617
06:20:05,280 --> 06:20:07,260
everyone knows about log forged a little

5618
06:20:07,260 --> 06:20:09,540
bit less popular but I'm excited I don't

5619
06:20:09,540 --> 06:20:11,040
know is that weird to be excited about

5620
06:20:11,040 --> 06:20:13,200
malware being popular and successful but

5621
06:20:13,200 --> 06:20:14,760
black Bots really really been

5622
06:20:14,760 --> 06:20:16,138
interesting to watch and I really

5623
06:20:16,138 --> 06:20:17,878
encourage you like the last six months

5624
06:20:17,878 --> 06:20:20,340
they've they have also been a similarly

5625
06:20:20,340 --> 06:20:23,360
constantly evolving threat and supposed

5626
06:20:23,360 --> 06:20:26,040
challenges but also interestingly posing

5627
06:20:26,040 --> 06:20:27,660
new detection opportunities based off of

5628
06:20:27,660 --> 06:20:28,860
what they've been attempting to

5629
06:20:28,860 --> 06:20:30,420
accomplish

5630
06:20:30,420 --> 06:20:32,958
so a little bit about

5631
06:20:32,958 --> 06:20:35,280
quack bot cubot however you want to say

5632
06:20:35,280 --> 06:20:36,180
it

5633
06:20:36,180 --> 06:20:36,780
um

5634
06:20:36,780 --> 06:20:38,240
there

5635
06:20:38,240 --> 06:20:42,058
decade old plus um it's a big trojanera

5636
06:20:42,058 --> 06:20:43,558
originally

5637
06:20:43,558 --> 06:20:44,280
um

5638
06:20:44,280 --> 06:20:46,260
it used to just do your credentials it

5639
06:20:46,260 --> 06:20:48,120
was actually groundbreaking news back in

5640
06:20:48,120 --> 06:20:49,500
the back in

5641
06:20:49,500 --> 06:20:50,940
I don't know I actually don't know the

5642
06:20:50,940 --> 06:20:53,100
year maybe 2013 or 14 they started to go

5643
06:20:53,100 --> 06:20:54,000
after

5644
06:20:54,000 --> 06:20:54,540
um

5645
06:20:54,540 --> 06:20:57,000
Sam caps local credentials and and

5646
06:20:57,000 --> 06:20:58,680
separate social environments rather than

5647
06:20:58,680 --> 06:21:00,000
just trying to get your financial info

5648
06:21:00,000 --> 06:21:01,558
and your banking info

5649
06:21:01,558 --> 06:21:06,120
and uh they for a long time have kind of

5650
06:21:06,120 --> 06:21:08,280
business this thing that's well it's

5651
06:21:08,280 --> 06:21:10,080
kind of common malware we might call it

5652
06:21:10,080 --> 06:21:12,058
a come on malware but there's

5653
06:21:12,058 --> 06:21:14,280
significant there are significant

5654
06:21:14,280 --> 06:21:15,958
applications behind it

5655
06:21:15,958 --> 06:21:18,020
um nowadays it's like those other

5656
06:21:18,020 --> 06:21:20,458
modular picking Trojans if any malware

5657
06:21:20,458 --> 06:21:22,920
lasts like for 10 plus years and it's

5658
06:21:22,920 --> 06:21:24,840
still very popular and successful it's a

5659
06:21:24,840 --> 06:21:26,040
good one to look into and kind of ask

5660
06:21:26,040 --> 06:21:28,378
like why is this still around

5661
06:21:28,378 --> 06:21:31,440
um the modular that quack bot had is one

5662
06:21:31,440 --> 06:21:32,760
of the things that's allowed it to be to

5663
06:21:32,760 --> 06:21:35,280
stick around and because it's become

5664
06:21:35,280 --> 06:21:38,100
useful in other ways Now can do lateral

5665
06:21:38,100 --> 06:21:40,378
movement it can do propagation and crop

5666
06:21:40,378 --> 06:21:43,020
I guess a lot of movement but it can do

5667
06:21:43,020 --> 06:21:46,260
Recon on the environment and what's been

5668
06:21:46,260 --> 06:21:48,480
more the scary thing that we don't want

5669
06:21:48,480 --> 06:21:49,920
to happen is that we've is that we've

5670
06:21:49,920 --> 06:21:52,740
seen it deploy ransomware in some cases

5671
06:21:52,740 --> 06:21:54,120
um it's kind of a we believe it's

5672
06:21:54,120 --> 06:21:55,558
something that's out for hire you can

5673
06:21:55,558 --> 06:21:57,600
hire this botnet again

5674
06:21:57,600 --> 06:22:01,400
many many compromised devices we've seen

5675
06:22:01,400 --> 06:22:06,120
do some more advanced uh some of the the

5676
06:22:06,120 --> 06:22:08,218
techniques that employs are a bit more

5677
06:22:08,218 --> 06:22:10,200
advanced doing hangout uh chain

5678
06:22:10,200 --> 06:22:13,320
compromise so injecting itself into an

5679
06:22:13,320 --> 06:22:15,180
email and saying hey Bob you talked to

5680
06:22:15,180 --> 06:22:16,920
me three months ago I'm just following

5681
06:22:16,920 --> 06:22:18,840
up and here's the link I owe you and

5682
06:22:18,840 --> 06:22:20,520
then they're downloading malware and sqd

5683
06:22:20,520 --> 06:22:23,100
malware and interestingly that that is

5684
06:22:23,100 --> 06:22:27,360
they combine that tactic with

5685
06:22:27,360 --> 06:22:30,058
sometimes their employees aren't that

5686
06:22:30,058 --> 06:22:31,320
convincing like they're asking you to

5687
06:22:31,320 --> 06:22:35,100
download a password encrypted zip file

5688
06:22:35,100 --> 06:22:36,840
and you kind of saw things that we have

5689
06:22:36,840 --> 06:22:38,218
red flags for and security awareness

5690
06:22:38,218 --> 06:22:40,320
training security awareness trainings

5691
06:22:40,320 --> 06:22:41,820
um but their numbers speak for

5692
06:22:41,820 --> 06:22:44,580
themselves they have they go for very uh

5693
06:22:44,580 --> 06:22:46,200
they're very they're one of the premium

5694
06:22:46,200 --> 06:22:47,580
Services I guess I'm kind of looking at

5695
06:22:47,580 --> 06:22:51,840
what it was back in the day and um and

5696
06:22:51,840 --> 06:22:53,520
ransomware operators are figuring that

5697
06:22:53,520 --> 06:22:56,160
out and you could do pay per install for

5698
06:22:56,160 --> 06:22:57,900
like being you know downloaders and

5699
06:22:57,900 --> 06:22:59,700
stuff like that but another route to go

5700
06:22:59,700 --> 06:23:03,240
is just have a infection paid for the

5701
06:23:03,240 --> 06:23:05,700
installation of the ransomware

5702
06:23:05,700 --> 06:23:08,040
and or at least other tools that result

5703
06:23:08,040 --> 06:23:09,900
in the ransomware

5704
06:23:09,900 --> 06:23:11,100
deployment

5705
06:23:11,100 --> 06:23:12,958
so in other words it's severity's

5706
06:23:12,958 --> 06:23:15,420
increased as well so we have history

5707
06:23:15,420 --> 06:23:17,160
then to talk about

5708
06:23:17,160 --> 06:23:19,080
what they've done over the last year

5709
06:23:19,080 --> 06:23:20,458
slash six months I'll just trust that

5710
06:23:20,458 --> 06:23:22,920
it's going to come back online in June

5711
06:23:22,920 --> 06:23:25,580
or so 2020 to

5712
06:23:25,580 --> 06:23:29,580
Microsoft uh the volume exploit came out

5713
06:23:29,580 --> 06:23:31,200
with msdt

5714
06:23:31,200 --> 06:23:32,820
and

5715
06:23:32,820 --> 06:23:36,660
whenever they leave it seems to get a

5716
06:23:36,660 --> 06:23:37,378
little

5717
06:23:37,378 --> 06:23:39,180
upset and then just want them to come

5718
06:23:39,180 --> 06:23:40,500
back

5719
06:23:40,500 --> 06:23:43,138
but I'll just talk through this there

5720
06:23:43,138 --> 06:23:46,378
was a cve that affected the Microsoft's

5721
06:23:46,378 --> 06:23:48,420
diagnostic tool thanks for trying to

5722
06:23:48,420 --> 06:23:50,280
help out with that and it was a remote

5723
06:23:50,280 --> 06:23:52,378
code execution as well

5724
06:23:52,378 --> 06:23:53,878
and keep in mind that this summer this

5725
06:23:53,878 --> 06:23:55,260
was around when Microsoft was supposed

5726
06:23:55,260 --> 06:23:56,878
to be disabling Microsoft EBAs by

5727
06:23:56,878 --> 06:23:59,340
default which was super excited for

5728
06:23:59,340 --> 06:24:00,900
right and then they rolled that decision

5729
06:24:00,900 --> 06:24:02,700
back and I understand other business

5730
06:24:02,700 --> 06:24:05,040
reasons for doing that

5731
06:24:05,040 --> 06:24:07,500
but uh so it was interesting because

5732
06:24:07,500 --> 06:24:09,840
that that idea that Microsoft was going

5733
06:24:09,840 --> 06:24:12,540
to disable Microsoft disable VBA macros

5734
06:24:12,540 --> 06:24:16,138
by team well lead security uh or I

5735
06:24:16,138 --> 06:24:17,400
should say adversary groups are starting

5736
06:24:17,400 --> 06:24:19,378
otherwise to affected computers that

5737
06:24:19,378 --> 06:24:22,920
weren't reliant on VBA macros they tried

5738
06:24:22,920 --> 06:24:24,718
this feline exploit which would allow

5739
06:24:24,718 --> 06:24:27,900
them to launch and run their power not

5740
06:24:27,900 --> 06:24:30,420
necessarily having to rely on Excel VBA

5741
06:24:30,420 --> 06:24:33,600
and Mac brows and the like

5742
06:24:33,600 --> 06:24:35,878
I'll just try to unplug it plug stuff

5743
06:24:35,878 --> 06:24:37,320
out back in real fast see if that helps

5744
06:24:37,320 --> 06:24:38,040
anything

5745
06:24:38,040 --> 06:24:41,058
and um

5746
06:24:41,218 --> 06:24:43,260
uh eventually like like we said

5747
06:24:43,260 --> 06:24:45,958
Microsoft rolled back this decision to

5748
06:24:45,958 --> 06:24:48,780
uh to to

5749
06:24:48,780 --> 06:24:51,058
disable MacBook macro vbas by default

5750
06:24:51,058 --> 06:24:53,638
but they started exploring things like

5751
06:24:53,638 --> 06:24:56,100
legitimate true MSI installation

5752
06:24:56,100 --> 06:24:57,900
installers and just literally installing

5753
06:24:57,900 --> 06:24:59,280
their malware through MSI which is

5754
06:24:59,280 --> 06:25:02,040
almost ironic but it was it worked they

5755
06:25:02,040 --> 06:25:03,058
had success

5756
06:25:03,058 --> 06:25:04,620
um they're still doing it today and

5757
06:25:04,620 --> 06:25:07,200
that's how you know that it works

5758
06:25:07,200 --> 06:25:08,878
um they were installing link files with

5759
06:25:08,878 --> 06:25:10,740
extremely long commands that would

5760
06:25:10,740 --> 06:25:12,540
execute everything pull down and execute

5761
06:25:12,540 --> 06:25:15,120
all the malware the malware that they

5762
06:25:15,120 --> 06:25:16,378
wanted to they would have their malware

5763
06:25:16,378 --> 06:25:19,620
embedded in isos and images

5764
06:25:19,620 --> 06:25:24,058
now done htmas HTML smuggling and um

5765
06:25:24,058 --> 06:25:25,860
they've evolved over the course of six

5766
06:25:25,860 --> 06:25:27,540
months and I I don't know if they I

5767
06:25:27,540 --> 06:25:29,458
think they probably are well positioned

5768
06:25:29,458 --> 06:25:31,500
too because they have such a large

5769
06:25:31,500 --> 06:25:33,840
um being such a large desk open where

5770
06:25:33,840 --> 06:25:36,500
they're able to pull off

5771
06:25:37,080 --> 06:25:38,400
hey that's okay they just didn't like

5772
06:25:38,400 --> 06:25:40,200
that slide

5773
06:25:40,200 --> 06:25:41,820
um so

5774
06:25:41,820 --> 06:25:43,740
that was in June

5775
06:25:43,740 --> 06:25:45,660
we kind of sent out some advisors about

5776
06:25:45,660 --> 06:25:47,160
that within our intelligence groups we

5777
06:25:47,160 --> 06:25:48,240
thought that was pretty notable

5778
06:25:48,240 --> 06:25:49,980
information hey it's a new tactic people

5779
06:25:49,980 --> 06:25:51,958
are using this is something different

5780
06:25:51,958 --> 06:25:55,558
have to look for all the while quack bot

5781
06:25:55,558 --> 06:25:57,840
was I from

5782
06:25:57,840 --> 06:26:00,180
my our perspective it's been more slow

5783
06:26:00,180 --> 06:26:01,798
low they definitely they're one of these

5784
06:26:01,798 --> 06:26:03,840
groups again like you know

5785
06:26:03,840 --> 06:26:05,820
we don't expect an operational cycle of

5786
06:26:05,820 --> 06:26:08,340
development and operation and surges

5787
06:26:08,340 --> 06:26:11,520
stuff like that but in September

5788
06:26:11,520 --> 06:26:14,700
a lot of people probably recalled

5789
06:26:14,700 --> 06:26:17,040
discovering this but in September they

5790
06:26:17,040 --> 06:26:18,740
started uh

5791
06:26:18,740 --> 06:26:22,980
increasing their email volume to pretty

5792
06:26:22,980 --> 06:26:25,080
much competing with what emotat used to

5793
06:26:25,080 --> 06:26:28,080
be able to accomplish and in like a less

5794
06:26:28,080 --> 06:26:30,780
than 24 hours with trying to collect all

5795
06:26:30,780 --> 06:26:33,298
the the samples that we had that there

5796
06:26:33,298 --> 06:26:34,080
was

5797
06:26:34,080 --> 06:26:36,360
to thousands of URLs there was thousands

5798
06:26:36,360 --> 06:26:38,218
of email subjects there was thousands of

5799
06:26:38,218 --> 06:26:41,580
unique senders we were kind of testing

5800
06:26:41,580 --> 06:26:44,580
out their uh their the loader site the

5801
06:26:44,580 --> 06:26:46,020
load of resource that they were

5802
06:26:46,020 --> 06:26:47,700
accessing and we were discovering that

5803
06:26:47,700 --> 06:26:50,100
they were generating new samples not

5804
06:26:50,100 --> 06:26:51,780
just with each URL which as you guys

5805
06:26:51,780 --> 06:26:53,940
know a lot of times they'll use that URL

5806
06:26:53,940 --> 06:26:56,160
for campaign track and that'll be

5807
06:26:56,160 --> 06:26:57,360
information in that they'll have a

5808
06:26:57,360 --> 06:26:59,520
payload for that based off of that

5809
06:26:59,520 --> 06:27:01,200
campaign that was computer generated you

5810
06:27:01,200 --> 06:27:02,940
go back to that same URL again and it

5811
06:27:02,940 --> 06:27:04,500
would be a new sample and they're doing

5812
06:27:04,500 --> 06:27:07,740
some clever things to modify basically

5813
06:27:07,740 --> 06:27:10,260
just add in all this complexity and all

5814
06:27:10,260 --> 06:27:12,120
this uh diverse all this diversity in

5815
06:27:12,120 --> 06:27:14,540
their attacks and they were changing

5816
06:27:14,540 --> 06:27:17,420
even at this time adding new

5817
06:27:17,420 --> 06:27:20,638
modifications to their email to their to

5818
06:27:20,638 --> 06:27:22,320
their lures they were doing this email

5819
06:27:22,320 --> 06:27:24,660
thread injection a lot of

5820
06:27:24,660 --> 06:27:26,638
um organizations found that they were

5821
06:27:26,638 --> 06:27:28,500
you know compromised email accounts of

5822
06:27:28,500 --> 06:27:30,020
vendors were being used to send this

5823
06:27:30,020 --> 06:27:31,740
official email there was actually

5824
06:27:31,740 --> 06:27:33,900
content and it was just very painful

5825
06:27:33,900 --> 06:27:36,000
short period of time

5826
06:27:36,000 --> 06:27:37,558
where a lot of emails were coming in

5827
06:27:37,558 --> 06:27:39,660
that again you can't rely on that list

5828
06:27:39,660 --> 06:27:41,520
because the reality is well I don't know

5829
06:27:41,520 --> 06:27:43,440
and some people may find out one day but

5830
06:27:43,440 --> 06:27:45,180
I don't know how many unique URLs they

5831
06:27:45,180 --> 06:27:47,520
really had and how many domains and host

5832
06:27:47,520 --> 06:27:50,100
names so it was compromised I know for

5833
06:27:50,100 --> 06:27:53,420
sure some of it was stood up

5834
06:27:53,458 --> 06:27:55,200
um but they were using domains that were

5835
06:27:55,200 --> 06:27:56,520
old too so this was a very much

5836
06:27:56,520 --> 06:27:58,020
preparation of the age their domains

5837
06:27:58,020 --> 06:28:00,058
which is what they do to avoid evade the

5838
06:28:00,058 --> 06:28:02,580
detection of new domains being created

5839
06:28:02,580 --> 06:28:03,360
um

5840
06:28:03,360 --> 06:28:04,798
week prior to

5841
06:28:04,798 --> 06:28:07,320
this hectic stuff we had a little bit

5842
06:28:07,320 --> 06:28:09,058
just a little bit of information that

5843
06:28:09,058 --> 06:28:11,400
seemed it's Unique amount that we wrote

5844
06:28:11,400 --> 06:28:13,558
kind of an advisory to all of our groups

5845
06:28:13,558 --> 06:28:15,298
and we're saying hey

5846
06:28:15,298 --> 06:28:16,740
um we're not sure

5847
06:28:16,740 --> 06:28:18,840
we obviously had no idea The Surge would

5848
06:28:18,840 --> 06:28:21,120
come but this is really interesting it's

5849
06:28:21,120 --> 06:28:23,040
new tactics whatever we decided to

5850
06:28:23,040 --> 06:28:25,080
particular advisory we did include the

5851
06:28:25,080 --> 06:28:26,580
traditional indicators of compromise the

5852
06:28:26,580 --> 06:28:28,740
Cyber observables which again don't

5853
06:28:28,740 --> 06:28:30,180
discard don't discount those just

5854
06:28:30,180 --> 06:28:31,620
because they're not always this is the

5855
06:28:31,620 --> 06:28:34,500
tool for every problem problem but we

5856
06:28:34,500 --> 06:28:36,420
also discussed the stuff that's kind of

5857
06:28:36,420 --> 06:28:38,520
harder to take action on just because

5858
06:28:38,520 --> 06:28:40,080
that's what seems important we discussed

5859
06:28:40,080 --> 06:28:42,480
the behaviors the files they dropped it

5860
06:28:42,480 --> 06:28:44,100
was really interesting to us that at

5861
06:28:44,100 --> 06:28:45,058
that time they were doing password

5862
06:28:45,058 --> 06:28:47,638
protected archives and loading images

5863
06:28:47,638 --> 06:28:49,200
and mounting stuff and just this

5864
06:28:49,200 --> 06:28:50,400
combination of things that just seemed a

5865
06:28:50,400 --> 06:28:52,920
little weird they were evading uh

5866
06:28:52,920 --> 06:28:56,100
certain Microsoft uh controls for

5867
06:28:56,100 --> 06:28:57,480
security

5868
06:28:57,480 --> 06:29:00,420
so we sent an advisory out and

5869
06:29:00,420 --> 06:29:03,298
um this stuff that lasted that worked

5870
06:29:03,298 --> 06:29:04,620
weren't those traditional indicators so

5871
06:29:04,620 --> 06:29:06,420
I have some examples and I've posted

5872
06:29:06,420 --> 06:29:07,980
about this a little bit later a few

5873
06:29:07,980 --> 06:29:09,240
weeks after

5874
06:29:09,240 --> 06:29:11,700
all this was coming out so some of the

5875
06:29:11,700 --> 06:29:14,100
examples though that we used for this

5876
06:29:14,100 --> 06:29:17,100
for the threat hunting

5877
06:29:17,100 --> 06:29:19,378
um it just it showed us how complex

5878
06:29:19,378 --> 06:29:21,660
trying to tackle this was and just again

5879
06:29:21,660 --> 06:29:23,940
try to think about retroactively going

5880
06:29:23,940 --> 06:29:25,680
your environment looking for cases where

5881
06:29:25,680 --> 06:29:27,000
you may have been compromised there were

5882
06:29:27,000 --> 06:29:28,740
hundreds of samples

5883
06:29:28,740 --> 06:29:30,780
um again each computer each visit that

5884
06:29:30,780 --> 06:29:32,040
you had to that resource that generated

5885
06:29:32,040 --> 06:29:33,480
a new one we couldn't really find any

5886
06:29:33,480 --> 06:29:36,000
static strings that were common there

5887
06:29:36,000 --> 06:29:39,420
was a lot of fulfilling um they filled

5888
06:29:39,420 --> 06:29:40,920
the actual archive with a lot of other

5889
06:29:40,920 --> 06:29:44,040
contents like Alice in Wonderland and uh

5890
06:29:44,040 --> 06:29:45,900
Moby Dick and these great like text

5891
06:29:45,900 --> 06:29:47,700
blocks not not full books or just hex

5892
06:29:47,700 --> 06:29:48,718
blocks

5893
06:29:48,718 --> 06:29:51,200
um strings

5894
06:29:52,218 --> 06:29:54,680
security awareness campaigns things that

5895
06:29:54,680 --> 06:29:56,458
adversaries use like hey they're going

5896
06:29:56,458 --> 06:29:58,558
to go after your IRS stuff that's it's

5897
06:29:58,558 --> 06:29:59,940
this time of year

5898
06:29:59,940 --> 06:30:02,878
um and there was really no ioas domains

5899
06:30:02,878 --> 06:30:04,558
file hash there's something we can

5900
06:30:04,558 --> 06:30:06,660
really stick to we got these

5901
06:30:06,660 --> 06:30:08,100
samples and we're sort of trying to

5902
06:30:08,100 --> 06:30:09,958
figure out how do we help others defend

5903
06:30:09,958 --> 06:30:11,940
against it we also found that it was

5904
06:30:11,940 --> 06:30:13,558
complex by Design Not only was it just

5905
06:30:13,558 --> 06:30:15,360
different samples generate the samples

5906
06:30:15,360 --> 06:30:17,280
actually use different methods to get

5907
06:30:17,280 --> 06:30:19,020
the individual to

5908
06:30:19,020 --> 06:30:21,058
click on the actual link so you can see

5909
06:30:21,058 --> 06:30:23,520
quick graph all the different ways

5910
06:30:23,520 --> 06:30:26,340
you're trying to load dlls execute Java

5911
06:30:26,340 --> 06:30:28,740
script there's all these different

5912
06:30:28,740 --> 06:30:31,138
methods that they're playing a single

5913
06:30:31,138 --> 06:30:33,120
event slash campaign what we would call

5914
06:30:33,120 --> 06:30:35,638
it a you know a campaign in the industry

5915
06:30:35,638 --> 06:30:37,920
and

5916
06:30:37,920 --> 06:30:41,340
they were there were so many so many

5917
06:30:41,340 --> 06:30:43,138
samples there wasn't really any one way

5918
06:30:43,138 --> 06:30:45,298
to kind of skin a cat

5919
06:30:45,298 --> 06:30:47,520
and that made looking to defending this

5920
06:30:47,520 --> 06:30:48,780
in the future a little challenging we

5921
06:30:48,780 --> 06:30:51,360
kind of looked at maybe we can block uh

5922
06:30:51,360 --> 06:30:53,458
downloads for certain different types of

5923
06:30:53,458 --> 06:30:54,480
files and

5924
06:30:54,480 --> 06:30:56,218
mounting but again this is getting a

5925
06:30:56,218 --> 06:30:57,240
little bit more complicated we'll start

5926
06:30:57,240 --> 06:30:59,878
talking about creating detections

5927
06:30:59,878 --> 06:31:02,160
to detect when someone's mounting an

5928
06:31:02,160 --> 06:31:04,200
image there may be you may be an

5929
06:31:04,200 --> 06:31:05,760
organization where

5930
06:31:05,760 --> 06:31:07,740
that happens almost never you make an

5931
06:31:07,740 --> 06:31:09,120
organization where that happens every

5932
06:31:09,120 --> 06:31:10,558
day in a certain department but that's

5933
06:31:10,558 --> 06:31:12,660
sort of more complex than just plugging

5934
06:31:12,660 --> 06:31:15,298
into an ioc feed and Paul and that your

5935
06:31:15,298 --> 06:31:16,798
environment looking at those but when we

5936
06:31:16,798 --> 06:31:18,000
start applying that retroactively

5937
06:31:18,000 --> 06:31:19,320
because of the intelligence that we've

5938
06:31:19,320 --> 06:31:20,458
gotten to date

5939
06:31:20,458 --> 06:31:22,020
when we're getting into this idea of

5940
06:31:22,020 --> 06:31:25,340
hunting for threats in our environment

5941
06:31:25,500 --> 06:31:27,900
um their sample I mentioned mentioned

5942
06:31:27,900 --> 06:31:29,760
their sample generation had a brief

5943
06:31:29,760 --> 06:31:30,958
image showing it a bunch of different

5944
06:31:30,958 --> 06:31:33,180
examples

5945
06:31:33,180 --> 06:31:35,878
um a lot a lot of it uh they had you

5946
06:31:35,878 --> 06:31:38,400
know database files so they're storing

5947
06:31:38,400 --> 06:31:40,620
stuff in they had command prompts like

5948
06:31:40,620 --> 06:31:42,480
little just CMD files to actually be

5949
06:31:42,480 --> 06:31:44,040
executed

5950
06:31:44,040 --> 06:31:46,440
that raises a lot of flags for us but as

5951
06:31:46,440 --> 06:31:47,760
you guys know people will click on stuff

5952
06:31:47,760 --> 06:31:49,200
especially when

5953
06:31:49,200 --> 06:31:50,760
there's an email conversation that

5954
06:31:50,760 --> 06:31:53,100
they're in the middle of and it was it

5955
06:31:53,100 --> 06:31:55,620
was very very successful it seems like

5956
06:31:55,620 --> 06:31:57,600
that they were able to utilize this very

5957
06:31:57,600 --> 06:31:58,980
well

5958
06:31:58,980 --> 06:32:00,958
there was also so we started to look at

5959
06:32:00,958 --> 06:32:03,320
detection

5960
06:32:03,680 --> 06:32:05,820
that was difficult to communicate that

5961
06:32:05,820 --> 06:32:06,900
was something that we had to write

5962
06:32:06,900 --> 06:32:09,298
paragraphs describing

5963
06:32:09,298 --> 06:32:11,520
um we wrote signatures for some

5964
06:32:11,520 --> 06:32:13,500
individuals that were helped me write

5965
06:32:13,500 --> 06:32:14,820
signatures for platforms I wasn't

5966
06:32:14,820 --> 06:32:16,500
familiar with

5967
06:32:16,500 --> 06:32:17,700
um but we wanted to try to figure out

5968
06:32:17,700 --> 06:32:19,020
what's the minimum amount of information

5969
06:32:19,020 --> 06:32:21,420
the minimum footwork we can require of

5970
06:32:21,420 --> 06:32:23,820
people to be able to use what we're

5971
06:32:23,820 --> 06:32:25,440
discovering in a way that helps protect

5972
06:32:25,440 --> 06:32:27,120
them for the future

5973
06:32:27,120 --> 06:32:29,458
um but a lot of things were coming up

5974
06:32:29,458 --> 06:32:31,080
with took a lot of effort on the part of

5975
06:32:31,080 --> 06:32:33,120
the recipient it wasn't and again just

5976
06:32:33,120 --> 06:32:35,160
upload this ioc list to your firewall

5977
06:32:35,160 --> 06:32:37,020
but there was there were some common

5978
06:32:37,020 --> 06:32:39,058
things we see this archive file was

5979
06:32:39,058 --> 06:32:41,820
being used it was in inside the archive

5980
06:32:41,820 --> 06:32:44,820
file was a small number of files

5981
06:32:44,820 --> 06:32:47,458
some of them images some of them HTML

5982
06:32:47,458 --> 06:32:49,020
files and links depending on what day of

5983
06:32:49,020 --> 06:32:50,580
that really weak or kind of where we

5984
06:32:50,580 --> 06:32:53,218
were at in the in the

5985
06:32:53,218 --> 06:32:56,340
process I guess there was some file name

5986
06:32:56,340 --> 06:32:59,040
uh patterns we were able to to discover

5987
06:32:59,040 --> 06:33:01,138
but it's not like we could just send out

5988
06:33:01,138 --> 06:33:02,820
like you we have threat intelligence

5989
06:33:02,820 --> 06:33:04,260
programs we can upload a file name and

5990
06:33:04,260 --> 06:33:05,400
say hey if this file name comes in your

5991
06:33:05,400 --> 06:33:07,020
environment you should look at it

5992
06:33:07,020 --> 06:33:08,940
but we didn't quite have those quite

5993
06:33:08,940 --> 06:33:11,218
easily generated for us so you had to

5994
06:33:11,218 --> 06:33:12,240
kind of figure out how we were going to

5995
06:33:12,240 --> 06:33:14,700
do that we talked about the encrypted

5996
06:33:14,700 --> 06:33:17,040
payload download that's something that

5997
06:33:17,040 --> 06:33:19,260
are we can search for that's something

5998
06:33:19,260 --> 06:33:20,940
that maybe organizations

5999
06:33:20,940 --> 06:33:23,218
if they want to can block we talked

6000
06:33:23,218 --> 06:33:24,840
about process creation

6001
06:33:24,840 --> 06:33:27,780
we wrote Red X for it and again all this

6002
06:33:27,780 --> 06:33:29,400
stuff's a little bit more complicated

6003
06:33:29,400 --> 06:33:31,860
than those in those traditional

6004
06:33:31,860 --> 06:33:34,440
observables and so it was challenging we

6005
06:33:34,440 --> 06:33:35,760
were trying to describe

6006
06:33:35,760 --> 06:33:37,200
complex

6007
06:33:37,200 --> 06:33:39,958
observables in a way that humans can

6008
06:33:39,958 --> 06:33:42,000
understand but also in a way that's easy

6009
06:33:42,000 --> 06:33:43,080
for

6010
06:33:43,080 --> 06:33:45,660
humans to plot machines and those two

6011
06:33:45,660 --> 06:33:46,740
things are a little bit different again

6012
06:33:46,740 --> 06:33:49,440
IP address domain you know we recognize

6013
06:33:49,440 --> 06:33:51,000
those things humans can read those

6014
06:33:51,000 --> 06:33:52,980
machines can be those but this was a

6015
06:33:52,980 --> 06:33:55,500
little bit more complex than that

6016
06:33:55,500 --> 06:33:59,280
there was a really clever or not just

6017
06:33:59,280 --> 06:34:00,360
one of the more interesting things I've

6018
06:34:00,360 --> 06:34:01,860
seen that I don't often see with this

6019
06:34:01,860 --> 06:34:02,820
type of stuff so I thought it was really

6020
06:34:02,820 --> 06:34:06,000
interesting they were using a legitimate

6021
06:34:06,000 --> 06:34:09,058
version of the Windows 7 calc.exe signed

6022
06:34:09,058 --> 06:34:10,740
by Microsoft

6023
06:34:10,740 --> 06:34:12,780
um to execute to sideload their dlls

6024
06:34:12,780 --> 06:34:15,000
they would archive that wrap that all up

6025
06:34:15,000 --> 06:34:17,340
have malicious dll in the application

6026
06:34:17,340 --> 06:34:18,600
directory

6027
06:34:18,600 --> 06:34:20,218
which um

6028
06:34:20,218 --> 06:34:22,860
for that version Windows 10 help doesn't

6029
06:34:22,860 --> 06:34:24,360
do this but for Windows for that version

6030
06:34:24,360 --> 06:34:28,320
of the Windows 7 calculator

6031
06:34:28,320 --> 06:34:31,020
um it actually loads DLS from the

6032
06:34:31,020 --> 06:34:31,980
current directory you can kind of see

6033
06:34:31,980 --> 06:34:34,740
this graph that itman made to describe

6034
06:34:34,740 --> 06:34:36,840
this but it will actually load

6035
06:34:36,840 --> 06:34:38,760
local dlls first so if you literally

6036
06:34:38,760 --> 06:34:40,920
just name your file at dll

6037
06:34:40,920 --> 06:34:42,420
it'll execute it and that's how they

6038
06:34:42,420 --> 06:34:44,700
were getting people to uh you know

6039
06:34:44,700 --> 06:34:47,180
Microsoft launched Windows launched

6040
06:34:47,180 --> 06:34:49,558
calculator.exe if you have good security

6041
06:34:49,558 --> 06:34:50,878
controls some of this might be detected

6042
06:34:50,878 --> 06:34:53,040
but some of it might not it's also very

6043
06:34:53,040 --> 06:34:55,440
easy to see how people can become fooled

6044
06:34:55,440 --> 06:34:57,420
by this if they're

6045
06:34:57,420 --> 06:34:59,400
Edge shortcut on a desktop is replaced

6046
06:34:59,400 --> 06:35:01,920
by something that looks like Ash and

6047
06:35:01,920 --> 06:35:03,180
Microsoft allows you to pay just

6048
06:35:03,180 --> 06:35:04,740
Microsoft is trusts whatever you know

6049
06:35:04,740 --> 06:35:07,440
you however you describe your file

6050
06:35:07,440 --> 06:35:08,160
um

6051
06:35:08,160 --> 06:35:10,260
then you can see how people people can

6052
06:35:10,260 --> 06:35:12,180
kind of fall for this and how they can

6053
06:35:12,180 --> 06:35:13,620
get it to execute but they tried all

6054
06:35:13,620 --> 06:35:15,420
these different things they've used

6055
06:35:15,420 --> 06:35:17,400
the mark of the web CE exploit that came

6056
06:35:17,400 --> 06:35:18,958
out in the late fall um so once

6057
06:35:18,958 --> 06:35:20,280
Microsoft's like okay hey security

6058
06:35:20,280 --> 06:35:22,378
Community we're not giving you disabled

6059
06:35:22,378 --> 06:35:24,058
VBA by default but we will give you a

6060
06:35:24,058 --> 06:35:26,458
way to make it difficult for employees

6061
06:35:26,458 --> 06:35:29,040
to execute files that have been

6062
06:35:29,040 --> 06:35:30,480
downloaded from the web I'm like Rick

6063
06:35:30,480 --> 06:35:31,920
and then there was vulnerabilities in it

6064
06:35:31,920 --> 06:35:32,900
and that

6065
06:35:32,900 --> 06:35:35,458
sort of ways to get around that and now

6066
06:35:35,458 --> 06:35:37,920
today they're still doing a lot of HTML

6067
06:35:37,920 --> 06:35:40,620
smuggling so they're evolving with this

6068
06:35:40,620 --> 06:35:43,080
High operational Tempo

6069
06:35:43,080 --> 06:35:44,458
um they're showing their selling their

6070
06:35:44,458 --> 06:35:46,320
services or sharing it presumably that's

6071
06:35:46,320 --> 06:35:48,058
another interesting discussion but

6072
06:35:48,058 --> 06:35:49,138
anyways they're working with a lot of

6073
06:35:49,138 --> 06:35:52,080
other groups so even just say okay well

6074
06:35:52,080 --> 06:35:54,660
we can't detect them maybe let's just

6075
06:35:54,660 --> 06:35:55,500
try to figure out what they're trying to

6076
06:35:55,500 --> 06:35:56,820
do there's no common pattern there

6077
06:35:56,820 --> 06:35:58,260
either so

6078
06:35:58,260 --> 06:35:59,520
um it's kind of like everything

6079
06:35:59,520 --> 06:36:02,760
insecurity it's a whack-a-mole game

6080
06:36:02,760 --> 06:36:05,100
um but it's definitely a game that we

6081
06:36:05,100 --> 06:36:06,718
lose if we just rely on those

6082
06:36:06,718 --> 06:36:08,340
traditional

6083
06:36:08,340 --> 06:36:09,780
observables and again just kind of

6084
06:36:09,780 --> 06:36:11,520
pre-prefacing there's a lot of good use

6085
06:36:11,520 --> 06:36:13,200
cases for cyber observable

6086
06:36:13,200 --> 06:36:15,000
and a lot of people that I interact with

6087
06:36:15,000 --> 06:36:16,798
at these sort of events say iocs are

6088
06:36:16,798 --> 06:36:18,120
dead and stuff like that my personal

6089
06:36:18,120 --> 06:36:20,040
opinion I think that they that they can

6090
06:36:20,040 --> 06:36:21,718
add value as such

6091
06:36:21,718 --> 06:36:24,718
deep so you know why not but that's not

6092
06:36:24,718 --> 06:36:26,340
the tool for solving these evasive

6093
06:36:26,340 --> 06:36:27,240
threats that we're worried about

6094
06:36:27,240 --> 06:36:28,920
actually getting past our our security

6095
06:36:28,920 --> 06:36:30,180
trolls

6096
06:36:30,180 --> 06:36:32,100
another adversaries that buy the

6097
06:36:32,100 --> 06:36:33,420
security products to test against them

6098
06:36:33,420 --> 06:36:35,340
those aren't the ones that are you know

6099
06:36:35,340 --> 06:36:36,900
like hot with these these traditional

6100
06:36:36,900 --> 06:36:38,340
lists um because they're going to move

6101
06:36:38,340 --> 06:36:40,680
on from the hosts or the emails or

6102
06:36:40,680 --> 06:36:42,540
whatever it is

6103
06:36:42,540 --> 06:36:44,878
so we started collecting and and this

6104
06:36:44,878 --> 06:36:46,680
those were quite thoughts one instance

6105
06:36:46,680 --> 06:36:48,360
well I'll get back to clockbot in a

6106
06:36:48,360 --> 06:36:50,520
moment here but it's it's not hard to

6107
06:36:50,520 --> 06:36:52,440
imagine I'm sure a lot of people can

6108
06:36:52,440 --> 06:36:53,760
think about other instances where

6109
06:36:53,760 --> 06:36:54,958
they've dealt with reps that we were

6110
06:36:54,958 --> 06:36:56,878
learning about real time and it's harder

6111
06:36:56,878 --> 06:36:59,160
to communicate the intelligence that

6112
06:36:59,160 --> 06:37:00,298
we're Gathering about it's harder to

6113
06:37:00,298 --> 06:37:01,680
take action on it that's really what we

6114
06:37:01,680 --> 06:37:03,120
want to do is we want to take action on

6115
06:37:03,120 --> 06:37:05,120
it's really cool I really enjoy running

6116
06:37:05,120 --> 06:37:08,100
posts or putting up GitHub

6117
06:37:08,100 --> 06:37:10,920
Repose and and just doing information

6118
06:37:10,920 --> 06:37:13,680
for this think of it but really what we

6119
06:37:13,680 --> 06:37:15,420
want to do is consume this in a way that

6120
06:37:15,420 --> 06:37:18,660
results in a Net game for the Defenders

6121
06:37:18,660 --> 06:37:20,700
um so that's where I'm going to

6122
06:37:20,700 --> 06:37:21,900
introduce the

6123
06:37:21,900 --> 06:37:24,240
this this tool just as a possible thing

6124
06:37:24,240 --> 06:37:25,260
to consider

6125
06:37:25,260 --> 06:37:29,280
really interested to see how it evolves

6126
06:37:29,280 --> 06:37:32,000
thank you very much

6127
06:37:33,058 --> 06:37:34,798
I'm really interested to watch Sigma and

6128
06:37:34,798 --> 06:37:36,900
see kind of where it goes um it's uh

6129
06:37:36,900 --> 06:37:38,280
several years old

6130
06:37:38,280 --> 06:37:40,558
now presented originally at a conference

6131
06:37:40,558 --> 06:37:42,900
similar to this and um

6132
06:37:42,900 --> 06:37:45,298
what it allows us to do is write

6133
06:37:45,298 --> 06:37:48,540
signatures on Telemetry on a bunch of

6134
06:37:48,540 --> 06:37:51,000
different things but I mentioned before

6135
06:37:51,000 --> 06:37:53,638
I was trying to write Microsoft

6136
06:37:53,638 --> 06:37:55,558
detection tools with actually someone

6137
06:37:55,558 --> 06:37:57,120
sitting in the room

6138
06:37:57,120 --> 06:37:59,580
and I didn't know Sentinel stuff I knew

6139
06:37:59,580 --> 06:38:01,138
another offender so I was running back

6140
06:38:01,138 --> 06:38:02,218
he was writing that we were trying to

6141
06:38:02,218 --> 06:38:03,660
figure out how do we make this easy for

6142
06:38:03,660 --> 06:38:05,400
people to just copy and paste

6143
06:38:05,400 --> 06:38:07,680
bring to their environment and that that

6144
06:38:07,680 --> 06:38:09,840
was kind of the challenge that we had

6145
06:38:09,840 --> 06:38:11,840
um

6146
06:38:12,600 --> 06:38:15,298
okay yeah that'd be great thank you

6147
06:38:15,298 --> 06:38:17,100
so

6148
06:38:17,100 --> 06:38:19,620
let's try a different adapter

6149
06:38:19,620 --> 06:38:22,080
but for those so you can't see it that's

6150
06:38:22,080 --> 06:38:23,160
what makes

6151
06:38:23,160 --> 06:38:24,660
examples I gave

6152
06:38:24,660 --> 06:38:26,638
um were if you're familiar

6153
06:38:26,638 --> 06:38:28,740
sort you can write Network traffic

6154
06:38:28,740 --> 06:38:30,180
detect

6155
06:38:30,180 --> 06:38:31,620
protection rules for for Network traffic

6156
06:38:31,620 --> 06:38:32,760
oh this is great thank you very much

6157
06:38:32,760 --> 06:38:34,860
Mike I'll try this one out yeah I have

6158
06:38:34,860 --> 06:38:37,440
the cheapest sort of USBC to

6159
06:38:37,440 --> 06:38:39,660
HDMI dongle I could find so maybe that

6160
06:38:39,660 --> 06:38:42,600
is what's going on

6161
06:38:42,600 --> 06:38:45,377
yeah right

6162
06:38:48,718 --> 06:38:51,420
yeah this it works in the the uh

6163
06:38:51,420 --> 06:38:53,940
presentation presenters Lounge so I'm

6164
06:38:53,940 --> 06:38:56,717
hoping that I can

6165
06:38:57,000 --> 06:39:00,480
really okay well I like that

6166
06:39:00,480 --> 06:39:02,218
idea and we'll see we'll work with what

6167
06:39:02,218 --> 06:39:04,020
we got Sigma it's a generic it's open

6168
06:39:04,020 --> 06:39:06,000
source so I'm not it's not just you know

6169
06:39:06,000 --> 06:39:07,558
not

6170
06:39:07,558 --> 06:39:10,020
just uh chilling for some sort of cyber

6171
06:39:10,020 --> 06:39:11,458
security vendor

6172
06:39:11,458 --> 06:39:13,200
I hope it is indeed that cyber security

6173
06:39:13,200 --> 06:39:15,660
offenders will adopt this

6174
06:39:15,660 --> 06:39:16,980
um or at least something like this if

6175
06:39:16,980 --> 06:39:19,740
this isn't if this isn't the end.be-all

6176
06:39:19,740 --> 06:39:21,378
um

6177
06:39:21,378 --> 06:39:24,180
but thanks for your help let's try that

6178
06:39:24,180 --> 06:39:26,420
one out

6179
06:39:27,540 --> 06:39:29,940
all right um so I've mentioned snort if

6180
06:39:29,940 --> 06:39:30,840
you're familiar with that little

6181
06:39:30,840 --> 06:39:32,400
significant ways to write signatures to

6182
06:39:32,400 --> 06:39:34,320
detect uh patterns on network traffic

6183
06:39:34,320 --> 06:39:36,540
yard rules for detecting patterns on

6184
06:39:36,540 --> 06:39:38,458
files for analysis malware that sort of

6185
06:39:38,458 --> 06:39:40,980
thing what Sigma rules are are just a

6186
06:39:40,980 --> 06:39:46,080
way to write detections for logs um this

6187
06:39:46,080 --> 06:39:48,298
could be those Network logs it could be

6188
06:39:48,298 --> 06:39:51,058
you can actually write signal rules for

6189
06:39:51,058 --> 06:39:55,080
Yara but the benefit is is threat Intel

6190
06:39:55,080 --> 06:39:56,700
curators and contract covering

6191
06:39:56,700 --> 06:39:59,218
contributors and they can write these

6192
06:39:59,218 --> 06:40:01,620
signal rules that can then be consumed

6193
06:40:01,620 --> 06:40:03,058
by a lot of different organizations who

6194
06:40:03,058 --> 06:40:04,980
aren't necessarily using the product the

6195
06:40:04,980 --> 06:40:06,298
same products that they're on

6196
06:40:06,298 --> 06:40:07,260
um

6197
06:40:07,260 --> 06:40:10,080
using vendor a that can go and provide

6198
06:40:10,080 --> 06:40:12,298
this this I can provide

6199
06:40:12,298 --> 06:40:13,798
the detection and this type of rule set

6200
06:40:13,798 --> 06:40:15,540
using the intelligence that we have

6201
06:40:15,540 --> 06:40:17,940
today and I can provide it to a company

6202
06:40:17,940 --> 06:40:20,160
that's using band B

6203
06:40:20,160 --> 06:40:22,020
and hopefully 90 of The Works they're

6204
06:40:22,020 --> 06:40:24,120
done for them it's a little

6205
06:40:24,120 --> 06:40:25,940
but harder we're gonna have to

6206
06:40:25,940 --> 06:40:27,600
re-change how we're sharing some

6207
06:40:27,600 --> 06:40:29,458
intelligence but

6208
06:40:29,458 --> 06:40:32,340
but um anything I can help with I know

6209
06:40:32,340 --> 06:40:35,240
it's Linux so maybe

6210
06:40:37,378 --> 06:40:38,760
I don't know this is this is gonna be

6211
06:40:38,760 --> 06:40:40,200
stuff in my team maybe maybe it is it

6212
06:40:40,200 --> 06:40:41,340
doesn't happen in all day but I'm sure

6213
06:40:41,340 --> 06:40:42,780
my co-workers will start to say

6214
06:40:42,780 --> 06:40:44,700
something about Linux or maybe if I was

6215
06:40:44,700 --> 06:40:46,378
using Ubuntu is that is that what would

6216
06:40:46,378 --> 06:40:48,620
work

6217
06:40:49,558 --> 06:40:52,100
and

6218
06:40:52,138 --> 06:40:54,660
anyways just to try to keep it going so

6219
06:40:54,660 --> 06:40:56,760
hopefully I'll I'll try to talk about

6220
06:40:56,760 --> 06:40:59,280
some content before Oh

6221
06:40:59,280 --> 06:41:01,699
yes

6222
06:41:02,040 --> 06:41:04,340
all right

6223
06:41:04,340 --> 06:41:06,840
anyways so this was a slide that I had

6224
06:41:06,840 --> 06:41:08,218
earlier and I'm really glad we can start

6225
06:41:08,218 --> 06:41:10,680
because that communicate is there's a

6226
06:41:10,680 --> 06:41:12,480
lot of complex information that's being

6227
06:41:12,480 --> 06:41:13,860
uh communicated here and there's a lot

6228
06:41:13,860 --> 06:41:15,058
of different ways to take advantage of

6229
06:41:15,058 --> 06:41:16,620
it like are you going to look for a

6230
06:41:16,620 --> 06:41:17,820
certain type of archive all types of

6231
06:41:17,820 --> 06:41:19,620
archives so you can look for the links

6232
06:41:19,620 --> 06:41:21,480
that are executed from the child of the

6233
06:41:21,480 --> 06:41:23,100
archive and

6234
06:41:23,100 --> 06:41:24,900
again this was a search that we worked

6235
06:41:24,900 --> 06:41:26,160
on creating

6236
06:41:26,160 --> 06:41:28,500
um about a year ago and

6237
06:41:28,500 --> 06:41:31,440
or I guess six months ago and

6238
06:41:31,440 --> 06:41:33,660
um and it was uh challenging to we

6239
06:41:33,660 --> 06:41:35,458
wanted people we thought that it wasn't

6240
06:41:35,458 --> 06:41:37,200
just good enough to do to share IPS it

6241
06:41:37,200 --> 06:41:38,100
wasn't just good enough to share host

6242
06:41:38,100 --> 06:41:40,740
names if you okay if we he wanted to

6243
06:41:40,740 --> 06:41:42,000
produce an advisor that might actually

6244
06:41:42,000 --> 06:41:44,160
provide value to someone and to do that

6245
06:41:44,160 --> 06:41:46,860
we needed to communicate something more

6246
06:41:46,860 --> 06:41:48,900
complex but this requires a lot of

6247
06:41:48,900 --> 06:41:50,638
footwork in communication with some of

6248
06:41:50,638 --> 06:41:51,660
the members who received that

6249
06:41:51,660 --> 06:41:53,340
intelligence we actually had to talk

6250
06:41:53,340 --> 06:41:55,440
about this tool and uh it was really

6251
06:41:55,440 --> 06:41:57,840
interesting to learn thank you and it

6252
06:41:57,840 --> 06:41:59,400
was interesting to learn that there was

6253
06:41:59,400 --> 06:42:01,620
a lot of challenges

6254
06:42:01,620 --> 06:42:03,900
um behind consuming that this sort of

6255
06:42:03,900 --> 06:42:05,160
level of intelligence and you know you

6256
06:42:05,160 --> 06:42:06,780
can take IPS and we can put those in our

6257
06:42:06,780 --> 06:42:09,058
Fireballs it's a lot more work to do

6258
06:42:09,058 --> 06:42:10,138
this sort of thing especially small

6259
06:42:10,138 --> 06:42:12,600
shops maybe you only have you know what

6260
06:42:12,600 --> 06:42:16,320
90 security team so

6261
06:42:16,320 --> 06:42:19,138
Sigma helps us communicate I'm so glad

6262
06:42:19,138 --> 06:42:21,180
this is that's shared that's great

6263
06:42:21,180 --> 06:42:22,920
uh this is an example of the sigma

6264
06:42:22,920 --> 06:42:23,878
signature

6265
06:42:23,878 --> 06:42:25,980
um that in theory could be consumed by

6266
06:42:25,980 --> 06:42:28,378
people with 2030 I don't know what

6267
06:42:28,378 --> 06:42:30,480
they're on now different vendors and

6268
06:42:30,480 --> 06:42:32,280
even if this tool itself in this open

6269
06:42:32,280 --> 06:42:34,320
source project doesn't isn't what we end

6270
06:42:34,320 --> 06:42:35,700
up with in 10 years I really hope that

6271
06:42:35,700 --> 06:42:37,920
there's going to be tools like this that

6272
06:42:37,920 --> 06:42:41,340
we can leverage but it's a it's a common

6273
06:42:41,340 --> 06:42:42,718
um non-bender specific way of

6274
06:42:42,718 --> 06:42:46,020
communicating this detection this this

6275
06:42:46,020 --> 06:42:48,420
detection logic

6276
06:42:48,420 --> 06:42:50,520
so it's the same thing actually it's the

6277
06:42:50,520 --> 06:42:52,798
same search it would produce the same

6278
06:42:52,798 --> 06:42:54,120
search for similar searches to what we

6279
06:42:54,120 --> 06:42:56,580
share in that advisory six months ago

6280
06:42:56,580 --> 06:43:00,000
but um individuals can take this and

6281
06:43:00,000 --> 06:43:01,378
consume it in whatever way they'd like

6282
06:43:01,378 --> 06:43:02,400
maybe that does mean it's just

6283
06:43:02,400 --> 06:43:04,440
productive I mean maybe you want to take

6284
06:43:04,440 --> 06:43:06,480
this to card lacker to card crowdstrike

6285
06:43:06,480 --> 06:43:08,940
or to Microsoft Defender and you want to

6286
06:43:08,940 --> 06:43:11,280
create some sort of rule to detect this

6287
06:43:11,280 --> 06:43:12,660
in the future or disable it in the

6288
06:43:12,660 --> 06:43:14,280
future prevent it in the future

6289
06:43:14,280 --> 06:43:15,840
um again that's actually that's actually

6290
06:43:15,840 --> 06:43:17,700
stuff that we took back in the day

6291
06:43:17,700 --> 06:43:20,878
um at an organization and and it was

6292
06:43:20,878 --> 06:43:22,980
helpful of course the adversary updates

6293
06:43:22,980 --> 06:43:23,878
there

6294
06:43:23,878 --> 06:43:26,878
their tactics so things change but this

6295
06:43:26,878 --> 06:43:27,958
was actually the way we were able to

6296
06:43:27,958 --> 06:43:30,540
take the end intelligence share it in a

6297
06:43:30,540 --> 06:43:31,798
way that people can read it uses the

6298
06:43:31,798 --> 06:43:33,480
animal

6299
06:43:33,480 --> 06:43:35,878
no no I will you can see that it looks

6300
06:43:35,878 --> 06:43:37,440
great if you're not familiar with that

6301
06:43:37,440 --> 06:43:38,760
everything's starting seems like

6302
06:43:38,760 --> 06:43:40,620
starting to adopt it and you know it's

6303
06:43:40,620 --> 06:43:42,120
great too because even our other deaf

6304
06:43:42,120 --> 06:43:44,820
setup teams or devops teams um Can can

6305
06:43:44,820 --> 06:43:46,860
know how to consume this it's a great uh

6306
06:43:46,860 --> 06:43:48,480
format because it's

6307
06:43:48,480 --> 06:43:50,638
consumable both by a human very easily

6308
06:43:50,638 --> 06:43:52,440
and machines very easily and that's what

6309
06:43:52,440 --> 06:43:54,058
I'm gonna get at that's the most that's

6310
06:43:54,058 --> 06:43:56,718
the important part

6311
06:43:56,820 --> 06:43:57,420
um

6312
06:43:57,420 --> 06:44:00,958
I that was the uh example of quite a lot

6313
06:44:00,958 --> 06:44:03,480
of using the archive to ISO to image

6314
06:44:03,480 --> 06:44:04,620
sort of

6315
06:44:04,620 --> 06:44:07,020
uh attack pattern but going way back to

6316
06:44:07,020 --> 06:44:08,940
Molina back when I hadn't you know

6317
06:44:08,940 --> 06:44:10,558
really even discovered that and we wrote

6318
06:44:10,558 --> 06:44:13,798
These this big query windows

6319
06:44:13,798 --> 06:44:18,540
and uh another vendor and uh this is a

6320
06:44:18,540 --> 06:44:20,638
similar uh Rule and you don't have to

6321
06:44:20,638 --> 06:44:21,958
read the details I'll figure out a way

6322
06:44:21,958 --> 06:44:23,638
to if you're interested in this live

6323
06:44:23,638 --> 06:44:25,080
deck you know come and talk to me or

6324
06:44:25,080 --> 06:44:26,580
I'll post this on that site that I

6325
06:44:26,580 --> 06:44:28,798
provided earlier as well but if in case

6326
06:44:28,798 --> 06:44:30,000
you're wanting to look at the details

6327
06:44:30,000 --> 06:44:31,440
but

6328
06:44:31,440 --> 06:44:34,020
um this is a a rule set that's written

6329
06:44:34,020 --> 06:44:36,480
in the sigma format and on the right

6330
06:44:36,480 --> 06:44:37,740
side you're not meant you're not

6331
06:44:37,740 --> 06:44:39,660
intended to be able to read that

6332
06:44:39,660 --> 06:44:41,760
so don't worry about it if you can my

6333
06:44:41,760 --> 06:44:43,080
intention is to show that I was able to

6334
06:44:43,080 --> 06:44:46,138
produce mostly working queries and I've

6335
06:44:46,138 --> 06:44:47,340
consumed a lot of these signatures

6336
06:44:47,340 --> 06:44:49,620
myself and sometimes you have to

6337
06:44:49,620 --> 06:44:51,780
you're not an index main you're an index

6338
06:44:51,780 --> 06:44:54,420
uh I don't know one or index two or

6339
06:44:54,420 --> 06:44:56,580
index Foo or index bar in case there's

6340
06:44:56,580 --> 06:44:58,740
any developers out there um

6341
06:44:58,740 --> 06:45:00,840
but you might have to modify it slightly

6342
06:45:00,840 --> 06:45:01,920
but the reality is you could take this

6343
06:45:01,920 --> 06:45:03,480
and with very little footwork you don't

6344
06:45:03,480 --> 06:45:04,740
have to take a grief from a vendor that

6345
06:45:04,740 --> 06:45:06,718
you don't know and cons and write it in

6346
06:45:06,718 --> 06:45:09,120
kql or take it from kql and write it in

6347
06:45:09,120 --> 06:45:11,400
your tool or whatever it is

6348
06:45:11,400 --> 06:45:13,740
okay which as I know maybe kick you out

6349
06:45:13,740 --> 06:45:14,878
will help with some of this as well as

6350
06:45:14,878 --> 06:45:16,680
we just start to get this uh common

6351
06:45:16,680 --> 06:45:19,440
standard but

6352
06:45:19,440 --> 06:45:21,780
this wrote signatures for me it's almost

6353
06:45:21,780 --> 06:45:24,000
like chat uh chat GPT

6354
06:45:24,000 --> 06:45:26,280
except for in signatures and you feed it

6355
06:45:26,280 --> 06:45:27,900
something much more specific it wrote

6356
06:45:27,900 --> 06:45:29,340
all these signatures these these

6357
06:45:29,340 --> 06:45:31,558
searches for me for systems that I'm not

6358
06:45:31,558 --> 06:45:33,058
familiar with and that if I was trying

6359
06:45:33,058 --> 06:45:34,740
to produce intelligence for

6360
06:45:34,740 --> 06:45:36,540
members I would have not been able to

6361
06:45:36,540 --> 06:45:38,280
produce that to produce those searches

6362
06:45:38,280 --> 06:45:39,298
for

6363
06:45:39,298 --> 06:45:42,480
um for those it does use a local tool

6364
06:45:42,480 --> 06:45:45,000
there is a vendor I'm going to bring up

6365
06:45:45,000 --> 06:45:46,378
you don't have to use them or anything

6366
06:45:46,378 --> 06:45:48,900
but they have this free online unencoder

6367
06:45:48,900 --> 06:45:50,638
tool and I just have a bunch of slides

6368
06:45:50,638 --> 06:45:52,680
here to show how simple

6369
06:45:52,680 --> 06:45:54,958
again this is the execution from

6370
06:45:54,958 --> 06:45:56,878
temporarily mounted eyesore image search

6371
06:45:56,878 --> 06:46:00,120
that I had before and I'm creating a

6372
06:46:00,120 --> 06:46:03,180
Google query of which I would have to

6373
06:46:03,180 --> 06:46:04,860
read a lot to build right query for I'm

6374
06:46:04,860 --> 06:46:06,718
writing it for qradar

6375
06:46:06,718 --> 06:46:08,700
um it was that was elasticsearch

6376
06:46:08,700 --> 06:46:10,080
carbon black

6377
06:46:10,080 --> 06:46:12,180
crosswreck you get the idea I'm able to

6378
06:46:12,180 --> 06:46:14,900
produce multiple as a threat Intel

6379
06:46:14,900 --> 06:46:16,680
contributor and even if you're just

6380
06:46:16,680 --> 06:46:18,058
sharing with your another organization

6381
06:46:18,058 --> 06:46:20,100
or I was really excited today hearing

6382
06:46:20,100 --> 06:46:22,558
about a managed security

6383
06:46:22,558 --> 06:46:25,138
type of company who's using it within

6384
06:46:25,138 --> 06:46:26,520
their organization and they're able to

6385
06:46:26,520 --> 06:46:28,920
share that and provide value to their to

6386
06:46:28,920 --> 06:46:30,840
their customers and that's kind of a

6387
06:46:30,840 --> 06:46:32,400
really great

6388
06:46:32,400 --> 06:46:34,320
use case as well

6389
06:46:34,320 --> 06:46:36,540
but for us producing threat intelligence

6390
06:46:36,540 --> 06:46:37,978
is that this is something that we can

6391
06:46:37,978 --> 06:46:41,100
share as a as a format

6392
06:46:41,100 --> 06:46:42,540
shares a gamma file you can put it in

6393
06:46:42,540 --> 06:46:43,680
the body of something and as long as

6394
06:46:43,680 --> 06:46:45,000
people start to get to know about this

6395
06:46:45,000 --> 06:46:47,218
and as long as the awareness is there on

6396
06:46:47,218 --> 06:46:49,378
how to use this which again is copy and

6397
06:46:49,378 --> 06:46:51,478
paste so that's great for me that's the

6398
06:46:51,478 --> 06:46:52,440
level of effort I want to put into

6399
06:46:52,440 --> 06:46:54,540
something we can start to get value out

6400
06:46:54,540 --> 06:46:56,520
of it so

6401
06:46:56,520 --> 06:46:58,138
um with that I actually wanted to I had

6402
06:46:58,138 --> 06:46:59,580
I really had a realization where I think

6403
06:46:59,580 --> 06:47:00,600
that this is really where the Natural

6404
06:47:00,600 --> 06:47:02,400
Evolution is anyway

6405
06:47:02,400 --> 06:47:04,100
this is the take this complex

6406
06:47:04,100 --> 06:47:06,478
intelligence and apply a historical data

6407
06:47:06,478 --> 06:47:08,820
and apply it to Adaptive and evolving

6408
06:47:08,820 --> 06:47:10,260
threat

6409
06:47:10,260 --> 06:47:11,760
yes

6410
06:47:11,760 --> 06:47:12,298
um

6411
06:47:12,298 --> 06:47:15,840
so quick in this this is some this

6412
06:47:15,840 --> 06:47:17,940
isn't going to be new if you're new to

6413
06:47:17,940 --> 06:47:19,260
cyber then this is really cool I'll

6414
06:47:19,260 --> 06:47:20,940
review I think but you know back in the

6415
06:47:20,940 --> 06:47:23,458
day we had this um strategy this

6416
06:47:23,458 --> 06:47:25,020
defense in depth which certainly isn't

6417
06:47:25,020 --> 06:47:26,400
dead and it's a very good principle to

6418
06:47:26,400 --> 06:47:28,620
live by now but this common idea was

6419
06:47:28,620 --> 06:47:30,000
that

6420
06:47:30,000 --> 06:47:32,820
um adversaries only had to be right once

6421
06:47:32,820 --> 06:47:34,080
and the defender had to be right all the

6422
06:47:34,080 --> 06:47:36,600
time and we could compensate for this by

6423
06:47:36,600 --> 06:47:38,160
deploying multiple prevention tools and

6424
06:47:38,160 --> 06:47:39,240
put them in line with each other one

6425
06:47:39,240 --> 06:47:40,978
fails the next comes into place and you

6426
06:47:40,978 --> 06:47:42,240
kind of did this over and over until you

6427
06:47:42,240 --> 06:47:43,680
run out of budget or until there was no

6428
06:47:43,680 --> 06:47:45,298
more security vendors out there and it's

6429
06:47:45,298 --> 06:47:46,558
kind of like this I love I always love

6430
06:47:46,558 --> 06:47:49,080
the castle analogy you have all these

6431
06:47:49,080 --> 06:47:50,638
different defensive you know it's

6432
06:47:50,638 --> 06:47:52,200
age-old kind of

6433
06:47:52,200 --> 06:47:54,718
um Theory or I guess a strategy for

6434
06:47:54,718 --> 06:47:56,280
trying to talk about defenses but you

6435
06:47:56,280 --> 06:47:57,958
know castles had moats they had Gates

6436
06:47:57,958 --> 06:48:01,080
they had um whatever that is and draw

6437
06:48:01,080 --> 06:48:02,160
Bridges

6438
06:48:02,160 --> 06:48:02,940
um

6439
06:48:02,940 --> 06:48:04,378
they had to keep and had all these

6440
06:48:04,378 --> 06:48:05,878
layers that if one fell they could kind

6441
06:48:05,878 --> 06:48:07,020
of go back to the next and that's kind

6442
06:48:07,020 --> 06:48:08,280
of this idea behind them depends in

6443
06:48:08,280 --> 06:48:10,320
depth and it's still needed today but

6444
06:48:10,320 --> 06:48:12,298
then this idea that adversaries had to

6445
06:48:12,298 --> 06:48:14,160
be right only once was

6446
06:48:14,160 --> 06:48:15,840
kind of flipped around a little bit in

6447
06:48:15,840 --> 06:48:17,458
2010 Lockheed Martin came out with the

6448
06:48:17,458 --> 06:48:18,958
skill chain and they demonstrated how

6449
06:48:18,958 --> 06:48:20,458
perhaps the opposite is really true

6450
06:48:20,458 --> 06:48:22,378
where adversaries

6451
06:48:22,378 --> 06:48:24,478
only have to be right once in terms of

6452
06:48:24,478 --> 06:48:26,340
blocking and breaking this chain of

6453
06:48:26,340 --> 06:48:27,900
activities that an adversary needed

6454
06:48:27,900 --> 06:48:29,820
needed to perform and the adversary

6455
06:48:29,820 --> 06:48:31,378
needed to be right all these other times

6456
06:48:31,378 --> 06:48:34,320
and uh eventually we wanted to look at

6457
06:48:34,320 --> 06:48:35,820
okay this is this would become strategic

6458
06:48:35,820 --> 06:48:37,740
strategy document

6459
06:48:37,740 --> 06:48:40,200
okay I'm going to talk about miter and

6460
06:48:40,200 --> 06:48:41,040
uh

6461
06:48:41,040 --> 06:48:43,458
you know uh uh

6462
06:48:43,458 --> 06:48:45,718
model and when I was getting the

6463
06:48:45,718 --> 06:48:47,040
industry I thought that these were just

6464
06:48:47,040 --> 06:48:48,900
a lot of the same ideas or different

6465
06:48:48,900 --> 06:48:50,580
different approaches to the same thing

6466
06:48:50,580 --> 06:48:52,080
but they're really not and they can

6467
06:48:52,080 --> 06:48:53,458
they're not different ways they're

6468
06:48:53,458 --> 06:48:55,440
actually can be used in conjunction and

6469
06:48:55,440 --> 06:48:56,760
there's this Natural Evolution that we

6470
06:48:56,760 --> 06:48:58,740
start to see I think so we had to

6471
06:48:58,740 --> 06:49:00,600
strategy we're like okay let's disrupt

6472
06:49:00,600 --> 06:49:02,458
the kill chain but how do we actually

6473
06:49:02,458 --> 06:49:04,320
apply that we still rely on defensive

6474
06:49:04,320 --> 06:49:06,180
depth and that's when oops I went

6475
06:49:06,180 --> 06:49:08,160
backwards going forwards in time we

6476
06:49:08,160 --> 06:49:09,298
wanted to operationalize the strategy

6477
06:49:09,298 --> 06:49:11,280
and that's when a little bit after some

6478
06:49:11,280 --> 06:49:13,138
years later writer attack came out miter

6479
06:49:13,138 --> 06:49:15,180
came out with a tactile framework excuse

6480
06:49:15,180 --> 06:49:16,798
me fighter came out with the attack

6481
06:49:16,798 --> 06:49:18,840
framework and it's allowed us to

6482
06:49:18,840 --> 06:49:19,920
communicate

6483
06:49:19,920 --> 06:49:21,478
between each other it kind of gave us

6484
06:49:21,478 --> 06:49:22,920
some common terminology if you were in a

6485
06:49:22,920 --> 06:49:24,120
government space you

6486
06:49:24,120 --> 06:49:26,040
had trouble communicating with private

6487
06:49:26,040 --> 06:49:27,298
there's different ways describing things

6488
06:49:27,298 --> 06:49:29,580
and it gave us this common uh grounds to

6489
06:49:29,580 --> 06:49:31,320
communicate on and to just

6490
06:49:31,320 --> 06:49:33,660
describe it's an it would say it became

6491
06:49:33,660 --> 06:49:35,340
both an operational construct but we

6492
06:49:35,340 --> 06:49:38,040
were able to really put into action the

6493
06:49:38,040 --> 06:49:41,100
this kill chain concept

6494
06:49:41,100 --> 06:49:43,200
and it also became a knowledge base for

6495
06:49:43,200 --> 06:49:44,580
storing some of those you know if you go

6496
06:49:44,580 --> 06:49:46,080
there now you can see a lot of the big

6497
06:49:46,080 --> 06:49:47,638
adversaries and their tactics and

6498
06:49:47,638 --> 06:49:49,260
techniques that they use

6499
06:49:49,260 --> 06:49:49,860
um

6500
06:49:49,860 --> 06:49:51,900
and that's helpful too but this

6501
06:49:51,900 --> 06:49:53,218
operational constructs really what I

6502
06:49:53,218 --> 06:49:54,478
think is interesting really helpful and

6503
06:49:54,478 --> 06:49:55,920
it's trying to most comprehensively

6504
06:49:55,920 --> 06:49:58,080
cover all the different tactics and

6505
06:49:58,080 --> 06:50:01,798
techniques and uh this was in 2013 and I

6506
06:50:01,798 --> 06:50:03,360
and I've been excited to see you over

6507
06:50:03,360 --> 06:50:05,700
the last several years vendors start to

6508
06:50:05,700 --> 06:50:07,620
implement that more into their products

6509
06:50:07,620 --> 06:50:09,120
and show you hey here's a minor attack

6510
06:50:09,120 --> 06:50:11,458
coverage we have or maybe even here's an

6511
06:50:11,458 --> 06:50:13,500
event here's what attack technique Maps

6512
06:50:13,500 --> 06:50:16,080
too that's awesome

6513
06:50:16,080 --> 06:50:17,940
um it took many years and Community

6514
06:50:17,940 --> 06:50:19,920
involvement it's open source to you can

6515
06:50:19,920 --> 06:50:21,360
contribute to it as well as vendor

6516
06:50:21,360 --> 06:50:23,400
engagement and vendor integration that

6517
06:50:23,400 --> 06:50:25,680
really made it possible to add value and

6518
06:50:25,680 --> 06:50:26,878
then one of my favorite this diamond

6519
06:50:26,878 --> 06:50:30,298
model the choose analysis this I'm not

6520
06:50:30,298 --> 06:50:31,260
necessarily being the defense and

6521
06:50:31,260 --> 06:50:32,400
strategy we were just talking about it's

6522
06:50:32,400 --> 06:50:34,740
around the same time actually in four

6523
06:50:34,740 --> 06:50:37,080
different problems focusing on threat

6524
06:50:37,080 --> 06:50:40,080
intelligence sharing there is this way

6525
06:50:40,080 --> 06:50:43,200
of again communicating at this or Atomic

6526
06:50:43,200 --> 06:50:45,180
level like what is the the minimum uh

6527
06:50:45,180 --> 06:50:46,978
element that we're dealing with here

6528
06:50:46,978 --> 06:50:48,478
that we can communicate information

6529
06:50:48,478 --> 06:50:50,940
about adversaries help me get on the

6530
06:50:50,940 --> 06:50:52,978
same page and nowadays there's

6531
06:50:52,978 --> 06:50:55,200
um you know threat connects the

6532
06:50:55,200 --> 06:50:57,540
organization who you know Andy

6533
06:50:57,540 --> 06:50:59,340
Pendergrass who went to that

6534
06:50:59,340 --> 06:51:00,978
organization now there's serious

6535
06:51:00,978 --> 06:51:02,940
operation license at machine machine

6536
06:51:02,940 --> 06:51:06,540
level and use this model to share pull

6537
06:51:06,540 --> 06:51:08,040
information contribute to and it's a

6538
06:51:08,040 --> 06:51:09,478
great resource for threat intelligence

6539
06:51:09,478 --> 06:51:13,620
uh groups and curators and that is a way

6540
06:51:13,620 --> 06:51:15,420
that we operationalize this in Intel

6541
06:51:15,420 --> 06:51:18,240
adversary intelligence but

6542
06:51:18,240 --> 06:51:20,280
um now we're trying to focus on what we

6543
06:51:20,280 --> 06:51:21,478
know we need to focus on which is that

6544
06:51:21,478 --> 06:51:25,138
peak of the the TTP pure Amanda pain or

6545
06:51:25,138 --> 06:51:26,820
I should say the Pyramid of pain and we

6546
06:51:26,820 --> 06:51:29,340
have all of these attacks being blocked

6547
06:51:29,340 --> 06:51:31,920
by uh this our security controls we have

6548
06:51:31,920 --> 06:51:34,020
some attacks being detected and blocked

6549
06:51:34,020 --> 06:51:36,660
by the traditional LCDs that we have and

6550
06:51:36,660 --> 06:51:38,700
maybe you disagree on where the blue and

6551
06:51:38,700 --> 06:51:40,138
green should go I think that's that's

6552
06:51:40,138 --> 06:51:41,638
sure that could be debated but I think

6553
06:51:41,638 --> 06:51:43,860
the reality is they're certainly on top

6554
06:51:43,860 --> 06:51:46,200
they're at the smaller grouping of

6555
06:51:46,200 --> 06:51:48,058
threats that are bypassing both and

6556
06:51:48,058 --> 06:51:49,798
that's what we're trying to talk about

6557
06:51:49,798 --> 06:51:51,180
should care about when we're doing

6558
06:51:51,180 --> 06:51:52,200
threat hunting right because it makes

6559
06:51:52,200 --> 06:51:53,940
sense to detect threats with threat

6560
06:51:53,940 --> 06:51:55,378
hunting that our other security controls

6561
06:51:55,378 --> 06:51:56,820
are blocked so

6562
06:51:56,820 --> 06:51:58,080
we're always talking to the base of

6563
06:51:58,080 --> 06:51:59,760
breaths ever rewarder can get past that

6564
06:51:59,760 --> 06:52:01,978
and so threat hunting becomes this

6565
06:52:01,978 --> 06:52:04,320
proactive way

6566
06:52:04,320 --> 06:52:06,478
where we can retroactively look at our

6567
06:52:06,478 --> 06:52:08,340
historical data to try to identify this

6568
06:52:08,340 --> 06:52:12,058
and combine it with our Modern Art

6569
06:52:12,058 --> 06:52:15,180
Pi processes it can really it's actually

6570
06:52:15,180 --> 06:52:17,700
built in a way that complements both

6571
06:52:17,700 --> 06:52:21,000
from the miter attack side there's tax

6572
06:52:21,000 --> 06:52:23,660
part of the design was to allow for that

6573
06:52:23,660 --> 06:52:27,840
metadata commenting for the tax that are

6574
06:52:27,840 --> 06:52:29,458
the techniques I should say that are

6575
06:52:29,458 --> 06:52:31,680
really that this Advanced describing

6576
06:52:31,680 --> 06:52:33,780
because it's not the same and if those

6577
06:52:33,780 --> 06:52:35,940
of you who have these tools who show you

6578
06:52:35,940 --> 06:52:38,160
here's the matter attack event

6579
06:52:38,160 --> 06:52:40,138
that's not always actionable that's not

6580
06:52:40,138 --> 06:52:41,638
always bad sometimes those are events

6581
06:52:41,638 --> 06:52:43,620
and that's helpful context but this is a

6582
06:52:43,620 --> 06:52:46,260
way that we can communicate that and

6583
06:52:46,260 --> 06:52:47,820
have this in a package that people can

6584
06:52:47,820 --> 06:52:50,340
assume it connects with my attack okay

6585
06:52:50,340 --> 06:52:52,440
that's great and I was talking with Andy

6586
06:52:52,440 --> 06:52:54,120
Pendergast about you know the

6587
06:52:54,120 --> 06:52:55,138
integration with the current threat

6588
06:52:55,138 --> 06:52:56,520
connect model and the diamond model that

6589
06:52:56,520 --> 06:52:57,660
they're operationalizing and other

6590
06:52:57,660 --> 06:52:59,160
vendors certainly have you know other

6591
06:52:59,160 --> 06:53:00,718
ways of accomplishing this too but now

6592
06:53:00,718 --> 06:53:02,340
the model's evolved a lot and there's

6593
06:53:02,340 --> 06:53:04,378
this concept part of that model is this

6594
06:53:04,378 --> 06:53:06,180
these signatures which again the same

6595
06:53:06,180 --> 06:53:09,058
examples I gave for Sigma snore Yara and

6596
06:53:09,058 --> 06:53:10,680
now Sigma they can integrate very well

6597
06:53:10,680 --> 06:53:11,940
with them you can add these signatures

6598
06:53:11,940 --> 06:53:14,820
and Associate them to the adversaries to

6599
06:53:14,820 --> 06:53:17,218
the campaigns or even to the Cyber

6600
06:53:17,218 --> 06:53:19,558
observables themselves and describe that

6601
06:53:19,558 --> 06:53:21,660
actually described the Cyber observables

6602
06:53:21,660 --> 06:53:22,978
in a more

6603
06:53:22,978 --> 06:53:24,660
complex Way by saying this is the

6604
06:53:24,660 --> 06:53:25,860
signature that matches the activity

6605
06:53:25,860 --> 06:53:28,558
activity that this cyber observable was

6606
06:53:28,558 --> 06:53:30,360
found in

6607
06:53:30,360 --> 06:53:31,740
and

6608
06:53:31,740 --> 06:53:33,718
so kind of what what do we do with all

6609
06:53:33,718 --> 06:53:34,920
this information kind of where we go

6610
06:53:34,920 --> 06:53:37,200
with this uh I get excited about threat

6611
06:53:37,200 --> 06:53:38,760
intelligence because I think that it

6612
06:53:38,760 --> 06:53:40,200
seems to me like it was one of those

6613
06:53:40,200 --> 06:53:41,520
things that you kind of had to be like a

6614
06:53:41,520 --> 06:53:43,218
threat researcher at a you know

6615
06:53:43,218 --> 06:53:45,360
multi-million dollar research company to

6616
06:53:45,360 --> 06:53:46,378
build

6617
06:53:46,378 --> 06:53:48,298
or contribute to but I've actually found

6618
06:53:48,298 --> 06:53:49,798
that there's a lot of value in the

6619
06:53:49,798 --> 06:53:51,840
community data I mean I found actionable

6620
06:53:51,840 --> 06:53:53,218
Intelligence on Twitter I found

6621
06:53:53,218 --> 06:53:54,840
actionable Intelligence on Reddit and

6622
06:53:54,840 --> 06:53:55,740
it's just

6623
06:53:55,740 --> 06:53:57,478
people sharing the stuff that they think

6624
06:53:57,478 --> 06:53:59,218
is interesting that they think that

6625
06:53:59,218 --> 06:54:00,478
other people might want to know about it

6626
06:54:00,478 --> 06:54:02,340
because

6627
06:54:02,340 --> 06:54:03,900
controls are different than what we've

6628
06:54:03,900 --> 06:54:05,458
seen so

6629
06:54:05,458 --> 06:54:07,440
um what when I when you're walking away

6630
06:54:07,440 --> 06:54:10,020
there's a few ways to take

6631
06:54:10,020 --> 06:54:11,820
a send to take action on it within your

6632
06:54:11,820 --> 06:54:14,760
own organization maybe look for those

6633
06:54:14,760 --> 06:54:16,138
groups that are trying to share this

6634
06:54:16,138 --> 06:54:17,638
intelligence to each other maybe see if

6635
06:54:17,638 --> 06:54:19,138
Sigma is the right tool for you and your

6636
06:54:19,138 --> 06:54:20,700
organization see if it connects with

6637
06:54:20,700 --> 06:54:23,400
your shops or um if not and you're

6638
06:54:23,400 --> 06:54:24,840
really interested in it maybe contribute

6639
06:54:24,840 --> 06:54:27,540
to adding those modules it's it's a

6640
06:54:27,540 --> 06:54:30,240
model in a sense that you can build uh

6641
06:54:30,240 --> 06:54:33,180
new uh outputs for it so your products

6642
06:54:33,180 --> 06:54:34,978
not supported Andy

6643
06:54:34,978 --> 06:54:36,600
and they're very quickly adapting and

6644
06:54:36,600 --> 06:54:40,740
evolving that or else so if you're not

6645
06:54:40,740 --> 06:54:42,978
an organization I know there's a lot of

6646
06:54:42,978 --> 06:54:44,700
individuals in here who are going

6647
06:54:44,700 --> 06:54:46,620
through their academic part of their

6648
06:54:46,620 --> 06:54:47,820
career path

6649
06:54:47,820 --> 06:54:51,298
um look at maybe generating this uh this

6650
06:54:51,298 --> 06:54:52,740
type of intelligence based off of the

6651
06:54:52,740 --> 06:54:54,360
other intelligence that's out there

6652
06:54:54,360 --> 06:54:56,520
maybe consume some reports and a

6653
06:54:56,520 --> 06:54:58,798
report's great but we can't read

6654
06:54:58,798 --> 06:55:00,420
hundreds of reports and take action on

6655
06:55:00,420 --> 06:55:01,740
all of them every day those of us that

6656
06:55:01,740 --> 06:55:03,780
are trying to defend organizations but

6657
06:55:03,780 --> 06:55:06,360
maybe we can do hundreds of a single day

6658
06:55:06,360 --> 06:55:07,500
maybe that's something that's actually

6659
06:55:07,500 --> 06:55:09,958
actionable the GitHub project that

6660
06:55:09,958 --> 06:55:12,000
signal is a part of has rule sets those

6661
06:55:12,000 --> 06:55:13,320
are great you can contribute to those as

6662
06:55:13,320 --> 06:55:14,820
well

6663
06:55:14,820 --> 06:55:16,080
um so there's all these ways to get

6664
06:55:16,080 --> 06:55:17,700
involved and to get connected with that

6665
06:55:17,700 --> 06:55:19,740
Community

6666
06:55:19,740 --> 06:55:21,360
um and then for those who are practicing

6667
06:55:21,360 --> 06:55:23,160
and who are looking at the hunting

6668
06:55:23,160 --> 06:55:24,780
application of this

6669
06:55:24,780 --> 06:55:25,620
um

6670
06:55:25,620 --> 06:55:27,600
there's there's a lot this is uh they're

6671
06:55:27,600 --> 06:55:30,420
hunting's really awesome like I said

6672
06:55:30,420 --> 06:55:32,218
um it can be something that has a lower

6673
06:55:32,218 --> 06:55:34,020
rate of return so it's just something to

6674
06:55:34,020 --> 06:55:35,580
be careful about and something to know

6675
06:55:35,580 --> 06:55:36,600
about

6676
06:55:36,600 --> 06:55:38,458
I think combining threat hunting within

6677
06:55:38,458 --> 06:55:39,840
threat intelligence will allow you to

6678
06:55:39,840 --> 06:55:42,020
focus the hype

6679
06:55:42,020 --> 06:55:45,600
hypotheses that you actually pursue

6680
06:55:45,600 --> 06:55:47,820
Focus those on things that are more

6681
06:55:47,820 --> 06:55:50,700
likely to derive value to indicate to

6682
06:55:50,700 --> 06:55:52,200
surface an attack that took place in

6683
06:55:52,200 --> 06:55:53,638
your organization

6684
06:55:53,638 --> 06:55:55,558
um and it's a lot it may be more

6685
06:55:55,558 --> 06:55:57,780
efficient than a statistical curiosity

6686
06:55:57,780 --> 06:56:00,298
driven threat hunting that we see at

6687
06:56:00,298 --> 06:56:02,820
other big security research companies we

6688
06:56:02,820 --> 06:56:04,200
still need that and if you're at a team

6689
06:56:04,200 --> 06:56:06,900
of 50 thread Hunters spending hours or

6690
06:56:06,900 --> 06:56:09,058
hundreds of hours or several hundreds of

6691
06:56:09,058 --> 06:56:10,978
hours and to find a new way of detecting

6692
06:56:10,978 --> 06:56:12,660
a threat and being able to provide that

6693
06:56:12,660 --> 06:56:14,100
for hundreds of thousands of customers

6694
06:56:14,100 --> 06:56:16,378
is awesome and the industry needs that

6695
06:56:16,378 --> 06:56:17,820
but if you're also an organization where

6696
06:56:17,820 --> 06:56:19,378
you've seen an interesting threat or you

6697
06:56:19,378 --> 06:56:21,298
hear about an interesting threat and you

6698
06:56:21,298 --> 06:56:22,500
think hey

6699
06:56:22,500 --> 06:56:24,240
did we defend about do we defend against

6700
06:56:24,240 --> 06:56:25,620
that we found out about

6701
06:56:25,620 --> 06:56:27,120
it two weeks after it happened did we

6702
06:56:27,120 --> 06:56:28,860
defend against it um this is a way of

6703
06:56:28,860 --> 06:56:30,540
retroactively going back into that so

6704
06:56:30,540 --> 06:56:32,218
I'm excited to see where Sigma goes I'm

6705
06:56:32,218 --> 06:56:34,200
hoping it kind of kicks off um I'll be

6706
06:56:34,200 --> 06:56:35,820
contributing to it and I'll be consuming

6707
06:56:35,820 --> 06:56:37,020
it too

6708
06:56:37,020 --> 06:56:39,540
so and I just want to also say that's

6709
06:56:39,540 --> 06:56:40,798
kind of the end but I just want to say a

6710
06:56:40,798 --> 06:56:41,760
lot

6711
06:56:41,760 --> 06:56:43,978
in this room if you're have contributed

6712
06:56:43,978 --> 06:56:45,360
to these ideas and discover these things

6713
06:56:45,360 --> 06:56:46,798
with me so I wanted to thank everyone

6714
06:56:46,798 --> 06:56:49,200
who's taught me a lot of the mentors

6715
06:56:49,200 --> 06:56:51,680
that I get to see and a lot of the

6716
06:56:51,680 --> 06:56:54,540
collaborators that I have so just wanna

6717
06:56:54,540 --> 06:56:56,400
thank you guys for your time I was

6718
06:56:56,400 --> 06:57:00,200
interesting and thank you very much

6719
06:57:07,520 --> 06:57:09,540
and then I think I'll be out in the hall

6720
06:57:09,540 --> 06:57:11,760
but as I understand it we're out of time

6721
06:57:11,760 --> 06:57:13,080
for questions to help you out Hall if

6722
06:57:13,080 --> 06:57:14,878
you're interested in talking about it

6723
06:57:14,878 --> 06:57:17,000
