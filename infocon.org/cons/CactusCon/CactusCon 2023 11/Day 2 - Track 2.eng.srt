1
00:00:00,539 --> 00:00:01,979
um also if you just click in a blank

2
00:00:01,979 --> 00:00:04,620
spot in the graph you can add nodes add

3
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:07,620
edges which sometimes is useful

4
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:10,260
going into Cipher itself I'll talk to

5
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:12,240
let Frank talk this for a second okay

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,860
yeah so this is kind of also a lot to

7
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:14,880
look at

8
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,440
um but basically just trying to break

9
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:19,260
down what a cipher query looks like so

10
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:20,640
um I've kind of highlighted this so it

11
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:21,900
makes a little bit of sense but it's

12
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:23,820
still kind of difficult to look at but

13
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:27,000
so basically we have the match and the

14
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,580
return statements so those are pretty

15
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:30,660
much always going to be in all of your

16
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:32,880
queries this one in particular is saying

17
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,219
match P equals and then it's running

18
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:38,280
this shortest path function so p is

19
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:41,700
becoming a variable for the path that

20
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:44,040
comes out of the the query it's looking

21
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:47,040
for shortest paths from a node that is

22
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:49,680
labeled as n that's just like a variable

23
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,719
that gets assigned to what you're

24
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:54,300
looking for the path from and then we're

25
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:57,660
saying with the property of own true so

26
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:01,020
this is sort of pass from uh any node

27
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:03,780
that is owned true with any of these

28
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:06,659
relationship types in green these are

29
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:09,180
all ones that basically were like

30
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:12,060
filtered in a previous query so

31
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:13,439
um you know all of these are different

32
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:15,659
types then you can see at the end where

33
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:19,520
it says star one dot dot that's because

34
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,380
uh if you look down here like I guess I

35
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:24,780
can't Point still but um the green thing

36
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:27,119
it says type and then you do an asterisk

37
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:29,460
Min hops Max hops that's saying anything

38
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:32,340
that is of any of those types minimum

39
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:33,500
one hop

40
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:37,619
two M which is another variable that one

41
00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:40,560
is actually labeled to a group so it's

42
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,299
only making this query to any node that

43
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:43,280
is a group

44
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,960
and then again we're doing node

45
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:48,060
properties the name is domain admins at

46
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:50,100
domain.com and then it's just saying

47
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:52,020
we're not n equals m return P so this

48
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:57,360
returns a path from owned principles to

49
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,840
um domain admins using any of those

50
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:03,600
any of those Edge types so hopefully

51
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,799
that makes a little bit of sense because

52
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:06,060
we're going to show a few more queries

53
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:09,060
after this I also included a reference

54
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:12,840
to ebook from a workshop about just

55
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,900
Cipher and how Bloodhound uses it uh I

56
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,040
think it's a really good reference if

57
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,300
you're trying to understand how the

58
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:20,099
cipher query language Works in relation

59
00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:21,360
to bloodhound

60
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,480
looking at this screenshot I'll go ahead

61
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,760
and let Frank cover it but there's a

62
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,440
couple cool things you can do this is

63
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:31,500
the neo4j console which is separate from

64
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:34,080
Bloodhound but I find that I use them

65
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,540
both pretty frequently

66
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:38,520
yeah I think the main thing that we

67
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,620
wanted to call out on this uh was just

68
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:42,540
enabling the multi-statement query

69
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:45,060
editor um checkbox uh I think that's

70
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:46,980
been that's been enabled for me by

71
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:49,440
default recently but it wasn't before

72
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,360
um so just make sure that's checked

73
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,280
um one one cool thing that you can do

74
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,019
that you can't really do within the

75
00:02:55,019 --> 00:02:56,160
Bloodhound

76
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:56,819
um

77
00:02:56,819 --> 00:02:58,800
front-end application is like if for

78
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,480
example you're like running a query

79
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,800
that's built in that's like find

80
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,599
unsupported operating systems and you

81
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:06,540
want to then get like a CSV export of

82
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:08,160
all of the computer names and all of the

83
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,780
operating systems or something like that

84
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:11,580
this is a really good way to just get

85
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:14,459
the output in like text form because

86
00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:15,959
sometimes you don't necessarily need a

87
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:18,720
graph you just kind of want the outcome

88
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,599
of the graph to be uh output in some way

89
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:24,379
to give to a client

90
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:26,819
um so here's some kind of a pro tip that

91
00:03:26,819 --> 00:03:29,700
we use a lot is that oftentimes when you

92
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,680
compromise you know systems you want to

93
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,440
mark them as owned within Bloodhound so

94
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,599
you can use them in later queries so if

95
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:38,400
you have a big list of computers that

96
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,780
you've compromised

97
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:41,700
um you know from spraying with crack map

98
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,860
exact or some other tool you can go

99
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:45,720
ahead and then just paste all of these

100
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:48,959
into like the neo4j console like bulk

101
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:50,519
query and it would just go ahead and

102
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:52,620
then just mark them all as owned or if

103
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:54,120
you have a list of high value assets

104
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,920
that you've collected or that it was

105
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,599
given to you by your client you can go

106
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:59,040
and just Mark all of those high value

107
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:04,379
super easy by using that a neo4j console

108
00:04:04,379 --> 00:04:05,580
um a lot of what we're going to be

109
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:07,739
talking about is these active directory

110
00:04:07,739 --> 00:04:09,299
ACL attacks

111
00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:11,939
um here is a really good mind map that

112
00:04:11,939 --> 00:04:14,280
was recently updated that just kind of

113
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:17,579
shows uh how these different permissions

114
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:19,680
can enable different attacks we're going

115
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,440
to go into those more specifically but

116
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,820
this just kind of gives you like an

117
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:25,139
overview of all the different things

118
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:26,520
that you can do

119
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,380
so firstly I'm going to talk about

120
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:30,540
attacking groups

121
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:33,720
um so if you have an edge to a group

122
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:36,120
like you have full control over it or

123
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,160
you can add members there's a number of

124
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,740
attacks you can do so the main thing

125
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:42,419
with groups is that you can add new

126
00:04:42,419 --> 00:04:44,340
members so say if you have control over

127
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:47,100
domain admins you could then add a new

128
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:49,139
domain admin or some other high

129
00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:51,840
privilege group you can do that with net

130
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,580
commands if you're on a Windows command

131
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:56,460
line you can use power view you can use

132
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:58,620
c-sharp and there's a bunch of

133
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:00,960
python-based tools as well that you can

134
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,460
do to do that so you actually have a lot

135
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:04,020
of options no matter what operating

136
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:06,479
system you're operating from to make

137
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:08,340
that happen

138
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:09,780
um one thing that I like to look for

139
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:12,900
with groups is I like to say

140
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:15,900
I want to find groups that actually give

141
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:18,600
me admin to different computers so for

142
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,580
example if you have an account operator

143
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:24,300
you can basically add users to any group

144
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:27,300
except for the high privilege ones like

145
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:29,039
domain admins they're like okay well

146
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:31,500
what are some high privilege groups that

147
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:34,259
aren't necessarily you know the defaults

148
00:05:34,259 --> 00:05:36,240
like domain admin so what this will do

149
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,460
is it'll give you a list of those and

150
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:40,919
this is what it looks like in the neo4j

151
00:05:40,919 --> 00:05:42,600
console which I think is a better way to

152
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,280
look at it than Bloodhound so for

153
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,900
example if you look at this screenshot

154
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,759
you know I can run this query and I can

155
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:51,600
say okay well SQL Server DBA that has a

156
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,660
ton of computers that it's admin over so

157
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:56,100
you can kind of like look for those high

158
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:58,800
value targets that aren't necessarily as

159
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,940
obvious that they're high value

160
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,020
okay

161
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:06,960
um so uh yeah so expanding on that uh to

162
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,180
to attack computers um the same thing if

163
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:10,740
you have an edge to a computer there's a

164
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:12,660
few things you can do

165
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:14,880
um basically if you have something like

166
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,860
read lapse password it's a cur it's an

167
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:19,199
edge in in Bloodhound generic all owns

168
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,020
all extended rights um any of those

169
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:24,120
um edges to a computer you can read

170
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,800
lapse passwords

171
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,120
um that only works obviously if they're

172
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,440
running laps

173
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:31,259
um but uh Esteban actually has a tool

174
00:06:31,259 --> 00:06:33,360
called lap stumper that does that

175
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,940
um crack map exec has dash dash lapse

176
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:38,580
flag that does that and there's also a

177
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:40,139
tool called sharp lapse if you're

178
00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:42,360
running this from Windows

179
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,240
um with the shadow credentials it's kind

180
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:48,000
of similar if you can write to a

181
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,240
computer object you can write to the

182
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:54,960
MSDS key credential link attribute and

183
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,080
then in doing so you could potentially

184
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,120
then depending on it depends it has to

185
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,919
be running server 2016 domain functional

186
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:04,380
level and they have have adcs but if

187
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:06,360
they have those things then rather than

188
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,340
you know having to change a computer's

189
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:11,160
password you can do this attack and it's

190
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,979
a lot less impactful on the environment

191
00:07:13,979 --> 00:07:15,419
don't you don't break any trust or

192
00:07:15,419 --> 00:07:17,460
anything like that doing that and then

193
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:19,080
resource-based constrained delegation

194
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,940
again you have to have some type of

195
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,940
right permission to a computer object

196
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:26,039
and then you write this MSDS allowed to

197
00:07:26,039 --> 00:07:27,539
act on behalf of other identity

198
00:07:27,539 --> 00:07:28,940
attribute

199
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:31,560
that essentially gives a computer that

200
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,180
you control

201
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:34,139
um

202
00:07:34,139 --> 00:07:38,039
like the ability to impersonate any user

203
00:07:38,039 --> 00:07:40,800
on the target machine so

204
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,539
um that one also requires 2012

205
00:07:42,539 --> 00:07:44,400
functional level that's pretty common

206
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,440
nowadays there's a lot of tools to do

207
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,639
this now

208
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:48,720
um the one that I always use is the

209
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,500
impact it rbcd.pi tool before that was

210
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,960
out I had a tool that did the same thing

211
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,539
but it wasn't as good so that's that's

212
00:07:57,539 --> 00:07:59,520
why we don't use it anymore there's a

213
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,900
few other tools that do that as well um

214
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:02,580
bloody ID I just also want to give a

215
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:04,199
shout out to because I use that all the

216
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:07,099
time for everything

217
00:08:07,979 --> 00:08:10,139
um for attacking users there's a couple

218
00:08:10,139 --> 00:08:12,300
different things you can do

219
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:14,520
um forcing a password reset a lot of

220
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,199
ways to do that if you have you know

221
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:19,020
ownership or full control over a user or

222
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:22,500
just the reset password Edge

223
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,900
um that one I try to shy away from for

224
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:26,520
obvious reasons you know if you reset a

225
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:29,160
user's password it denies them access it

226
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,780
could break you know scripts that are

227
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:33,599
running so I kind of would say that as a

228
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:36,000
last resort sometimes if you're sure

229
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,620
that it's going to result in you getting

230
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:39,719
domain admin you can go ahead reset

231
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:41,339
someone's password complete your attack

232
00:08:41,339 --> 00:08:43,200
chain and then set their password back

233
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,480
and I have a blog post kind of

234
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,180
mentioning how to do that

235
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:50,120
you can also perform targeted kerberost

236
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:53,940
you can you do that from Linux or

237
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:58,320
Windows using Power view or this uh

238
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,660
GitHub repo mentioned there but it

239
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:02,580
basically like adds an SPN and then you

240
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:05,519
can you can Kerberos to user you can

241
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:08,820
read sometimes times you can read GMM

242
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:11,399
gmsa password group manage service

243
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:13,260
account passwords it's a lot like

244
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:15,240
reading laps passwords but of course

245
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,220
instead of reading the computer account

246
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:20,220
you're reading the password for one of

247
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:23,399
these service accounts targeted as rep

248
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:26,300
roast it's very similar to Target

249
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:28,620
kerberosting but you just modify the

250
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:30,779
account to not require Kerberos

251
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:32,700
pre-authentication and then you can get

252
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:35,640
a hash that you can crack the main one I

253
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:38,040
use against users is Shadow credentials

254
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:40,500
it's completely replaced pretty much all

255
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:43,019
of these other ones just because it

256
00:09:43,019 --> 00:09:45,839
allows you to get the NT hash of the

257
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:47,580
user and you don't have to worry about

258
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:49,260
changing passwords or anything like that

259
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:52,200
and I find that the 2016 functional

260
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,120
level and active directory certificate

261
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,880
Services is so common now that it almost

262
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,940
always works also I know that you can

263
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:02,640
add a logon script for a user this is

264
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,100
not one that I've ever do I don't think

265
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:06,839
many people do but it is also another

266
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:08,940
possible ability

267
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:12,180
against gpos I don't see these kind of

268
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:14,399
paths as often but if you do have them

269
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:17,339
and can modify a GPO you can add

270
00:10:17,339 --> 00:10:19,560
scheduled tasks that will be deployed to

271
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:22,980
computers that have that GPO you can add

272
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:24,660
you know new local administrator

273
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:27,180
accounts to computers so that's just

274
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:28,980
some of the ways you can do anything

275
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:32,040
that GPO can do so it's really up to

276
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,420
your imagination but those are the two

277
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:36,720
most common attacks that I see

278
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,959
as far as attacking the domain object

279
00:10:39,959 --> 00:10:42,180
itself most of the rights you're looking

280
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:45,000
for is like generic all and all extended

281
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,880
rights DS replication get changes all or

282
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:50,700
DS replication get changes if you have

283
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:54,600
any of those you can DC sync so if

284
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,339
you're using impact it Secrets dump can

285
00:10:56,339 --> 00:10:57,660
do that or if you're using something

286
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:01,019
like mini cats you know uh LSA dump DC

287
00:11:01,019 --> 00:11:04,440
sync if you have ownership or right

288
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:07,380
dackle what you can do is you can then

289
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:10,620
modify the ACLS to give yourself those

290
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:12,300
permissions or if you just have right

291
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:14,279
owner then you make yourself the owner

292
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:16,680
then as the owner you update the ACLS to

293
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,240
give yourself the permissions you need

294
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,320
to DC sync

295
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,820
and I'll pass over to Frank

296
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:25,680
okay yeah we just kind of wanted to give

297
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,019
uh certify a shout out

298
00:11:28,019 --> 00:11:30,000
um it's really you know completely

299
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,680
separate tool from Bloodhound

300
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,440
um but it does have the ability to

301
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,760
um export

302
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,519
um like the certificate Services

303
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:42,000
um templates and uh Cas into like a

304
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,339
bloodhound format and then one of the

305
00:11:44,339 --> 00:11:45,959
cool things that

306
00:11:45,959 --> 00:11:48,660
um you can do with that is find paths to

307
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:50,700
those um to those things from own

308
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:52,740
principles and things like that so it is

309
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:53,880
pretty cool

310
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:56,459
um not the same tool necessarily but you

311
00:11:56,459 --> 00:11:57,720
can export

312
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:58,440
um

313
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,600
from certify into like old Bloodhound

314
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,519
format which is what I normally do just

315
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:04,680
because I'm not running the other Fork

316
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:07,560
but the old Bloodhound flag basically

317
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:10,980
exports the adcs stuff into existing

318
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:13,860
node types so like instead of having a

319
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:15,720
separate node type for a CA or for a

320
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,760
template it'll use like

321
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:18,320
ous

322
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,000
and it works essentially the same way

323
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,220
but it is pretty cool definitely worth

324
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:24,779
looking into if you're not using that

325
00:12:24,779 --> 00:12:26,640
now

326
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,140
now we're going to move into some of the

327
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:30,420
cool tips and tricks that we found over

328
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:33,180
time one thing that I always make sure

329
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:36,540
to do when using Bloodhound is to Mark

330
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:39,779
computers as owned because that's the

331
00:12:39,779 --> 00:12:41,459
main thing that I'm using in my queries

332
00:12:41,459 --> 00:12:44,040
is like I only really care about paths

333
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:46,200
from accounts or computers that I

334
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,579
control because if you know there's

335
00:12:47,579 --> 00:12:49,440
another path and it's not something I

336
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,820
have control over it's not really

337
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:52,980
relevant so I find that really useful

338
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:55,620
where this finger is pointing is kind of

339
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:58,260
my most used query where it's like find

340
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:00,980
me the shortest paths from

341
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:04,620
principles that are owned and principles

342
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:06,300
that are marked as high value because

343
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:07,500
that's what I really care about like

344
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:10,860
what do I have where do I want to go

345
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:12,860
um

346
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,600
um yeah uh kind of back to what I

347
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,820
mentioned earlier too um using for

348
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:19,320
example like the shortest path to domain

349
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:22,019
admins from own principles query

350
00:13:22,019 --> 00:13:24,360
um that one uses the uh filter check

351
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:27,180
boxes that we showed earlier so one of

352
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:28,740
the cool things that you can do like

353
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:31,560
with this query shown above is you can

354
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:35,700
use the filters from that query whatever

355
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:37,260
you've checked and put it inside of

356
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:40,380
those brackets in your pathfinding so

357
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:42,000
that you're not finding paths maybe that

358
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,980
you don't want because that is one thing

359
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:45,480
like with this with this query shown

360
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,459
here it shows any of the edge types and

361
00:13:47,459 --> 00:13:48,660
that might be something you don't want

362
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:50,720
like force pass or change or something

363
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,860
so that's something that we do a lot

364
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:55,139
that's just a tip to get the filters

365
00:13:55,139 --> 00:13:57,060
really quickly

366
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:59,579
um and then uh there's a all shortest

367
00:13:59,579 --> 00:14:02,279
paths which is a different function from

368
00:14:02,279 --> 00:14:04,680
shortest path but basically it will show

369
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:08,779
you multiple Edge types so

370
00:14:08,779 --> 00:14:11,300
sometimes you might have multiple

371
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:14,519
relationships that we into a node and

372
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:16,320
maybe one of them is not the one that

373
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,060
you would prefer so it's sometimes good

374
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:20,579
to see both and then you might be able

375
00:14:20,579 --> 00:14:24,380
to pick which one you prefer to do

376
00:14:26,459 --> 00:14:29,459
um so uh

377
00:14:29,459 --> 00:14:30,839
this is

378
00:14:30,839 --> 00:14:34,320
um the built-in queries to look for

379
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,620
objects that have DC sync privileges

380
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:39,959
so one thing that I typically do like

381
00:14:39,959 --> 00:14:42,000
right away is set them all as high value

382
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,339
literally the only thing that you do is

383
00:14:44,339 --> 00:14:46,860
use those built-in queries instead of

384
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:51,980
return P to return the path you set a a

385
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:55,019
variable for the starting node so see it

386
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:56,639
like I guess we should have highlighted

387
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:58,680
that but in the second set of queries it

388
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,600
says P equals n instead of having that

389
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:05,040
be empty then instead of returning P you

390
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,139
just say Set n dot high value equals

391
00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:09,959
true that will set that first

392
00:15:09,959 --> 00:15:10,560
um

393
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,740
node as high value and then all of the

394
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:15,300
principles out of DC sync will then be

395
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:17,660
high value

396
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:21,480
when it comes to populating our list of

397
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,220
high value targets another thing I like

398
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:26,399
to look for is groups that are not

399
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:28,800
marked as high value yet but they have

400
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,920
the admin count flag so uh that's

401
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,380
usually an indication that this is uh

402
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:36,360
some sort of significant group if you

403
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,519
know Microsoft had marked it as that so

404
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:40,620
I like to add those as high value and

405
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:42,420
then also groups that don't have the

406
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:46,740
admin account flag but have access admin

407
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:49,139
access to computers so even though these

408
00:15:49,139 --> 00:15:51,600
might not necessarily be obvious to be

409
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,899
admin groups the fact that they have

410
00:15:53,899 --> 00:15:58,320
access to computers this to me would be

411
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:01,260
something that I would be interested in

412
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:03,420
um also high value groups that can reset

413
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:06,480
passwords so you can look at you know

414
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,639
any group that can reset the password of

415
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:11,100
other users I also like to Pivot over to

416
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:13,680
neo4j here and then I can actually sort

417
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,560
them and then look at you know all of

418
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,860
the you know the amount of users of

419
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:21,420
passwords they can reset so I can really

420
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:23,699
get an idea of the scope of how powerful

421
00:16:23,699 --> 00:16:26,359
the group is

422
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:27,660
um one of the things that I've been

423
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:30,480
doing lately that's been super useful is

424
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,120
taking all of the computers that allow

425
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,579
for unconstrained delegation and marking

426
00:16:35,579 --> 00:16:38,339
those as high value so uh by default

427
00:16:38,339 --> 00:16:41,160
domain controllers have unconstrained

428
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:45,120
delegation but I've also seen it put on

429
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,600
other systems that are not always uh

430
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,399
seen as you know

431
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:53,759
um as valuable like so for example you

432
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,860
know maybe a web application server will

433
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:58,079
have unconstrained delegation and

434
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:00,300
whenever you get on a system that has

435
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:02,459
that you pretty much can compromise the

436
00:17:02,459 --> 00:17:04,319
domain um and the way that you would do

437
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:06,059
that typically is you would like say

438
00:17:06,059 --> 00:17:08,160
course authentication you know from a

439
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,380
domain controller and then relay it to

440
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:12,359
that system and when it goes to that

441
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:13,859
system

442
00:17:13,859 --> 00:17:15,660
um the because it has unconstrained

443
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:17,819
delegation it will send along the full

444
00:17:17,819 --> 00:17:20,699
TGT for that account so basically you

445
00:17:20,699 --> 00:17:23,280
get the full TGT of a domain controller

446
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,799
so these These are usually just as good

447
00:17:25,799 --> 00:17:27,780
as domain controllers in most cases

448
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:29,100
because you're only one simple attack

449
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:32,700
away from compromise

450
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:34,080
um also another thing that I've been

451
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:37,200
seeing lately is um Azure ad connect

452
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,000
servers

453
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,980
um these are valuable because they often

454
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:44,940
have the credentials of a account that

455
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:47,460
has DC sync permissions

456
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:48,960
um so there's a couple ways that you can

457
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,280
find it

458
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:53,460
um but so if you have access to Azure

459
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:56,400
active directory you can use the UI or

460
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,880
you can run a Powershell command

461
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,380
also with Bloodhound this one's not

462
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:03,240
perfect but if they use the default

463
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,640
configuration there should be a user

464
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:08,460
this name starts with msol

465
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:11,039
um and then you know a random string of

466
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:13,620
numbers and then you can find that in

467
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:15,240
the description and it's typically an

468
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:18,059
Azure ad connect server

469
00:18:18,059 --> 00:18:20,460
yeah um yeah because basically like the

470
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:23,039
goal here is um to get access to that

471
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:25,799
msol user account

472
00:18:25,799 --> 00:18:28,140
um but that account is pretty much

473
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:29,760
always going to exist on whatever

474
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,799
machine is being used for the Azure

475
00:18:31,799 --> 00:18:33,600
idsync so

476
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,980
um that's why we're that's why we're

477
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:36,480
looking for that description value of

478
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,280
that user because we might not have like

479
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:40,020
a has session Edge but we know that

480
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:41,880
that's where that account gets used

481
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,740
um so that's where that's why we're

482
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:45,000
doing this query right like we're trying

483
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,340
to find the computer that

484
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:49,020
um that that account is on because that

485
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:52,020
account has DC sync so that becomes a

486
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:54,299
high value Target that second query

487
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:56,400
there just returns

488
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,780
um like a bloodhound path instead of

489
00:18:57,780 --> 00:19:01,340
just the uh name

490
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,840
another thing that I typically set as

491
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:07,080
high value is members of the cert

492
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:09,299
Publishers group so this group will

493
00:19:09,299 --> 00:19:11,520
usually contain uh your certificate

494
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,559
authorities so if you're able to

495
00:19:13,559 --> 00:19:16,740
compromise a certificate Authority you

496
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:18,660
basically compromise the domain because

497
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:20,039
once you compromise the certificate

498
00:19:20,039 --> 00:19:21,720
Authority you can create golden

499
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:24,000
certificates and there's a couple tools

500
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,280
that you can use to extract the private

501
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:28,140
key and the certificate to facilitate

502
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:30,360
that but basically if you've ever heard

503
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:32,220
of a golden ticket it's it's basically

504
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:34,100
just like that except with certificates

505
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:36,480
so these are definitely pretty high

506
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,340
value and they might not you know be

507
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:41,280
marked as high value by default so

508
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:45,000
marking them is useful also sdcm servers

509
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,500
is something I like to Mark as high

510
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:49,200
value too and the reason is you know

511
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,320
SCCM servers they push software to

512
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,240
machines in your environment so if

513
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,400
you're able to compromise an SCCM server

514
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,559
you could potentially push malicious

515
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:02,100
malicious updates to any server the that

516
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:05,299
is receiving updates from there

517
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:09,840
this one is also very useful I like to

518
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,960
look for computers that are admin to

519
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,600
other computers so this was kind of more

520
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,580
common than I thought it would be but

521
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:18,900
sometimes

522
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:20,520
um you know a computer will be in a

523
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:23,280
group say like SQL admins and then the

524
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,620
computer itself will be admin to all of

525
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:28,260
the other computers and the reason this

526
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:30,780
matters is because if they do not have

527
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:33,780
SMB signing enabled you can coerce

528
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:35,880
authentication from one of those servers

529
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:39,120
and then relay it to the other server so

530
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,740
what it allows you to do is take say

531
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:43,380
like a low priv account you know perform

532
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:46,679
like a printer bug Petit botam any

533
00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:49,559
coercion method and you can a lot of

534
00:20:49,559 --> 00:20:51,660
times compromise a high value server so

535
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:53,640
yeah I've seen this a lot with exchange

536
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:56,880
servers with SQL servers where you can

537
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,860
go from low priv to a pretty high value

538
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:02,160
computer right away just because of the

539
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,799
way that this group is set up and you

540
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:07,500
know SMB signing not being forest all

541
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,919
over the place

542
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:12,780
sometimes when you're collecting

543
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:14,760
accounts like say you've cracked a

544
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:17,520
password or you've guessed a couple user

545
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,980
accounts the it might be a low priv user

546
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:21,299
and there's just it doesn't really seem

547
00:21:21,299 --> 00:21:23,760
to have admin on anything so you don't

548
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,740
really know what you can do with it so

549
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:27,419
what I like to do is I like to run these

550
00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:30,120
two queries and it basically just saying

551
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:33,299
like do they have access over anything

552
00:21:33,299 --> 00:21:35,520
at all like can they add themselves to a

553
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,799
group can they do you know do anything

554
00:21:37,799 --> 00:21:39,720
even if they don't have admin just show

555
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:41,520
me what they can do because it kind of

556
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,440
Might increase the scope of what you

557
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,659
have to work with

558
00:21:45,659 --> 00:21:49,679
foreign this one is uh

559
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:51,840
also one that I that I kind of do this

560
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,760
if I run out of ideas

561
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,500
um but basically a lot of times you'll

562
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,539
find environments that have laps only

563
00:21:57,539 --> 00:22:00,360
like partially deployed like um half of

564
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,740
their computers have laps and half of

565
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:03,059
them don't

566
00:22:03,059 --> 00:22:05,159
um one thing that you can do is try to

567
00:22:05,159 --> 00:22:07,380
find paths from

568
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:09,299
um whatever you've already owned to

569
00:22:09,299 --> 00:22:11,780
machines that don't have laps enabled

570
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:14,400
and then you try to find paths from

571
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,380
machines that don't have laps enabled to

572
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:18,720
things that are high value and then the

573
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,880
assumption is that potentially some of

574
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,520
those machines that don't have laps are

575
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,799
sharing a password so you won't see

576
00:22:25,799 --> 00:22:28,200
those edges in Bloodhound but there may

577
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:31,740
be a path that exists through a shared

578
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:34,200
password that you can use so this is

579
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,760
something that I like to do just to see

580
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,280
if um if there's anything I can do to

581
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:39,840
maybe compromise a machine that doesn't

582
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,940
have laps that I can then spray to other

583
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:43,200
machines that don't have laps and

584
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,700
potentially compromise one that gives me

585
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:47,059
a path

586
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:51,000
there are a number of tools that I found

587
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,159
that can also extend the functionality

588
00:22:53,159 --> 00:22:55,799
of Bloodhound so one of them is called

589
00:22:55,799 --> 00:22:57,900
Max and it has a bunch of different

590
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:59,640
features but some of the ones that I

591
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,500
found to be useful

592
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:04,320
um are this this one called add spns so

593
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,480
it looks for uh computer objects that

594
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,940
have spns configured and then it creates

595
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:11,700
an edge between the user and the SPN to

596
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:13,799
that computer object and the reason is

597
00:23:13,799 --> 00:23:16,980
it's assumed that that user might have

598
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:19,640
their credentials stored on the computer

599
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:22,020
so that can be useful for finding

600
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:23,960
potential attack paths

601
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:28,159
also add spw this is kind of

602
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:30,780
post-exploitation function but basically

603
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:33,299
when you do find systems that are

604
00:23:33,299 --> 00:23:35,460
sharing passwords you can kind of show

605
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:36,960
that in a graph so if you look at that

606
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,940
little apple looking one it's showing

607
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:41,340
that hey all these computers share the

608
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:43,260
same local admin password so if you get

609
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:45,840
to one you can get to any of them so if

610
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,220
you're doing your reporting that can be

611
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:49,020
something that's super useful to visit

612
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:51,780
visualize just to kind of see how large

613
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:55,159
of a scope of an issue it is

614
00:23:55,159 --> 00:23:58,380
another one I like it's called hash cat

615
00:23:58,380 --> 00:23:59,760
helper you don't have to use it with

616
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:03,020
hashcat but once you take an ntds

617
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:06,600
password dump from the domain it can

618
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:09,240
look through and see what users are

619
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:11,039
sharing the same password and you don't

620
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:12,419
have to necessarily crack it because you

621
00:24:12,419 --> 00:24:15,179
can just compare you know the NT hashes

622
00:24:15,179 --> 00:24:17,340
so like in this screenshot this is an

623
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:19,320
example from the blog but you can see

624
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:21,600
like these low privilege accounts are

625
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,100
sharing the same password as their

626
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:26,280
companion higher privilege account so it

627
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:29,159
can kind of show like if you know admins

628
00:24:29,159 --> 00:24:31,140
have two different accounts one low priv

629
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:33,240
one high priv it doesn't really matter

630
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:35,280
if they're sharing the same password so

631
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:37,080
this is a great way to kind of visualize

632
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:39,360
that and then show the impact to the

633
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,640
client in the report

634
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,320
um another tool that I like to use is

635
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:45,720
called crack Hound but it actually takes

636
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:48,240
the cracked passwords and then puts that

637
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,820
data into Bloodhound and what that's

638
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:52,679
really useful because then you can run

639
00:24:52,679 --> 00:24:55,080
queries based on the plain text

640
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:57,840
passwords so you can say of all the

641
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:00,720
cracked passwords uh all the users which

642
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,940
I've cracked passwords for how many of

643
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:05,760
those were high value how many people

644
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:10,320
with full 2023 had VPN access you know

645
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,299
how many of the accounts that were

646
00:25:12,299 --> 00:25:14,940
kerberostable was I able to crack you

647
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:16,679
know does any account with a weak

648
00:25:16,679 --> 00:25:19,140
password have a path domain admin so

649
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:21,059
those are you know you can find a bunch

650
00:25:21,059 --> 00:25:22,620
of different attack paths that you might

651
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:25,200
not have already found before so you can

652
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,640
just kind of increase the scope of

653
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,159
finding the different vulnerabilities in

654
00:25:29,159 --> 00:25:33,059
the environment based upon the passwords

655
00:25:33,059 --> 00:25:34,620
um I also threw a little slide in here

656
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:37,860
uh for the blue side so a lot of what I

657
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:39,659
talked about was more on the red team

658
00:25:39,659 --> 00:25:42,419
side and using this operationally but if

659
00:25:42,419 --> 00:25:44,100
you're on the blue team there are a lot

660
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:46,380
of other tools that you can use to take

661
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:48,900
the blood Bloodhound data and put it in

662
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:51,419
a format that might be more useful

663
00:25:51,419 --> 00:25:53,299
um so that tool I mentioned earlier Max

664
00:25:53,299 --> 00:25:56,940
you can take password audit data and run

665
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:58,679
it with Bloodhound to kind of enrich it

666
00:25:58,679 --> 00:26:01,140
I know there's there's a tools like Plum

667
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:04,200
Hound cipheroth Watchdog and then pink

668
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:06,360
castle isn't Bloodhound related but it's

669
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:08,720
comparable to Bloodhound and in function

670
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,799
comparable to Bloodhound in

671
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:13,679
functionality but these are a lot of

672
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:16,620
ways that you know if you're really

673
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:18,480
um you know not on the offensive side

674
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,580
but you need a list of like hey these

675
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:22,620
are all the things I want to fix these

676
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:26,120
tools can be really helpful for that

677
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,279
all right I think we have some time uh

678
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:31,740
about 10-15 minutes for questions did

679
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:34,520
anybody have any questions

680
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:41,710
[Music]

681
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:46,020
I I don't believe it's been published

682
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:48,000
yet but after this talk I will be

683
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,679
publishing it

684
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:51,600
um on my blog

685
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,120
um I'm not sure if if I can add it is

686
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,140
there a way I can add it to the

687
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:58,140
cactuscon website link the slides

688
00:26:58,140 --> 00:26:59,400
foreign

689
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,679
okay yeah I can throw it in the Discord

690
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:04,100
as well

691
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:06,679
okay

692
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:09,320
yes

693
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:15,659
uh if you have an active directory

694
00:27:15,659 --> 00:27:18,299
environment uh you know at work or some

695
00:27:18,299 --> 00:27:20,460
with somewhere you can run it safely

696
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:22,140
um I would say just start poking around

697
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:23,700
in your own environment and just start

698
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:25,200
clicking on stuff

699
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,760
um you know it's all data that's

700
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:29,279
collected you can't break anything by

701
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:30,360
just clicking through it and running

702
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:32,880
queries so just yeah if you have access

703
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,919
to any real life active directory

704
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:36,720
environment just poking through it is

705
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:39,179
really the best way I know there's also

706
00:27:39,179 --> 00:27:41,340
a project open source project out there

707
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:44,340
called goad and it kind of gives you the

708
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:46,140
steps on how to set up a vulnerable ad

709
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:48,179
lab and they also have a Blog series

710
00:27:48,179 --> 00:27:49,620
that goes through a bunch of different

711
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:51,960
attacks that you can perform and

712
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:54,299
identify in Bloodhound so that's that's

713
00:27:54,299 --> 00:27:56,400
what I would recommend

714
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,140
similar project called Bad Blood that

715
00:27:58,140 --> 00:27:59,340
will just

716
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:02,600
a directory environment for you

717
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:12,360
by default does Bloodhound represent

718
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:14,159
certificate authorities or certificates

719
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:16,440
in any way without using certified

720
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:19,080
I don't I don't well you can you can see

721
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:20,940
like the cert Publishers group and

722
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:22,140
things like that

723
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:25,020
um so you can find like Cas via that but

724
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:27,179
you won't be able to see templates or

725
00:28:27,179 --> 00:28:28,559
anything like that without collecting it

726
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:30,120
through certified yeah so the computer

727
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:32,340
objects for the certificate authorities

728
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:34,080
will be in there but as far as the

729
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,940
actual templates and everything you need

730
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:38,400
to augment it by running certify or a

731
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:41,000
similar tool

732
00:28:43,559 --> 00:28:46,140
all right I think we're good you guys

733
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:48,740
have any questions

734
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,820
cool all right thanks everyone for

735
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:51,120

about seven years ago and digging into

838
00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:04,619
it staring into the abyss it's

839
00:51:04,619 --> 00:51:05,940
absolutely horrible with how this stuff

840
00:51:05,940 --> 00:51:08,880
works and the slide I have up here I

841
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:10,260
like starting this presentation with

842
00:51:10,260 --> 00:51:12,599
this because this slide is going to have

843
00:51:12,599 --> 00:51:14,520
a completely different meaning by the

844
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:16,619
end of this so I'm gonna go ahead and

845
00:51:16,619 --> 00:51:18,300
get my presentation kicked off a

846
00:51:18,300 --> 00:51:19,920
business email compromise problems in

847
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:21,440
the mirror are larger than they appear

848
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:24,900
so my name is Ryan tokazowski I have a

849
00:51:24,900 --> 00:51:25,980
background in information security

850
00:51:25,980 --> 00:51:29,700
midfield for almost for 13 years now

851
00:51:29,700 --> 00:51:31,440
um love doing Tech stuff

852
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:33,240
I'm a principal threat advisor is a

853
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:35,339
company called co-fence husband and the

854
00:51:35,339 --> 00:51:36,960
dad of three clones and the more I

855
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:38,579
parent the more I realize I am just

856
00:51:38,579 --> 00:51:40,200
arguing with like a younger version of

857
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:43,380
myself and every day I kind of apologize

858
00:51:43,380 --> 00:51:44,940
to my mother I'm like I'm sorry for that

859
00:51:44,940 --> 00:51:47,040
[ __ ] I did when I was seven

860
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:49,079
I know how you felt I'm yelling at this

861
00:51:49,079 --> 00:51:50,220
one for that

862
00:51:50,220 --> 00:51:51,780
um I also like taking scammers for long

863
00:51:51,780 --> 00:51:53,400
walks off of short peers and it's

864
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:54,540
something where a lot of people will

865
00:51:54,540 --> 00:51:55,740
engage with scammers a lot of people

866
00:51:55,740 --> 00:51:57,000
will try and make their lives a living

867
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,460
hell we need more people doing that

868
00:51:59,460 --> 00:52:00,960
um in addition to that I'm an accidental

869
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:03,059
YouTuber so if you want to see more

870
00:52:03,059 --> 00:52:04,859
presentation stuff where I kind of

871
00:52:04,859 --> 00:52:06,599
present stuff look me up on Rhonda rants

872
00:52:06,599 --> 00:52:08,760
I also like building communities and I

873
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:10,079
like advocating for all things business

874
00:52:10,079 --> 00:52:11,640
email compromise

875
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:14,579
so to get this kicked off I'm going to

876
00:52:14,579 --> 00:52:17,040
be covering what the BEC definitions are

877
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:19,800
I'm going to cover what we track this as

878
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:22,680
in the industry as well as what the

879
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:25,260
actual story is behind the scenes on it

880
00:52:25,260 --> 00:52:26,460
um I'm also going to be talking on the

881
00:52:26,460 --> 00:52:28,440
damages and impacts that we see as as it

882
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:29,880
relates to business email compromise

883
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:32,579
we're also going to get dark too so um

884
00:52:32,579 --> 00:52:33,839
again I'll be covering some of the music

885
00:52:33,839 --> 00:52:34,920
some of the voodoo some of the human

886
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:36,839
sacrifices that we see tied back to this

887
00:52:36,839 --> 00:52:38,940
and I'm also going to walk through why

888
00:52:38,940 --> 00:52:40,559
collaboration is key and why we need to

889
00:52:40,559 --> 00:52:41,700
start understanding more of this and

890
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:44,819
working together on this so the industry

891
00:52:44,819 --> 00:52:46,500
definition of business email compromise

892
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:48,780
many people understand how this works so

893
00:52:48,780 --> 00:52:50,520
if you're unfamiliar with how this works

894
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:54,119
imagine that your CEO is in a company

895
00:52:54,119 --> 00:52:56,760
and somebody goes and pretends to send

896
00:52:56,760 --> 00:52:58,800
an email on their behalf and they say

897
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:00,540
hey I needed to go and do this urgent

898
00:53:00,540 --> 00:53:02,760
wire transfer for me they pretend to be

899
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:05,400
that person they go and talk to the

900
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:06,839
employee and the employee's like oh yes

901
00:53:06,839 --> 00:53:08,099
I'll go and do that urgent transfer for

902
00:53:08,099 --> 00:53:10,500
you and then what happens is the scammer

903
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:11,700
will come back and say hey here's a bank

904
00:53:11,700 --> 00:53:13,980
account to wire to and then your user

905
00:53:13,980 --> 00:53:15,540
goes and wires forty thousand dollars

906
00:53:15,540 --> 00:53:17,520
out and that's how it works they go and

907
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:19,319
steal the money like that

908
00:53:19,319 --> 00:53:21,180
um there's many different flavors to

909
00:53:21,180 --> 00:53:22,559
this we've seen elements of thick

910
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:25,140
invoices we've seen check fraud again

911
00:53:25,140 --> 00:53:26,640
the threat actors are getting really

912
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:28,079
really good at how they're operating

913
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:29,579
with this

914
00:53:29,579 --> 00:53:31,440
um from statistics from the losses that

915
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:33,720
we have business email compromise is the

916
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:35,760
number one cyber crime seven years in a

917
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:38,099
row because again it's something where

918
00:53:38,099 --> 00:53:39,359
the amount of Damages the amount of

919
00:53:39,359 --> 00:53:40,559
financial losses that we see on this

920
00:53:40,559 --> 00:53:44,339
it's the highest cyber crime period this

921
00:53:44,339 --> 00:53:47,339
is FBI statistics this is DHS statistics

922
00:53:47,339 --> 00:53:49,200
this is embryos's statistics other than

923
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:52,440
mine that states this so officially we

924
00:53:52,440 --> 00:53:54,420
know that the losses are upwards of 43

925
00:53:54,420 --> 00:53:56,760
billion dollars the problem is when it

926
00:53:56,760 --> 00:53:59,460
comes to tracking BEC it touches many

927
00:53:59,460 --> 00:54:01,920
other types of cyber crime that I'll be

928
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:04,440
covering here today when you look at the

929
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:06,000
losses that does not include the 100

930
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,740
billion dollars of unemployment fraud

931
00:54:07,740 --> 00:54:10,200
that we saw from two in 2019 where

932
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:11,940
scammers realize that they can go and

933
00:54:11,940 --> 00:54:13,619
make accounts on our unemployment fraud

934
00:54:13,619 --> 00:54:15,960
systems and have money wired to them

935
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:18,240
that does not include the 72 billion

936
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:19,800
dollars in fraud that was related back

937
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:22,079
to the SBA systems that scammers were

938
00:54:22,079 --> 00:54:23,520
actively sharing templates back and

939
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:24,839
forth to kind of go and hit those

940
00:54:24,839 --> 00:54:27,420
systems in addition to that does uncover

941
00:54:27,420 --> 00:54:28,440
the romance victims that we're seeing

942
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:31,200
because again the romance victims who we

943
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:33,480
see out in the wild who you see on

944
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:35,400
things like catfished it's those are the

945
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:36,720
victims who are actually wiring the

946
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:40,140
money on behalf of the scammers but if

947
00:54:40,140 --> 00:54:41,160
you go and talk to anybody in

948
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:42,420
information security if you go talk to

949
00:54:42,420 --> 00:54:44,400
any news about they're like oh my God

950
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:46,020
ransomware is this biggest scariest

951
00:54:46,020 --> 00:54:47,400
thing it's the absolute most horrible

952
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:49,859
thing and someone might die because of

953
00:54:49,859 --> 00:54:51,180
this but at the end of the day like we

954
00:54:51,180 --> 00:54:53,400
have murders we have suicides because of

955
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:54,720
business email compromise of related

956
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:57,240
activities I'm like okay 21 billion

957
00:54:57,240 --> 00:54:59,160
dollars it might hit that

958
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:01,559
um and in addition to that Bec is very

959
00:55:01,559 --> 00:55:03,240
underreported because of all the scrap

960
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:05,400
cams that there are there

961
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:07,020
um anyway it comes to looking at the

962
00:55:07,020 --> 00:55:08,220
losses and everything like I actually

963
00:55:08,220 --> 00:55:09,540
quit counting it like hundreds of

964
00:55:09,540 --> 00:55:11,280
billions of dollars because again that's

965
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:13,020
like five that's almost like that was

966
00:55:13,020 --> 00:55:14,460
what like 200 billion dollars I just

967
00:55:14,460 --> 00:55:16,020
pointed to right there

968
00:55:16,020 --> 00:55:17,760
um but again it's something where that

969
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:20,040
doesn't even touch the amount of crimes

970
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:21,119
that are actually happening because of

971
00:55:21,119 --> 00:55:22,500
this and we need to start taking this

972
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:24,599
more seriously the reason we need to

973
00:55:24,599 --> 00:55:26,280
start taking this more seriously is

974
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:28,500
because we have seen invoice fraud check

975
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:30,720
fraud and romance scams directly tied to

976
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:32,880
business email compromise when I was at

977
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:34,559
agari we did a study that actually

978
00:55:34,559 --> 00:55:36,720
walked through one of the BEC actors

979
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:38,700
that we had identified it was um we call

980
00:55:38,700 --> 00:55:40,559
them scattered Canary at the time and

981
00:55:40,559 --> 00:55:42,359
what happened was at the time we thought

982
00:55:42,359 --> 00:55:45,660
BEC was from 2015 and onward but in the

983
00:55:45,660 --> 00:55:47,640
scatter Canary use case we identified no

984
00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:49,680
this actually goes back way farther than

985
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:52,140
that this ties back to things like what

986
00:55:52,140 --> 00:55:55,020
we would consider as 419 scams as your

987
00:55:55,020 --> 00:55:57,540
Nigerian print scams so Bec is a symptom

988
00:55:57,540 --> 00:55:59,760
of calling all of those crimes simple

989
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:01,740
and calling all of those easy that we

990
00:56:01,740 --> 00:56:02,940
just never addressed and again we had

991
00:56:02,940 --> 00:56:05,819
data going back a 10-year chunk that was

992
00:56:05,819 --> 00:56:07,680
tracking one actor who just started

993
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:11,520
doing BTC again this stuff is absolutely

994
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:13,440
massive with how these things and scams

995
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:16,859
work as it stands right now today right

996
00:56:16,859 --> 00:56:19,559
now FBI statistics here we have victims

997
00:56:19,559 --> 00:56:23,460
of the 177 of 193 countries that relate

998
00:56:23,460 --> 00:56:25,680
back to this this is ninety percent of

999
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:27,660
the globe and when it comes to tracking

1000
00:56:27,660 --> 00:56:29,099
BEC when it comes to tracking Monday

1001
00:56:29,099 --> 00:56:31,260
laundering you have places like the US

1002
00:56:31,260 --> 00:56:33,720
the UK Canada who are really really

1003
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:35,880
great at tracking these things but when

1004
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:37,440
you go to other places around the world

1005
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:40,200
such as Thailand and Cambodia how would

1006
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:42,000
you go and try and say hey this bank

1007
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,859
account is suspicious we he's going to

1008
00:56:43,859 --> 00:56:45,660
track that what type of anti-money

1009
00:56:45,660 --> 00:56:47,339
laundering laws do they have over there

1010
00:56:47,339 --> 00:56:49,500
again many places in the world right now

1011
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:52,319
are being hit with this stuff in

1012
00:56:52,319 --> 00:56:53,760
addition to that there's very little

1013
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:55,800
empathy for the victims the current

1014
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:58,200
stigmas that we have right now are that

1015
00:56:58,200 --> 00:56:59,700
a lot of the victims who get hit with

1016
00:56:59,700 --> 00:57:01,920
this are stupid they're uneducated every

1017
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:04,260
single one of us myself included have

1018
00:57:04,260 --> 00:57:05,940
said at some point that was a stupid

1019
00:57:05,940 --> 00:57:07,440
user they should not have clicked that

1020
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:08,460
phishing email they should not have

1021
00:57:08,460 --> 00:57:10,800
clicked that link but to the user to the

1022
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:13,020
person who was seeing it

1023
00:57:13,020 --> 00:57:15,119
it was a hundred percent legitimate with

1024
00:57:15,119 --> 00:57:16,800
what they were able to do they're not

1025
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:18,599
Security Experts and likewise we should

1026
00:57:18,599 --> 00:57:20,280
not go and put that on them in order to

1027
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:22,319
do that and that's the problem right now

1028
00:57:22,319 --> 00:57:23,520
is when it comes to business email

1029
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:25,140
compromise you got to reflect back you

1030
00:57:25,140 --> 00:57:26,819
gotta be like holy [ __ ] how did we get

1031
00:57:26,819 --> 00:57:28,920
here and a lot of the way that we got to

1032
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:31,920
this problem right here is 20 years of

1033
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:33,780
brushing off Nigerian scams is simple

1034
00:57:33,780 --> 00:57:35,819
brushing them off is easy

1035
00:57:35,819 --> 00:57:37,980
um again dismissively saying if that

1036
00:57:37,980 --> 00:57:39,839
person fell for it they were an idiot

1037
00:57:39,839 --> 00:57:42,119
again the analogy I like to give here is

1038
00:57:42,119 --> 00:57:44,339
if I'm going to get my oil changed I'm

1039
00:57:44,339 --> 00:57:45,780
gonna go and bring it to my mechanic my

1040
00:57:45,780 --> 00:57:46,980
mechanic's not going to chew me out

1041
00:57:46,980 --> 00:57:48,900
because I made a mistake on it he's

1042
00:57:48,900 --> 00:57:50,760
going to just go and repair him fix my

1043
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:52,160
oil change my oil change my tire

1044
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:54,300
likewise we shouldn't put those same

1045
00:57:54,300 --> 00:57:57,240
stigmas on the victims who have no idea

1046
00:57:57,240 --> 00:57:59,220
of the whole back end of what an apt is

1047
00:57:59,220 --> 00:58:00,780
like they're gonna be like oh an

1048
00:58:00,780 --> 00:58:02,880
apartment like they don't they don't

1049
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:04,619
understand that

1050
00:58:04,619 --> 00:58:06,000
um again that's kind of what we have to

1051
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,319
do as Security Professionals actually

1052
00:58:07,319 --> 00:58:09,119
understand this and understand we have

1053
00:58:09,119 --> 00:58:10,920
to start articulating things in the

1054
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:12,660
perspective of the victim not from our

1055
00:58:12,660 --> 00:58:14,220
perspective and that's one of the

1056
00:58:14,220 --> 00:58:15,300
biggest problems that we have right now

1057
00:58:15,300 --> 00:58:17,400
is as a security industry we do that we

1058
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:19,200
try and be like okay you don't know this

1059
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:21,720
thing I know you're an idiot screw you

1060
00:58:21,720 --> 00:58:23,280
um again that's one of the stigmas that

1061
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:24,960
we have so

1062
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:26,280
I'm gonna go ahead and dig into the

1063
00:58:26,280 --> 00:58:28,079
business focus side which is where most

1064
00:58:28,079 --> 00:58:30,240
of us are going to see this

1065
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:31,559
um and I'll kind of dig into some of the

1066
00:58:31,559 --> 00:58:33,780
other areas that we see too

1067
00:58:33,780 --> 00:58:35,280
um so I mentioned the business email

1068
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:36,720
compromise again this is the business

1069
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:38,819
focus frog where it's like okay this is

1070
00:58:38,819 --> 00:58:41,579
your traditional CEO fraud or we're like

1071
00:58:41,579 --> 00:58:43,020
hey I need you to go and wire this money

1072
00:58:43,020 --> 00:58:44,220
for me

1073
00:58:44,220 --> 00:58:46,859
um this overlaps 100 with Consumer Fraud

1074
00:58:46,859 --> 00:58:47,940
and I'll kind of go into that here in a

1075
00:58:47,940 --> 00:58:50,099
bit but the actors will do anything they

1076
00:58:50,099 --> 00:58:52,380
can to follow the money so if you're a

1077
00:58:52,380 --> 00:58:54,000
company that has really great

1078
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:55,799
protections again stopping bank accounts

1079
00:58:55,799 --> 00:58:57,480
they're going to come after you with

1080
00:58:57,480 --> 00:58:58,799
other types of frauds such as direct

1081
00:58:58,799 --> 00:59:00,839
deposit scams they're going to go ahead

1082
00:59:00,839 --> 00:59:02,819
and try and say hey I need to update my

1083
00:59:02,819 --> 00:59:04,559
payroll can you go can I go ahead and

1084
00:59:04,559 --> 00:59:06,180
give you my bet my bank account for you

1085
00:59:06,180 --> 00:59:07,680
to update the back end system here's my

1086
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:08,520
name

1087
00:59:08,520 --> 00:59:09,780
um so I can go ahead and do this to

1088
00:59:09,780 --> 00:59:12,119
verify the problem with this is that

1089
00:59:12,119 --> 00:59:13,619
when it comes to actually detecting a

1090
00:59:13,619 --> 00:59:16,079
lot of these it can be upwards of weeks

1091
00:59:16,079 --> 00:59:18,480
before the user actually sees this now

1092
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:20,099
you have a pissed off user who never got

1093
00:59:20,099 --> 00:59:21,960
their paycheck they may be going through

1094
00:59:21,960 --> 00:59:24,299
the stresses of not being able to

1095
00:59:24,299 --> 00:59:26,040
go buy food because at the end of the

1096
00:59:26,040 --> 00:59:27,359
day many people live paycheck to

1097
00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:29,880
paycheck so you now have this case where

1098
00:59:29,880 --> 00:59:31,200
that used now you're going to have to go

1099
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:33,540
do back pay to that user it causes a lot

1100
00:59:33,540 --> 00:59:35,280
of unneeded stress on that user just

1101
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:37,440
because of that the problem is when you

1102
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:39,540
look at the Lost thresholds here this

1103
00:59:39,540 --> 00:59:41,880
might be five six thousand dollars by

1104
00:59:41,880 --> 00:59:43,380
the end of the time that it had that

1105
00:59:43,380 --> 00:59:46,020
happens so you now have a federal crime

1106
00:59:46,020 --> 00:59:47,460
that's that has to be ten thousand

1107
00:59:47,460 --> 00:59:50,040
dollars or more FBI won't take a case if

1108
00:59:50,040 --> 00:59:51,480
it's a hundred thousand dollars or more

1109
00:59:51,480 --> 00:59:54,000
you have the local law enforcement who

1110
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:55,920
does has no capability to actually track

1111
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:57,839
the Cyber side because they're tracking

1112
00:59:57,839 --> 00:59:59,280
local drug gangs and other things like

1113
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:00,720
that and they're tracking other things

1114
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:02,760
like that so a lot of the times this

1115
01:00:02,760 --> 01:00:04,740
crime gets stuck between that limbo

1116
01:00:04,740 --> 01:00:06,660
stage of I'm going to go ahead and steal

1117
01:00:06,660 --> 01:00:08,819
the money but there's nothing that you

1118
01:00:08,819 --> 01:00:10,140
can do about it and there's no one to

1119
01:00:10,140 --> 01:00:12,240
really help out with that another angle

1120
01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:13,859
that we see is we see gift cards rotten

1121
01:00:13,859 --> 01:00:16,079
and this comes in the case of like hey I

1122
01:00:16,079 --> 01:00:17,940
need to go to this urgent task for me

1123
01:00:17,940 --> 01:00:20,280
and I need you to go and wire this money

1124
01:00:20,280 --> 01:00:21,299
for me

1125
01:00:21,299 --> 01:00:22,920
um what they'll do is the scammers will

1126
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:24,180
go and convince the users to go and pick

1127
01:00:24,180 --> 01:00:26,280
them up a gift card from a store and as

1128
01:00:26,280 --> 01:00:27,180
they're going to pick it up and

1129
01:00:27,180 --> 01:00:28,380
everything they're going to say hey go

1130
01:00:28,380 --> 01:00:29,400
ahead and take a picture of the back of

1131
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:31,319
it and send it to me what they'll do is

1132
01:00:31,319 --> 01:00:33,540
they'll actually cash that out and they

1133
01:00:33,540 --> 01:00:35,040
will go and convert that over to

1134
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:36,660
cryptocurrency and then use that as

1135
01:00:36,660 --> 01:00:38,819
their cash out method and the speed at

1136
01:00:38,819 --> 01:00:40,319
which they do that is they can go ahead

1137
01:00:40,319 --> 01:00:42,839
and actually have the cards the amount

1138
01:00:42,839 --> 01:00:45,480
of time it takes from the scam to hit

1139
01:00:45,480 --> 01:00:47,880
the gift card to cashing out for the

1140
01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:50,339
scammers to have money is 24 hours and

1141
01:00:50,339 --> 01:00:51,480
there were co-founds we actually did a

1142
01:00:51,480 --> 01:00:53,520
study on this where we actually gave 500

1143
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:55,260
of gift cards to the scammers and

1144
01:00:55,260 --> 01:00:57,900
tracked what had happened from that and

1145
01:00:57,900 --> 01:00:58,920
that was one of the big things that we

1146
01:00:58,920 --> 01:01:00,660
found was okay you can go ahead and it's

1147
01:01:00,660 --> 01:01:02,339
very quick for the scammers to wire the

1148
01:01:02,339 --> 01:01:04,740
money out in addition to that with gift

1149
01:01:04,740 --> 01:01:06,119
card fraud some of this actually happens

1150
01:01:06,119 --> 01:01:07,920
over SMS so you're not even getting an

1151
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:10,559
email I got pulled into one case where

1152
01:01:10,559 --> 01:01:13,319
the person was two years out of college

1153
01:01:13,319 --> 01:01:15,420
and he had received a text message from

1154
01:01:15,420 --> 01:01:17,640
the CEO within the first couple days of

1155
01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:19,619
him working there

1156
01:01:19,619 --> 01:01:21,299
um that ended up turning into over 30

1157
01:01:21,299 --> 01:01:22,740
000 of fraud

1158
01:01:22,740 --> 01:01:24,480
um it turned into a toxic relationship

1159
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:26,520
between this individual and the CEO

1160
01:01:26,520 --> 01:01:29,280
because the person was constantly being

1161
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:31,500
berated by the fake CEO your Harbor

1162
01:01:31,500 --> 01:01:32,940
employee you're not going to be doing

1163
01:01:32,940 --> 01:01:34,319
this and it became an abusive

1164
01:01:34,319 --> 01:01:36,359
relationship at that point so the CEO

1165
01:01:36,359 --> 01:01:37,559
who was actually the person who was

1166
01:01:37,559 --> 01:01:38,819
there was kind of telling the story he's

1167
01:01:38,819 --> 01:01:40,200
like yeah this guy has a weird attitude

1168
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:41,640
towards me like I can't never figure it

1169
01:01:41,640 --> 01:01:44,460
out CEO is a great guy but the CEO and

1170
01:01:44,460 --> 01:01:46,079
this person's head was completely

1171
01:01:46,079 --> 01:01:47,520
different than who he was dealing with

1172
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:49,260
and that's one of the things that

1173
01:01:49,260 --> 01:01:50,520
happens is that the level of

1174
01:01:50,520 --> 01:01:52,740
Consciousness between the victims here

1175
01:01:52,740 --> 01:01:55,079
and the way the scam works there have

1176
01:01:55,079 --> 01:01:56,520
there is no Gap there is no links

1177
01:01:56,520 --> 01:01:58,559
between that and that's one of the areas

1178
01:01:58,559 --> 01:02:01,740
that we have on Consumer Fraud where we

1179
01:02:01,740 --> 01:02:02,640
need to again we need to start

1180
01:02:02,640 --> 01:02:04,440
understanding that the Consumer Fraud

1181
01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:07,140
size is what's facilitating VEC and we

1182
01:02:07,140 --> 01:02:09,299
need to start addressing this more and

1183
01:02:09,299 --> 01:02:10,920
the reason that Consumer Fraud is such a

1184
01:02:10,920 --> 01:02:13,859
big problem is if you go walk out the

1185
01:02:13,859 --> 01:02:15,240
street right now

1186
01:02:15,240 --> 01:02:16,859
um and if you go watch anybody walking

1187
01:02:16,859 --> 01:02:18,599
in a grocery store for example any

1188
01:02:18,599 --> 01:02:20,819
person that you're looking at could be a

1189
01:02:20,819 --> 01:02:22,859
money mule a money mule is not this

1190
01:02:22,859 --> 01:02:24,839
malicious horrible person that's gonna

1191
01:02:24,839 --> 01:02:26,940
go and steal money it's somebody who has

1192
01:02:26,940 --> 01:02:29,099
been socially engineered in order to do

1193
01:02:29,099 --> 01:02:31,020
things in order to go and wire the money

1194
01:02:31,020 --> 01:02:34,380
for them so for example they one one

1195
01:02:34,380 --> 01:02:36,299
scheme that we've seen is we've seen a

1196
01:02:36,299 --> 01:02:38,099
car wrapping scam where they'll say hey

1197
01:02:38,099 --> 01:02:39,780
we'll can go ahead and put slap this

1198
01:02:39,780 --> 01:02:41,339
monster or this coke logo on the side of

1199
01:02:41,339 --> 01:02:42,839
your car we'll give you five hundred

1200
01:02:42,839 --> 01:02:44,579
dollars per week and a lot of times

1201
01:02:44,579 --> 01:02:46,440
they'll go ahead and that could be as a

1202
01:02:46,440 --> 01:02:47,940
fake check and it's like oh I'm sorry I

1203
01:02:47,940 --> 01:02:49,319
sent you this fake this check for

1204
01:02:49,319 --> 01:02:51,059
fifteen hundred dollars go ahead and

1205
01:02:51,059 --> 01:02:53,099
cash this take the 500 and I'll keep up

1206
01:02:53,099 --> 01:02:54,359
and then just send me the other thousand

1207
01:02:54,359 --> 01:02:56,880
dollars so now that user is out the

1208
01:02:56,880 --> 01:02:58,920
thousand dollars and is pending charges

1209
01:02:58,920 --> 01:03:00,299
because they went and cash unknowingly

1210
01:03:00,299 --> 01:03:02,160
cashed a fake check and that's the

1211
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:03,059
problem

1212
01:03:03,059 --> 01:03:04,859
is when you even for law enforcement

1213
01:03:04,859 --> 01:03:06,299
when you go and actually approach these

1214
01:03:06,299 --> 01:03:08,880
people they have absolutely no clue what

1215
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:10,920
they're doing is actually a crime and

1216
01:03:10,920 --> 01:03:12,299
what happens is law enforcement will go

1217
01:03:12,299 --> 01:03:13,799
and beat the crap out of these victims

1218
01:03:13,799 --> 01:03:15,119
it'd be like you're a horrible person

1219
01:03:15,119 --> 01:03:16,740
you're doing this crime why would you do

1220
01:03:16,740 --> 01:03:18,180
this why why would you go and stay in

1221
01:03:18,180 --> 01:03:20,760
this and psychologically that's like the

1222
01:03:20,760 --> 01:03:22,740
absolute worst thing you can do is

1223
01:03:22,740 --> 01:03:24,420
because if somebody has no idea what

1224
01:03:24,420 --> 01:03:26,160
you're doing you're now accusing

1225
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:27,960
something somebody of something that

1226
01:03:27,960 --> 01:03:29,640
they don't even realize it's happening

1227
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:31,740
and when you go and approach romance

1228
01:03:31,740 --> 01:03:32,760
victims like yeah I'll be digging to

1229
01:03:32,760 --> 01:03:34,140
this here shortly

1230
01:03:34,140 --> 01:03:35,400
um that's like the absolute worst thing

1231
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:36,780
you can do is because emotionally we

1232
01:03:36,780 --> 01:03:38,579
shut down like we don't want to work

1233
01:03:38,579 --> 01:03:40,140
with somebody like that

1234
01:03:40,140 --> 01:03:41,640
um so again there's all of these stigmas

1235
01:03:41,640 --> 01:03:43,680
that we have to start realizing are

1236
01:03:43,680 --> 01:03:46,020
actually part of this and in virtually

1237
01:03:46,020 --> 01:03:47,640
every case that we've seen when it comes

1238
01:03:47,640 --> 01:03:49,079
to business email compromise when it

1239
01:03:49,079 --> 01:03:51,299
comes to money being wired when it comes

1240
01:03:51,299 --> 01:03:52,920
to that bank account being used for that

1241
01:03:52,920 --> 01:03:55,680
CEO fraud that 43 billion dollar number

1242
01:03:55,680 --> 01:03:59,400
I pointed to more times than not that is

1243
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:01,260
a romance scam victim who is actually

1244
01:04:01,260 --> 01:04:02,819
wiring that money let me repeat that

1245
01:04:02,819 --> 01:04:05,220
again the romance scam victims who are

1246
01:04:05,220 --> 01:04:07,319
opening the bank accounts to facilitate

1247
01:04:07,319 --> 01:04:09,359
the business email compromises to be

1248
01:04:09,359 --> 01:04:11,339
using every single company

1249
01:04:11,339 --> 01:04:14,099
is a romance victim and there are other

1250
01:04:14,099 --> 01:04:15,359
types of money mules that are out there

1251
01:04:15,359 --> 01:04:16,500
too

1252
01:04:16,500 --> 01:04:18,780
um but again the concept actually comes

1253
01:04:18,780 --> 01:04:20,640
from with a lot of the victims and they

1254
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:22,680
again they don't realize it and when law

1255
01:04:22,680 --> 01:04:23,940
enforcement goes and talk to them they

1256
01:04:23,940 --> 01:04:25,260
think that the victims relying because

1257
01:04:25,260 --> 01:04:26,640
they don't want to get in trouble but

1258
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:28,619
again many of them consciously you could

1259
01:04:28,619 --> 01:04:30,000
plug them up to a polygraph and you

1260
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:31,380
could say hey are you doing the scam

1261
01:04:31,380 --> 01:04:32,940
they're going to have no idea what's

1262
01:04:32,940 --> 01:04:34,200
going on because again they don't have

1263
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:35,819
that Fuller scope of what's really going

1264
01:04:35,819 --> 01:04:39,059
on and a lot of the victims they get

1265
01:04:39,059 --> 01:04:40,500
berated and said hey they're actually

1266
01:04:40,500 --> 01:04:42,180
stupid it's like gets the complete

1267
01:04:42,180 --> 01:04:43,980
opposite a lot of the victims are

1268
01:04:43,980 --> 01:04:45,420
extremely smart they're extremely well

1269
01:04:45,420 --> 01:04:47,460
educated and even though they have so

1270
01:04:47,460 --> 01:04:49,680
many do tend to be older that's like you

1271
01:04:49,680 --> 01:04:51,119
have to look back they went to college

1272
01:04:51,119 --> 01:04:54,000
they had a job they're successful they

1273
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,280
were had a successful career and you're

1274
01:04:56,280 --> 01:04:58,020
now labeling somebody who has all of

1275
01:04:58,020 --> 01:05:00,359
that as stupid because they made one

1276
01:05:00,359 --> 01:05:02,579
little itty bitty mistake

1277
01:05:02,579 --> 01:05:04,559
how many people in this room have never

1278
01:05:04,559 --> 01:05:06,780
made a mistake before

1279
01:05:06,780 --> 01:05:08,700
and that's what we're doing here is

1280
01:05:08,700 --> 01:05:10,200
we're accusing them of being horrible

1281
01:05:10,200 --> 01:05:12,000
people for something that every single

1282
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,640
one of us do we all screw up and again

1283
01:05:14,640 --> 01:05:16,260
the analogy I like to give different

1284
01:05:16,260 --> 01:05:18,780
knowledge doesn't mean being stupid

1285
01:05:18,780 --> 01:05:20,339
um and this is where I'm going to kind

1286
01:05:20,339 --> 01:05:21,780
of start rolling into the romance scam

1287
01:05:21,780 --> 01:05:24,359
side is again with the way the romance

1288
01:05:24,359 --> 01:05:27,599
scams work many times the victims will

1289
01:05:27,599 --> 01:05:29,160
go ahead and they they're lonely they're

1290
01:05:29,160 --> 01:05:30,480
single they want to go and find a

1291
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:32,579
relationship and every single person in

1292
01:05:32,579 --> 01:05:34,619
this room right now wants to be loved at

1293
01:05:34,619 --> 01:05:36,420
the core that's the core of our us as

1294
01:05:36,420 --> 01:05:38,099
being human beings and we all want

1295
01:05:38,099 --> 01:05:39,540
relationships we all want to be approved

1296
01:05:39,540 --> 01:05:41,760
of and again that's everything that

1297
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:43,559
that's a huge that's a aspect of us just

1298
01:05:43,559 --> 01:05:45,480
simply Being Human

1299
01:05:45,480 --> 01:05:47,520
um and the reason Roman I kind of harp

1300
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:49,619
on romance again is being part of it is

1301
01:05:49,619 --> 01:05:51,359
because again the romance victims are

1302
01:05:51,359 --> 01:05:53,700
very much that underlying infrastructure

1303
01:05:53,700 --> 01:05:55,380
for the scammers

1304
01:05:55,380 --> 01:05:56,760
um and again when you go and talk with

1305
01:05:56,760 --> 01:05:58,859
them when you work with them they truly

1306
01:05:58,859 --> 01:06:00,599
believe that they are in a relationship

1307
01:06:00,599 --> 01:06:02,520
these victims when they're at when

1308
01:06:02,520 --> 01:06:03,660
you're actually working with them they

1309
01:06:03,660 --> 01:06:05,460
will fantasize in their heads about that

1310
01:06:05,460 --> 01:06:06,480
next time that they're gonna make that

1311
01:06:06,480 --> 01:06:08,040
phone call next time they're going to

1312
01:06:08,040 --> 01:06:09,960
have that discussion with the person so

1313
01:06:09,960 --> 01:06:12,000
they get themselves amped up and don't

1314
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:13,559
know how to bring themselves back down

1315
01:06:13,559 --> 01:06:16,140
again because they're so expecting this

1316
01:06:16,140 --> 01:06:17,880
to happen and they won't they actually

1317
01:06:17,880 --> 01:06:19,140
want to be in that relationship because

1318
01:06:19,140 --> 01:06:22,260
again that's a core attribute of us as

1319
01:06:22,260 --> 01:06:23,700
human beings we just want to be loved

1320
01:06:23,700 --> 01:06:24,780
that we just want to be loved and

1321
01:06:24,780 --> 01:06:26,880
accepted and what happens is because

1322
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:28,920
when the victims believe that when they

1323
01:06:28,920 --> 01:06:30,900
get so entranced in that there's a level

1324
01:06:30,900 --> 01:06:32,520
of grooming that can happen

1325
01:06:32,520 --> 01:06:34,680
again this is something that anybody can

1326
01:06:34,680 --> 01:06:36,960
fall for because again this is now a

1327
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:38,880
core belief and a core value of us as

1328
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:40,559
human beings

1329
01:06:40,559 --> 01:06:42,240
um again victims are not stupid they're

1330
01:06:42,240 --> 01:06:44,700
simply lonely they will they may have

1331
01:06:44,700 --> 01:06:46,500
lost somebody they may have been a widow

1332
01:06:46,500 --> 01:06:48,240
they may have gone through some some

1333
01:06:48,240 --> 01:06:50,520
type of trauma in their life that they

1334
01:06:50,520 --> 01:06:53,039
don't fully know how to unpack and even

1335
01:06:53,039 --> 01:06:55,380
before the scammers go and start talking

1336
01:06:55,380 --> 01:06:57,359
back and forth with the victims the

1337
01:06:57,359 --> 01:06:58,799
scammers have pictures that they have

1338
01:06:58,799 --> 01:07:01,079
scraped from social media they have long

1339
01:07:01,079 --> 01:07:02,819
scripts and formats for engagement where

1340
01:07:02,819 --> 01:07:04,740
some of these things will go 26 layers

1341
01:07:04,740 --> 01:07:06,720
deep that they can that this victim can

1342
01:07:06,720 --> 01:07:08,700
copy paste back and forth even before

1343
01:07:08,700 --> 01:07:12,059
they have to say something to the victim

1344
01:07:12,059 --> 01:07:13,140
before they have to come and create

1345
01:07:13,140 --> 01:07:14,460
something else that they can that they

1346
01:07:14,460 --> 01:07:16,319
can use and again these scripts are

1347
01:07:16,319 --> 01:07:18,480
something or along the lines of hey I'm

1348
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:20,940
single I'm widowed I have three kids I

1349
01:07:20,940 --> 01:07:22,799
just want to have somebody to go and

1350
01:07:22,799 --> 01:07:23,760
love the rest of my life with and

1351
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:25,319
everything and again these are all

1352
01:07:25,319 --> 01:07:27,240
things that the scammers will use to

1353
01:07:27,240 --> 01:07:29,220
play up on the emotions of the victims

1354
01:07:29,220 --> 01:07:30,960
and unfortunately many of the victims

1355
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:32,579
don't know

1356
01:07:32,579 --> 01:07:34,680
how their own emotions work because

1357
01:07:34,680 --> 01:07:36,240
again there's a big disconnect in that

1358
01:07:36,240 --> 01:07:37,680
regard

1359
01:07:37,680 --> 01:07:38,880
um and this is what gets me back to the

1360
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:40,319
human element of this is we need to

1361
01:07:40,319 --> 01:07:41,520
start humanizing some of the stuff

1362
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:43,619
because again deep down wanting to be

1363
01:07:43,619 --> 01:07:45,119
loved and wanting to have companionship

1364
01:07:45,119 --> 01:07:48,420
that's a core belief for us as humans

1365
01:07:48,420 --> 01:07:49,619
um from again from a victim's

1366
01:07:49,619 --> 01:07:50,940
perspective they see pictures of the

1367
01:07:50,940 --> 01:07:52,559
people they have real-time Facebook

1368
01:07:52,559 --> 01:07:55,020
messages and again it's something where

1369
01:07:55,020 --> 01:07:56,880
it gets away from a case of no default

1370
01:07:56,880 --> 01:07:59,579
for this to anybody would fall for this

1371
01:07:59,579 --> 01:08:01,799
um again it's very disheartening trying

1372
01:08:01,799 --> 01:08:04,140
to convince like infosec people like hey

1373
01:08:04,140 --> 01:08:05,640
we need to go and look at the romance

1374
01:08:05,640 --> 01:08:07,859
campsite of BEC because this is where

1375
01:08:07,859 --> 01:08:10,440
the losses are but again it's also going

1376
01:08:10,440 --> 01:08:12,839
against the stigmas here that victims

1377
01:08:12,839 --> 01:08:14,520
are stupid it's like no they're not it's

1378
01:08:14,520 --> 01:08:17,100
like be humans be kind to each other and

1379
01:08:17,100 --> 01:08:18,359
like I said that's some of the hardest

1380
01:08:18,359 --> 01:08:21,120
things and again after talking with many

1381
01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:23,040
romance victims here

1382
01:08:23,040 --> 01:08:24,899
um working with people in the field who

1383
01:08:24,899 --> 01:08:27,420
actively work with romance victims

1384
01:08:27,420 --> 01:08:29,640
um many of them feel horrible for this

1385
01:08:29,640 --> 01:08:31,560
they feel about a good bit of Shame as a

1386
01:08:31,560 --> 01:08:33,960
result of this they become anxious they

1387
01:08:33,960 --> 01:08:35,640
become depressed that many of them will

1388
01:08:35,640 --> 01:08:37,140
actually disassociate from their body

1389
01:08:37,140 --> 01:08:39,120
days and if you're unfamiliar with that

1390
01:08:39,120 --> 01:08:40,859
term it's where your Consciousness will

1391
01:08:40,859 --> 01:08:42,479
actually go to a point where you can't

1392
01:08:42,479 --> 01:08:44,880
even feel your body anymore because the

1393
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:46,080
amount of trauma that you have been

1394
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:48,238
through is so painful that your body

1395
01:08:48,238 --> 01:08:49,979
will do anything it can to literally

1396
01:08:49,979 --> 01:08:51,899
disconnect from your body so there's

1397
01:08:51,899 --> 01:08:53,580
cases where you can actually they can

1398
01:08:53,580 --> 01:08:55,319
actually touch the arm and like they

1399
01:08:55,319 --> 01:08:56,698
actually won't feel it because again

1400
01:08:56,698 --> 01:08:58,198
they their brains will literally turn

1401
01:08:58,198 --> 01:09:00,060
off that much stuff so you don't have to

1402
01:09:00,060 --> 01:09:03,179
feel the pain associated with this and

1403
01:09:03,179 --> 01:09:03,960
again that's some of the most

1404
01:09:03,960 --> 01:09:06,420
unfortunate things working with this in

1405
01:09:06,420 --> 01:09:07,799
addition to that I was actually working

1406
01:09:07,799 --> 01:09:10,080
with um with one of the folks who

1407
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:11,279
actually tracks a lot on the romance

1408
01:09:11,279 --> 01:09:12,660
scam side

1409
01:09:12,660 --> 01:09:14,279
um again one individual who has a lot of

1410
01:09:14,279 --> 01:09:15,779
these cases here

1411
01:09:15,779 --> 01:09:17,219
um suicide is something that we have to

1412
01:09:17,219 --> 01:09:18,540
deal with on this we've had seven

1413
01:09:18,540 --> 01:09:20,460
suicides as a result of romance scams

1414
01:09:20,460 --> 01:09:22,500
again this is just from one individual

1415
01:09:22,500 --> 01:09:24,000
who works with people who are doing this

1416
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:25,979
but again the amount of Shame the

1417
01:09:25,979 --> 01:09:28,198
hopelessness and when you go and

1418
01:09:28,198 --> 01:09:30,600
actually work with the victims and you

1419
01:09:30,600 --> 01:09:32,100
have law enforcement constantly berating

1420
01:09:32,100 --> 01:09:35,100
them it's a horrible mess and at the end

1421
01:09:35,100 --> 01:09:36,600
of the day many of the victims frigates

1422
01:09:36,600 --> 01:09:37,560
feel because

1423
01:09:37,560 --> 01:09:39,779
it's something where as humans we'll do

1424
01:09:39,779 --> 01:09:41,399
everything we can to not feel those

1425
01:09:41,399 --> 01:09:43,439
uncomfortable emotions but for the

1426
01:09:43,439 --> 01:09:45,179
emotions in our body those are simply

1427
01:09:45,179 --> 01:09:47,279
senses and it's something where those

1428
01:09:47,279 --> 01:09:48,660
uncomfortable emotions that we feel

1429
01:09:48,660 --> 01:09:51,120
aren't necessarily a bad thing it's just

1430
01:09:51,120 --> 01:09:52,439
our body trying to give us signals that

1431
01:09:52,439 --> 01:09:54,480
we don't fully understand and because of

1432
01:09:54,480 --> 01:09:55,980
the victims because they are in this

1433
01:09:55,980 --> 01:09:58,080
really loving relationship consciously

1434
01:09:58,080 --> 01:09:59,699
it actually rewires a lot of that to

1435
01:09:59,699 --> 01:10:01,199
where they don't fully understand what's

1436
01:10:01,199 --> 01:10:04,320
going on as a matter of trying to redo

1437
01:10:04,320 --> 01:10:09,000
that and refigure that so so in in order

1438
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:10,199
to do that I kind of want to show you

1439
01:10:10,199 --> 01:10:11,400
guys some of the stuff that you can that

1440
01:10:11,400 --> 01:10:13,199
you can do in order to actually down

1441
01:10:13,199 --> 01:10:15,420
regulate and calm your body so everybody

1442
01:10:15,420 --> 01:10:17,640
close your eyes

1443
01:10:17,640 --> 01:10:19,980
and then now that your eyes are closed

1444
01:10:19,980 --> 01:10:22,380
put your hand on your stomach and take

1445
01:10:22,380 --> 01:10:24,960
three big breaths in like as big as as

1446
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:27,060
big of a breath in as you can and then

1447
01:10:27,060 --> 01:10:30,320
blow it out as slow as you can

1448
01:10:34,560 --> 01:10:37,020
and now keeping your eyes closed imagine

1449
01:10:37,020 --> 01:10:39,239
the muscles on the top of your head and

1450
01:10:39,239 --> 01:10:40,739
relax those muscles

1451
01:10:40,739 --> 01:10:42,659
now imagine the muscles on the side of

1452
01:10:42,659 --> 01:10:45,120
your head and relax those muscles

1453
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:47,400
now relax imagine the muscles in your

1454
01:10:47,400 --> 01:10:50,580
neck and relax those

1455
01:10:50,580 --> 01:10:52,500
and then relax the muscles in your

1456
01:10:52,500 --> 01:10:53,760
shoulders

1457
01:10:53,760 --> 01:10:57,239
your arms and your hands

1458
01:10:57,239 --> 01:11:00,840
and then relax the muscles in your torso

1459
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:02,340
your hips

1460
01:11:02,340 --> 01:11:03,780
and your legs

1461
01:11:03,780 --> 01:11:05,880
and then relax the muscles of your feet

1462
01:11:05,880 --> 01:11:09,060
now that relaxed feeling double that

1463
01:11:09,060 --> 01:11:11,640
and then double that again

1464
01:11:11,640 --> 01:11:13,920
now open your eyes how many people feel

1465
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:15,659
more relaxed

1466
01:11:15,659 --> 01:11:17,820
and it's something where as humans we

1467
01:11:17,820 --> 01:11:19,620
don't realize that we can act that we

1468
01:11:19,620 --> 01:11:21,239
actually constantly have that much

1469
01:11:21,239 --> 01:11:23,880
control over our bodies and in doing

1470
01:11:23,880 --> 01:11:26,100
this research to try and understand and

1471
01:11:26,100 --> 01:11:28,679
unpack lob this when we feel emotions as

1472
01:11:28,679 --> 01:11:30,780
humans we feel them in certain places in

1473
01:11:30,780 --> 01:11:32,640
our bodies we feel happiness in this

1474
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:34,739
place we feel sadness in that place and

1475
01:11:34,739 --> 01:11:37,020
again being able to down regulate and

1476
01:11:37,020 --> 01:11:39,179
calm our bodies down that's been some of

1477
01:11:39,179 --> 01:11:41,040
the hardest thing in order to come to

1478
01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:43,020
terms with because again when your

1479
01:11:43,020 --> 01:11:45,120
victim is super anxious and super worked

1480
01:11:45,120 --> 01:11:46,800
up they're actually stuck in what's

1481
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:48,300
called their sympathetic nervousness I

1482
01:11:48,300 --> 01:11:49,560
mean that's what's responsible for our

1483
01:11:49,560 --> 01:11:51,360
fight or flight response and what

1484
01:11:51,360 --> 01:11:53,100
happens is they actually will get stuck

1485
01:11:53,100 --> 01:11:54,960
in there and they will constantly stay

1486
01:11:54,960 --> 01:11:57,300
in a nice stuck State and everything and

1487
01:11:57,300 --> 01:11:58,739
they don't know how to down regulate

1488
01:11:58,739 --> 01:12:01,020
that within their bodies and

1489
01:12:01,020 --> 01:12:02,940
has Information Security Professionals

1490
01:12:02,940 --> 01:12:05,100
how many of us have been in a stressful

1491
01:12:05,100 --> 01:12:06,840
position where we're like we want to go

1492
01:12:06,840 --> 01:12:08,280
and do this thing but we don't know how

1493
01:12:08,280 --> 01:12:10,140
to calm our own bodies down

1494
01:12:10,140 --> 01:12:11,760
this is something that you can kind of

1495
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:13,560
do and again what happens is because of

1496
01:12:13,560 --> 01:12:14,880
the way that this works within the

1497
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:16,679
victims that energy flow in the sink

1498
01:12:16,679 --> 01:12:18,060
with all of their nerves with their

1499
01:12:18,060 --> 01:12:20,400
organs get so much out of sync and again

1500
01:12:20,400 --> 01:12:21,840
it's something where there's actually

1501
01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:23,400
thousands of years of research in

1502
01:12:23,400 --> 01:12:24,900
meditation and breath work that actually

1503
01:12:24,900 --> 01:12:26,880
might help out with this again this is

1504
01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:28,380
why romance victims are very much key

1505
01:12:28,380 --> 01:12:30,540
here is because they really don't

1506
01:12:30,540 --> 01:12:32,460
understand that these are mechanisms of

1507
01:12:32,460 --> 01:12:34,380
their body that work in addition to that

1508
01:12:34,380 --> 01:12:35,699
they actually don't know that they can

1509
01:12:35,699 --> 01:12:37,380
actually down regulate themselves that

1510
01:12:37,380 --> 01:12:38,300
hard

1511
01:12:38,300 --> 01:12:40,199
they're Associated engineered to move

1512
01:12:40,199 --> 01:12:42,000
money for their scam for their lovers

1513
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:43,320
they're actually the ones who take it

1514
01:12:43,320 --> 01:12:45,659
who take the fall for them um again

1515
01:12:45,659 --> 01:12:47,100
mentally emotionally they're destroyed

1516
01:12:47,100 --> 01:12:49,260
many of these victims be unfortunately

1517
01:12:49,260 --> 01:12:50,820
become shells of their former selves

1518
01:12:50,820 --> 01:12:53,100
where they are so emotionally hurt and

1519
01:12:53,100 --> 01:12:54,900
distraught that they can't work through

1520
01:12:54,900 --> 01:12:57,000
some of these things one of the hardest

1521
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:58,920
pills I had to swallow was I got into an

1522
01:12:58,920 --> 01:13:01,140
Uber and black hat a couple years ago

1523
01:13:01,140 --> 01:13:03,120
and in working and talking I got to

1524
01:13:03,120 --> 01:13:04,860
talking with the Uber driver I said yeah

1525
01:13:04,860 --> 01:13:06,179
I'd worked with romance victim she's

1526
01:13:06,179 --> 01:13:08,760
like funny story she's like I was a

1527
01:13:08,760 --> 01:13:10,500
romance victim for 10 years

1528
01:13:10,500 --> 01:13:13,199
lost her business lost custody of her

1529
01:13:13,199 --> 01:13:14,940
family or lost custody of her kids lost

1530
01:13:14,940 --> 01:13:17,040
her home lost her husband and was over a

1531
01:13:17,040 --> 01:13:18,300
million dollars in debt and the reason

1532
01:13:18,300 --> 01:13:20,820
she was an Uber driver was because she

1533
01:13:20,820 --> 01:13:23,159
had no other ways to go and make money

1534
01:13:23,159 --> 01:13:24,480
on that and everything so I asked her I

1535
01:13:24,480 --> 01:13:26,100
said what kept you in it for so long and

1536
01:13:26,100 --> 01:13:28,860
like her mood completely changed and she

1537
01:13:28,860 --> 01:13:30,900
was like well my husband was abusive I

1538
01:13:30,900 --> 01:13:32,280
just wanted to be loved and she's like

1539
01:13:32,280 --> 01:13:33,719
that's why I wanted to be in it was

1540
01:13:33,719 --> 01:13:34,860
because somebody was showing me that

1541
01:13:34,860 --> 01:13:36,780
love in the faction again that's the

1542
01:13:36,780 --> 01:13:38,580
reality here is when it comes to work

1543
01:13:38,580 --> 01:13:40,020
with BEC when it comes to working with

1544
01:13:40,020 --> 01:13:42,239
romance victims while there are cyber

1545
01:13:42,239 --> 01:13:44,159
elements here this is a people problem

1546
01:13:44,159 --> 01:13:46,380
and this is something that is very much

1547
01:13:46,380 --> 01:13:49,440
an emotional issue that we don't fully

1548
01:13:49,440 --> 01:13:51,540
understand yet again without those money

1549
01:13:51,540 --> 01:13:54,659
meals BEC would look extremely different

1550
01:13:54,659 --> 01:13:57,060
um so I know I've talked a lot about the

1551
01:13:57,060 --> 01:13:58,500
romance scams I know I've talked a lot

1552
01:13:58,500 --> 01:14:00,600
about the BEC now I'm going to go ahead

1553
01:14:00,600 --> 01:14:02,400
and walk through some of the stuff with

1554
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:03,840
the actors I'm like okay now that we

1555
01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:05,760
know this is what's actually happening

1556
01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:07,679
here what are some of the things that

1557
01:14:07,679 --> 01:14:09,540
are happening with who what's happening

1558
01:14:09,540 --> 01:14:10,920
behind the scenes with the scan cameras

1559
01:14:10,920 --> 01:14:12,179
like who's actually running this stuff

1560
01:14:12,179 --> 01:14:15,840
so in Nigeria there's a certain group of

1561
01:14:15,840 --> 01:14:17,880
people that are called Yahoo boys and as

1562
01:14:17,880 --> 01:14:19,800
I say this this is not just a Nigeria

1563
01:14:19,800 --> 01:14:21,840
problem this is just kind of where in

1564
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:23,280
the areas where we see this stuff so

1565
01:14:23,280 --> 01:14:24,719
please don't take this as me saying

1566
01:14:24,719 --> 01:14:25,980
horrible things about Nigeria this is

1567
01:14:25,980 --> 01:14:28,500
just again shoot the facts here

1568
01:14:28,500 --> 01:14:31,080
um traditionally a lot of these crimes

1569
01:14:31,080 --> 01:14:33,480
actually come out of Nigeria and the way

1570
01:14:33,480 --> 01:14:36,540
it works is you're scammers like I said

1571
01:14:36,540 --> 01:14:37,260
that's what they're called they're

1572
01:14:37,260 --> 01:14:39,300
called the Yahoo boy many of them are

1573
01:14:39,300 --> 01:14:40,739
very flashy many of them will go and

1574
01:14:40,739 --> 01:14:42,719
flaunt their money around and they will

1575
01:14:42,719 --> 01:14:45,300
do literally anything in order to go and

1576
01:14:45,300 --> 01:14:47,940
entice these victims in order to go and

1577
01:14:47,940 --> 01:14:49,679
try and sell money from the victim

1578
01:14:49,679 --> 01:14:51,540
in addition to that they use something

1579
01:14:51,540 --> 01:14:53,400
that's called Juju or would be the

1580
01:14:53,400 --> 01:14:55,500
equivalent of Voodoo or roughly the

1581
01:14:55,500 --> 01:14:56,820
equivalent of voodoo but kind of have

1582
01:14:56,820 --> 01:14:58,860
the similar things as part of that in

1583
01:14:58,860 --> 01:15:00,300
order to instill confidence within

1584
01:15:00,300 --> 01:15:02,880
themselves so the way that this works is

1585
01:15:02,880 --> 01:15:04,080
they will go and do different types of

1586
01:15:04,080 --> 01:15:06,480
money rituals and human sacrifices in

1587
01:15:06,480 --> 01:15:07,860
order to again build that that

1588
01:15:07,860 --> 01:15:09,719
confidence and everything there are some

1589
01:15:09,719 --> 01:15:10,860
rituals where you can become what's

1590
01:15:10,860 --> 01:15:12,719
called a Yahoo boy plus that will

1591
01:15:12,719 --> 01:15:14,640
actually include a human sacrifice that

1592
01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:16,800
once you sacrifice that human then you

1593
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:18,659
can kind of go and be a better be a

1594
01:15:18,659 --> 01:15:20,040
better scammer

1595
01:15:20,040 --> 01:15:21,600
um again the way I like to wear this is

1596
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:22,739
think of like a combination of like

1597
01:15:22,739 --> 01:15:25,800
magic and Superstition where you can go

1598
01:15:25,800 --> 01:15:27,360
and do these things in order to kind of

1599
01:15:27,360 --> 01:15:29,340
build your confidence again if you see

1600
01:15:29,340 --> 01:15:30,900
some of the rituals that that are

1601
01:15:30,900 --> 01:15:32,640
publicly documented here

1602
01:15:32,640 --> 01:15:34,020
um there's a whole lot of things that

1603
01:15:34,020 --> 01:15:36,120
you can do in order to do that

1604
01:15:36,120 --> 01:15:37,560
um we actually had one case down in

1605
01:15:37,560 --> 01:15:40,860
South Africa with law enforcement where

1606
01:15:40,860 --> 01:15:42,900
it was a the rest of the people there

1607
01:15:42,900 --> 01:15:44,880
was one room that was back that was

1608
01:15:44,880 --> 01:15:47,880
actually blocked off and everything and

1609
01:15:47,880 --> 01:15:49,140
um the law enforcement broke the window

1610
01:15:49,140 --> 01:15:51,000
got in everything and it was a pile of

1611
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,219
money covered with blood and dead

1612
01:15:53,219 --> 01:15:55,679
chickens and they uh they actually

1613
01:15:55,679 --> 01:15:57,000
started asking the actors they were

1614
01:15:57,000 --> 01:16:00,360
pointing they were like WTF because for

1615
01:16:00,360 --> 01:16:01,560
the law enforcement like they had never

1616
01:16:01,560 --> 01:16:03,719
seen something like that and what the

1617
01:16:03,719 --> 01:16:06,120
actors told them was again true story

1618
01:16:06,120 --> 01:16:08,159
here they were like well it turns out

1619
01:16:08,159 --> 01:16:10,020
that the magic down here in South Africa

1620
01:16:10,020 --> 01:16:11,760
is not as strong as the juju with

1621
01:16:11,760 --> 01:16:14,340
Nigeria so we needed a larger pile of

1622
01:16:14,340 --> 01:16:15,900
money in order to make the ritual work

1623
01:16:15,900 --> 01:16:18,540
and again it's something where we can

1624
01:16:18,540 --> 01:16:20,699
discount this all day long

1625
01:16:20,699 --> 01:16:22,560
um but at the end of the day this is a

1626
01:16:22,560 --> 01:16:24,480
core belief for many of the scammers and

1627
01:16:24,480 --> 01:16:25,980
unfortunately we have to account for

1628
01:16:25,980 --> 01:16:27,120
that

1629
01:16:27,120 --> 01:16:29,280
um and the way a lot of the juju Works

1630
01:16:29,280 --> 01:16:31,199
kind of breaking that thousands of years

1631
01:16:31,199 --> 01:16:33,840
of them trying to go and do this from

1632
01:16:33,840 --> 01:16:35,580
the spiritual and the religious side of

1633
01:16:35,580 --> 01:16:36,360
it

1634
01:16:36,360 --> 01:16:38,640
the way they're using it is a way to

1635
01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:40,440
instill confidence within themselves so

1636
01:16:40,440 --> 01:16:42,480
like how we might wear a really funny

1637
01:16:42,480 --> 01:16:44,100
looking shirt in order to make us feel

1638
01:16:44,100 --> 01:16:45,600
more confident about stuff that we're

1639
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:47,760
presenting or how some of us might wear

1640
01:16:47,760 --> 01:16:49,500
a nice pair of high heels or we might

1641
01:16:49,500 --> 01:16:51,360
wear a nice dress or we might wear that

1642
01:16:51,360 --> 01:16:52,800
nice suit to make us more confident

1643
01:16:52,800 --> 01:16:54,900
that's the element within our bodies

1644
01:16:54,900 --> 01:16:56,940
that's actually being hit here that a

1645
01:16:56,940 --> 01:16:58,800
lot of the scammers will do

1646
01:16:58,800 --> 01:17:01,320
um again we can the whole other bunch of

1647
01:17:01,320 --> 01:17:02,880
theories on that but again that's the

1648
01:17:02,880 --> 01:17:05,159
core issue of how that works and in

1649
01:17:05,159 --> 01:17:07,560
addition to that when working with the

1650
01:17:07,560 --> 01:17:09,540
victims many of the scammers will

1651
01:17:09,540 --> 01:17:11,699
actually willingly remove their own

1652
01:17:11,699 --> 01:17:14,100
empathy from themselves so they will

1653
01:17:14,100 --> 01:17:15,480
actually make it to where they don't

1654
01:17:15,480 --> 01:17:17,219
feel the pain they don't feel the

1655
01:17:17,219 --> 01:17:19,560
discomfort of somebody crying and

1656
01:17:19,560 --> 01:17:21,179
begging for the money on the other end

1657
01:17:21,179 --> 01:17:23,219
and when doing that they actually make

1658
01:17:23,219 --> 01:17:24,360
it to the point where they'll actually

1659
01:17:24,360 --> 01:17:27,060
laugh at the victims there are so many

1660
01:17:27,060 --> 01:17:28,800
documented cases where they've done that

1661
01:17:28,800 --> 01:17:31,739
it's absolutely and utterly horrifying

1662
01:17:31,739 --> 01:17:33,620
um and again it's the it's actually

1663
01:17:33,620 --> 01:17:35,640
sociopaths who actually dabble in dark

1664
01:17:35,640 --> 01:17:37,860
magic here and like I'm not going to say

1665
01:17:37,860 --> 01:17:39,060
what's good I'm not going to say what's

1666
01:17:39,060 --> 01:17:40,440
evil but when you look up the dictionary

1667
01:17:40,440 --> 01:17:42,420
definition of evil that's kind of what

1668
01:17:42,420 --> 01:17:44,340
you're talking about here

1669
01:17:44,340 --> 01:17:46,500
um and when it comes to actors who are

1670
01:17:46,500 --> 01:17:47,580
doing this kind of some of the things

1671
01:17:47,580 --> 01:17:49,500
that are behind the scenes one of the

1672
01:17:49,500 --> 01:17:51,600
larger groups who does a lot of BEC as a

1673
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:53,760
group that's called black ax

1674
01:17:53,760 --> 01:17:55,500
um and what they are is they're a

1675
01:17:55,500 --> 01:17:58,380
Nigerian confraternity that has been

1676
01:17:58,380 --> 01:18:01,020
around since uh late the late 70s and

1677
01:18:01,020 --> 01:18:02,820
what they do is they have their fingers

1678
01:18:02,820 --> 01:18:04,679
in many different things so they do

1679
01:18:04,679 --> 01:18:07,020
cyber crime they run prostitution ranks

1680
01:18:07,020 --> 01:18:09,840
they do BEC they do money laundering

1681
01:18:09,840 --> 01:18:11,699
they do a whole gamut of things and

1682
01:18:11,699 --> 01:18:13,020
they're actually classified as a

1683
01:18:13,020 --> 01:18:15,659
terrorist organization in Canada and in

1684
01:18:15,659 --> 01:18:17,280
addition to that the very multinational

1685
01:18:17,280 --> 01:18:19,800
organization that has pop that actually

1686
01:18:19,800 --> 01:18:21,780
and they have publicly stated this that

1687
01:18:21,780 --> 01:18:23,100
they have politicians and people

1688
01:18:23,100 --> 01:18:24,659
embedded in different parts of the

1689
01:18:24,659 --> 01:18:27,179
government so you're now so this is the

1690
01:18:27,179 --> 01:18:28,920
level of which this stuff goes and if

1691
01:18:28,920 --> 01:18:30,960
you were curious to see how some of this

1692
01:18:30,960 --> 01:18:33,000
stuff works BBC did a very amazing

1693
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:34,800
documentary where they actually did a

1694
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:37,320
two-year study looking at this group

1695
01:18:37,320 --> 01:18:39,420
um and we have other stuff on behind the

1696
01:18:39,420 --> 01:18:41,040
scenes that when it comes to them

1697
01:18:41,040 --> 01:18:44,400
operating they've also done cases of

1698
01:18:44,400 --> 01:18:46,679
um of like SBA fraud and different

1699
01:18:46,679 --> 01:18:48,900
things like that so they do way more

1700
01:18:48,900 --> 01:18:50,340
than just BEC and again that's the

1701
01:18:50,340 --> 01:18:52,380
biggest thing here is that with BEC the

1702
01:18:52,380 --> 01:18:53,760
Yahoo boys and the actors who are doing

1703
01:18:53,760 --> 01:18:55,679
some of this stuff again it touches many

1704
01:18:55,679 --> 01:18:57,420
different things

1705
01:18:57,420 --> 01:18:58,679
um again this is some of the pictures

1706
01:18:58,679 --> 01:19:00,060
from behind the scenes that when it

1707
01:19:00,060 --> 01:19:01,739
comes to working with them these are

1708
01:19:01,739 --> 01:19:03,780
some of the operations that they do

1709
01:19:03,780 --> 01:19:05,280
um the name the main name that they

1710
01:19:05,280 --> 01:19:07,140
actually went under was the neo-black

1711
01:19:07,140 --> 01:19:09,300
movement in Africa which initially when

1712
01:19:09,300 --> 01:19:11,820
it started it was great now we have that

1713
01:19:11,820 --> 01:19:13,320
image that's tainted that's trying to

1714
01:19:13,320 --> 01:19:15,480
talk about equal rights that now you

1715
01:19:15,480 --> 01:19:16,679
have a lot of people who are abusing

1716
01:19:16,679 --> 01:19:18,540
that who are stealing different types of

1717
01:19:18,540 --> 01:19:20,400
money and falling under that radar and

1718
01:19:20,400 --> 01:19:22,260
stuff so again that's very much been a

1719
01:19:22,260 --> 01:19:23,880
tainted issue here

1720
01:19:23,880 --> 01:19:25,440
um and with some of the rituals that

1721
01:19:25,440 --> 01:19:28,800
they'll do if you see let me see okay

1722
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:30,060
make sure I have my make sure I have my

1723
01:19:30,060 --> 01:19:32,280
directors are on correct so if you look

1724
01:19:32,280 --> 01:19:33,960
at the picture on the left um again

1725
01:19:33,960 --> 01:19:35,520
these are all rituals that you can go

1726
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:37,560
and pull right from YouTube today

1727
01:19:37,560 --> 01:19:38,219
um

1728
01:19:38,219 --> 01:19:39,960
that's a case where they were using a

1729
01:19:39,960 --> 01:19:41,580
lamb and some blood in order to do one

1730
01:19:41,580 --> 01:19:43,800
of the sacrifices the one that's to the

1731
01:19:43,800 --> 01:19:45,120
left of that

1732
01:19:45,120 --> 01:19:46,980
um that was where they were bringing a

1733
01:19:46,980 --> 01:19:49,800
picture of a rapper named Davido in

1734
01:19:49,800 --> 01:19:52,320
Nigeria and they were using his album in

1735
01:19:52,320 --> 01:19:55,260
his CD as part of that ritual under that

1736
01:19:55,260 --> 01:19:57,179
one is a case where they were actually

1737
01:19:57,179 --> 01:19:58,920
washing their bodies with something

1738
01:19:58,920 --> 01:20:00,780
called black soap and it's kind of a

1739
01:20:00,780 --> 01:20:02,940
type of soap that has like ash inside of

1740
01:20:02,940 --> 01:20:04,560
it and they believe that if you go and

1741
01:20:04,560 --> 01:20:05,940
wash yourself with this you can get

1742
01:20:05,940 --> 01:20:07,500
again different different powers of

1743
01:20:07,500 --> 01:20:08,940
different rights on that um they were

1744
01:20:08,940 --> 01:20:10,620
doing that over Graves

1745
01:20:10,620 --> 01:20:12,239
um and if you look at the one right up

1746
01:20:12,239 --> 01:20:14,100
next to that one I forget exactly what

1747
01:20:14,100 --> 01:20:15,840
that was but again tying different

1748
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:17,280
things in certain patterns in order to

1749
01:20:17,280 --> 01:20:19,500
use different charms and finally all the

1750
01:20:19,500 --> 01:20:20,880
way over here on the right

1751
01:20:20,880 --> 01:20:23,280
it was a whole line of Yahoo boys who

1752
01:20:23,280 --> 01:20:24,900
were again washing themselves in a river

1753
01:20:24,900 --> 01:20:26,820
with dollar bills and everything again

1754
01:20:26,820 --> 01:20:28,980
trying to gain that confidence and gain

1755
01:20:28,980 --> 01:20:32,159
that right in order to go and do this so

1756
01:20:32,159 --> 01:20:34,320
when it comes to the cultural side again

1757
01:20:34,320 --> 01:20:35,940
we have to understand the whole picture

1758
01:20:35,940 --> 01:20:38,640
here there's a lot going on in Nigeria

1759
01:20:38,640 --> 01:20:39,900
right now

1760
01:20:39,900 --> 01:20:42,360
um culturally there's a good thing where

1761
01:20:42,360 --> 01:20:44,219
a lot of the scammers like fast cars

1762
01:20:44,219 --> 01:20:46,080
they like trying to do as much as they

1763
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:48,179
can in addition to that there's a lot of

1764
01:20:48,179 --> 01:20:50,880
peer pressure in order to go and be a

1765
01:20:50,880 --> 01:20:53,340
scammer if you have a choice of being

1766
01:20:53,340 --> 01:20:55,380
with someone who has a lot of money or

1767
01:20:55,380 --> 01:20:57,300
doesn't have a lot of money it's

1768
01:20:57,300 --> 01:20:58,739
something where while many of us will

1769
01:20:58,739 --> 01:21:00,600
pick love and everything there is a part

1770
01:21:00,600 --> 01:21:02,040
of the population that won't they will

1771
01:21:02,040 --> 01:21:04,020
go for people who have a lot of money so

1772
01:21:04,020 --> 01:21:05,940
again there's that cultural aspect there

1773
01:21:05,940 --> 01:21:07,800
where it where if you look at in a

1774
01:21:07,800 --> 01:21:09,840
hierarchy in a food chain that's one

1775
01:21:09,840 --> 01:21:11,219
thing that happens in addition to that

1776
01:21:11,219 --> 01:21:13,020
you've also got a lot of family peer

1777
01:21:13,020 --> 01:21:14,760
pressure that happens too

1778
01:21:14,760 --> 01:21:16,199
um well my guys I actively work with

1779
01:21:16,199 --> 01:21:18,120
over in Nigeria called me in tears

1780
01:21:18,120 --> 01:21:20,520
saying that his van and he was suicidal

1781
01:21:20,520 --> 01:21:23,040
because his his family had said that you

1782
01:21:23,040 --> 01:21:24,360
need to go ahead and go be a scammer you

1783
01:21:24,360 --> 01:21:25,560
need to go make more money and you need

1784
01:21:25,560 --> 01:21:27,480
to provide more for the family yet he

1785
01:21:27,480 --> 01:21:28,980
was one of our Intel sources who was

1786
01:21:28,980 --> 01:21:31,560
passing so much information over and the

1787
01:21:31,560 --> 01:21:33,719
amount of money that this individual had

1788
01:21:33,719 --> 01:21:36,000
actually saved the United States I can't

1789
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:37,440
put a dollar amount High because again

1790
01:21:37,440 --> 01:21:39,120
that's how much this individual has

1791
01:21:39,120 --> 01:21:40,440
helped

1792
01:21:40,440 --> 01:21:42,659
um but again he was distraught because

1793
01:21:42,659 --> 01:21:44,219
he's like I know I'm doing the right

1794
01:21:44,219 --> 01:21:46,920
thing by helping but I'm getting the

1795
01:21:46,920 --> 01:21:48,239
pressure from my family in order to

1796
01:21:48,239 --> 01:21:49,739
succeed and again these are things that

1797
01:21:49,739 --> 01:21:51,600
most people don't realize here is again

1798
01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:53,100
this is a lot of what's actually driving

1799
01:21:53,100 --> 01:21:54,480
this

1800
01:21:54,480 --> 01:21:56,760
um and the deck and as I and one more

1801
01:21:56,760 --> 01:21:58,980
thing that the deck is actually a deck

1802
01:21:58,980 --> 01:22:00,900
the deck is stacked against those people

1803
01:22:00,900 --> 01:22:03,000
who are trying to be legitimate because

1804
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,880
what happens is the culturally it's very

1805
01:22:05,880 --> 01:22:08,520
accepted to go ahead and accept Rives in

1806
01:22:08,520 --> 01:22:10,860
addition to that you also have an entire

1807
01:22:10,860 --> 01:22:12,780
subculture who will go and make

1808
01:22:12,780 --> 01:22:15,060
different rap videos talking about how

1809
01:22:15,060 --> 01:22:17,520
they stole all this money how

1810
01:22:17,520 --> 01:22:19,860
um It's Great To Go sing about the Yahoo

1811
01:22:19,860 --> 01:22:21,960
boys and as isn't something that just

1812
01:22:21,960 --> 01:22:24,000
came up yesterday this culture has been

1813
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,820
there for excuse me there's uh the

1814
01:22:26,820 --> 01:22:28,620
cantaloupe um this culture has been

1815
01:22:28,620 --> 01:22:31,260
there for decades and what happens is is

1816
01:22:31,260 --> 01:22:33,659
you now have these individuals who are

1817
01:22:33,659 --> 01:22:35,040
saying that hey we made all this money

1818
01:22:35,040 --> 01:22:36,719
by scamming people by scamming the

1819
01:22:36,719 --> 01:22:38,219
whites as they say

1820
01:22:38,219 --> 01:22:39,840
um their words not mine

1821
01:22:39,840 --> 01:22:42,360
um and again it becomes a horrible role

1822
01:22:42,360 --> 01:22:43,860
model for a lot of the youth out there

1823
01:22:43,860 --> 01:22:45,900
and again when they go and make these

1824
01:22:45,900 --> 01:22:47,820
videos is it them trying to cope is it

1825
01:22:47,820 --> 01:22:49,260
them trying to brag or is it something

1826
01:22:49,260 --> 01:22:54,300
else but in the same breath life is

1827
01:22:54,300 --> 01:22:57,540
extremely complex in Nigeria culturally

1828
01:22:57,540 --> 01:22:59,580
you have a lot of harm that has happened

1829
01:22:59,580 --> 01:23:03,120
over the last 100 years you have cases

1830
01:23:03,120 --> 01:23:04,800
where oil companies have gone in there

1831
01:23:04,800 --> 01:23:07,500
to try and go take oil from the tribes

1832
01:23:07,500 --> 01:23:09,659
and provide money back to them but it

1833
01:23:09,659 --> 01:23:11,400
hasn't been a completely clean method

1834
01:23:11,400 --> 01:23:13,440
for why they do that so you now have

1835
01:23:13,440 --> 01:23:15,420
land that is being destroyed you have a

1836
01:23:15,420 --> 01:23:17,520
lot of cases where the people who had

1837
01:23:17,520 --> 01:23:19,620
spent thousands of years and have tens

1838
01:23:19,620 --> 01:23:22,560
of generations there aren't able to live

1839
01:23:22,560 --> 01:23:25,140
because the land got destroyed in

1840
01:23:25,140 --> 01:23:26,460
addition to that and again that's just

1841
01:23:26,460 --> 01:23:28,260
one such example you also have a law of

1842
01:23:28,260 --> 01:23:30,659
corruption in reshipping and building

1843
01:23:30,659 --> 01:23:32,460
and if you want to go and be president

1844
01:23:32,460 --> 01:23:35,219
in Nigeria you can go and do a military

1845
01:23:35,219 --> 01:23:37,199
coup and if you look at the history of

1846
01:23:37,199 --> 01:23:40,440
Nigeria a lot of the way that many of

1847
01:23:40,440 --> 01:23:42,300
the rulers have come to power again it's

1848
01:23:42,300 --> 01:23:44,100
a case where you've had military coups

1849
01:23:44,100 --> 01:23:45,540
that have overthrown the previous

1850
01:23:45,540 --> 01:23:48,300
governments you also have cases of Boko

1851
01:23:48,300 --> 01:23:50,699
Haram who will do different things again

1852
01:23:50,699 --> 01:23:52,560
to try and go and steal a lot of things

1853
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:54,900
in order to kind of use the people who

1854
01:23:54,900 --> 01:23:56,880
are local there and again black acts is

1855
01:23:56,880 --> 01:23:58,620
one of the conf fraternities there but

1856
01:23:58,620 --> 01:24:00,120
there are dozens of Cults there are

1857
01:24:00,120 --> 01:24:02,040
dozens of confraternities out there that

1858
01:24:02,040 --> 01:24:03,600
are doing the exact same thing that we

1859
01:24:03,600 --> 01:24:05,699
are barely even that we barely even know

1860
01:24:05,699 --> 01:24:07,920
who they are let alone actively tracking

1861
01:24:07,920 --> 01:24:10,500
them and at the end of the day people

1862
01:24:10,500 --> 01:24:12,540
just want to live and people just want

1863
01:24:12,540 --> 01:24:14,640
to survive and when you look at the

1864
01:24:14,640 --> 01:24:16,080
unemployment rates and when you look at

1865
01:24:16,080 --> 01:24:18,060
the amount of people who and losses that

1866
01:24:18,060 --> 01:24:20,159
are out there a lot of this is actually

1867
01:24:20,159 --> 01:24:21,920
just starving people trying to survive

1868
01:24:21,920 --> 01:24:25,020
unemployment is over 50 in Nigeria right

1869
01:24:25,020 --> 01:24:28,020
now that's where ages between 15 and 35.

1870
01:24:28,020 --> 01:24:30,600
there is no unemployment funds to go and

1871
01:24:30,600 --> 01:24:32,520
try and take care of yourself and again

1872
01:24:32,520 --> 01:24:35,159
at the end of the day you're now looking

1873
01:24:35,159 --> 01:24:37,320
at human at core human issues right now

1874
01:24:37,320 --> 01:24:39,360
where again humans just want to survive

1875
01:24:39,360 --> 01:24:41,040
we just want to provide for our families

1876
01:24:41,040 --> 01:24:43,260
so again with bribery being publicly

1877
01:24:43,260 --> 01:24:44,820
acceptable and they're peer apparently

1878
01:24:44,820 --> 01:24:46,080
and there being a good level of peer

1879
01:24:46,080 --> 01:24:48,600
pressure here the reality of the BEC

1880
01:24:48,600 --> 01:24:50,040
situation right now when it comes to

1881
01:24:50,040 --> 01:24:52,500
tracking these actors in Nigeria many of

1882
01:24:52,500 --> 01:24:54,120
them are trying to are choosing between

1883
01:24:54,120 --> 01:24:57,239
do I steal to eat or do I die and like I

1884
01:24:57,239 --> 01:24:58,739
have people I also Support over there

1885
01:24:58,739 --> 01:25:00,719
who are not scammers I help give a

1886
01:25:00,719 --> 01:25:01,920
hundred dollars per month to help

1887
01:25:01,920 --> 01:25:04,679
support them and again it's issues like

1888
01:25:04,679 --> 01:25:06,840
that where not only are you going to get

1889
01:25:06,840 --> 01:25:08,699
these moral things where okay I don't

1890
01:25:08,699 --> 01:25:11,100
want to be a scammer it's like you're

1891
01:25:11,100 --> 01:25:13,320
not able to live if you aren't a scammer

1892
01:25:13,320 --> 01:25:15,060
over there so we really need to start

1893
01:25:15,060 --> 01:25:15,960
thinking about what type of

1894
01:25:15,960 --> 01:25:17,280
opportunities we can start developing

1895
01:25:17,280 --> 01:25:19,800
over there in order to do some of that

1896
01:25:19,800 --> 01:25:21,780
um in addition to that we've got other

1897
01:25:21,780 --> 01:25:24,600
cases that are popping up out in

1898
01:25:24,600 --> 01:25:26,699
um out in Asia another type of romance

1899
01:25:26,699 --> 01:25:28,800
scam is called Pig butchering and for

1900
01:25:28,800 --> 01:25:30,360
those who are uninitiated to those it's

1901
01:25:30,360 --> 01:25:32,760
a flavor of crypto and investment scams

1902
01:25:32,760 --> 01:25:36,300
that are mixed with romance scams and

1903
01:25:36,300 --> 01:25:38,100
what happens with those is again they'll

1904
01:25:38,100 --> 01:25:39,540
social engineer the victims in order to

1905
01:25:39,540 --> 01:25:40,980
kind of go and take the money from there

1906
01:25:40,980 --> 01:25:43,500
again this is another human core area

1907
01:25:43,500 --> 01:25:44,760
here that we need to address because

1908
01:25:44,760 --> 01:25:47,340
again we have BEC with the romance scams

1909
01:25:47,340 --> 01:25:49,020
that happen there and we now have the

1910
01:25:49,020 --> 01:25:50,340
second one that's only popped up on our

1911
01:25:50,340 --> 01:25:51,659
Radars here in the states within the

1912
01:25:51,659 --> 01:25:53,940
last two years unfortunate the people

1913
01:25:53,940 --> 01:25:55,920
who are running that are not horrible

1914
01:25:55,920 --> 01:25:58,139
scammers they are human trafficking

1915
01:25:58,139 --> 01:26:01,199
victims who are being abused by Chinese

1916
01:26:01,199 --> 01:26:03,060
Nationals and by Chinese organized crime

1917
01:26:03,060 --> 01:26:04,980
in order to go and facilitate the fraud

1918
01:26:04,980 --> 01:26:06,780
so you now have people who are being

1919
01:26:06,780 --> 01:26:09,540
abused abusing romance victims over here

1920
01:26:09,540 --> 01:26:11,400
in countries that we can barely even

1921
01:26:11,400 --> 01:26:13,080
touch and again that's another element

1922
01:26:13,080 --> 01:26:14,639
that we have to that we will have to

1923
01:26:14,639 --> 01:26:16,800
start addressing here shortly again

1924
01:26:16,800 --> 01:26:18,719
that's something where these are all

1925
01:26:18,719 --> 01:26:20,460
core human issues that again we don't

1926
01:26:20,460 --> 01:26:22,080
realize as they are

1927
01:26:22,080 --> 01:26:23,760
so the very first step when it comes to

1928
01:26:23,760 --> 01:26:25,800
tracking business email compromise is

1929
01:26:25,800 --> 01:26:27,179
actually start addressing it and start

1930
01:26:27,179 --> 01:26:28,980
acknowledging it that yes it is the

1931
01:26:28,980 --> 01:26:30,960
number one crime yes we do need to start

1932
01:26:30,960 --> 01:26:32,280
rethinking these things and while

1933
01:26:32,280 --> 01:26:34,380
reversing a piece of malware is sexy and

1934
01:26:34,380 --> 01:26:36,960
fun doesn't actually push the needle to

1935
01:26:36,960 --> 01:26:39,480
start addressing the larger issues here

1936
01:26:39,480 --> 01:26:41,699
um from a security gotcha Bec is very

1937
01:26:41,699 --> 01:26:44,340
hard to detect there are no malicious

1938
01:26:44,340 --> 01:26:46,380
email there is no malware associated

1939
01:26:46,380 --> 01:26:49,020
with it there are no malicious links so

1940
01:26:49,020 --> 01:26:51,060
again in addition to that losses are not

1941
01:26:51,060 --> 01:26:53,040
reported because of the shame that goes

1942
01:26:53,040 --> 01:26:54,420
along with it with a or when

1943
01:26:54,420 --> 01:26:56,159
organization go and Report

1944
01:26:56,159 --> 01:26:58,380
eight thousand dollars of fraud that

1945
01:26:58,380 --> 01:27:01,440
someone wouldn't um sent money over or

1946
01:27:01,440 --> 01:27:03,000
are they going to go ahead and keep that

1947
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:05,100
quiet to themselves because it's

1948
01:27:05,100 --> 01:27:06,000
something where they don't want to deal

1949
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:07,380
with the loss of reputation I want to

1950
01:27:07,380 --> 01:27:09,000
deal with a loss of revenues there so

1951
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:10,260
again a lot of this becomes a business

1952
01:27:10,260 --> 01:27:12,179
decision of okay

1953
01:27:12,179 --> 01:27:13,440
let's just brush this one under the

1954
01:27:13,440 --> 01:27:15,600
radar and not say anything about it

1955
01:27:15,600 --> 01:27:17,639
um many banks will go and write a lot of

1956
01:27:17,639 --> 01:27:19,440
this stuff off and kind of say hey this

1957
01:27:19,440 --> 01:27:20,940
is something where this this didn't

1958
01:27:20,940 --> 01:27:22,560
really happen again when it comes to

1959
01:27:22,560 --> 01:27:24,300
working with these crimes the person who

1960
01:27:24,300 --> 01:27:25,860
sees it and reports is not the only

1961
01:27:25,860 --> 01:27:27,120
victim here

1962
01:27:27,120 --> 01:27:28,440
um and the reason is these scammers are

1963
01:27:28,440 --> 01:27:30,719
going hit 50 different accounts from the

1964
01:27:30,719 --> 01:27:32,100
same email account so when you go and

1965
01:27:32,100 --> 01:27:33,480
report that one bank account when you

1966
01:27:33,480 --> 01:27:35,460
get that one bank account shut down you

1967
01:27:35,460 --> 01:27:36,960
just saved 50 other people who were in

1968
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:38,280
The scam that you didn't actually see

1969
01:27:38,280 --> 01:27:40,199
again when it comes to reporting the

1970
01:27:40,199 --> 01:27:43,260
fraud report up to ic3 they're one of

1971
01:27:43,260 --> 01:27:44,580
the ones who actually tracks a lot of

1972
01:27:44,580 --> 01:27:46,020
these metrics they report a lot of the

1973
01:27:46,020 --> 01:27:48,300
stuff and I've got my own thoughts and I

1974
01:27:48,300 --> 01:27:49,980
really wish ic3 would be able to do

1975
01:27:49,980 --> 01:27:51,600
better on some of this stuff but again

1976
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:53,280
they're the one who's actually tracking

1977
01:27:53,280 --> 01:27:54,420
a lot of this stuff right now and they

1978
01:27:54,420 --> 01:27:55,739
are the ones who actually holds a lot of

1979
01:27:55,739 --> 01:27:58,080
that data when it comes to education

1980
01:27:58,080 --> 01:28:00,600
education is the best defense how many

1981
01:28:00,600 --> 01:28:02,460
people here can raise their hand and say

1982
01:28:02,460 --> 01:28:05,460
I want to hire a stupid employee

1983
01:28:05,460 --> 01:28:07,920
absolutely none of you but in the same

1984
01:28:07,920 --> 01:28:09,900
time you now know that you didn't hire a

1985
01:28:09,900 --> 01:28:11,520
stupid employee so why are you calling

1986
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:12,659
that employee stupid because they

1987
01:28:12,659 --> 01:28:14,460
clicked a link why are you calling that

1988
01:28:14,460 --> 01:28:15,900
employee stupid because they didn't

1989
01:28:15,900 --> 01:28:17,280
because they clicked a piece of malware

1990
01:28:17,280 --> 01:28:20,940
is it on them for clicking that malware

1991
01:28:20,940 --> 01:28:24,239
or is it on us for not articulating what

1992
01:28:24,239 --> 01:28:26,280
needs to happen in a language that they

1993
01:28:26,280 --> 01:28:28,679
understand is it on us that we need to

1994
01:28:28,679 --> 01:28:30,000
go ahead and start putting it into a

1995
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:31,980
perspective that they actually get

1996
01:28:31,980 --> 01:28:33,120
um again that's one of the big problems

1997
01:28:33,120 --> 01:28:34,620
here when it comes to information

1998
01:28:34,620 --> 01:28:36,000
security when it comes to tracking this

1999
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:36,960
up is we need to kind of start

2000
01:28:36,960 --> 01:28:39,120
understanding a lot of that

2001
01:28:39,120 --> 01:28:41,219
again actors are chasing money here in

2002
01:28:41,219 --> 01:28:42,420
order to try and understand a lot of the

2003
01:28:42,420 --> 01:28:43,920
way this stuff works

2004
01:28:43,920 --> 01:28:46,260
um again your actors and your your sorry

2005
01:28:46,260 --> 01:28:48,360
your employees are extremely smart so

2006
01:28:48,360 --> 01:28:49,739
when it comes to actually training your

2007
01:28:49,739 --> 01:28:51,179
users and when it comes to actually

2008
01:28:51,179 --> 01:28:53,219
educating them they get really really

2009
01:28:53,219 --> 01:28:55,260
good at spawning phishing emails and

2010
01:28:55,260 --> 01:28:56,699
sure you're going to have cases where

2011
01:28:56,699 --> 01:28:58,139
they're going to send you that other

2012
01:28:58,139 --> 01:29:00,060
link from Target where it was a Spam

2013
01:29:00,060 --> 01:29:02,100
campaign or absolutely unrelated but

2014
01:29:02,100 --> 01:29:03,900
you've also got that case where your

2015
01:29:03,900 --> 01:29:05,219
employees aren't going to find that

2016
01:29:05,219 --> 01:29:07,620
really weird needle in the haystack when

2017
01:29:07,620 --> 01:29:10,080
it comes to a lot of this stuff and what

2018
01:29:10,080 --> 01:29:12,300
studying BEC for the last seven years

2019
01:29:12,300 --> 01:29:14,820
has actually taught me um in addition to

2020
01:29:14,820 --> 01:29:16,440
that actually digging into mindfulness

2021
01:29:16,440 --> 01:29:18,659
breath work psychology all of these

2022
01:29:18,659 --> 01:29:21,120
other things the human body does not

2023
01:29:21,120 --> 01:29:23,040
like stress the human body does not like

2024
01:29:23,040 --> 01:29:25,440
being in a perspective where it's a

2025
01:29:25,440 --> 01:29:27,480
where you're actually stuck in a state

2026
01:29:27,480 --> 01:29:29,400
where you don't know how to operate like

2027
01:29:29,400 --> 01:29:30,840
I showed you guys with the breath work I

2028
01:29:30,840 --> 01:29:32,520
was able to walk you guys and completely

2029
01:29:32,520 --> 01:29:34,260
rewire your nervous system in two

2030
01:29:34,260 --> 01:29:36,300
minutes remotely standing up here on

2031
01:29:36,300 --> 01:29:38,639
stage I successfully hacked every single

2032
01:29:38,639 --> 01:29:41,159
person who raise their hand a biohacker

2033
01:29:41,159 --> 01:29:43,080
yeah I successfully hacked the nervous

2034
01:29:43,080 --> 01:29:45,239
system of every single person here and

2035
01:29:45,239 --> 01:29:46,620
it's something where a lot of the reason

2036
01:29:46,620 --> 01:29:48,440
for that is because we don't understand

2037
01:29:48,440 --> 01:29:51,000
how far our Consciousness and our brains

2038
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:52,920
and our bodies actually work and when

2039
01:29:52,920 --> 01:29:54,360
you start accounting for that and when

2040
01:29:54,360 --> 01:29:56,400
you start accounting for and thinking of

2041
01:29:56,400 --> 01:29:57,840
things in that perspective there's a

2042
01:29:57,840 --> 01:29:59,040
whole lot of other things that fall into

2043
01:29:59,040 --> 01:30:01,560
place here so I would encourage

2044
01:30:01,560 --> 01:30:02,940
everybody if you don't do breath work if

2045
01:30:02,940 --> 01:30:04,440
you don't do mindfulness or meditation

2046
01:30:04,440 --> 01:30:06,780
please start doing it you will rewire

2047
01:30:06,780 --> 01:30:08,580
more things that you even realize were

2048
01:30:08,580 --> 01:30:10,199
there and in addition to that you'll

2049
01:30:10,199 --> 01:30:11,520
start unpacking your own trauma which

2050
01:30:11,520 --> 01:30:13,500
sucks but you learn a whole lot more

2051
01:30:13,500 --> 01:30:15,480
about yourself but I hear some people

2052
01:30:15,480 --> 01:30:16,860
laughing so yeah you all know exactly

2053
01:30:16,860 --> 01:30:18,360
what that one's about

2054
01:30:18,360 --> 01:30:20,340
um but again a lot of these nervous

2055
01:30:20,340 --> 01:30:22,560
systems hacks they're thousands of years

2056
01:30:22,560 --> 01:30:25,080
old we are not trusting the knowledge

2057
01:30:25,080 --> 01:30:27,060
from people who have been humans before

2058
01:30:27,060 --> 01:30:28,679
and that's the problem is you need to

2059
01:30:28,679 --> 01:30:31,320
trust our fellow humans who all who go

2060
01:30:31,320 --> 01:30:32,699
and do a lot of other things too again

2061
01:30:32,699 --> 01:30:35,159
people were stressed thousands of years

2062
01:30:35,159 --> 01:30:37,139
ago and people are stressed now and

2063
01:30:37,139 --> 01:30:38,520
there's ways to calm our nervous system

2064
01:30:38,520 --> 01:30:40,080
down where we don't need medicine to do

2065
01:30:40,080 --> 01:30:42,060
that take advantage of that we don't

2066
01:30:42,060 --> 01:30:44,040
necess there are times where you may

2067
01:30:44,040 --> 01:30:45,239
need medicine to do it but there's times

2068
01:30:45,239 --> 01:30:46,560
where you can take care of some of that

2069
01:30:46,560 --> 01:30:48,300
yourself so learn what you can actually

2070
01:30:48,300 --> 01:30:51,420
do and in conclusion Bec is massive and

2071
01:30:51,420 --> 01:30:53,280
absolutely touches everything we need to

2072
01:30:53,280 --> 01:30:55,320
share collaborate actually start working

2073
01:30:55,320 --> 01:30:56,400
on some of this stuff you need to

2074
01:30:56,400 --> 01:30:58,800
educate your employees and damn it be

2075
01:30:58,800 --> 01:31:00,480
kind and compassionate because it's

2076
01:31:00,480 --> 01:31:02,100
absolute horrible with how this stuff

2077
01:31:02,100 --> 01:31:04,760
works that's my presentation

2078
01:31:04,760 --> 01:31:11,040
[Applause]

2079
01:31:11,040 --> 01:31:14,120
so any questions

2080
01:31:14,340 --> 01:31:17,960
right here okay

2081
01:31:19,080 --> 01:31:22,139
so um you know if all the scams going on

2082
01:31:22,139 --> 01:31:24,659
I've seen a lot of like scam baiting

2083
01:31:24,659 --> 01:31:26,880
going on online I'm not sure if you

2084
01:31:26,880 --> 01:31:28,020
thought that was like a worthwell

2085
01:31:28,020 --> 01:31:30,239
Pursuit yeah people do it for different

2086
01:31:30,239 --> 01:31:32,460
reasons but if you think it is worth it

2087
01:31:32,460 --> 01:31:34,800
do you have any like recommendations any

2088
01:31:34,800 --> 01:31:36,540
suggestions as to how to pursue that

2089
01:31:36,540 --> 01:31:38,639
yeah so when it comes to scam baiting

2090
01:31:38,639 --> 01:31:39,840
I'll Define that quickly for everybody

2091
01:31:39,840 --> 01:31:42,239
so there are people who will go and

2092
01:31:42,239 --> 01:31:44,159
actively engage with scammers to try and

2093
01:31:44,159 --> 01:31:46,739
troll them and waste their time

2094
01:31:46,739 --> 01:31:49,320
um my personal view on that as someone

2095
01:31:49,320 --> 01:31:50,940
who's been baiting scammers for 12 years

2096
01:31:50,940 --> 01:31:54,239
absolutely love the idea the problem is

2097
01:31:54,239 --> 01:31:55,800
a lot of the people who are doing it

2098
01:31:55,800 --> 01:31:57,480
will do it just to piss that other

2099
01:31:57,480 --> 01:32:00,960
person off and it's a fine line to make

2100
01:32:00,960 --> 01:32:02,280
it to where you're actually pissing the

2101
01:32:02,280 --> 01:32:04,500
person off because again you also have

2102
01:32:04,500 --> 01:32:05,820
to account that many of these people

2103
01:32:05,820 --> 01:32:07,260
even for the Indian tech support

2104
01:32:07,260 --> 01:32:09,300
scammers many of them are held against

2105
01:32:09,300 --> 01:32:10,920
their will many of them are getting

2106
01:32:10,920 --> 01:32:12,480
their asses beaten because they weren't

2107
01:32:12,480 --> 01:32:14,699
able to get this money so when you were

2108
01:32:14,699 --> 01:32:16,260
doing that that is something that you

2109
01:32:16,260 --> 01:32:18,239
have to keep in mind and consider if

2110
01:32:18,239 --> 01:32:19,440
you're interested in getting into scam

2111
01:32:19,440 --> 01:32:20,400
being there are multiple different

2112
01:32:20,400 --> 01:32:22,800
angles Bec is one of the easier ones

2113
01:32:22,800 --> 01:32:25,320
simply modify your headers respond back

2114
01:32:25,320 --> 01:32:27,960
to the scammers from a Gmail account or

2115
01:32:27,960 --> 01:32:29,340
another email account make it look like

2116
01:32:29,340 --> 01:32:31,260
it was you they will they'll respond

2117
01:32:31,260 --> 01:32:33,780
back most of the time roughly 60 to 70

2118
01:32:33,780 --> 01:32:34,679
percent

2119
01:32:34,679 --> 01:32:37,440
um engagement metrics so

2120
01:32:37,440 --> 01:32:39,420
um not that yeah we've tracked that

2121
01:32:39,420 --> 01:32:40,560
um if you're looking to do the tech

2122
01:32:40,560 --> 01:32:42,060
support scams

2123
01:32:42,060 --> 01:32:43,440
um

2124
01:32:43,440 --> 01:32:45,300
you can probably pull a lot of stuff

2125
01:32:45,300 --> 01:32:46,679
from virus total or like a lot of other

2126
01:32:46,679 --> 01:32:48,300
data Feeds out there where it's like the

2127
01:32:48,300 --> 01:32:49,800
tech support scam so start identifying

2128
01:32:49,800 --> 01:32:50,880
the phone numbers

2129
01:32:50,880 --> 01:32:52,139
um I know there's a lot of baiters out

2130
01:32:52,139 --> 01:32:53,639
there who will share some of that

2131
01:32:53,639 --> 01:32:55,440
information so there's different angles

2132
01:32:55,440 --> 01:32:57,719
to do that from but again know your

2133
01:32:57,719 --> 01:32:59,639
goals know what you're looking for

2134
01:32:59,639 --> 01:33:00,719
um for some of the folks who have done

2135
01:33:00,719 --> 01:33:03,120
this on the BEC side a lot of the intent

2136
01:33:03,120 --> 01:33:04,920
is to try and milk bank accounts out of

2137
01:33:04,920 --> 01:33:05,880
them

2138
01:33:05,880 --> 01:33:08,280
um my personal record was 36 bank

2139
01:33:08,280 --> 01:33:10,380
accounts I got out of somebody at the

2140
01:33:10,380 --> 01:33:13,139
time the one record was like 42 but I

2141
01:33:13,139 --> 01:33:14,460
got to talk to somebody who had milked

2142
01:33:14,460 --> 01:33:15,960
over 200 accounts out of one of the

2143
01:33:15,960 --> 01:33:17,280
blogs so

2144
01:33:17,280 --> 01:33:18,840
yeah again it depends on what you're

2145
01:33:18,840 --> 01:33:20,280
trying to do what your intent is what

2146
01:33:20,280 --> 01:33:23,159
you're trying to burn and stuff so

2147
01:33:23,159 --> 01:33:25,800
hi I have a question about

2148
01:33:25,800 --> 01:33:27,840
um just in general like United in the

2149
01:33:27,840 --> 01:33:29,580
United States uh business email

2150
01:33:29,580 --> 01:33:31,440
compromise have you seen any threat

2151
01:33:31,440 --> 01:33:33,239
actors or

2152
01:33:33,239 --> 01:33:34,920
um specific indicators or compromise

2153
01:33:34,920 --> 01:33:38,659
that they use to send those emails or

2154
01:33:38,659 --> 01:33:40,340
malicious

2155
01:33:40,340 --> 01:33:43,920
payload in those emails to companies or

2156
01:33:43,920 --> 01:33:46,500
just in general to people so for the

2157
01:33:46,500 --> 01:33:49,920
most part Bec is a malwareless attack

2158
01:33:49,920 --> 01:33:51,480
like you usually don't see it because

2159
01:33:51,480 --> 01:33:53,820
again at the end of the day the main

2160
01:33:53,820 --> 01:33:57,239
intent is to try and defraud somebody

2161
01:33:57,239 --> 01:33:58,920
um there are documented cases where

2162
01:33:58,920 --> 01:34:01,500
malware has been included

2163
01:34:01,500 --> 01:34:03,900
um quack bot and

2164
01:34:03,900 --> 01:34:05,699
um

2165
01:34:05,699 --> 01:34:08,219
there's another one uh agent Tesla or

2166
01:34:08,219 --> 01:34:09,900
two are two examples that we have seen

2167
01:34:09,900 --> 01:34:12,840
tied back to BEC actors and everything

2168
01:34:12,840 --> 01:34:14,520
um for the most part like I said that

2169
01:34:14,520 --> 01:34:16,620
that is one thing that we've observed um

2170
01:34:16,620 --> 01:34:18,540
we've also seen cases where it's not

2171
01:34:18,540 --> 01:34:20,880
just Nigerians doing BEC um we actually

2172
01:34:20,880 --> 01:34:22,199
had one group that was actually located

2173
01:34:22,199 --> 01:34:23,460
in Russia

2174
01:34:23,460 --> 01:34:25,320
um that was actually doing BEC and it

2175
01:34:25,320 --> 01:34:26,820
was way more sophisticated than what we

2176
01:34:26,820 --> 01:34:28,679
were seeing and that was um that was a

2177
01:34:28,679 --> 01:34:30,239
group that we called Cosmic links so if

2178
01:34:30,239 --> 01:34:31,080
anybody ever wants to look at that

2179
01:34:31,080 --> 01:34:32,460
that's the group we publish them under

2180
01:34:32,460 --> 01:34:34,380
so

2181
01:34:34,380 --> 01:34:37,620
uh you mentioned BC being part of uh

2182
01:34:37,620 --> 01:34:39,840
money laundering could you expand what

2183
01:34:39,840 --> 01:34:41,820
which threat actor groups or give some

2184
01:34:41,820 --> 01:34:43,920
more information on that so which threat

2185
01:34:43,920 --> 01:34:45,239
actor groups are doing the Monday money

2186
01:34:45,239 --> 01:34:46,679
laundering and the answer is yes for

2187
01:34:46,679 --> 01:34:50,340
example yeah yeah so um so the so we so

2188
01:34:50,340 --> 01:34:52,980
in virtually every BEC case when it

2189
01:34:52,980 --> 01:34:54,719
comes to trying to get the money

2190
01:34:54,719 --> 01:34:57,239
laundered out and wired you will have

2191
01:34:57,239 --> 01:34:58,860
that money that will be sent to a

2192
01:34:58,860 --> 01:35:00,480
romance victim again when that you have

2193
01:35:00,480 --> 01:35:02,400
that first hop in that bank account that

2194
01:35:02,400 --> 01:35:04,980
will then go to your victim your V your

2195
01:35:04,980 --> 01:35:06,480
scammer on the back end will then tell

2196
01:35:06,480 --> 01:35:08,040
the victim hey why are this one either

2197
01:35:08,040 --> 01:35:10,020
wire this money over to this account or

2198
01:35:10,020 --> 01:35:12,179
do something else with that

2199
01:35:12,179 --> 01:35:13,500
um once it starts hitting those Money

2200
01:35:13,500 --> 01:35:14,760
muelling Networks some of them are

2201
01:35:14,760 --> 01:35:16,800
actually called hawala networks

2202
01:35:16,800 --> 01:35:19,380
um they will go and do have multiple

2203
01:35:19,380 --> 01:35:21,480
hops outside through those that bank

2204
01:35:21,480 --> 01:35:23,400
chain in order to get the money wired

2205
01:35:23,400 --> 01:35:24,360
out

2206
01:35:24,360 --> 01:35:26,040
um in some cases we've seen upwards of

2207
01:35:26,040 --> 01:35:27,960
like seven to ten hops before it finally

2208
01:35:27,960 --> 01:35:29,880
gets back to the scammers and a lot of

2209
01:35:29,880 --> 01:35:31,139
times it will be a couple times here

2210
01:35:31,139 --> 01:35:33,420
into the U.S then it will hit something

2211
01:35:33,420 --> 01:35:35,460
like a larger

2212
01:35:35,460 --> 01:35:38,100
um like a business bank account and will

2213
01:35:38,100 --> 01:35:41,400
usually go overseas specific with black

2214
01:35:41,400 --> 01:35:43,260
ax one of the things that we see with

2215
01:35:43,260 --> 01:35:46,679
them is they do a lot of international

2216
01:35:46,679 --> 01:35:49,860
and Logistics looking companies and

2217
01:35:49,860 --> 01:35:51,120
they'll make those shell companies

2218
01:35:51,120 --> 01:35:53,639
actually look real but when you and on

2219
01:35:53,639 --> 01:35:56,219
paper it might look fine but once those

2220
01:35:56,219 --> 01:35:59,460
larger funds of like your 200 2 million

2221
01:35:59,460 --> 01:36:02,400
200 000 2 million dollar wires those

2222
01:36:02,400 --> 01:36:03,719
will actually go out and they'll hit

2223
01:36:03,719 --> 01:36:06,600
places overseas a lot of times money

2224
01:36:06,600 --> 01:36:08,580
ends up out in China and then ends up

2225
01:36:08,580 --> 01:36:11,040
coming back over towards Nigeria from

2226
01:36:11,040 --> 01:36:12,239
what I've heard some of that ends up

2227
01:36:12,239 --> 01:36:14,159
hitting can hit Germany but again it's

2228
01:36:14,159 --> 01:36:16,139
usually like United States we've seen

2229
01:36:16,139 --> 01:36:18,480
cases I've seen money watered in Mexico

2230
01:36:18,480 --> 01:36:22,260
Canada Brazil it really really varies

2231
01:36:22,260 --> 01:36:24,659
just what the actors have set up what

2232
01:36:24,659 --> 01:36:26,159
they have that is actually trusted and

2233
01:36:26,159 --> 01:36:27,300
works in order to kind of wire that

2234
01:36:27,300 --> 01:36:29,880
money out so

2235
01:36:29,880 --> 01:36:31,620
yep

2236
01:36:31,620 --> 01:36:34,560
um if there's no malware in the emails

2237
01:36:34,560 --> 01:36:37,139
or anything like that how do you track

2238
01:36:37,139 --> 01:36:40,679
I so how do you know so when it comes to

2239
01:36:40,679 --> 01:36:42,659
BEC the scammers were trying to tell a

2240
01:36:42,659 --> 01:36:44,760
story they're trying to tell a story

2241
01:36:44,760 --> 01:36:47,639
that I need you to wire money for me I

2242
01:36:47,639 --> 01:36:50,699
need you to go and pick up this gift

2243
01:36:50,699 --> 01:36:52,739
card I need to go do this thing

2244
01:36:52,739 --> 01:36:54,179
um a lot of the times there's only like

2245
01:36:54,179 --> 01:36:56,699
a dozen or so stories they will tell so

2246
01:36:56,699 --> 01:36:58,199
it's a matter of

2247
01:36:58,199 --> 01:37:01,139
using signatures and content to identify

2248
01:37:01,139 --> 01:37:02,639
that story that they're trying to tell

2249
01:37:02,639 --> 01:37:05,780
in order to go far from there

2250
01:37:05,940 --> 01:37:08,340
how how is this not seen as just a

2251
01:37:08,340 --> 01:37:09,840
complete failure on the part of the

2252
01:37:09,840 --> 01:37:11,159
banking industry like where's where's

2253
01:37:11,159 --> 01:37:12,600
the banking hacking conference where

2254
01:37:12,600 --> 01:37:14,040
there's a guy like you who works in a

2255
01:37:14,040 --> 01:37:16,260
bank standing up saying hey we have this

2256
01:37:16,260 --> 01:37:18,120
problem this is what we need to do about

2257
01:37:18,120 --> 01:37:19,920
it because I've been looking at this for

2258
01:37:19,920 --> 01:37:21,060
the last eight odd years and I haven't

2259
01:37:21,060 --> 01:37:22,860
seen a single [ __ ] bank do a thing

2260
01:37:22,860 --> 01:37:25,020
ever because I wrote the problem because

2261
01:37:25,020 --> 01:37:26,520
I run that conference on the TLP red

2262
01:37:26,520 --> 01:37:28,739
level and we ran like four of them and

2263
01:37:28,739 --> 01:37:31,020
covet happened I haven't run another one

2264
01:37:31,020 --> 01:37:33,480
um so are there are there individuals in

2265
01:37:33,480 --> 01:37:34,920
the banking yes Suite that actually have

2266
01:37:34,920 --> 01:37:36,719
it together yes

2267
01:37:36,719 --> 01:37:39,060
um the I will say this just because I am

2268
01:37:39,060 --> 01:37:41,219
not a voice for the banks the banks are

2269
01:37:41,219 --> 01:37:42,659
very aware of what's happening and

2270
01:37:42,659 --> 01:37:44,219
they're doing everything they can to

2271
01:37:44,219 --> 01:37:45,840
understand this they're doing everything

2272
01:37:45,840 --> 01:37:48,060
they can to I see you shake your head

2273
01:37:48,060 --> 01:37:49,440
um many

2274
01:37:49,440 --> 01:37:51,919
yeah

2275
01:37:53,639 --> 01:37:54,840
yeah

2276
01:37:54,840 --> 01:37:58,500
it's a loaded question yeah

2277
01:37:58,500 --> 01:38:00,780
yeah the banks do a lot in order to help

2278
01:38:00,780 --> 01:38:02,580
mitigate a lot of this so um it's

2279
01:38:02,580 --> 01:38:04,380
something where it's a very it's a very

2280
01:38:04,380 --> 01:38:07,739
complex issue it's not a simple go don't

2281
01:38:07,739 --> 01:38:10,620
let Sally who has had a bank has had an

2282
01:38:10,620 --> 01:38:12,480
account for 10 years

2283
01:38:12,480 --> 01:38:14,400
um that one transfer that they made that

2284
01:38:14,400 --> 01:38:16,860
was fraud so it's it's a lot more

2285
01:38:16,860 --> 01:38:18,179
complex of an issue so like I said no

2286
01:38:18,179 --> 01:38:19,620
banks are very aware and they're they're

2287
01:38:19,620 --> 01:38:22,139
trying to do their best on this so that

2288
01:38:22,139 --> 01:38:24,360
answer as best as I could

2289
01:38:24,360 --> 01:38:27,380
the address of it

2290
01:38:29,100 --> 01:38:31,580
okay

2291
01:38:31,679 --> 01:38:33,360
Okay so

2292
01:38:33,360 --> 01:38:36,179
you probably watch Jim Browning and

2293
01:38:36,179 --> 01:38:38,100
stuff like you seem like the kind of guy

2294
01:38:38,100 --> 01:38:39,000
who'd be

2295
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:40,620
interested in this you also are very

2296
01:38:40,620 --> 01:38:42,239
knowledgeable I was actually very very

2297
01:38:42,239 --> 01:38:43,980
surprised to one see the Nigerian stuff

2298
01:38:43,980 --> 01:38:45,780
and like specifically relating it back

2299
01:38:45,780 --> 01:38:47,880
to the victims I'm not victims the the

2300
01:38:47,880 --> 01:38:49,320
attackers and like why they're doing

2301
01:38:49,320 --> 01:38:51,600
this so I'm kind of curious I've noticed

2302
01:38:51,600 --> 01:38:53,699
actually a theme it seems that a lot of

2303
01:38:53,699 --> 01:38:55,739
the Indian threat actors typically what

2304
01:38:55,739 --> 01:38:57,659
they'll do is they'll go into more text

2305
01:38:57,659 --> 01:39:01,320
uh tech support schemes but from what it

2306
01:39:01,320 --> 01:39:03,120
looks like from Nigerians a lot more of

2307
01:39:03,120 --> 01:39:06,239
it is more like you know the emails like

2308
01:39:06,239 --> 01:39:09,360
the I am a Nigerian Prime site is is

2309
01:39:09,360 --> 01:39:10,980
there a reason because I'm thinking if I

2310
01:39:10,980 --> 01:39:12,360
was a threat actor wouldn't it be a

2311
01:39:12,360 --> 01:39:15,120
better idea to perhaps diversify why are

2312
01:39:15,120 --> 01:39:16,560
we seeing these patterns in specific

2313
01:39:16,560 --> 01:39:19,139
countries doing very very specific scams

2314
01:39:19,139 --> 01:39:22,460
as opposed to you know diverse

2315
01:39:22,460 --> 01:39:24,719
diversifying your portfolio especially

2316
01:39:24,719 --> 01:39:26,840
because these are large large crime

2317
01:39:26,840 --> 01:39:28,980
organizations at some points like I know

2318
01:39:28,980 --> 01:39:30,300
with Jim Browning he was talking about

2319
01:39:30,300 --> 01:39:32,400
you know this is the CEO these are like

2320
01:39:32,400 --> 01:39:33,840
all the guys underneath them there's the

2321
01:39:33,840 --> 01:39:35,760
guys underneath them you said seven hops

2322
01:39:35,760 --> 01:39:38,900
already to a money eagle how

2323
01:39:38,900 --> 01:39:41,040
it's it's a real loaded question yeah

2324
01:39:41,040 --> 01:39:44,040
yeah the the simple answer is we're all

2325
01:39:44,040 --> 01:39:46,080
humans we're lazy and we take the path

2326
01:39:46,080 --> 01:39:48,540
of least resistance and if I can go and

2327
01:39:48,540 --> 01:39:50,159
send an email and have somebody wire me

2328
01:39:50,159 --> 01:39:52,199
money I'm gonna do that

2329
01:39:52,199 --> 01:39:53,520
um on the for the Indian tech support

2330
01:39:53,520 --> 01:39:55,080
scams they're like hey we can go make

2331
01:39:55,080 --> 01:39:56,940
these phone calls have people do it so

2332
01:39:56,940 --> 01:39:58,440
that's just kind of where those crimes

2333
01:39:58,440 --> 01:39:59,520
popped up

2334
01:39:59,520 --> 01:40:00,900
um some of the other sides too you've

2335
01:40:00,900 --> 01:40:02,760
also got an angle of Cameroon where they

2336
01:40:02,760 --> 01:40:04,320
will do things like puppy scams well

2337
01:40:04,320 --> 01:40:06,900
they will go and sell you fake puppies

2338
01:40:06,900 --> 01:40:08,699
and try and get you to wire money for

2339
01:40:08,699 --> 01:40:10,739
that you've got elements in Jamaica

2340
01:40:10,739 --> 01:40:12,719
where it's a combination of like the

2341
01:40:12,719 --> 01:40:14,699
tech support side but they'll do things

2342
01:40:14,699 --> 01:40:15,960
like hey I'm going to send you a picture

2343
01:40:15,960 --> 01:40:17,639
of a separate head you need to go ahead

2344
01:40:17,639 --> 01:40:20,159
and wire me money here

2345
01:40:20,159 --> 01:40:21,600
um unless you do that or I'm gonna come

2346
01:40:21,600 --> 01:40:24,000
after your family type thing so each

2347
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,460
country roughly has the certain angles

2348
01:40:26,460 --> 01:40:28,800
that they try and hit so just because

2349
01:40:28,800 --> 01:40:30,480
it's all connected so that's why they're

2350
01:40:30,480 --> 01:40:32,159
like yeah yeah

2351
01:40:32,159 --> 01:40:34,940
because I thought it was just most

2352
01:40:36,500 --> 01:40:40,219
business Secrets almost

2353
01:40:40,500 --> 01:40:42,420
so on the Indian tech support side I

2354
01:40:42,420 --> 01:40:43,380
don't track that so I don't know how

2355
01:40:43,380 --> 01:40:44,760
much collaboration is there for the

2356
01:40:44,760 --> 01:40:46,800
Nigerian side the way I like to work is

2357
01:40:46,800 --> 01:40:49,139
think of it like a loose Bazaar where

2358
01:40:49,139 --> 01:40:51,719
you can go and say Hey you have you're

2359
01:40:51,719 --> 01:40:53,580
really good at doing check fraud you're

2360
01:40:53,580 --> 01:40:55,920
really good at laundering money and

2361
01:40:55,920 --> 01:40:57,900
you're really good at crypto stuff the

2362
01:40:57,900 --> 01:40:59,520
three of you would work together on this

2363
01:40:59,520 --> 01:41:00,780
project and then you might bring

2364
01:41:00,780 --> 01:41:02,580
somebody else in you might go work for

2365
01:41:02,580 --> 01:41:04,800
somebody else over here so on the

2366
01:41:04,800 --> 01:41:06,900
Nigerian side sharing information is a

2367
01:41:06,900 --> 01:41:09,360
lot is ver is very open a lot of cases

2368
01:41:09,360 --> 01:41:10,860
like though like if you're talking to an

2369
01:41:10,860 --> 01:41:12,480
actor like they'll tell you exactly how

2370
01:41:12,480 --> 01:41:14,280
it works and everything

2371
01:41:14,280 --> 01:41:15,780
um and those and what they actually call

2372
01:41:15,780 --> 01:41:17,940
them is they call them methods and with

2373
01:41:17,940 --> 01:41:19,560
those methods of how to go and defraud

2374
01:41:19,560 --> 01:41:21,300
something they will they publish those

2375
01:41:21,300 --> 01:41:24,000
they share them and they are hundreds

2376
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:25,199
and hundreds and hundreds of ways to go

2377
01:41:25,199 --> 01:41:27,620
and do that

2378
01:41:27,719 --> 01:41:30,239
very enforced with the law enforcement

2379
01:41:30,239 --> 01:41:31,980
at least where to go and get those

2380
01:41:31,980 --> 01:41:34,500
methods it'd be

2381
01:41:34,500 --> 01:41:36,360
yeah and for the for the case in Nigeria

2382
01:41:36,360 --> 01:41:38,520
go look up a person named super cop

2383
01:41:38,520 --> 01:41:40,080
um it was actually somebody who was

2384
01:41:40,080 --> 01:41:42,600
recruited by one of the scammers to go

2385
01:41:42,600 --> 01:41:43,440
and actually

2386
01:41:43,440 --> 01:41:45,119
um and who's like um who actually helped

2387
01:41:45,119 --> 01:41:46,440
protect the scammers

2388
01:41:46,440 --> 01:41:47,880
um a lot of law enforcement and stuff

2389
01:41:47,880 --> 01:41:49,619
will actually accept bribes from the

2390
01:41:49,619 --> 01:41:51,540
Yahoo boys too so again because with

2391
01:41:51,540 --> 01:41:53,760
bribery is being publicly accepted

2392
01:41:53,760 --> 01:41:55,199
um a lot of law enforcement in Nigeria

2393
01:41:55,199 --> 01:41:56,940
it's really hard to work with some of

2394
01:41:56,940 --> 01:41:58,260
those cases so

2395
01:41:58,260 --> 01:42:00,480
we got one more all right yeah I just

2396
01:42:00,480 --> 01:42:02,580
thought I would share with you that I'm

2397
01:42:02,580 --> 01:42:05,219
one of those people that as the young

2398
01:42:05,219 --> 01:42:07,500
man mentioned you know I'm watching

2399
01:42:07,500 --> 01:42:09,719
emails go by every day and there's

2400
01:42:09,719 --> 01:42:11,820
nothing I can do to

2401
01:42:11,820 --> 01:42:15,540
to latch on to any of those and so

2402
01:42:15,540 --> 01:42:17,880
there's an acronym that I teach all of

2403
01:42:17,880 --> 01:42:21,719
our incoming new people jdfr

2404
01:42:21,719 --> 01:42:25,199
just okay feel right yep

2405
01:42:25,199 --> 01:42:27,060
and the and the interesting thing too on

2406
01:42:27,060 --> 01:42:28,920
that is again kind of reflecting back in

2407
01:42:28,920 --> 01:42:31,320
the romance victims that feeling right

2408
01:42:31,320 --> 01:42:32,760
and that level of intuition is something

2409
01:42:32,760 --> 01:42:34,320
that a lot of people aren't connected to

2410
01:42:34,320 --> 01:42:37,080
and when something doesn't feel right

2411
01:42:37,080 --> 01:42:38,580
many people will be like oh it's fine

2412
01:42:38,580 --> 01:42:39,840
I'm just being silly type thing I'm

2413
01:42:39,840 --> 01:42:41,699
gonna do it anyway and yeah that doesn't

2414
01:42:41,699 --> 01:42:43,380
feel right I like that approach because

2415
01:42:43,380 --> 01:42:45,840
again it's if it feels off it's off it's

2416
01:42:45,840 --> 01:42:47,940
your body telling you something that

2417
01:42:47,940 --> 01:42:49,679
you're not consciously aware of because

2418
01:42:49,679 --> 01:42:51,360
again everything from your neck down

2419
01:42:51,360 --> 01:42:53,400
operates way faster than everything from

2420
01:42:53,400 --> 01:42:55,739
here up so

2421
01:42:55,739 --> 01:42:58,459
thank you

2422
01:43:03,500 --> 01:43:06,119
I kind of notice uh this when you

2423
01:43:06,119 --> 01:43:07,199
mentioned

2424
01:43:07,199 --> 01:43:07,860
um

2425
01:43:07,860 --> 01:43:10,739
at the beginning when you said uh

2426
01:43:10,739 --> 01:43:13,560
the employee was receiving emails from

2427
01:43:13,560 --> 01:43:16,679
the fake CEO and getting emails like

2428
01:43:16,679 --> 01:43:18,600
about how um

2429
01:43:18,600 --> 01:43:20,940
how he was a terrible employee

2430
01:43:20,940 --> 01:43:23,159
and then the actual CEO

2431
01:43:23,159 --> 01:43:26,100
was getting like a weird vibe from the

2432
01:43:26,100 --> 01:43:28,800
employee not understanding why

2433
01:43:28,800 --> 01:43:31,679
well I I'm a huge

2434
01:43:31,679 --> 01:43:33,060
you kind of mentioned like how the

2435
01:43:33,060 --> 01:43:34,199
employee wasn't

2436
01:43:34,199 --> 01:43:37,260
saying anything to the CEO I was just

2437
01:43:37,260 --> 01:43:39,900
wondering like

2438
01:43:39,900 --> 01:43:42,900
like I know people nowadays uh have a

2439
01:43:42,900 --> 01:43:45,960
hard time communicating but why do you

2440
01:43:45,960 --> 01:43:48,420
think like he would not bring up a

2441
01:43:48,420 --> 01:43:50,820
serious issue like that to the CEO and

2442
01:43:50,820 --> 01:43:55,020
not communicate that because at the time

2443
01:43:55,020 --> 01:43:57,719
alive with the guy was being told was

2444
01:43:57,719 --> 01:43:59,580
that hey I need to keep this quiet don't

2445
01:43:59,580 --> 01:44:01,619
tell anybody about it and everything all

2446
01:44:01,619 --> 01:44:02,820
the communications were over text

2447
01:44:02,820 --> 01:44:05,040
message and everything so he in his

2448
01:44:05,040 --> 01:44:06,600
brain he truly thought everything he was

2449
01:44:06,600 --> 01:44:08,580
taught doing was talking with that CEO

2450
01:44:08,580 --> 01:44:10,920
and stuff and in addition to that when

2451
01:44:10,920 --> 01:44:12,179
it comes to conveying a lot of ideas

2452
01:44:12,179 --> 01:44:13,860
especially for the victims there's a lot

2453
01:44:13,860 --> 01:44:15,719
of shame that goes along with that and a

2454
01:44:15,719 --> 01:44:17,219
lot of people are can be very insecure

2455
01:44:17,219 --> 01:44:18,840
on that so it's hard

2456
01:44:18,840 --> 01:44:20,639
yeah mostly breaking through some of

2457
01:44:20,639 --> 01:44:22,619
that but also being honest with yourself

2458
01:44:22,619 --> 01:44:24,960
to know okay this is how I feel and

2459
01:44:24,960 --> 01:44:26,100
trying to break through and try and

2460
01:44:26,100 --> 01:44:27,960
communicate that so it's very difficult

2461
01:44:27,960 --> 01:44:29,400
to try and come along with that and

2462
01:44:29,400 --> 01:44:30,420
that's kind of why I want to address the

2463
01:44:30,420 --> 01:44:32,460
stigmas is because because of the shame

2464
01:44:32,460 --> 01:44:33,719
and negative emotions that go along with

2465
01:44:33,719 --> 01:44:36,540
that it's hard to break through it's

2466
01:44:36,540 --> 01:44:38,100
hard to emotionally break through a lot

2467
01:44:38,100 --> 01:44:39,420
of that so

2468
01:44:39,420 --> 01:44:41,219
all right I think we've got time for one

2469
01:44:41,219 --> 01:44:42,840
more vector

2470
01:44:42,840 --> 01:44:46,320
um with the extreme psychological con

2471
01:44:46,320 --> 01:44:49,400
falling victim to these things

2472
01:44:49,400 --> 01:44:51,719
mindfulness is a great tool but it

2473
01:44:51,719 --> 01:44:54,659
somehow feels deficient especially with

2474
01:44:54,659 --> 01:44:56,280
the stakes being as high as suicide for

2475
01:44:56,280 --> 01:44:59,040
some victims are you aware of any public

2476
01:44:59,040 --> 01:45:00,020
services

2477
01:45:00,020 --> 01:45:02,400
psychology therapy that helps

2478
01:45:02,400 --> 01:45:04,679
specifically victims of these types of

2479
01:45:04,679 --> 01:45:06,980
scams

2480
01:45:07,020 --> 01:45:09,420
working working on the psychology side

2481
01:45:09,420 --> 01:45:11,699
there's some studies that have done um

2482
01:45:11,699 --> 01:45:13,860
there was a study by a psychologist

2483
01:45:13,860 --> 01:45:16,260
named Monica witty out in Australia who

2484
01:45:16,260 --> 01:45:18,179
actually did some stuff on this

2485
01:45:18,179 --> 01:45:20,400
um there are some information out there

2486
01:45:20,400 --> 01:45:21,719
but when it comes to like massive

2487
01:45:21,719 --> 01:45:23,159
awareness campaigns around this there

2488
01:45:23,159 --> 01:45:24,360
isn't much

2489
01:45:24,360 --> 01:45:25,440
um one of the things I did on the

2490
01:45:25,440 --> 01:45:27,540
YouTube side was I actually worked with

2491
01:45:27,540 --> 01:45:29,100
um like I said research this for

2492
01:45:29,100 --> 01:45:31,020
multiple years I worked to get my own

2493
01:45:31,020 --> 01:45:33,300
mental health under control I worked

2494
01:45:33,300 --> 01:45:35,400
with some a muscular skeletal therapists

2495
01:45:35,400 --> 01:45:37,260
in order to understand this and

2496
01:45:37,260 --> 01:45:39,000
antibodies are certain key areas where

2497
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:40,199
we hold stress where we hold our

2498
01:45:40,199 --> 01:45:42,119
emotions and what I did was I did a

2499
01:45:42,119 --> 01:45:44,699
45-minute workout routine to start

2500
01:45:44,699 --> 01:45:46,739
releasing those tension spots in order

2501
01:45:46,739 --> 01:45:48,179
to kind of start addressing some of that

2502
01:45:48,179 --> 01:45:49,860
stuff and I'm not aware of any

2503
01:45:49,860 --> 01:45:52,139
widespread campaigns but something where

2504
01:45:52,139 --> 01:45:53,760
like again I advocate for mental health

2505
01:45:53,760 --> 01:45:54,719
I hear

2506
01:45:54,719 --> 01:45:56,280
um it's something where I try and do a

2507
01:45:56,280 --> 01:45:58,260
lot personally just to try and push a

2508
01:45:58,260 --> 01:45:59,820
lot of that stuff out but a lot of times

2509
01:45:59,820 --> 01:46:01,440
it feels like a one-man band even though

2510
01:46:01,440 --> 01:46:03,360
it's we're all working this stuff it's

2511
01:46:03,360 --> 01:46:05,760
like there's a whole lot of suck going

2512
01:46:05,760 --> 01:46:07,980
on right now so we need more support so

2513
01:46:07,980 --> 01:46:09,780

and welcome back to our worst of cyber

2538
01:51:30,119 --> 01:51:33,300
cyber security reporting it's been a

2539
01:51:33,300 --> 01:51:36,300
long couple weeks 20 22.

for anybody that's new to this talk we

2542
01:51:39,780 --> 01:51:42,300
basically cover sort of retrospective of

2543
01:51:42,300 --> 01:51:45,060
bad cyber security stories uh that we've

2544
01:51:45,060 --> 01:51:47,040
curated and added to our proverbial burn

2545
01:51:47,040 --> 01:51:49,679
book uh over the course of the year uh

2546
01:51:49,679 --> 01:51:51,540
so we're gonna oh hey so we're gonna

2547
01:51:51,540 --> 01:51:55,139
talk about those uh this year uh and you

2548
01:51:55,139 --> 01:51:57,000
know I don't know how many of you are on

2549
01:51:57,000 --> 01:51:59,760
Mastodon but we're on there now so yeah

2550
01:51:59,760 --> 01:52:01,260
could you introduce your

2551
01:52:01,260 --> 01:52:03,360
sure hi everybody I'm a product manager

2552
01:52:03,360 --> 01:52:05,639
uh unrelatedly I do freelance

2553
01:52:05,639 --> 01:52:07,500
investigative reporting uh covering

2554
01:52:07,500 --> 01:52:09,719
privacy and security and I've written

2555
01:52:09,719 --> 01:52:10,920
for a bunch of sites that you've

2556
01:52:10,920 --> 01:52:12,659
probably heard of and ranted in the

2557
01:52:12,659 --> 01:52:15,360
comments of and I do a lot of public

2558
01:52:15,360 --> 01:52:17,880
speaking and then I also have a master's

2559
01:52:17,880 --> 01:52:21,060
degree in journalism which was an

2560
01:52:21,060 --> 01:52:22,440
interesting way to kill time it

2561
01:52:22,440 --> 01:52:24,960
literally started right after Defcon and

2562
01:52:24,960 --> 01:52:27,000
ended right before the next step con so

2563
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:29,900
it was perfect

2564
01:52:30,659 --> 01:52:33,239
and I'm David Huerta where to next at 10

2565
01:52:33,239 --> 01:52:35,219
forward.social I'm a digital security

2566
01:52:35,219 --> 01:52:36,719
trainer over at the freedom of the press

2567
01:52:36,719 --> 01:52:38,639
Foundation where we train journalists in

2568
01:52:38,639 --> 01:52:40,800
privacy enhancing technology and using

2569
01:52:40,800 --> 01:52:42,300
that to protect their sources and

2570
01:52:42,300 --> 01:52:44,100
protect your colleagues as they do their

2571
01:52:44,100 --> 01:52:45,139
important work

2572
01:52:45,139 --> 01:52:48,360
uh We've like I've taught mostly digital

2573
01:52:48,360 --> 01:52:49,800
security trainings in person now it's

2574
01:52:49,800 --> 01:52:51,540
mostly online but I've also occasionally

2575
01:52:51,540 --> 01:52:54,060
like written for a few Tech Outlets

2576
01:52:54,060 --> 01:52:55,800
um some which don't exist anymore like

2577
01:52:55,800 --> 01:52:57,900
in the mesh is is been shuttered so as

2578
01:52:57,900 --> 01:52:59,760
the outline uh wire Cutter's still

2579
01:52:59,760 --> 01:53:00,900
around though

2580
01:53:00,900 --> 01:53:03,179
um the times is keeping them afloat I

2581
01:53:03,179 --> 01:53:03,840
guess

2582
01:53:03,840 --> 01:53:06,239
uh and our own security blog at

2583
01:53:06,239 --> 01:53:09,179
freedom.press so that's also a place to

2584
01:53:09,179 --> 01:53:11,520
look at guides for digital security

2585
01:53:11,520 --> 01:53:13,560
mostly aimed at a very beginner slash

2586
01:53:13,560 --> 01:53:15,600
journalistic uh or sort of like broad

2587
01:53:15,600 --> 01:53:17,580
journalist use case

2588
01:53:17,580 --> 01:53:21,420
uh also a little bit of backstory uh I'm

2589
01:53:21,420 --> 01:53:23,460
originally from here from Phoenix I live

2590
01:53:23,460 --> 01:53:25,380
in New York now but uh back when I was

2591
01:53:25,380 --> 01:53:27,780
here helped start this cool hacker space

2592
01:53:27,780 --> 01:53:29,100
called heatsink you should all go check

2593
01:53:29,100 --> 01:53:31,560
it out it is literally down the street

2594
01:53:31,560 --> 01:53:32,760
um I believe they have an open night

2595
01:53:32,760 --> 01:53:35,340
tonight probably yeah maybe I'll just

2596
01:53:35,340 --> 01:53:37,679
assume they do go check it out anyway

2597
01:53:37,679 --> 01:53:40,500
um anyway welcome back to our annual

2598
01:53:40,500 --> 01:53:43,500
Grill uh we got all kinds of stuff that

2599
01:53:43,500 --> 01:53:46,739
we're gonna be roasting but mostly uh

2600
01:53:46,739 --> 01:53:49,139
news articles so honestly like a lot of

2601
01:53:49,139 --> 01:53:50,400
other stuff

2602
01:53:50,400 --> 01:53:52,980
um that is like what people kind of love

2603
01:53:52,980 --> 01:53:55,380
to yell at or cringe at a lot of times

2604
01:53:55,380 --> 01:53:59,880
it's like op-eds or tweets or uh other

2605
01:53:59,880 --> 01:54:02,040
kind of like marketing materials by

2606
01:54:02,040 --> 01:54:03,239
Brands and stuff like that it's not

2607
01:54:03,239 --> 01:54:05,040
usually like

2608
01:54:05,040 --> 01:54:06,719
articles that have gone through the

2609
01:54:06,719 --> 01:54:09,360
editorial process Etc but we're going to

2610
01:54:09,360 --> 01:54:11,100
be focusing on just those

2611
01:54:11,100 --> 01:54:13,020
uh and we're not going to be focusing on

2612
01:54:13,020 --> 01:54:14,820
broadcasts and TV news because just like

2613
01:54:14,820 --> 01:54:16,739
TV is

2614
01:54:16,739 --> 01:54:18,480
a very intention sucking that we don't

2615
01:54:18,480 --> 01:54:19,920
really look into it too much

2616
01:54:19,920 --> 01:54:22,080
uh but we will add just a little bit of

2617
01:54:22,080 --> 01:54:23,820
interest to your industry writing just

2618
01:54:23,820 --> 01:54:26,420
it's a treat

2619
01:54:27,300 --> 01:54:30,659
okay so some recurring reminders uh this

2620
01:54:30,659 --> 01:54:31,980
is literally the same slide we've had

2621
01:54:31,980 --> 01:54:34,020
since the first talk uh a bad article

2622
01:54:34,020 --> 01:54:35,639
doesn't mean the author is bad every

2623
01:54:35,639 --> 01:54:37,260
time

2624
01:54:37,260 --> 01:54:39,000
um or sorry a bad article doesn't mean

2625
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:40,560
the author is bad every time that author

2626
01:54:40,560 --> 01:54:42,239
doesn't mean the publication is bad

2627
01:54:42,239 --> 01:54:44,340
every time a bad publication doesn't

2628
01:54:44,340 --> 01:54:46,679
mean the industry is bad every time

2629
01:54:46,679 --> 01:54:49,500
uh we really like journalists where we

2630
01:54:49,500 --> 01:54:52,080
do journalistic work uh we even like not

2631
01:54:52,080 --> 01:54:54,480
all but like most I guess some of the

2632
01:54:54,480 --> 01:54:55,500
journalists and Publications were

2633
01:54:55,500 --> 01:54:58,020
roasting uh many of these articles came

2634
01:54:58,020 --> 01:54:59,520
from just our own media diets and

2635
01:54:59,520 --> 01:55:01,679
subscriptions uh which we also encourage

2636
01:55:01,679 --> 01:55:04,080
people to do support your local news

2637
01:55:04,080 --> 01:55:06,119
outlets Etc

2638
01:55:06,119 --> 01:55:08,040
um I've been like to focus on the ways

2639
01:55:08,040 --> 01:55:10,980
both journalists and hackers uh can work

2640
01:55:10,980 --> 01:55:13,679
together to have more accurate and

2641
01:55:13,679 --> 01:55:15,719
useful reporting

2642
01:55:15,719 --> 01:55:18,360
all right so what do we got on the grill

2643
01:55:18,360 --> 01:55:19,679
today first yeah

2644
01:55:19,679 --> 01:55:21,900
uh so we've got themes that our first

2645
01:55:21,900 --> 01:55:24,360
theme is nothing burgers

2646
01:55:24,360 --> 01:55:26,159
um and uh we keep a running list the way

2647
01:55:26,159 --> 01:55:27,600
we do this is we keep a running list of

2648
01:55:27,600 --> 01:55:29,100
bad articles all year and then narrow

2649
01:55:29,100 --> 01:55:30,719
them down at the end of the year and

2650
01:55:30,719 --> 01:55:32,520
this was one that came pretty early on

2651
01:55:32,520 --> 01:55:34,920
that made the cut and it was how an

2652
01:55:34,920 --> 01:55:37,080
ethical hacker convention is fueling

2653
01:55:37,080 --> 01:55:39,420
Trump's big lie

2654
01:55:39,420 --> 01:55:42,060
um that was in motherboard which we like

2655
01:55:42,060 --> 01:55:44,340
but yeah

2656
01:55:44,340 --> 01:55:45,300
um

2657
01:55:45,300 --> 01:55:47,639
the experts agree there's no evidence of

2658
01:55:47,639 --> 01:55:49,380
widespread voter fraud in the election

2659
01:55:49,380 --> 01:55:51,360
and many have worked hard to debunk

2660
01:55:51,360 --> 01:55:54,540
these conspiracy theories but with its

2661
01:55:54,540 --> 01:55:56,460
sensationalistic rhetoric flashy

2662
01:55:56,460 --> 01:55:59,460
theatrics unstructured hacking and lack

2663
01:55:59,460 --> 01:56:01,619
of context about how elections operate

2664
01:56:01,619 --> 01:56:04,380
Defcon emphasizes the vulnerabilities

2665
01:56:04,380 --> 01:56:06,239
that are possible even when they're not

2666
01:56:06,239 --> 01:56:07,920
necessarily probable

2667
01:56:07,920 --> 01:56:10,560
serving as easy fodder for this and

2668
01:56:10,560 --> 01:56:13,080
misinformation Mal information showing

2669
01:56:13,080 --> 01:56:15,000
how even well-intentioned experts are

2670
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:18,300
being used to prop up the big lie and so

2671
01:56:18,300 --> 01:56:19,500
I thought this was really annoying

2672
01:56:19,500 --> 01:56:22,080
because I know the Cyber ninjas who are

2673
01:56:22,080 --> 01:56:23,520
neither cyber nor ninja but they're

2674
01:56:23,520 --> 01:56:26,219
local and I know defcon's voting Village

2675
01:56:26,219 --> 01:56:29,460
and these are not the same people uh and

2676
01:56:29,460 --> 01:56:32,760
it's true that conspiracy uh conspiracy

2677
01:56:32,760 --> 01:56:35,820
the uh researchers or actually theorists

2678
01:56:35,820 --> 01:56:38,040
repurpose legitimate election security

2679
01:56:38,040 --> 01:56:40,260
research for their own ends but that

2680
01:56:40,260 --> 01:56:42,239
includes some of vice's own reporting so

2681
01:56:42,239 --> 01:56:44,219
if Vice publishes an article and

2682
01:56:44,219 --> 01:56:45,900
conspiracy theorists run with it does

2683
01:56:45,900 --> 01:56:48,360
that mean that Vice is evil like I just

2684
01:56:48,360 --> 01:56:50,219
thought this was like uh really really

2685
01:56:50,219 --> 01:56:52,020
weird and I think that what happened the

2686
01:56:52,020 --> 01:56:54,480
biggest issue because we do try to be

2687
01:56:54,480 --> 01:56:55,920
constructive like sometimes I read

2688
01:56:55,920 --> 01:56:57,659
Twitter rants of my own articles and I'm

2689
01:56:57,659 --> 01:56:59,219
like cool you didn't like this but not

2690
01:56:59,219 --> 01:57:01,440
in a way that actually helps me figure

2691
01:57:01,440 --> 01:57:02,820
out what you didn't like or what I

2692
01:57:02,820 --> 01:57:05,040
should do differently but we try to do

2693
01:57:05,040 --> 01:57:06,300
the opposite of that by actually giving

2694
01:57:06,300 --> 01:57:08,699
feedback so what I think that the author

2695
01:57:08,699 --> 01:57:10,380
should have done was Interview experts

2696
01:57:10,380 --> 01:57:12,599
on Election security

2697
01:57:12,599 --> 01:57:14,280
um and they could like contextualize

2698
01:57:14,280 --> 01:57:15,540
some of what they're seeing in voting

2699
01:57:15,540 --> 01:57:17,159
Village that might seem off or weird to

2700
01:57:17,159 --> 01:57:19,380
them as people are not embedded in that

2701
01:57:19,380 --> 01:57:23,599
community and like put that in context

2702
01:57:23,940 --> 01:57:26,219
um that being said though like critical

2703
01:57:26,219 --> 01:57:28,560
articles can be good like I do think

2704
01:57:28,560 --> 01:57:31,800
that a lot of the pushback triggers a

2705
01:57:31,800 --> 01:57:33,480
certain Instinct that we have to defend

2706
01:57:33,480 --> 01:57:36,060
things that we love uh which is totally

2707
01:57:36,060 --> 01:57:38,340
natural and you know human

2708
01:57:38,340 --> 01:57:41,639
uh but it's important to you know

2709
01:57:41,639 --> 01:57:44,219
check like read maybe read the article

2710
01:57:44,219 --> 01:57:46,380
and see if it is a hit hit piece before

2711
01:57:46,380 --> 01:57:49,020
you start calling it a hit piece

2712
01:57:49,020 --> 01:57:50,940
um so this is an example of good

2713
01:57:50,940 --> 01:57:52,380
criticism I just kind of want to throw

2714
01:57:52,380 --> 01:57:54,239
in and like yeah you can be critical

2715
01:57:54,239 --> 01:57:55,980
about something including things that

2716
01:57:55,980 --> 01:57:58,380
you think are cool uh

2717
01:57:58,380 --> 01:58:01,080
but do it right uh so in this case this

2718
01:58:01,080 --> 01:58:02,880
was an article it's not part of a roast

2719
01:58:02,880 --> 01:58:05,159
to be clear like this is not like uh

2720
01:58:05,159 --> 01:58:07,199
something that's on the grill it's like

2721
01:58:07,199 --> 01:58:10,500
uh a Tom Collins that we have to refresh

2722
01:58:10,500 --> 01:58:11,940
you in between eating bird nothing

2723
01:58:11,940 --> 01:58:13,560
burgers

2724
01:58:13,560 --> 01:58:16,440
so in this case there's uh sort of this

2725
01:58:16,440 --> 01:58:18,179
sort of fair approach of being like well

2726
01:58:18,179 --> 01:58:20,880
here are pros and cons of centralized

2727
01:58:20,880 --> 01:58:23,940
versus Community hosted Services uh

2728
01:58:23,940 --> 01:58:25,380
including drawing comparisons to those

2729
01:58:25,380 --> 01:58:26,699
that have already existed have had a

2730
01:58:26,699 --> 01:58:31,080
long history of uh existing and potent

2731
01:58:31,080 --> 01:58:33,239
and you know also history security

2732
01:58:33,239 --> 01:58:35,040
issues if any of you have ever looked at

2733
01:58:35,040 --> 01:58:37,800
you know cve's reward for us

2734
01:58:37,800 --> 01:58:40,139
um it also doesn't try to like shoehorn

2735
01:58:40,139 --> 01:58:41,880
things into this Grand narrative like

2736
01:58:41,880 --> 01:58:43,560
here's this kind of thing that is just

2737
01:58:43,560 --> 01:58:45,719
like well all right we're seeing that

2738
01:58:45,719 --> 01:58:47,940
we're just basically trying to say like

2739
01:58:47,940 --> 01:58:50,099
here's you as a consumer you're thinking

2740
01:58:50,099 --> 01:58:51,179
about you're maybe thinking about

2741
01:58:51,179 --> 01:58:52,980
jumping ship on Twitter as a lot of

2742
01:58:52,980 --> 01:58:54,840
people are here's what you should know

2743
01:58:54,840 --> 01:58:56,159
about Mastodon that's a little bit

2744
01:58:56,159 --> 01:58:57,719
different because it's not always like

2745
01:58:57,719 --> 01:58:59,159
immediately obvious especially for

2746
01:58:59,159 --> 01:59:01,199
people that are not knee-deep in talking

2747
01:59:01,199 --> 01:59:03,119
about decentralized networks all day

2748
01:59:03,119 --> 01:59:04,080
every day

2749
01:59:04,080 --> 01:59:05,340
so

2750
01:59:05,340 --> 01:59:07,800
that's basically uh you know the way

2751
01:59:07,800 --> 01:59:09,420
they did Wayne all the pros and cons you

2752
01:59:09,420 --> 01:59:10,679
can think of talking to experts

2753
01:59:10,679 --> 01:59:13,320
basically checking all the right boxes

2754
01:59:13,320 --> 01:59:15,020
um Everybody hated it anyway

2755
01:59:15,020 --> 01:59:17,099
uh so it's one of those things where

2756
01:59:17,099 --> 01:59:18,000
like

2757
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:20,340
um if you're wondering why there's

2758
01:59:20,340 --> 01:59:22,619
people don't try to be perfect at

2759
01:59:22,619 --> 01:59:25,139
critical pieces it's because honestly

2760
01:59:25,139 --> 01:59:26,580
the result's going to be the same as

2761
01:59:26,580 --> 01:59:27,840
your audience is going to yell at you

2762
01:59:27,840 --> 01:59:30,060
but maybe that's fine maybe you know

2763
01:59:30,060 --> 01:59:32,699
you're into that it's cool

2764
01:59:32,699 --> 01:59:35,940
um speaking of nothing Burgers uh so

2765
01:59:35,940 --> 01:59:38,580
this is an article also from Vice

2766
01:59:38,580 --> 01:59:41,520
um we read a lot of ice uh drones and

2767
01:59:41,520 --> 01:59:44,159
basically there is a article I think

2768
01:59:44,159 --> 01:59:46,440
from early 2022 it's like I think one of

2769
01:59:46,440 --> 01:59:48,420
the first ones that I added that was

2770
01:59:48,420 --> 01:59:52,500
about nfts stealing IP addresses

2771
01:59:52,500 --> 01:59:55,320
um for any of you that know how the

2772
01:59:55,320 --> 01:59:57,360
internet works and how tcpip protocol

2773
01:59:57,360 --> 02:00:01,440
works when you connect to a website you

2774
02:00:01,440 --> 02:00:03,960
essentially let them know what your IP

2775
02:00:03,960 --> 02:00:05,639
address is

2776
02:00:05,639 --> 02:00:06,239
um

2777
02:00:06,239 --> 02:00:08,760
big reveal for anybody that maybe didn't

2778
02:00:08,760 --> 02:00:10,679
know that but the thing is most people

2779
02:00:10,679 --> 02:00:11,940
don't

2780
02:00:11,940 --> 02:00:13,560
um so I think that there is like to us

2781
02:00:13,560 --> 02:00:15,840
it's like obvious yes you go connect to

2782
02:00:15,840 --> 02:00:17,099
a website you're going to reveal your IP

2783
02:00:17,099 --> 02:00:18,420
address

2784
02:00:18,420 --> 02:00:20,040
um and in this case there was some

2785
02:00:20,040 --> 02:00:21,719
understanding of that in terms of like

2786
02:00:21,719 --> 02:00:23,460
first party connections to the sites

2787
02:00:23,460 --> 02:00:25,500
that use uh

2788
02:00:25,500 --> 02:00:27,599
but it then goes into this kind of thing

2789
02:00:27,599 --> 02:00:29,520
of like well you know this is actually a

2790
02:00:29,520 --> 02:00:30,960
third party not the website you're

2791
02:00:30,960 --> 02:00:32,460
connected to but a different thing

2792
02:00:32,460 --> 02:00:33,900
hosted elsewhere that's not on the

2793
02:00:33,900 --> 02:00:35,159
website you're visiting that's taking

2794
02:00:35,159 --> 02:00:36,420
your IP address

2795
02:00:36,420 --> 02:00:38,340
but also there is like an old parable

2796
02:00:38,340 --> 02:00:41,219
about not throwing stones from glass

2797
02:00:41,219 --> 02:00:42,719
houses or something like that I forget

2798
02:00:42,719 --> 02:00:45,119
exactly how that goes

2799
02:00:45,119 --> 02:00:47,580
um but that's kind of the way the whole

2800
02:00:47,580 --> 02:00:50,219
ad kind of industry works it's like

2801
02:00:50,219 --> 02:00:53,400
literally designed to try to find your

2802
02:00:53,400 --> 02:00:55,380
IP address among you know several

2803
02:00:55,380 --> 02:00:57,000
hundreds or sometimes even thousands of

2804
02:00:57,000 --> 02:01:00,900
other sort of like indicators and it's

2805
02:01:00,900 --> 02:01:03,360
you know uh

2806
02:01:03,360 --> 02:01:06,000
one of those things where I think it's

2807
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:08,280
it's hard like most people don't

2808
02:01:08,280 --> 02:01:09,780
understand how the internet works it's I

2809
02:01:09,780 --> 02:01:11,760
don't know if Cronkite talked about this

2810
02:01:11,760 --> 02:01:14,159
in journalism school or not

2811
02:01:14,159 --> 02:01:15,780
um how the internet works yeah yeah and

2812
02:01:15,780 --> 02:01:18,540
IP addresses and yeah I know so it's not

2813
02:01:18,540 --> 02:01:19,619
something we can necessarily expect

2814
02:01:19,619 --> 02:01:22,020
everybody to know and talking to experts

2815
02:01:22,020 --> 02:01:23,159
will give you a good fundamental

2816
02:01:23,159 --> 02:01:24,480
Baseline of understanding but

2817
02:01:24,480 --> 02:01:26,280
unfortunately the complexity of AD

2818
02:01:26,280 --> 02:01:29,639
networks is incredibly incredibly

2819
02:01:29,639 --> 02:01:33,000
obscure and opaque and

2820
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:35,460
anybody that thinks they know about how

2821
02:01:35,460 --> 02:01:38,280
a networks work will end up you know

2822
02:01:38,280 --> 02:01:40,440
like I'm sorry like I don't nobody does

2823
02:01:40,440 --> 02:01:41,940
like it's one of those things where like

2824
02:01:41,940 --> 02:01:43,500
if you're one of the people that are

2825
02:01:43,500 --> 02:01:46,320
working at the double click team or any

2826
02:01:46,320 --> 02:01:47,699
of these other kind of like large ad

2827
02:01:47,699 --> 02:01:50,699
exchanges you know how deep the rabbit

2828
02:01:50,699 --> 02:01:52,980
hole goes and unfortunately that's not

2829
02:01:52,980 --> 02:01:54,719
something you can just explain to a

2830
02:01:54,719 --> 02:01:56,340
journalist before a deadline in like a

2831
02:01:56,340 --> 02:01:58,920
few days uh so it's understandable that

2832
02:01:58,920 --> 02:02:00,900
somebody maybe wouldn't be as familiar

2833
02:02:00,900 --> 02:02:03,360
with some of those Dynamics

2834
02:02:03,360 --> 02:02:07,679
uh also just like you know it it's it

2835
02:02:07,679 --> 02:02:11,639
gets the hits like 2021 early 2022 is

2836
02:02:11,639 --> 02:02:13,739
just like the perfect like nft like

2837
02:02:13,739 --> 02:02:17,219
dunking season basically uh so it is one

2838
02:02:17,219 --> 02:02:18,960
of those things where it's it's like an

2839
02:02:18,960 --> 02:02:20,940
easy punching bag it's like the easiest

2840
02:02:20,940 --> 02:02:22,860
you know it's like a pinata that you

2841
02:02:22,860 --> 02:02:25,380
don't have to put a blindfold on to hit

2842
02:02:25,380 --> 02:02:27,300
um that being said though like it's one

2843
02:02:27,300 --> 02:02:28,980
of those things where you may want to

2844
02:02:28,980 --> 02:02:30,599
look into the position of which you're

2845
02:02:30,599 --> 02:02:33,000
starting at to see like where the actual

2846
02:02:33,000 --> 02:02:34,800
Baseline is because it might not be that

2847
02:02:34,800 --> 02:02:37,500
these are uh that you're not starting

2848
02:02:37,500 --> 02:02:39,480
from zero in terms of like oh we're

2849
02:02:39,480 --> 02:02:41,580
critical of problematic monetization of

2850
02:02:41,580 --> 02:02:43,619
a thing it's like well your whole

2851
02:02:43,619 --> 02:02:45,420
industry is powered by ad surveillance

2852
02:02:45,420 --> 02:02:47,159
so maybe we should think about these

2853
02:02:47,159 --> 02:02:49,679
things as well and address that

2854
02:02:49,679 --> 02:02:51,360
um I'll let you go to the next one oh

2855
02:02:51,360 --> 02:02:53,040
okay so now we're dunking after we

2856
02:02:53,040 --> 02:02:55,080
dunked on our favorite Vice reporters

2857
02:02:55,080 --> 02:02:57,540
from now dunking on The Intercept

2858
02:02:57,540 --> 02:03:00,300
um and this was a story about how leaked

2859
02:03:00,300 --> 02:03:02,820
documents outlined dhs's plan to police

2860
02:03:02,820 --> 02:03:05,639
disinformation and uh I kind of feel

2861
02:03:05,639 --> 02:03:07,380
like if I ever write a story in Mike

2862
02:03:07,380 --> 02:03:10,139
masnick uh writes a post about it I

2863
02:03:10,139 --> 02:03:12,420
would go take a long walk somewhere like

2864
02:03:12,420 --> 02:03:15,360
that's worse than being on this uh in

2865
02:03:15,360 --> 02:03:18,239
this uh worst uh cyber security talk but

2866
02:03:18,239 --> 02:03:20,460
he basically like wrote a story ripping

2867
02:03:20,460 --> 02:03:22,020
it apart

2868
02:03:22,020 --> 02:03:23,880
um because it didn't show what it said

2869
02:03:23,880 --> 02:03:25,440
it would

2870
02:03:25,440 --> 02:03:27,300
um it misreads things it's confused

2871
02:03:27,300 --> 02:03:29,580
about what documents actually say and

2872
02:03:29,580 --> 02:03:31,320
then it presented widely available and

2873
02:03:31,320 --> 02:03:33,000
known things as if they were secret and

2874
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:36,179
hidden from the that article's [ __ ]

2875
02:03:36,179 --> 02:03:37,520
department

2876
02:03:37,520 --> 02:03:40,860
and uh I basically the article said that

2877
02:03:40,860 --> 02:03:42,599
providing information about threats to

2878
02:03:42,599 --> 02:03:43,800
companies and governments was

2879
02:03:43,800 --> 02:03:46,440
suppressing speech it equated the two

2880
02:03:46,440 --> 02:03:47,639
um and those are two different things

2881
02:03:47,639 --> 02:03:49,679
and then it talked about these secret

2882
02:03:49,679 --> 02:03:51,719
nefarious meetings that were posted

2883
02:03:51,719 --> 02:03:54,540
publicly the ones that were not posted

2884
02:03:54,540 --> 02:03:55,679
publicly didn't actually have anything

2885
02:03:55,679 --> 02:03:57,420
of substance because the intercepts was

2886
02:03:57,420 --> 02:04:00,119
like well these ones weren't public like

2887
02:04:00,119 --> 02:04:02,219
this subcommittee meeting was not public

2888
02:04:02,219 --> 02:04:04,619
but I'm like it doesn't say anything uh

2889
02:04:04,619 --> 02:04:06,239
but yeah if tech Turk Waits a long

2890
02:04:06,239 --> 02:04:07,800
takedown post about your story I think

2891
02:04:07,800 --> 02:04:10,139
it's worthy of some introspection

2892
02:04:10,139 --> 02:04:12,000
sometimes people get really defensive

2893
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:14,940
and kind of double down but uh I think

2894
02:04:14,940 --> 02:04:17,219
that's always a bad idea

2895
02:04:17,219 --> 02:04:19,320
uh so what went wrong I hate to blame

2896
02:04:19,320 --> 02:04:20,820
things on clickbait like I think that's

2897
02:04:20,820 --> 02:04:22,260
kind of a lazy argument like oh

2898
02:04:22,260 --> 02:04:24,719
clickbait journalism because like like

2899
02:04:24,719 --> 02:04:27,480
one why is it bad to want people to read

2900
02:04:27,480 --> 02:04:28,800
what you write like I don't think that

2901
02:04:28,800 --> 02:04:30,659
that is inherently bad to want to make

2902
02:04:30,659 --> 02:04:32,040
sure that what you write lands and

2903
02:04:32,040 --> 02:04:34,199
people are reading it and two like a lot

2904
02:04:34,199 --> 02:04:36,000
of sites don't even look at clicks like

2905
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:37,679
that's not the metric that they observe

2906
02:04:37,679 --> 02:04:39,840
they look at subscriptions or time on

2907
02:04:39,840 --> 02:04:41,639
page or at least a combination of those

2908
02:04:41,639 --> 02:04:42,719
things

2909
02:04:42,719 --> 02:04:44,040
um so I don't want to blame things on

2910
02:04:44,040 --> 02:04:45,480
clickbait but I kind of had to wonder

2911
02:04:45,480 --> 02:04:47,159
when I read this piece if they were just

2912
02:04:47,159 --> 02:04:50,639
trying to drum up uh clickbait and uh I

2913
02:04:50,639 --> 02:04:51,780
feel like if you have a really good

2914
02:04:51,780 --> 02:04:53,639
editor and a really good fact Checker

2915
02:04:53,639 --> 02:04:55,560
they can be annoying sometimes because

2916
02:04:55,560 --> 02:04:57,239
they make you redo things or like

2917
02:04:57,239 --> 02:05:00,179
question your premises sometimes they

2918
02:05:00,179 --> 02:05:01,679
introduce errors that you have to get

2919
02:05:01,679 --> 02:05:03,900
removed which is really annoying but a

2920
02:05:03,900 --> 02:05:05,880
good editor and a good fact Checker can

2921
02:05:05,880 --> 02:05:07,560
help prevent some of the issues that we

2922
02:05:07,560 --> 02:05:09,719
saw in the story and I would rather have

2923
02:05:09,719 --> 02:05:11,940
it ripped apart internally than like

2924
02:05:11,940 --> 02:05:14,040
have Mike Mass next to a blog post about

2925
02:05:14,040 --> 02:05:15,480
it

2926
02:05:15,480 --> 02:05:18,960
uh so and then my next one and I hate to

2927
02:05:18,960 --> 02:05:20,280
roast this one because I really like

2928
02:05:20,280 --> 02:05:22,679
some of the writers on it

2929
02:05:22,679 --> 02:05:23,280
um

2930
02:05:23,280 --> 02:05:25,860
insiders where is too distracted from

2931
02:05:25,860 --> 02:05:27,900
its critical cyber Mission I just

2932
02:05:27,900 --> 02:05:29,400
thought this article was really sexist

2933
02:05:29,400 --> 02:05:30,960
honestly like I felt like there's

2934
02:05:30,960 --> 02:05:32,520
criticism that

2935
02:05:32,520 --> 02:05:34,020
um Jen easterly received that her

2936
02:05:34,020 --> 02:05:35,940
predecessor didn't

2937
02:05:35,940 --> 02:05:38,340
um and it also talks about like part

2938
02:05:38,340 --> 02:05:40,020
part of the premise of the story is that

2939
02:05:40,020 --> 02:05:42,000
sister doesn't have a mission but they

2940
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:43,619
literally had just put out a three-year

2941
02:05:43,619 --> 02:05:46,080
strategic plan which was not mentioned

2942
02:05:46,080 --> 02:05:48,119
in the story and that was weird to me

2943
02:05:48,119 --> 02:05:50,880
like um and they said they want the

2944
02:05:50,880 --> 02:05:52,679
focus to be about the work not on one

2945
02:05:52,679 --> 02:05:54,780
person and that is a critique that I

2946
02:05:54,780 --> 02:05:56,040
don't think is usually made about male

2947
02:05:56,040 --> 02:05:57,119
leaders

2948
02:05:57,119 --> 02:05:58,800
um and so I just thought this article

2949
02:05:58,800 --> 02:06:00,659
was sexist and bad

2950
02:06:00,659 --> 02:06:02,639
uh so what went wrong

2951
02:06:02,639 --> 02:06:04,199
um they quoted people that I also

2952
02:06:04,199 --> 02:06:06,179
thought were sexist like maybe some of

2953
02:06:06,179 --> 02:06:07,739
the people they interviewed were sexist

2954
02:06:07,739 --> 02:06:09,960
maybe this story reflects sexism that

2955
02:06:09,960 --> 02:06:11,940
exists in DC politics

2956
02:06:11,940 --> 02:06:13,800
um so that's an idea like that's a if

2957
02:06:13,800 --> 02:06:15,239
everybody is telling you something then

2958
02:06:15,239 --> 02:06:17,580
yes like they see it that way but like

2959
02:06:17,580 --> 02:06:19,260
do you want to take a bigger picture and

2960
02:06:19,260 --> 02:06:22,139
look at it in the in that context and

2961
02:06:22,139 --> 02:06:23,760
maybe the journalists working on it who

2962
02:06:23,760 --> 02:06:25,380
again I really like maybe they didn't

2963
02:06:25,380 --> 02:06:27,420
know about the Strategic plan maybe they

2964
02:06:27,420 --> 02:06:29,099
just didn't know that that came out I

2965
02:06:29,099 --> 02:06:30,719
don't know why but or maybe they didn't

2966
02:06:30,719 --> 02:06:32,880
think it was relevant so those are my my

2967
02:06:32,880 --> 02:06:35,719
hypotheses

2968
02:06:35,880 --> 02:06:39,420
all right uh you know so I know there's

2969
02:06:39,420 --> 02:06:41,699
you know everybody's maybe not full from

2970
02:06:41,699 --> 02:06:43,800
nothing Burgers wondering where's the

2971
02:06:43,800 --> 02:06:45,659
beef and for anybody that's not in a

2972
02:06:45,659 --> 02:06:47,760
boomer in the room you may not catch

2973
02:06:47,760 --> 02:06:49,440
that reference so maybe if you're like

2974
02:06:49,440 --> 02:06:51,300
an elder Millennial like me this one any

2975
02:06:51,300 --> 02:06:53,580
Fedora users okay no

2976
02:06:53,580 --> 02:06:55,080
um all right so we're gonna talk about

2977
02:06:55,080 --> 02:06:58,400
this uh story from the New York Times

2978
02:06:58,400 --> 02:07:01,440
about a Bitcoin laundering case that had

2979
02:07:01,440 --> 02:07:03,659
some interesting characters uh which is

2980
02:07:03,659 --> 02:07:04,800
part of course in a lot of

2981
02:07:04,800 --> 02:07:07,980
cryptocurrency kind of stories I guess

2982
02:07:07,980 --> 02:07:11,400
um in this case there were two uh people

2983
02:07:11,400 --> 02:07:14,520
that were arrested as suspects for a

2984
02:07:14,520 --> 02:07:16,800
highest on bitfinex

2985
02:07:16,800 --> 02:07:20,219
and there's not really much about that

2986
02:07:20,219 --> 02:07:24,179
Heist or story or like doing a cursory

2987
02:07:24,179 --> 02:07:26,340
check on you know blockchain

2988
02:07:26,340 --> 02:07:27,980
transactions or really kind of anything

2989
02:07:27,980 --> 02:07:30,599
it's mostly just like look at these two

2990
02:07:30,599 --> 02:07:32,760
weirdo like Bonnie and Clyde type

2991
02:07:32,760 --> 02:07:35,159
figures aren't they weird look at them

2992
02:07:35,159 --> 02:07:37,380
they got hollowed out books they got

2993
02:07:37,380 --> 02:07:39,300
encryption apps

2994
02:07:39,300 --> 02:07:41,520
um there's a paragraph about a tweet

2995
02:07:41,520 --> 02:07:44,400
about pancakes I like pancakes so I

2996
02:07:44,400 --> 02:07:46,320
don't mind that content I'm here for it

2997
02:07:46,320 --> 02:07:49,260
but I don't see like this doesn't tell

2998
02:07:49,260 --> 02:07:51,060
me anything about what happened to

2999
02:07:51,060 --> 02:07:54,300
bitfinex like at all also normalized

3000
02:07:54,300 --> 02:07:56,699
burner phones normalize hollowed out

3001
02:07:56,699 --> 02:07:58,920
books with Yuba keys in them I'm just

3002
02:07:58,920 --> 02:08:01,080
saying This Is Not Unusual this is

3003
02:08:01,080 --> 02:08:05,400
something me and all my friends do so

3004
02:08:05,400 --> 02:08:08,040
yeah yeah

3005
02:08:08,040 --> 02:08:10,619
all right so a few things that could go

3006
02:08:10,619 --> 02:08:13,020
wrong is like reporting on blockchain

3007
02:08:13,020 --> 02:08:15,179
stuff is hard uh because I mean

3008
02:08:15,179 --> 02:08:18,119
blockchains are incredibly complex

3009
02:08:18,119 --> 02:08:21,119
uh technology slash attack surfaces and

3010
02:08:21,119 --> 02:08:24,480
there is uh it's yeah it's it's again

3011
02:08:24,480 --> 02:08:26,400
it's that I don't know if Cronkite

3012
02:08:26,400 --> 02:08:28,199
talked about blockchain and journalism

3013
02:08:28,199 --> 02:08:31,080
school but it's you know it's not common

3014
02:08:31,080 --> 02:08:33,060
knowledge to a lot of people from what I

3015
02:08:33,060 --> 02:08:34,860
understand so it's it's weird to have

3016
02:08:34,860 --> 02:08:36,179
that expectation like every journalist

3017
02:08:36,179 --> 02:08:38,340
should be a blockchain expert like

3018
02:08:38,340 --> 02:08:40,500
most are not they're gonna try to read

3019
02:08:40,500 --> 02:08:42,300
but they can but ultimately they're not

3020
02:08:42,300 --> 02:08:43,560
going to know everything because even

3021
02:08:43,560 --> 02:08:44,820
blockchain developers don't know

3022
02:08:44,820 --> 02:08:46,139
everything about blockchain and how it

3023
02:08:46,139 --> 02:08:47,699
works

3024
02:08:47,699 --> 02:08:48,420
um

3025
02:08:48,420 --> 02:08:51,719
and in this case yeah when you lack that

3026
02:08:51,719 --> 02:08:53,280
kind of like knowing where to start in

3027
02:08:53,280 --> 02:08:55,320
terms of like investigating how money's

3028
02:08:55,320 --> 02:08:59,099
moving around and uh maybe not having as

3029
02:08:59,099 --> 02:09:01,619
much detail from the actual Heist people

3030
02:09:01,619 --> 02:09:03,119
tend to fall back on sort of human

3031
02:09:03,119 --> 02:09:04,920
interesting type stories and you know

3032
02:09:04,920 --> 02:09:07,260
tweets about pancakes and things that

3033
02:09:07,260 --> 02:09:10,320
make it sound like an Ocean's 11 movie

3034
02:09:10,320 --> 02:09:13,080
all right all right here's another one

3035
02:09:13,080 --> 02:09:15,060
of my favorite authors who I'm roasting

3036
02:09:15,060 --> 02:09:17,520
which I'm very sad about but um there

3037
02:09:17,520 --> 02:09:19,440
was an article in the Washington post

3038
02:09:19,440 --> 02:09:21,719
about the Google engineer who thinks the

3039
02:09:21,719 --> 02:09:24,000
company's AI has come to life

3040
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:27,300
uh one of Google's own thinks there's a

3041
02:09:27,300 --> 02:09:30,020
ghost in the machine

3042
02:09:30,060 --> 02:09:32,599
um cool okay so an engineer thinks that

3043
02:09:32,599 --> 02:09:35,520
uh AI is becoming sentient

3044
02:09:35,520 --> 02:09:37,260
um that kicks up an internal shitstorm

3045
02:09:37,260 --> 02:09:40,139
he gets suspended from his job is this

3046
02:09:40,139 --> 02:09:42,119
really a story though

3047
02:09:42,119 --> 02:09:44,099
I don't know I feel like it kind of

3048
02:09:44,099 --> 02:09:46,320
perpetuates the Sci-Fi and panic

3049
02:09:46,320 --> 02:09:48,060
surrounding Ai and we know that there

3050
02:09:48,060 --> 02:09:50,340
are a lot of real issues existing issues

3051
02:09:50,340 --> 02:09:53,520
with AI like algorithmic bias like chat

3052
02:09:53,520 --> 02:09:55,739
GPS like you can read a million stories

3053
02:09:55,739 --> 02:09:57,420
about some of the other very real issues

3054
02:09:57,420 --> 02:09:58,800
that have been studied for many many

3055
02:09:58,800 --> 02:10:01,080
years and I feel like focusing on this

3056
02:10:01,080 --> 02:10:03,480
sort of sci-fi version of this kind of

3057
02:10:03,480 --> 02:10:06,119
draws attention away from that so that

3058
02:10:06,119 --> 02:10:08,820
was kind of my issue with this story uh

3059
02:10:08,820 --> 02:10:10,679
what went wrong we love Natasha we love

3060
02:10:10,679 --> 02:10:12,780
science fiction maybe not at the same

3061
02:10:12,780 --> 02:10:13,980
time

3062
02:10:13,980 --> 02:10:15,480
huh

3063
02:10:15,480 --> 02:10:18,239
I blame Isaac Asimov I think there's a

3064
02:10:18,239 --> 02:10:20,219
lot of other reasons to like you know be

3065
02:10:20,219 --> 02:10:22,679
concerned about AI but you know rising

3066
02:10:22,679 --> 02:10:24,659
up against humans for being sentient oh

3067
02:10:24,659 --> 02:10:26,639
no that hasn't been discussed over and

3068
02:10:26,639 --> 02:10:27,900
over and over again in every single

3069
02:10:27,900 --> 02:10:30,480
genre of Science Fiction since the 1970s

3070
02:10:30,480 --> 02:10:32,340
all right so we're gonna talk this is

3071
02:10:32,340 --> 02:10:34,860
our other kind of sessions uh uh for for

3072
02:10:34,860 --> 02:10:36,599
the vegans on the room we have a roast

3073
02:10:36,599 --> 02:10:39,599
of shiitake mushrooms so we'll shiitake

3074
02:10:39,599 --> 02:10:41,580
for anybody that also catches another

3075
02:10:41,580 --> 02:10:43,800
Elder Millennial reference uh Spy Kids

3076
02:10:43,800 --> 02:10:44,880
the movie

3077
02:10:44,880 --> 02:10:46,920
all right so

3078
02:10:46,920 --> 02:10:50,280
uh there's a story here uh from the rap

3079
02:10:50,280 --> 02:10:52,619
which is like not a very like you know

3080
02:10:52,619 --> 02:10:55,320
big famous sort of Ina Outlet uh about

3081
02:10:55,320 --> 02:10:56,699
how Tick Tock can totally string event

3082
02:10:56,699 --> 02:10:58,380
Apple and Google privacy protections and

3083
02:10:58,380 --> 02:11:00,960
access full user data two studies say

3084
02:11:00,960 --> 02:11:03,840
exclusive

3085
02:11:03,840 --> 02:11:06,360
um first off this the studies can't

3086
02:11:06,360 --> 02:11:08,280
actually be found anywhere so there's no

3087
02:11:08,280 --> 02:11:10,199
way to like verify really anything

3088
02:11:10,199 --> 02:11:13,260
that's being said at all

3089
02:11:13,260 --> 02:11:15,659
um we have like little tiny tidbits of

3090
02:11:15,659 --> 02:11:18,000
like slides from things so we're kind of

3091
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:19,920
trying to get like I could see how

3092
02:11:19,920 --> 02:11:21,239
reporters are trying to do what they can

3093
02:11:21,239 --> 02:11:23,340
based on what they had access to sharing

3094
02:11:23,340 --> 02:11:25,440
what they found relevant But ultimately

3095
02:11:25,440 --> 02:11:26,580
um

3096
02:11:26,580 --> 02:11:29,520
a lot of other stories that would be

3097
02:11:29,520 --> 02:11:31,260
written this way would normally include

3098
02:11:31,260 --> 02:11:32,280
like

3099
02:11:32,280 --> 02:11:34,080
something that is available to the

3100
02:11:34,080 --> 02:11:35,880
public if they're citing a study so that

3101
02:11:35,880 --> 02:11:37,800
people and experts could look at it

3102
02:11:37,800 --> 02:11:40,080
themselves and inspect it this is I

3103
02:11:40,080 --> 02:11:41,639
think at least true in a lot of the

3104
02:11:41,639 --> 02:11:42,960
medical writing that I've seen for

3105
02:11:42,960 --> 02:11:44,520
example

3106
02:11:44,520 --> 02:11:45,780
um

3107
02:11:45,780 --> 02:11:48,179
so in this case there's some indication

3108
02:11:48,179 --> 02:11:50,280
about how

3109
02:11:50,280 --> 02:11:53,699
uh things work in terms of AD tracking

3110
02:11:53,699 --> 02:11:57,179
within tick tock but again going back to

3111
02:11:57,179 --> 02:11:58,739
the ad industry

3112
02:11:58,739 --> 02:12:01,320
um the ad Industries kind of whole MO is

3113
02:12:01,320 --> 02:12:02,760
to try to know everything I can around

3114
02:12:02,760 --> 02:12:04,500
about you and track you as you go around

3115
02:12:04,500 --> 02:12:06,239
as much as they can as much of the

3116
02:12:06,239 --> 02:12:08,040
internet as POS as it possibly can

3117
02:12:08,040 --> 02:12:09,540
extend to

3118
02:12:09,540 --> 02:12:13,260
uh there's also some interesting kind of

3119
02:12:13,260 --> 02:12:15,599
assumptions being made about

3120
02:12:15,599 --> 02:12:17,219
what seemed to be from the compute

3121
02:12:17,219 --> 02:12:18,960
security researchers but maybe just

3122
02:12:18,960 --> 02:12:20,580
cited and parroted by the journalists

3123
02:12:20,580 --> 02:12:22,560
that are basically saying that here's

3124
02:12:22,560 --> 02:12:24,060
some bespoke C plus plus libraries they

3125
02:12:24,060 --> 02:12:25,440
didn't use some that were part of the

3126
02:12:25,440 --> 02:12:29,280
standard like iOS toolkit in this case

3127
02:12:29,280 --> 02:12:30,480
um which for any of you that have

3128
02:12:30,480 --> 02:12:32,880
developed iOS uh apps you know you have

3129
02:12:32,880 --> 02:12:34,380
like the Higg you have like a certain

3130
02:12:34,380 --> 02:12:36,000
sort of standardized set of tools that

3131
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:37,380
you can use but then if you're doing

3132
02:12:37,380 --> 02:12:40,199
something with a very non-standard UI

3133
02:12:40,199 --> 02:12:42,360
uh you kind of have to end up writing a

3134
02:12:42,360 --> 02:12:43,920
lot of stuff from scratch and learning

3135
02:12:43,920 --> 02:12:47,159
opengl and that's lots of fun

3136
02:12:47,159 --> 02:12:49,380
um and in this case the kind of

3137
02:12:49,380 --> 02:12:50,940
assumption being made it's like oh they

3138
02:12:50,940 --> 02:12:52,260
used custom libraries instead of the

3139
02:12:52,260 --> 02:12:55,020
standard ones uh this is totally Pro

3140
02:12:55,020 --> 02:12:56,820
this is probably going to be this is

3141
02:12:56,820 --> 02:12:58,380
probably because they're trying to make

3142
02:12:58,380 --> 02:13:00,119
it harder for us to reverse engineer the

3143
02:13:00,119 --> 02:13:03,420
binary basically and it could have been

3144
02:13:03,420 --> 02:13:05,099
that like I'm not saying and I'm not

3145
02:13:05,099 --> 02:13:06,360
ruling that out that that could have

3146
02:13:06,360 --> 02:13:08,699
actually been the case but in this case

3147
02:13:08,699 --> 02:13:10,500
there's not really much

3148
02:13:10,500 --> 02:13:12,719
kind of uh there's not many other

3149
02:13:12,719 --> 02:13:14,280
possibilities explored like it could

3150
02:13:14,280 --> 02:13:15,960
have been for optimization C plus plus

3151
02:13:15,960 --> 02:13:18,540
is fast you know there could have been

3152
02:13:18,540 --> 02:13:20,099
custom features that may not have been

3153
02:13:20,099 --> 02:13:22,079
available to make with the existing kind

3154
02:13:22,079 --> 02:13:25,260
of like iOS you know sdks that were out

3155
02:13:25,260 --> 02:13:27,179
there at the time

3156
02:13:27,179 --> 02:13:29,579
and in this case uh there's assumptions

3157
02:13:29,579 --> 02:13:31,860
being made about the Baseline of how

3158
02:13:31,860 --> 02:13:34,619
kind of more normal sort of apps work

3159
02:13:34,619 --> 02:13:36,540
like Facebook where it's like well you

3160
02:13:36,540 --> 02:13:38,099
know it's Facebook is different it's

3161
02:13:38,099 --> 02:13:39,420
like it was always the pushback it's

3162
02:13:39,420 --> 02:13:41,400
like well you know you're voluntarily

3163
02:13:41,400 --> 02:13:42,540
you know what you're putting into

3164
02:13:42,540 --> 02:13:43,739
Facebook

3165
02:13:43,739 --> 02:13:46,920
it's not exactly the case and when it

3166
02:13:46,920 --> 02:13:49,199
comes to sharing on Facebook which is

3167
02:13:49,199 --> 02:13:50,699
the kind of example that it sort of

3168
02:13:50,699 --> 02:13:53,400
posed as sort of a comparison uh there's

3169
02:13:53,400 --> 02:13:56,520
a lot done that is not necessarily made

3170
02:13:56,520 --> 02:13:59,340
obvious to the user using Facebook and

3171
02:13:59,340 --> 02:14:01,800
if you were to look at sort of the sort

3172
02:14:01,800 --> 02:14:03,239
of evidence of that you can do things

3173
02:14:03,239 --> 02:14:05,280
like a gdpr request on that Facebook

3174
02:14:05,280 --> 02:14:07,199
data and there's like you know you

3175
02:14:07,199 --> 02:14:09,300
didn't write 138 gigabytes worth of

3176
02:14:09,300 --> 02:14:10,800
status updates like there's more to the

3177
02:14:10,800 --> 02:14:12,119
picture than that there's kind of

3178
02:14:12,119 --> 02:14:14,159
interaction data there's location data

3179
02:14:14,159 --> 02:14:15,780
there's IP addresses there's all these

3180
02:14:15,780 --> 02:14:17,099
other things

3181
02:14:17,099 --> 02:14:18,420
so

3182
02:14:18,420 --> 02:14:20,639
that's the other thing that I think is

3183
02:14:20,639 --> 02:14:21,900
kind of like missing from the equation

3184
02:14:21,900 --> 02:14:23,639
is like when they try to like say like

3185
02:14:23,639 --> 02:14:27,360
this app does this really bad thing it

3186
02:14:27,360 --> 02:14:28,980
could be true but it could be that like

3187
02:14:28,980 --> 02:14:30,540
unfortunately a lot of the other apps

3188
02:14:30,540 --> 02:14:31,800
that you know and love are also doing

3189
02:14:31,800 --> 02:14:33,840
the same kind of terrible things but for

3190
02:14:33,840 --> 02:14:36,440
different owners

3191
02:14:36,719 --> 02:14:39,060
um and yeah in this case like it's easy

3192
02:14:39,060 --> 02:14:40,980
to dunk on Tick Tock like I do it all

3193
02:14:40,980 --> 02:14:43,440
the time I'm guilty of it like and you

3194
02:14:43,440 --> 02:14:44,820
know sometimes that can be a little bit

3195
02:14:44,820 --> 02:14:46,320
or it can come off as a little bit

3196
02:14:46,320 --> 02:14:48,480
pandry uh there are like you know

3197
02:14:48,480 --> 02:14:50,699
potential real concerns about it but I I

3198
02:14:50,699 --> 02:14:52,260
do think that these things should be

3199
02:14:52,260 --> 02:14:53,940
something that is explored a bit more

3200
02:14:53,940 --> 02:14:56,040
transparency rather than just citing to

3201
02:14:56,040 --> 02:14:57,900
studies total that we don't really

3202
02:14:57,900 --> 02:14:58,980
necessarily

3203
02:14:58,980 --> 02:15:01,139
know much about whether they've even

3204
02:15:01,139 --> 02:15:03,719
been like properly peer-reviewed or not

3205
02:15:03,719 --> 02:15:06,480
um let alone being able to read them uh

3206
02:15:06,480 --> 02:15:07,320
and then of course there's just

3207
02:15:07,320 --> 02:15:08,880
assumptions made about like why

3208
02:15:08,880 --> 02:15:10,739
developers do things

3209
02:15:10,739 --> 02:15:12,659
um there's a lot of complex and

3210
02:15:12,659 --> 02:15:14,340
sometimes dumb reasons why developers

3211
02:15:14,340 --> 02:15:16,320
have to make certain design decisions

3212
02:15:16,320 --> 02:15:17,780
that seem

3213
02:15:17,780 --> 02:15:20,400
non-intuitive or non-obvious as to what

3214
02:15:20,400 --> 02:15:21,840
the goal are

3215
02:15:21,840 --> 02:15:23,099
um and if anybody that's been a

3216
02:15:23,099 --> 02:15:24,300
developer you know you know what I'm

3217
02:15:24,300 --> 02:15:25,800
talking about

3218
02:15:25,800 --> 02:15:26,460
um

3219
02:15:26,460 --> 02:15:29,340
and yeah in this case like there's lots

3220
02:15:29,340 --> 02:15:30,599
of terrible things that apps do but

3221
02:15:30,599 --> 02:15:32,340
unfortunately these are not known as

3222
02:15:32,340 --> 02:15:34,920
being the same kind of terrible things

3223
02:15:34,920 --> 02:15:37,679
at other very normal apps do so that's

3224
02:15:37,679 --> 02:15:39,179
something to think about all right and

3225
02:15:39,179 --> 02:15:41,520
now we're going to talk about actual

3226
02:15:41,520 --> 02:15:44,360
bull shiitake

3227
02:15:45,179 --> 02:15:47,780
I just want to

3228
02:15:49,679 --> 02:15:51,599
put it oh no I didn't want to put it in

3229
02:15:51,599 --> 02:15:53,159
a size since you said C plus plus that

3230
02:15:53,159 --> 02:15:54,659
you guys should be writing your new apps

3231
02:15:54,659 --> 02:15:57,440
in memory safe code

3232
02:15:58,079 --> 02:15:59,880
all about memory safe code

3233
02:15:59,880 --> 02:16:03,119
all right so this is from ABC Australia

3234
02:16:03,119 --> 02:16:05,579
um again great news Outlet actually I

3235
02:16:05,579 --> 02:16:07,440
had the privilege to like visit them as

3236
02:16:07,440 --> 02:16:10,380
part of my work at fpf UH years ago

3237
02:16:10,380 --> 02:16:12,900
uh but this is this is one of those

3238
02:16:12,900 --> 02:16:15,360
stories that has just always in by a

3239
02:16:15,360 --> 02:16:16,079
different author by a different

3240
02:16:16,079 --> 02:16:17,639
publication it's just every single year

3241
02:16:17,639 --> 02:16:19,260
it's kind of the same thing it's like

3242
02:16:19,260 --> 02:16:21,420
your WhatsApp messages your signal

3243
02:16:21,420 --> 02:16:24,840
messages you know broke in they can cops

3244
02:16:24,840 --> 02:16:26,400
can break into them the authorities can

3245
02:16:26,400 --> 02:16:28,079
read them look it's all you know

3246
02:16:28,079 --> 02:16:29,639
encryption doesn't work

3247
02:16:29,639 --> 02:16:31,320
and they're always wrong and they're

3248
02:16:31,320 --> 02:16:33,299
always wrong in the same way

3249
02:16:33,299 --> 02:16:34,978
um so this is just kind of a perennial

3250
02:16:34,978 --> 02:16:37,580
sort of thing that happens every year

3251
02:16:37,580 --> 02:16:42,179
uh there is a you know kind of vague

3252
02:16:42,179 --> 02:16:44,898
sort of thing a claim made by

3253
02:16:44,898 --> 02:16:48,058
counter corruption agency within the

3254
02:16:48,058 --> 02:16:49,500
Australian federal government that

3255
02:16:49,500 --> 02:16:51,959
basically investigates elected officials

3256
02:16:51,959 --> 02:16:53,519
to make sure that they're not corrupt I

3257
02:16:53,519 --> 02:16:54,359
guess

3258
02:16:54,359 --> 02:16:56,459
and in this case they mentioned

3259
02:16:56,459 --> 02:16:57,540
something about like these could be

3260
02:16:57,540 --> 02:17:01,019
tapped and uh that could mean many many

3261
02:17:01,019 --> 02:17:02,459
different things but it also could mean

3262
02:17:02,459 --> 02:17:03,898
that the person saying that and making

3263
02:17:03,898 --> 02:17:05,398
that claim maybe doesn't necessarily

3264
02:17:05,398 --> 02:17:06,780
understand

3265
02:17:06,780 --> 02:17:08,580
how people have been able to get into

3266
02:17:08,580 --> 02:17:09,898
these kind of messages in the past

3267
02:17:09,898 --> 02:17:12,240
generally speaking

3268
02:17:12,240 --> 02:17:14,218
interception is what we so what we would

3269
02:17:14,218 --> 02:17:15,959
call a wiretap what we know it as the

3270
02:17:15,959 --> 02:17:17,580
United States and in Australia is

3271
02:17:17,580 --> 02:17:19,320
basically an interception in between two

3272
02:17:19,320 --> 02:17:21,540
endpoints um

3273
02:17:21,540 --> 02:17:24,299
normally though when we do see these

3274
02:17:24,299 --> 02:17:25,859
kind of stories and the thing that has

3275
02:17:25,859 --> 02:17:27,299
kind of brought and revealed as being

3276
02:17:27,299 --> 02:17:29,340
evidence of like tapping happening is

3277
02:17:29,340 --> 02:17:33,058
normally just a unencrypted copy of the

3278
02:17:33,058 --> 02:17:35,398
same content in a backup even either in

3279
02:17:35,398 --> 02:17:38,519
Google Drive or iCloud where it's not

3280
02:17:38,519 --> 02:17:41,879
end-to-end encrypted so that's usually

3281
02:17:41,879 --> 02:17:43,679
what that story ends up meaning in this

3282
02:17:43,679 --> 02:17:45,058
case they didn't even go this far as to

3283
02:17:45,058 --> 02:17:46,200
provide evidence they just made the

3284
02:17:46,200 --> 02:17:47,718
claim we could tap you

3285
02:17:47,718 --> 02:17:50,638
Australia I don't know

3286
02:17:50,638 --> 02:17:53,700
um and in this case there it could be

3287
02:17:53,700 --> 02:17:54,718
that they were alluding to something

3288
02:17:54,718 --> 02:17:57,740
else it could be like we have

3289
02:17:57,740 --> 02:18:01,138
uh Pegasus but it's Australian so it's

3290
02:18:01,138 --> 02:18:04,558
like kangaroo with wings I don't know

3291
02:18:04,558 --> 02:18:06,840
and we can infect the end points and

3292
02:18:06,840 --> 02:18:09,058
thus look at the messages or it could be

3293
02:18:09,058 --> 02:18:11,638
you know we can still subpoena Apple and

3294
02:18:11,638 --> 02:18:13,138
Google like we have been for the past

3295
02:18:13,138 --> 02:18:15,299
like 12 years

3296
02:18:15,299 --> 02:18:18,660
um we don't know I think if the reporter

3297
02:18:18,660 --> 02:18:20,459
wanted to get a more accurate story they

3298
02:18:20,459 --> 02:18:21,780
could have maybe followed up on that and

3299
02:18:21,780 --> 02:18:25,379
they're like what do you mean by tapped

3300
02:18:25,379 --> 02:18:27,478
uh and yeah in this case like sometimes

3301
02:18:27,478 --> 02:18:28,859
politicians don't necessarily know what

3302
02:18:28,859 --> 02:18:30,959
the capabilities of Technology are

3303
02:18:30,959 --> 02:18:32,519
um they're not necessarily always at

3304
02:18:32,519 --> 02:18:34,620
this talk every single year like raise

3305
02:18:34,620 --> 02:18:37,459
your hand if you're an elected official

3306
02:18:37,459 --> 02:18:39,299
yeah

3307
02:18:39,299 --> 02:18:40,799
so

3308
02:18:40,799 --> 02:18:42,898
and uh in this case like I think

3309
02:18:42,898 --> 02:18:46,320
something that I think is commonly like

3310
02:18:46,320 --> 02:18:47,879
taught I think would be taught in

3311
02:18:47,879 --> 02:18:49,379
journalism school I think it is like

3312
02:18:49,379 --> 02:18:50,700
basically like don't just trust

3313
02:18:50,700 --> 02:18:52,138
everything the government says like it's

3314
02:18:52,138 --> 02:18:54,540
kind of your job description

3315
02:18:54,540 --> 02:18:57,240
um and people should do that I think I

3316
02:18:57,240 --> 02:18:58,679
think that's a good idea

3317
02:18:58,679 --> 02:19:02,040
and it could also just be again it this

3318
02:19:02,040 --> 02:19:04,859
could be a public relations person that

3319
02:19:04,859 --> 02:19:06,780
maybe it was kind of a game of telephone

3320
02:19:06,780 --> 02:19:08,638
they heard about it's like well we can

3321
02:19:08,638 --> 02:19:11,879
subpoena like Google an apple and then

3322
02:19:11,879 --> 02:19:14,760
they're like oh right crocky and then

3323
02:19:14,760 --> 02:19:16,799
basically so I'm so sorry for every

3324
02:19:16,799 --> 02:19:18,478
Australian industry I apologize I'm

3325
02:19:18,478 --> 02:19:20,340
buying a pair of blood Stones I'm

3326
02:19:20,340 --> 02:19:21,599
supporting your economy please don't

3327
02:19:21,599 --> 02:19:23,218
hate me

3328
02:19:23,218 --> 02:19:25,799
um so basically that could be what's

3329
02:19:25,799 --> 02:19:28,799
going on and you know it happens

3330
02:19:28,799 --> 02:19:30,540
oh all right I'll let you take this next

3331
02:19:30,540 --> 02:19:34,320
one okay so this next one was um

3332
02:19:34,320 --> 02:19:36,840
uh about how Instagram took down some

3333
02:19:36,840 --> 02:19:39,840
posts uh even though they didn't really

3334
02:19:39,840 --> 02:19:41,280
have to

3335
02:19:41,280 --> 02:19:44,459
um they they will take it down under a

3336
02:19:44,459 --> 02:19:46,379
request from a politician and say that

3337
02:19:46,379 --> 02:19:47,879
it breaks certain rules even when it

3338
02:19:47,879 --> 02:19:49,620
doesn't I think everybody can relate to

3339
02:19:49,620 --> 02:19:51,300
having had something taken down for some

3340
02:19:51,300 --> 02:19:52,800
dumb reason

3341
02:19:52,800 --> 02:19:54,600
um which is maybe why and so like

3342
02:19:54,600 --> 02:19:56,340
thinking that maybe there's like a

3343
02:19:56,340 --> 02:19:58,920
controversial x-check program where they

3344
02:19:58,920 --> 02:20:01,320
will do this behind the scenes for

3345
02:20:01,320 --> 02:20:04,380
nefarious reasons uh kind of got a lot

3346
02:20:04,380 --> 02:20:06,060
of traffic

3347
02:20:06,060 --> 02:20:08,160
um but apparently like all Vena actually

3348
02:20:08,160 --> 02:20:10,140
came out and said this internal email is

3349
02:20:10,140 --> 02:20:12,300
fake the URL is not in use here's

3350
02:20:12,300 --> 02:20:14,220
evidence that it's wrong and then the

3351
02:20:14,220 --> 02:20:15,960
wire eventually retracted the article

3352
02:20:15,960 --> 02:20:17,640
but before they retracted it they

3353
02:20:17,640 --> 02:20:19,740
doubled down and like posted all this

3354
02:20:19,740 --> 02:20:21,180
evidence that also ended up being

3355
02:20:21,180 --> 02:20:22,979
fabricated

3356
02:20:22,979 --> 02:20:25,380
um so yeah it's uh the entire story was

3357
02:20:25,380 --> 02:20:27,120
retracted

3358
02:20:27,120 --> 02:20:29,760
um there was no special privilege system

3359
02:20:29,760 --> 02:20:31,859
that made meta review content and then

3360
02:20:31,859 --> 02:20:34,320
take it down if the high profile user

3361
02:20:34,320 --> 02:20:35,840
ask them to

3362
02:20:35,840 --> 02:20:38,160
without violating platform guidelines

3363
02:20:38,160 --> 02:20:40,319
that didn't actually happen and the

3364
02:20:40,319 --> 02:20:42,540
annoying thing is that like I really

3365
02:20:42,540 --> 02:20:43,800
hate it when we've talked about

3366
02:20:43,800 --> 02:20:45,780
Bloomberg before when you published a

3367
02:20:45,780 --> 02:20:47,220
story and everybody is telling you it's

3368
02:20:47,220 --> 02:20:48,899
wrong and instead of like taking a close

3369
02:20:48,899 --> 02:20:51,600
look at it you like double down and so

3370
02:20:51,600 --> 02:20:53,040
that's what they did here before they

3371
02:20:53,040 --> 02:20:55,620
took it down is they kept posting more

3372
02:20:55,620 --> 02:20:57,420
stories saying like oh these will

3373
02:20:57,420 --> 02:20:59,040
bolster The credibility of the original

3374
02:20:59,040 --> 02:21:00,600
story and then they ended up having to

3375
02:21:00,600 --> 02:21:02,120
retract everything

3376
02:21:02,120 --> 02:21:04,859
so the story was incorrect the internal

3377
02:21:04,859 --> 02:21:06,780
report email and corroboration from

3378
02:21:06,780 --> 02:21:09,780
experts were all fabricated it is a very

3379
02:21:09,780 --> 02:21:11,399
bad sign and again we've seen this with

3380
02:21:11,399 --> 02:21:13,020
Bloomberg but it doesn't happen that

3381
02:21:13,020 --> 02:21:16,020
often where like experts who were like I

3382
02:21:16,020 --> 02:21:17,340
was quoted in here but I didn't actually

3383
02:21:17,340 --> 02:21:19,800
say what they said I said

3384
02:21:19,800 --> 02:21:21,960
um that happened and uh and when the

3385
02:21:21,960 --> 02:21:24,359
companies actually go out and say this

3386
02:21:24,359 --> 02:21:26,040
is incorrect or fabricated like that

3387
02:21:26,040 --> 02:21:28,620
doesn't happen often PR people usually

3388
02:21:28,620 --> 02:21:30,300
like do sleight of hand instead of just

3389
02:21:30,300 --> 02:21:32,899
saying like this is flat out Incorrect

3390
02:21:32,899 --> 02:21:35,939
and so my advice is to stop doubling and

3391
02:21:35,939 --> 02:21:37,439
tripling down I mean sometimes people

3392
02:21:37,439 --> 02:21:38,939
tell you something is wrong when it's

3393
02:21:38,939 --> 02:21:41,160
not that happens a lot too but I think

3394
02:21:41,160 --> 02:21:43,020
it at least deserves like taking a close

3395
02:21:43,020 --> 02:21:44,399
look at how do you know this information

3396
02:21:44,399 --> 02:21:47,580
and the wire eventually filed a police

3397
02:21:47,580 --> 02:21:49,680
complaint accusing a co-author actually

3398
02:21:49,680 --> 02:21:51,000
I wrote co-author it might have been a

3399
02:21:51,000 --> 02:21:53,520
researcher actually a fabrication and

3400
02:21:53,520 --> 02:21:56,640
forgery of documents and so it's kind of

3401
02:21:56,640 --> 02:21:58,020
tough because it's like if you're

3402
02:21:58,020 --> 02:22:00,060
trusting your people to do a good job

3403
02:22:00,060 --> 02:22:01,560
and they give you information and it

3404
02:22:01,560 --> 02:22:03,000
looks credible to you and then you go

3405
02:22:03,000 --> 02:22:05,280
ahead and publish like like they were

3406
02:22:05,280 --> 02:22:07,979
they were lied to the editors were lied

3407
02:22:07,979 --> 02:22:10,380
to the authors were lied to and so like

3408
02:22:10,380 --> 02:22:12,300
that makes it a little bit tricky but I

3409
02:22:12,300 --> 02:22:14,939
feel like once the companies are saying

3410
02:22:14,939 --> 02:22:16,979
this is fabricated and not in use that's

3411
02:22:16,979 --> 02:22:19,620
when you want to like start looking at

3412
02:22:19,620 --> 02:22:22,640
it much closer

3413
02:22:23,240 --> 02:22:26,220
sure okay

3414
02:22:26,220 --> 02:22:29,939
um so oh okay cool so let's talk about

3415
02:22:29,939 --> 02:22:31,380
what we can do better either as

3416
02:22:31,380 --> 02:22:33,600
journalists security researchers or like

3417
02:22:33,600 --> 02:22:35,460
PR coms teams

3418
02:22:35,460 --> 02:22:37,920
um I'll let you do I will do journalists

3419
02:22:37,920 --> 02:22:38,880
So like

3420
02:22:38,880 --> 02:22:41,280
um uh as as a journalist what you should

3421
02:22:41,280 --> 02:22:42,540
be doing are there journalists in the

3422
02:22:42,540 --> 02:22:43,260
room

3423
02:22:43,260 --> 02:22:44,700
it's okay you don't have to admit it if

3424
02:22:44,700 --> 02:22:47,100
you are there's a few

3425
02:22:47,100 --> 02:22:49,500
um talk to subject matter experts to put

3426
02:22:49,500 --> 02:22:51,120
stuff in context that's not always easy

3427
02:22:51,120 --> 02:22:53,100
on it deadline um sometimes people don't

3428
02:22:53,100 --> 02:22:55,020
want to talk to you it takes a while to

3429
02:22:55,020 --> 02:22:57,600
build up those sources but I think it's

3430
02:22:57,600 --> 02:23:00,120
really really important uh like like

3431
02:23:00,120 --> 02:23:02,520
could could I be wrong about this like

3432
02:23:02,520 --> 02:23:05,280
is is voting Village really the same as

3433
02:23:05,280 --> 02:23:07,500
cyber ninjas like who should I talk to

3434
02:23:07,500 --> 02:23:09,960
to get information about it and uh and

3435
02:23:09,960 --> 02:23:11,700
you want to talk to not uh like

3436
02:23:11,700 --> 02:23:12,780
different types of subject matter

3437
02:23:12,780 --> 02:23:15,540
experts and some of them might uh tell

3438
02:23:15,540 --> 02:23:17,280
you that you're wrong and lean on your

3439
02:23:17,280 --> 02:23:19,020
editors and fact Checkers make sure your

3440
02:23:19,020 --> 02:23:21,660
information is 100 solid that includes

3441
02:23:21,660 --> 02:23:23,460
that of your co-authors your sources

3442
02:23:23,460 --> 02:23:25,500
your Consultants

3443
02:23:25,500 --> 02:23:27,180
um and I think like where people really

3444
02:23:27,180 --> 02:23:28,560
get tripped up is if they really don't

3445
02:23:28,560 --> 02:23:30,300
like a company whether it's meta or

3446
02:23:30,300 --> 02:23:32,040
Google or Tick Tock or whatever and they

3447
02:23:32,040 --> 02:23:33,780
just want to assume the worst like like

3448
02:23:33,780 --> 02:23:36,000
I know there's something in here and you

3449
02:23:36,000 --> 02:23:37,500
want to pay close attention to the

3450
02:23:37,500 --> 02:23:38,819
assumptions that you're making because

3451
02:23:38,819 --> 02:23:40,500
if you don't have evidence for it then

3452
02:23:40,500 --> 02:23:42,060
you shouldn't publish it because it's

3453
02:23:42,060 --> 02:23:43,560
going to make you look really bad and

3454
02:23:43,560 --> 02:23:45,240
feel worse when you have to like admit

3455
02:23:45,240 --> 02:23:46,800
you were wrong or you could just keep

3456
02:23:46,800 --> 02:23:48,540
doubling down forever and get roasted

3457
02:23:48,540 --> 02:23:51,420
that's cool too uh and then look for

3458
02:23:51,420 --> 02:23:52,920
conflicting information that might

3459
02:23:52,920 --> 02:23:54,479
disprove or at least complicate your

3460
02:23:54,479 --> 02:23:56,640
thesis and I do this all the time and a

3461
02:23:56,640 --> 02:23:58,620
lot of times it's um like I'm one of

3462
02:23:58,620 --> 02:23:59,580
those people that will read every

3463
02:23:59,580 --> 02:24:01,260
comment and read it through it and

3464
02:24:01,260 --> 02:24:03,479
Twitter Thread about stuff that I write

3465
02:24:03,479 --> 02:24:04,979
and like that makes me probably easier

3466
02:24:04,979 --> 02:24:07,439
to troll and a lot of times oh I just

3467
02:24:07,439 --> 02:24:08,640
spend eight hours thinking something

3468
02:24:08,640 --> 02:24:09,660
might have been wrong and it wasn't

3469
02:24:09,660 --> 02:24:11,100
wrong but like every once in a while

3470
02:24:11,100 --> 02:24:12,720
there's something in there that I'm like

3471
02:24:12,720 --> 02:24:15,240
oh this is a very interesting angle that

3472
02:24:15,240 --> 02:24:17,340
I hadn't considered and if you can throw

3473
02:24:17,340 --> 02:24:19,319
that into your next reporting I think it

3474
02:24:19,319 --> 02:24:21,420
makes you like phenomenally better as a

3475
02:24:21,420 --> 02:24:23,780
journalist

3476
02:24:23,819 --> 02:24:25,140
thank you

3477
02:24:25,140 --> 02:24:27,780
and for security researchers

3478
02:24:27,780 --> 02:24:29,520
um it's a good idea to call out Bad

3479
02:24:29,520 --> 02:24:31,380
actors in the space

3480
02:24:31,380 --> 02:24:32,700
um who may be sort of like

3481
02:24:32,700 --> 02:24:35,340
fear-mongering or making just really

3482
02:24:35,340 --> 02:24:37,920
really really assumptive or like like

3483
02:24:37,920 --> 02:24:40,200
blatantly false claims about

3484
02:24:40,200 --> 02:24:42,540
uh things being hacked or not being

3485
02:24:42,540 --> 02:24:46,500
hacked or uh you know making some spicy

3486
02:24:46,500 --> 02:24:48,899
tweets that try to make the most Edge

3487
02:24:48,899 --> 02:24:50,939
wording claims about how things are

3488
02:24:50,939 --> 02:24:52,620
working

3489
02:24:52,620 --> 02:24:56,040
um and also making yourself uh if you do

3490
02:24:56,040 --> 02:24:59,340
security research and you're wrong you

3491
02:24:59,340 --> 02:25:00,780
are in a position to disclose it

3492
02:25:00,780 --> 02:25:02,340
publicly like

3493
02:25:02,340 --> 02:25:04,859
I would encourage people doing that to

3494
02:25:04,859 --> 02:25:07,080
to do that to basically uh share our

3495
02:25:07,080 --> 02:25:08,520
work it's it's kind of the spirit of

3496
02:25:08,520 --> 02:25:10,260
many of these security conferences is

3497
02:25:10,260 --> 02:25:11,819
that we kind of like to do in the work

3498
02:25:11,819 --> 02:25:13,920
and transparently in the open so that we

3499
02:25:13,920 --> 02:25:16,439
can all learn from each other

3500
02:25:16,439 --> 02:25:17,939
um and then I didn't add this in time

3501
02:25:17,939 --> 02:25:19,380
but basically making yourself available

3502
02:25:19,380 --> 02:25:21,479
to secure it to journalists that are

3503
02:25:21,479 --> 02:25:24,060
covering the speed as experts

3504
02:25:24,060 --> 02:25:25,260
um journalists are going to need

3505
02:25:25,260 --> 02:25:27,479
somebody to help them like fact check

3506
02:25:27,479 --> 02:25:28,859
some of the claims that they're hearing

3507
02:25:28,859 --> 02:25:31,859
and you could be part of uh being the

3508
02:25:31,859 --> 02:25:33,060
solution for that

3509
02:25:33,060 --> 02:25:35,040
and then last but not least

3510
02:25:35,040 --> 02:25:36,960
um just to like for everybody no matter

3511
02:25:36,960 --> 02:25:38,460
what your profession

3512
02:25:38,460 --> 02:25:41,040
um don't assume like I I used to work at

3513
02:25:41,040 --> 02:25:44,220
a grocery store and I remember my boss

3514
02:25:44,220 --> 02:25:47,520
Rick I forget why this was but he was

3515
02:25:47,520 --> 02:25:49,439
like don't assume because it makes an

3516
02:25:49,439 --> 02:25:51,780
ass out of you and me

3517
02:25:51,780 --> 02:25:54,240
um so I took that lesson to heart and I

3518
02:25:54,240 --> 02:25:57,000
encourage everybody to do the same uh

3519
02:25:57,000 --> 02:25:59,100
you know maybe people are using C plus

3520
02:25:59,100 --> 02:26:01,500
plus libraries uh for reasons that are

3521
02:26:01,500 --> 02:26:04,200
making them sigh and not because you

3522
02:26:04,200 --> 02:26:05,760
know they're funneling all your data to

3523
02:26:05,760 --> 02:26:07,380
Beijing you know there's lots of reasons

3524
02:26:07,380 --> 02:26:09,960
why people would be doing things

3525
02:26:09,960 --> 02:26:11,399
uh

3526
02:26:11,399 --> 02:26:12,960
I wrote These but you can talk about

3527
02:26:12,960 --> 02:26:15,120
them I don't know uh do's and does for

3528
02:26:15,120 --> 02:26:17,280
comms teams uh fact check like a

3529
02:26:17,280 --> 02:26:18,899
journalist Don't just run statements by

3530
02:26:18,899 --> 02:26:20,700
your legal team ask your tech savvy

3531
02:26:20,700 --> 02:26:22,439
colleagues to give your copy list of

3532
02:26:22,439 --> 02:26:24,240
tests and I think a lot of tech teams

3533
02:26:24,240 --> 02:26:27,359
actually will blame uh your comps like

3534
02:26:27,359 --> 02:26:28,979
their comms teams when they're like oh I

3535
02:26:28,979 --> 02:26:30,600
know all the information on our site is

3536
02:26:30,600 --> 02:26:32,760
wrong and that's just our comms team so

3537
02:26:32,760 --> 02:26:34,140
I think like this should be a group

3538
02:26:34,140 --> 02:26:36,180
effort where like people participate on

3539
02:26:36,180 --> 02:26:37,859
it together

3540
02:26:37,859 --> 02:26:40,500
um and cultivate experts for sensitive

3541
02:26:40,500 --> 02:26:41,700
testing there's probably a few here

3542
02:26:41,700 --> 02:26:44,760
today like who can help um with that and

3543
02:26:44,760 --> 02:26:46,020
be more available to answer questions

3544
02:26:46,020 --> 02:26:47,520
from journalists

3545
02:26:47,520 --> 02:26:49,080
um no comment and could not be reached

3546
02:26:49,080 --> 02:26:51,479
for comment or not a great look and

3547
02:26:51,479 --> 02:26:53,040
actually there's one I would add that I

3548
02:26:53,040 --> 02:26:55,080
just thought about when I listen uh I

3549
02:26:55,080 --> 02:26:56,399
was talking to Melania who's my favorite

3550
02:26:56,399 --> 02:26:59,580
columns person ever from discernible who

3551
02:26:59,580 --> 02:27:01,020
was like

3552
02:27:01,020 --> 02:27:02,520
um you if somebody writes something

3553
02:27:02,520 --> 02:27:05,280
about your company that's true like

3554
02:27:05,280 --> 02:27:07,380
that's not like maybe you should change

3555
02:27:07,380 --> 02:27:09,000
the thing that they are writing about

3556
02:27:09,000 --> 02:27:10,319
instead of like being like Oh

3557
02:27:10,319 --> 02:27:12,180
journalists these days and like all

3558
02:27:12,180 --> 02:27:15,479
journalists are liars like if there are

3559
02:27:15,479 --> 02:27:17,460
things about your company that are bad

3560
02:27:17,460 --> 02:27:19,439
and people do not know about it yet then

3561
02:27:19,439 --> 02:27:21,359
that's a liability and you want to close

3562
02:27:21,359 --> 02:27:23,580
up those gaps before people find out

3563
02:27:23,580 --> 02:27:25,800
about it so then you can spend more time

3564
02:27:25,800 --> 02:27:27,600
doing your job and less time kind of

3565
02:27:27,600 --> 02:27:29,520
ranting about how journalists are evil

3566
02:27:29,520 --> 02:27:31,819
or whatever

3567
02:27:32,580 --> 02:27:36,479
cool so that concludes our annual roasts

3568
02:27:36,479 --> 02:27:39,960
uh does anybody have any questions that

3569
02:27:39,960 --> 02:27:41,580
they'd like to ask

3570
02:27:41,580 --> 02:27:45,319
oh yeah we have a question right here

3571
02:27:46,500 --> 02:27:48,899
across the room I'm always scared of

3572
02:27:48,899 --> 02:27:52,680
throwing that badly oh yeah um

3573
02:27:52,680 --> 02:27:54,780
from the Cyber threat intelligence

3574
02:27:54,780 --> 02:27:57,000
community and and writing in that

3575
02:27:57,000 --> 02:27:58,260
Community is

3576
02:27:58,260 --> 02:28:01,859
is a bit different because we're writing

3577
02:28:01,859 --> 02:28:05,700
for trust circles and we're often riding

3578
02:28:05,700 --> 02:28:08,280
in situations where we need to get the

3579
02:28:08,280 --> 02:28:10,680
information out quickly

3580
02:28:10,680 --> 02:28:12,840
so that people can action on it the

3581
02:28:12,840 --> 02:28:15,359
defender's connection on it but we also

3582
02:28:15,359 --> 02:28:18,479
have great uncertainty so there is a

3583
02:28:18,479 --> 02:28:21,600
best practice that we use called using

3584
02:28:21,600 --> 02:28:24,720
words of estimative probability

3585
02:28:24,720 --> 02:28:27,600
so you'll often see when you read some

3586
02:28:27,600 --> 02:28:29,399
of these reports

3587
02:28:29,399 --> 02:28:32,640
we you know we state with high level of

3588
02:28:32,640 --> 02:28:35,280
confidence or we state with a moderate

3589
02:28:35,280 --> 02:28:37,140
level of confidence

3590
02:28:37,140 --> 02:28:40,920
so would you ever need to use words of

3591
02:28:40,920 --> 02:28:44,880
estimative probability in journalism I

3592
02:28:44,880 --> 02:28:46,020
for the public

3593
02:28:46,020 --> 02:28:48,120
I feel like we have to do a little bit

3594
02:28:48,120 --> 02:28:49,920
of estimate of probability in journalism

3595
02:28:49,920 --> 02:28:52,560
and that we um like we'll say that

3596
02:28:52,560 --> 02:28:54,240
something is potentially misleading

3597
02:28:54,240 --> 02:28:56,040
instead of misleading if we don't know

3598
02:28:56,040 --> 02:28:57,840
that it actually has misled people but

3599
02:28:57,840 --> 02:29:01,260
we think that it could or this might

3600
02:29:01,260 --> 02:29:03,120
some of this is like a little bit of

3601
02:29:03,120 --> 02:29:04,380
hedging because we don't know for

3602
02:29:04,380 --> 02:29:06,780
certain whether something has been

3603
02:29:06,780 --> 02:29:08,580
exploited or not like we'll definitely

3604
02:29:08,580 --> 02:29:11,580
explain that and then also include a

3605
02:29:11,580 --> 02:29:13,500
quote from the company

3606
02:29:13,500 --> 02:29:15,060
um but yeah I think it's good to say

3607
02:29:15,060 --> 02:29:16,439
like we think this might have happened

3608
02:29:16,439 --> 02:29:17,819
but no don't know for sure I think

3609
02:29:17,819 --> 02:29:19,140
that's even more important when you're

3610
02:29:19,140 --> 02:29:21,240
trying to do attribution for hacks like

3611
02:29:21,240 --> 02:29:23,280
and like everybody you know is like it's

3612
02:29:23,280 --> 02:29:24,840
definitely China or it's definitely

3613
02:29:24,840 --> 02:29:26,819
Russia and you don't really know like

3614
02:29:26,819 --> 02:29:29,580
like so the sources believe or people

3615
02:29:29,580 --> 02:29:31,620
think that it might be this and here's

3616
02:29:31,620 --> 02:29:33,420
their evidence but without like outright

3617
02:29:33,420 --> 02:29:35,640
stating like this is definitively the

3618
02:29:35,640 --> 02:29:37,439
case and then the other thing that about

3619
02:29:37,439 --> 02:29:39,540
journalism is that you can you can write

3620
02:29:39,540 --> 02:29:41,220
corrections I do corrections when I have

3621
02:29:41,220 --> 02:29:43,560
errors in my work like sometimes people

3622
02:29:43,560 --> 02:29:45,060
think things are errors that are not

3623
02:29:45,060 --> 02:29:46,620
actually errors they just don't like it

3624
02:29:46,620 --> 02:29:49,080
or would have worded it differently or

3625
02:29:49,080 --> 02:29:50,580
it didn't include all of the information

3626
02:29:50,580 --> 02:29:53,160
that they would have included but if

3627
02:29:53,160 --> 02:29:55,080
there's an actual factual error like

3628
02:29:55,080 --> 02:29:57,180
like journalists will update it and I

3629
02:29:57,180 --> 02:29:59,280
kind of wish there was more like I feel

3630
02:29:59,280 --> 02:30:00,479
like it's sort of like if you're a

3631
02:30:00,479 --> 02:30:02,100
developer and there's a bug and you fix

3632
02:30:02,100 --> 02:30:03,840
the bug like that's a good thing and I

3633
02:30:03,840 --> 02:30:05,340
feel like correcting errors is a good

3634
02:30:05,340 --> 02:30:06,180
thing

3635
02:30:06,180 --> 02:30:07,620
um so sometimes people are like oh this

3636
02:30:07,620 --> 02:30:09,120
article had an error that's proof that

3637
02:30:09,120 --> 02:30:11,220
journalists is horrible and I'm like no

3638
02:30:11,220 --> 02:30:13,380
like they had an error they corrected it

3639
02:30:13,380 --> 02:30:15,120
and now it is correct and I feel like

3640
02:30:15,120 --> 02:30:17,399
people should get kudos for like being

3641
02:30:17,399 --> 02:30:19,920
honest about that and and correcting

3642
02:30:19,920 --> 02:30:22,760
that did you

3643
02:30:23,040 --> 02:30:25,020
yeah I think that kind of sums that up

3644
02:30:25,020 --> 02:30:28,200
there is a lot of sort of we I think in

3645
02:30:28,200 --> 02:30:29,939
in the writing especially

3646
02:30:29,939 --> 02:30:31,680
in the kind of more some of the articles

3647
02:30:31,680 --> 02:30:33,420
that I wrote about reviews and things

3648
02:30:33,420 --> 02:30:35,580
like that we try to look at things that

3649
02:30:35,580 --> 02:30:37,380
could be measured like pretty

3650
02:30:37,380 --> 02:30:39,840
objectively like things like

3651
02:30:39,840 --> 02:30:42,300
VPN speed for example like we have

3652
02:30:42,300 --> 02:30:43,800
standardized ways of engineering that

3653
02:30:43,800 --> 02:30:45,300
and disclosing that and we can like

3654
02:30:45,300 --> 02:30:48,000
provide stats on that for example and

3655
02:30:48,000 --> 02:30:49,380
then for other things you can say like

3656
02:30:49,380 --> 02:30:51,540
you know this is what we think

3657
02:30:51,540 --> 02:30:53,280
this is the evidence that is provided

3658
02:30:53,280 --> 02:30:54,840
that says like something is trustworthy

3659
02:30:54,840 --> 02:30:56,280
for example we might include a link to

3660
02:30:56,280 --> 02:30:58,620
like a security audit and say like based

3661
02:30:58,620 --> 02:31:00,600
on what the security audit says like we

3662
02:31:00,600 --> 02:31:02,280
we think this

3663
02:31:02,280 --> 02:31:04,859
um but we kind of make sure to link

3664
02:31:04,859 --> 02:31:06,660
those claims back to whoever was making

3665
02:31:06,660 --> 02:31:09,180
them so that people know like where to

3666
02:31:09,180 --> 02:31:10,319
follow up on

3667
02:31:10,319 --> 02:31:12,180
yep

3668
02:31:12,180 --> 02:31:14,460
um oh we have one question back there uh

3669
02:31:14,460 --> 02:31:16,080
do you think a new legislation that's

3670
02:31:16,080 --> 02:31:18,060
requiring publicly traded companies to

3671
02:31:18,060 --> 02:31:21,540
report cyber incidents will increase the

3672
02:31:21,540 --> 02:31:25,040
accuracy of some of this reporting

3673
02:31:25,080 --> 02:31:27,859
I hope so

3674
02:31:27,899 --> 02:31:29,939
um if you have thoughts I know it

3675
02:31:29,939 --> 02:31:31,260
depends on if people actually can access

3676
02:31:31,260 --> 02:31:33,479
it I do think though like

3677
02:31:33,479 --> 02:31:35,399
there's a lot of like throw clearing

3678
02:31:35,399 --> 02:31:38,599
that can happen in stories

3679
02:31:38,640 --> 02:31:40,800
ironically I had to clear my throat well

3680
02:31:40,800 --> 02:31:43,319
I said that and like um sometimes that

3681
02:31:43,319 --> 02:31:44,880
makes it more difficult for the reader

3682
02:31:44,880 --> 02:31:46,380
so people tend to shy away from the

3683
02:31:46,380 --> 02:31:47,939
level of nuance I think that people in

3684
02:31:47,939 --> 02:31:50,899
this room would appreciate

3685
02:31:54,899 --> 02:31:59,060
all right oh uh we got one more question

3686
02:32:01,080 --> 02:32:04,080
it was it focused a lot on like vetting

3687
02:32:04,080 --> 02:32:05,520
sources that you're going to use for

3688
02:32:05,520 --> 02:32:07,260
something and making sure that you're

3689
02:32:07,260 --> 02:32:08,700
getting credible data and you're not

3690
02:32:08,700 --> 02:32:11,220
using any of these you know

3691
02:32:11,220 --> 02:32:15,000
kind of less than accurate articles is

3692
02:32:15,000 --> 02:32:17,939
there like a are there any tips that you

3693
02:32:17,939 --> 02:32:20,220
use personally to make sure that you've

3694
02:32:20,220 --> 02:32:22,200
vetted an article like how do you go

3695
02:32:22,200 --> 02:32:24,780
through the the sources or just real

3696
02:32:24,780 --> 02:32:27,180
quick to see if it's worth considering

3697
02:32:27,180 --> 02:32:29,580
what what they've what they've written

3698
02:32:29,580 --> 02:32:31,380
yeah I mean I feel like

3699
02:32:31,380 --> 02:32:33,660
so in the articles that I write there

3700
02:32:33,660 --> 02:32:35,640
there's somewhat less directly related

3701
02:32:35,640 --> 02:32:37,380
to cyber security but a lot of the

3702
02:32:37,380 --> 02:32:40,140
processes are the same is that

3703
02:32:40,140 --> 02:32:42,600
the article like for this example I

3704
02:32:42,600 --> 02:32:44,399
helped do an update for a wire cutter

3705
02:32:44,399 --> 02:32:47,340
article about the best VPN and in that

3706
02:32:47,340 --> 02:32:50,939
we try to anticipate the questions that

3707
02:32:50,939 --> 02:32:53,220
readers would ask to basically kind of

3708
02:32:53,220 --> 02:32:55,319
show our work and we include that work

3709
02:32:55,319 --> 02:32:57,660
we basically say like here's the test

3710
02:32:57,660 --> 02:32:59,460
that we run here's exactly the process

3711
02:32:59,460 --> 02:33:01,859
we use like we connected from these

3712
02:33:01,859 --> 02:33:03,840
endpoints in this city using these

3713
02:33:03,840 --> 02:33:06,420
operating systems using these devices on

3714
02:33:06,420 --> 02:33:08,040
whatever kind of like whether Ethernet

3715
02:33:08,040 --> 02:33:10,859
or wired Network or whatever and I think

3716
02:33:10,859 --> 02:33:12,960
generally like if you see someone

3717
02:33:12,960 --> 02:33:15,060
showing their work and sort of like

3718
02:33:15,060 --> 02:33:17,479
putting themselves out there uh

3719
02:33:17,479 --> 02:33:19,800
transparently I think that's always a

3720
02:33:19,800 --> 02:33:21,359
good sign so the more you see articles

3721
02:33:21,359 --> 02:33:23,700
that have more of that the better when

3722
02:33:23,700 --> 02:33:26,280
people start doing things like citing

3723
02:33:26,280 --> 02:33:29,460
you know uh papers that nobody can

3724
02:33:29,460 --> 02:33:34,080
actually read then I start sort of like

3725
02:33:34,080 --> 02:33:36,720
um you know I start being a little bit

3726
02:33:36,720 --> 02:33:38,280
more suspicious I guess of that regard

3727
02:33:38,280 --> 02:33:40,620
and there's no like easy like metric for

3728
02:33:40,620 --> 02:33:42,899
this unfortunately

3729
02:33:42,899 --> 02:33:44,399
um I try to follow reporters that

3730
02:33:44,399 --> 02:33:45,899
generally do good work and they mostly

3731
02:33:45,899 --> 02:33:47,220
do

3732
02:33:47,220 --> 02:33:48,899
um you know some of them are on Twitter

3733
02:33:48,899 --> 02:33:50,819
or Mastodon I guess now

3734
02:33:50,819 --> 02:33:52,920
and uh yeah that's kind of how I've been

3735
02:33:52,920 --> 02:33:55,700
keeping up with with what's going on

3736
02:33:55,700 --> 02:33:58,020
so I if I'm trying to figure out if an

3737
02:33:58,020 --> 02:33:59,700
article is credible I will show it to

3738
02:33:59,700 --> 02:34:01,800
like 10 or I should show it to a lot of

3739
02:34:01,800 --> 02:34:03,899
people if I have questions about it and

3740
02:34:03,899 --> 02:34:06,060
like people who might disagree with each

3741
02:34:06,060 --> 02:34:07,800
other so I'll show it to a red team like

3742
02:34:07,800 --> 02:34:09,540
I'll show it to people I'll be like does

3743
02:34:09,540 --> 02:34:10,979
this sound right this is kind of your

3744
02:34:10,979 --> 02:34:15,240
area and see what they say and like um I

3745
02:34:15,240 --> 02:34:16,740
think you can kind of get a better sense

3746
02:34:16,740 --> 02:34:18,240
of it then but I think there's also like

3747
02:34:18,240 --> 02:34:20,160
areas of disagreement like I just wrote

3748
02:34:20,160 --> 02:34:23,160
a report about memory safety and there

3749
02:34:23,160 --> 02:34:24,780
was a lot of disagreement like even just

3750
02:34:24,780 --> 02:34:26,939
writing it like I was lucky it wasn't it

3751
02:34:26,939 --> 02:34:29,220
was um more like a white paper and so I

3752
02:34:29,220 --> 02:34:30,660
could show it to people before we

3753
02:34:30,660 --> 02:34:32,220
published

3754
02:34:32,220 --> 02:34:34,020
um and like a lot of people who are

3755
02:34:34,020 --> 02:34:36,300
experts disagreed with each other like

3756
02:34:36,300 --> 02:34:38,280
um we were having a lot of kind of

3757
02:34:38,280 --> 02:34:40,920
granular debates about the definition of

3758
02:34:40,920 --> 02:34:44,580
a Sandbox or like um just like different

3759
02:34:44,580 --> 02:34:48,240
like is this and so like um and so my

3760
02:34:48,240 --> 02:34:49,920
job was to kind of try to find a way to

3761
02:34:49,920 --> 02:34:52,859
word it that everybody could live with

3762
02:34:52,859 --> 02:34:55,260
um but I think like even if like a lot

3763
02:34:55,260 --> 02:34:56,580
of people don't like something that

3764
02:34:56,580 --> 02:34:58,800
doesn't mean that it's incorrect but if

3765
02:34:58,800 --> 02:35:00,540
everybody's like this is completely from

3766
02:35:00,540 --> 02:35:03,120
left field and wrong like usually

3767
02:35:03,120 --> 02:35:04,500
there's something there but you have to

3768
02:35:04,500 --> 02:35:05,640
kind of watch out for the group thing

3769
02:35:05,640 --> 02:35:07,800
too which is why I show it to people

3770
02:35:07,800 --> 02:35:10,920
from different types of um

3771
02:35:10,920 --> 02:35:12,899
um backgrounds so that they're not just

3772
02:35:12,899 --> 02:35:15,000
like all kind of glomming on to like oh

3773
02:35:15,000 --> 02:35:16,979
yeah we hate this person who wrote it or

3774
02:35:16,979 --> 02:35:19,160
whatever

3775
02:35:20,100 --> 02:35:23,100
foreign

3776
02:35:23,580 --> 02:35:25,680
so you mentioned uh I like the point

3777
02:35:25,680 --> 02:35:27,540
about uncertainty because I think

3778
02:35:27,540 --> 02:35:28,880
there's a very fine line between

3779
02:35:28,880 --> 02:35:31,740
inaccuracy and uncertainty like every

3780
02:35:31,740 --> 02:35:34,140
time I see an article on cryptography I

3781
02:35:34,140 --> 02:35:36,000
cringe because it's usually terrible

3782
02:35:36,000 --> 02:35:37,740
because cryptography is one of those

3783
02:35:37,740 --> 02:35:40,200
things that's very very very hard to get

3784
02:35:40,200 --> 02:35:41,399
right

3785
02:35:41,399 --> 02:35:43,500
very easy to get wrong and almost

3786
02:35:43,500 --> 02:35:45,180
impossible to know when you've gotten it

3787
02:35:45,180 --> 02:35:47,340
wrong and so for instance Mac then

3788
02:35:47,340 --> 02:35:49,560
encrypt encrypt and Mac one of those is

3789
02:35:49,560 --> 02:35:51,479
correct one of those does nothing for

3790
02:35:51,479 --> 02:35:54,000
you and so

3791
02:35:54,000 --> 02:35:55,859
yeah there's a fine line there and the

3792
02:35:55,859 --> 02:35:57,000
only thing more dangerous than not

3793
02:35:57,000 --> 02:35:58,319
putting information out is putting

3794
02:35:58,319 --> 02:36:00,479
information out that is either false or

3795
02:36:00,479 --> 02:36:02,220
will lead people to the wrong conclusion

3796
02:36:02,220 --> 02:36:03,780
so that they think they have security

3797
02:36:03,780 --> 02:36:06,180
when they don't

3798
02:36:06,180 --> 02:36:07,560
yeah

3799
02:36:07,560 --> 02:36:09,180
so

3800
02:36:09,180 --> 02:36:13,560
um I would say that in terms of

3801
02:36:13,560 --> 02:36:16,380
looking for accuracy generally speaking

3802
02:36:16,380 --> 02:36:19,080
it's hard because going specifically

3803
02:36:19,080 --> 02:36:20,819
your encryption example one of the

3804
02:36:20,819 --> 02:36:23,220
things that always comes to mind is

3805
02:36:23,220 --> 02:36:24,540
as somebody that works for your

3806
02:36:24,540 --> 02:36:25,740
presentation we get journalists

3807
02:36:25,740 --> 02:36:28,680
basically playing this game or they game

3808
02:36:28,680 --> 02:36:30,899
but basically coming up to me be like

3809
02:36:30,899 --> 02:36:33,899
hey is XYZ app good it says encrypted on

3810
02:36:33,899 --> 02:36:35,160
the website I'm like well that could

3811
02:36:35,160 --> 02:36:37,500
mean several different things

3812
02:36:37,500 --> 02:36:39,479
um because normally when a product says

3813
02:36:39,479 --> 02:36:40,560
they're encrypted that usually just

3814
02:36:40,560 --> 02:36:42,899
means that they're they have TLS which

3815
02:36:42,899 --> 02:36:45,660
is not that special frankly

3816
02:36:45,660 --> 02:36:48,720
um and it's worth looking into things

3817
02:36:48,720 --> 02:36:50,760
that would indicate what capabilities

3818
02:36:50,760 --> 02:36:53,520
are there for either the company to read

3819
02:36:53,520 --> 02:36:56,340
that data if possible because ultimately

3820
02:36:56,340 --> 02:36:58,439
like unless we have something like a

3821
02:36:58,439 --> 02:37:00,600
security audit report that finds that

3822
02:37:00,600 --> 02:37:03,000
they implemented the openvpn protocol

3823
02:37:03,000 --> 02:37:05,040
with like a weak Cipher or whatever like

3824
02:37:05,040 --> 02:37:06,660
we're not necessarily going to know

3825
02:37:06,660 --> 02:37:09,660
every single like nut and bolt that went

3826
02:37:09,660 --> 02:37:12,660
into their architecture but we can at

3827
02:37:12,660 --> 02:37:14,580
least see like

3828
02:37:14,580 --> 02:37:17,399
what they are saying they do and then

3829
02:37:17,399 --> 02:37:19,260
kind of say that this is what they claim

3830
02:37:19,260 --> 02:37:21,479
based on what they offer say the offers

3831
02:37:21,479 --> 02:37:22,680
so if they do offer random encryption

3832
02:37:22,680 --> 02:37:24,960
let's say like yeah signal offers

3833
02:37:24,960 --> 02:37:26,819
end-to-end encryption now whether you

3834
02:37:26,819 --> 02:37:28,740
know there may be a bug in that code

3835
02:37:28,740 --> 02:37:31,800
base like we could if possible point to

3836
02:37:31,800 --> 02:37:33,899
audits that basically show that they

3837
02:37:33,899 --> 02:37:35,460
look for that

3838
02:37:35,460 --> 02:37:36,840
um but you know unfortunately like most

3839
02:37:36,840 --> 02:37:39,479
companies don't get security audits done

3840
02:37:39,479 --> 02:37:40,439
for them

3841
02:37:40,439 --> 02:37:42,060
um if you were to look at just most of

3842
02:37:42,060 --> 02:37:43,560
the apps that you use every day they may

3843
02:37:43,560 --> 02:37:44,520
have been they may have a security

3844
02:37:44,520 --> 02:37:46,680
engineer they may have worked with them

3845
02:37:46,680 --> 02:37:48,479
or that works internally with them but

3846
02:37:48,479 --> 02:37:50,160
the practice of

3847
02:37:50,160 --> 02:37:52,319
having a third-party security audit and

3848
02:37:52,319 --> 02:37:55,380
then releasing that sort of like outcome

3849
02:37:55,380 --> 02:37:57,780
to the public to evaluate

3850
02:37:57,780 --> 02:37:59,819
is not that common it is a little bit

3851
02:37:59,819 --> 02:38:01,680
more common in like the VPN industry

3852
02:38:01,680 --> 02:38:03,720
where there's like so much trust that

3853
02:38:03,720 --> 02:38:05,399
has to be put into a third party that

3854
02:38:05,399 --> 02:38:06,899
basically gets to intercept all your

3855
02:38:06,899 --> 02:38:08,460
data

3856
02:38:08,460 --> 02:38:10,380
um but for many other things like it's

3857
02:38:10,380 --> 02:38:11,580
not something we haven't necessarily

3858
02:38:11,580 --> 02:38:13,380
available so I think to tie into your

3859
02:38:13,380 --> 02:38:15,780
VPN example yep I think the problem is

3860
02:38:15,780 --> 02:38:17,880
you need context right all security is

3861
02:38:17,880 --> 02:38:19,740
done with regard to a threat model so

3862
02:38:19,740 --> 02:38:21,840
when people say you should use a VPN

3863
02:38:21,840 --> 02:38:23,760
well maybe what's your threat model if

3864
02:38:23,760 --> 02:38:25,200
you're trying to keep one party from

3865
02:38:25,200 --> 02:38:27,479
spying on you now the VPN has even more

3866
02:38:27,479 --> 02:38:29,880
visibility right so that doesn't protect

3867
02:38:29,880 --> 02:38:31,560
you I have a whole story about that in

3868
02:38:31,560 --> 02:38:33,000
consumer reports about should you use a

3869
02:38:33,000 --> 02:38:35,640
VPN at all and uh and it does go into

3870
02:38:35,640 --> 02:38:36,780
threat modeling and I don't know if I

3871
02:38:36,780 --> 02:38:37,920
would agree that people should have

3872
02:38:37,920 --> 02:38:39,479
write articles in case somebody might

3873
02:38:39,479 --> 02:38:41,120
think there's an error in them because

3874
02:38:41,120 --> 02:38:43,200
there's a lot of times when people are

3875
02:38:43,200 --> 02:38:44,640
like you have an error in your story and

3876
02:38:44,640 --> 02:38:46,319
I spend like three hours researching it

3877
02:38:46,319 --> 02:38:48,000
and it's like oh they would have worded

3878
02:38:48,000 --> 02:38:49,800
this slightly differently and it's not

3879
02:38:49,800 --> 02:38:52,319
really an error at all so like I don't I

3880
02:38:52,319 --> 02:38:54,120
don't know if I and like if you get to

3881
02:38:54,120 --> 02:38:55,500
the point where you have something like

3882
02:38:55,500 --> 02:38:57,359
where people are debating these nuances

3883
02:38:57,359 --> 02:38:59,640
I think that like they maybe they agreed

3884
02:38:59,640 --> 02:39:01,080
with the rest of your story so you've

3885
02:39:01,080 --> 02:39:03,120
already gotten information out there and

3886
02:39:03,120 --> 02:39:06,420
kind of advanced uh that along so I

3887
02:39:06,420 --> 02:39:08,040
don't know if I would agree that like

3888
02:39:08,040 --> 02:39:10,020
there might be an errand so people

3889
02:39:10,020 --> 02:39:11,700
should not write about cryptography or

3890
02:39:11,700 --> 02:39:14,300
whatever so

3891
02:39:14,640 --> 02:39:17,760
any other questions uh yeah hey guys uh

3892
02:39:17,760 --> 02:39:20,340
great uh great talk uh you'd reference a

3893
02:39:20,340 --> 02:39:22,439
Bloomberg article from

3894
02:39:22,439 --> 02:39:24,960
oh yeah uh did anything come of that I

3895
02:39:24,960 --> 02:39:27,300
remember I remember that day clearly did

3896
02:39:27,300 --> 02:39:28,920
they retract that did that just kind of

3897
02:39:28,920 --> 02:39:31,220
fizzle away I don't remember

3898
02:39:31,220 --> 02:39:33,540
they did a follow-up that doubled down

3899
02:39:33,540 --> 02:39:36,300
like they it this is really bad yeah it

3900
02:39:36,300 --> 02:39:38,640
was uh I feel like it really hurts The

3901
02:39:38,640 --> 02:39:40,140
credibility of Bloomberg because they

3902
02:39:40,140 --> 02:39:41,520
did that weird Economist fightship

3903
02:39:41,520 --> 02:39:43,200
article that everybody said was wrong

3904
02:39:43,200 --> 02:39:45,359
and then they wrote another one I don't

3905
02:39:45,359 --> 02:39:47,819
know it's very it's I find it extremely

3906
02:39:47,819 --> 02:39:49,620
frustrating so yeah I know they didn't

3907
02:39:49,620 --> 02:39:52,340
retract it

3908
02:39:54,960 --> 02:39:58,819
any other questions from the audience

3909
02:40:01,340 --> 02:40:05,300
building yeah I mean spoken too fast

3910
02:40:05,300 --> 02:40:08,340
for someone who's not used to talking to

3911
02:40:08,340 --> 02:40:10,859
journalists and wants to not be

3912
02:40:10,859 --> 02:40:15,060
misrepresented or be able to help them

3913
02:40:15,060 --> 02:40:17,399
fact check do you have any suggestions

3914
02:40:17,399 --> 02:40:20,520
or tips yeah and what not to do so

3915
02:40:20,520 --> 02:40:23,640
honestly like you know it's kind of a

3916
02:40:23,640 --> 02:40:25,200
friend of a friend situation like I

3917
02:40:25,200 --> 02:40:26,100
would say

3918
02:40:26,100 --> 02:40:29,939
if you want to find a reporter that has

3919
02:40:29,939 --> 02:40:32,939
a good track record and like knows how

3920
02:40:32,939 --> 02:40:34,560
to protect their sources is the thing

3921
02:40:34,560 --> 02:40:35,819
that I'm always thinking about because I

3922
02:40:35,819 --> 02:40:37,620
work at a company or a non-profit that

3923
02:40:37,620 --> 02:40:39,780
thinks about that a lot but also is like

3924
02:40:39,780 --> 02:40:41,040
pretty accurate at things like quotes

3925
02:40:41,040 --> 02:40:42,120
Etc

3926
02:40:42,120 --> 02:40:44,160
I would say like talk to other security

3927
02:40:44,160 --> 02:40:45,780
researchers that are already talking to

3928
02:40:45,780 --> 02:40:47,880
journalists and see what their opinion

3929
02:40:47,880 --> 02:40:49,620
is what their thoughts are what their

3930
02:40:49,620 --> 02:40:51,359
experiences were like

3931
02:40:51,359 --> 02:40:55,020
um and uh a lot of times journalists so

3932
02:40:55,020 --> 02:40:57,660
this is the thing that I think sometimes

3933
02:40:57,660 --> 02:40:59,160
gets criticized a lot in journalism

3934
02:40:59,160 --> 02:41:00,540
conferences where it's this idea of

3935
02:41:00,540 --> 02:41:02,460
what's called parachute reporting where

3936
02:41:02,460 --> 02:41:04,620
you bring in somebody to a community

3937
02:41:04,620 --> 02:41:06,180
that they're not part of that they have

3938
02:41:06,180 --> 02:41:09,240
no real background in or context of and

3939
02:41:09,240 --> 02:41:12,420
are just like go go to uh like this

3940
02:41:12,420 --> 02:41:14,100
reservation and talk about what's going

3941
02:41:14,100 --> 02:41:15,180
on there

3942
02:41:15,180 --> 02:41:18,420
and it's like you know someone from New

3943
02:41:18,420 --> 02:41:20,040
York that has never set foot in Oklahoma

3944
02:41:20,040 --> 02:41:22,319
or whatever so

3945
02:41:22,319 --> 02:41:24,479
it's kind of a similar situation in some

3946
02:41:24,479 --> 02:41:26,460
cases with cyber security reporting some

3947
02:41:26,460 --> 02:41:28,680
reporters will be deeply embedded within

3948
02:41:28,680 --> 02:41:30,120
that Community have been have been going

3949
02:41:30,120 --> 02:41:33,979
to Defcon since like 2010 and like

3950
02:41:33,979 --> 02:41:36,000
understands how to talk to Security

3951
02:41:36,000 --> 02:41:38,700
Experts understand like

3952
02:41:38,700 --> 02:41:40,800
um how to protect their sources and like

3953
02:41:40,800 --> 02:41:42,660
know the context of what you would be

3954
02:41:42,660 --> 02:41:44,100
talking about

3955
02:41:44,100 --> 02:41:46,319
um so I would say look for those

3956
02:41:46,319 --> 02:41:47,460
um I there's a lot of different things

3957
02:41:47,460 --> 02:41:49,200
you can do so what aside from vetting

3958
02:41:49,200 --> 02:41:50,819
the journalists you can if you're not

3959
02:41:50,819 --> 02:41:53,340
comfortable maybe with your answers you

3960
02:41:53,340 --> 02:41:55,080
can say can I give you answers in

3961
02:41:55,080 --> 02:41:56,520
writing and then they are going to quote

3962
02:41:56,520 --> 02:41:58,200
from what you have written some

3963
02:41:58,200 --> 02:41:59,640
Publications will allow you to review

3964
02:41:59,640 --> 02:42:02,460
your own quotes So if you do um

3965
02:42:02,460 --> 02:42:04,319
um talk to somebody you can be like oh

3966
02:42:04,319 --> 02:42:05,819
I'd like to vet my codes before they go

3967
02:42:05,819 --> 02:42:07,319
live not everybody will do that but

3968
02:42:07,319 --> 02:42:08,600
that's something you can ask them about

3969
02:42:08,600 --> 02:42:11,100
some of them actually have fact Checkers

3970
02:42:11,100 --> 02:42:13,020
you can ask them like what is your fact

3971
02:42:13,020 --> 02:42:14,939
checking process

3972
02:42:14,939 --> 02:42:16,439
um yeah you can look at other stories

3973
02:42:16,439 --> 02:42:17,399
that they've written usually when I'm

3974
02:42:17,399 --> 02:42:18,660
trying to get somebody to talk to me

3975
02:42:18,660 --> 02:42:19,920
knowing that people are worried to talk

3976
02:42:19,920 --> 02:42:21,720
to journalists I'll be like here's three

3977
02:42:21,720 --> 02:42:22,920
other stories I've written about this

3978
02:42:22,920 --> 02:42:24,240
because I know people will look at them

3979
02:42:24,240 --> 02:42:26,160
and be like oh that's solid like and

3980
02:42:26,160 --> 02:42:28,800
they are more likely to talk to me

3981
02:42:28,800 --> 02:42:31,620
um uh but yeah if you can find someone

3982
02:42:31,620 --> 02:42:33,720
else who it's not um sometimes

3983
02:42:33,720 --> 02:42:34,920
journalists are really good at some

3984
02:42:34,920 --> 02:42:37,260
stories and on others but like do they

3985
02:42:37,260 --> 02:42:38,880
make Corrections like if you have heard

3986
02:42:38,880 --> 02:42:40,979
somebody say like oh they had an error

3987
02:42:40,979 --> 02:42:42,720
and I told them it was an error and they

3988
02:42:42,720 --> 02:42:44,760
didn't correct it then that's kind of a

3989
02:42:44,760 --> 02:42:46,920
red flag though sometimes it's not

3990
02:42:46,920 --> 02:42:49,080
really an error people are just like oh

3991
02:42:49,080 --> 02:42:51,240
you said I was a security researcher but

3992
02:42:51,240 --> 02:42:54,060
I call myself a you know senior security

3993
02:42:54,060 --> 02:42:56,100
researcher or whatever and they'll be

3994
02:42:56,100 --> 02:42:57,540
like this was an error or like they

3995
02:42:57,540 --> 02:42:58,920
didn't include a quote that that person

3996
02:42:58,920 --> 02:43:00,960
likes so like there's a little confident

3997
02:43:00,960 --> 02:43:03,300
context there but you can kind of get a

3998
02:43:03,300 --> 02:43:05,220
Vibe of it that way

3999
02:43:05,220 --> 02:43:06,780
um and then just the publication itself

4000
02:43:06,780 --> 02:43:08,399
like if somebody's writing for Daily

4001
02:43:08,399 --> 02:43:10,319
Mail like that's different than if

4002
02:43:10,319 --> 02:43:11,640
somebody's writing for advice or

4003
02:43:11,640 --> 02:43:12,479
whatever

4004
02:43:12,479 --> 02:43:14,700
um and I don't know you can look it on

4005
02:43:14,700 --> 02:43:16,319
Twitter like has that person tweeted on

4006
02:43:16,319 --> 02:43:17,700
that topic do they generally sound like

4007
02:43:17,700 --> 02:43:19,319
they know what they're talking about

4008
02:43:19,319 --> 02:43:21,060
um you can also ask them for the greater

4009
02:43:21,060 --> 02:43:22,500
context of their article like why are

4010
02:43:22,500 --> 02:43:24,899
you asking me these specific things what

4011
02:43:24,899 --> 02:43:26,340
is the larger story that you're working

4012
02:43:26,340 --> 02:43:27,899
on and they should tell you the truth

4013
02:43:27,899 --> 02:43:29,160
hopefully

4014
02:43:29,160 --> 02:43:30,359
um so yeah there's like a lot of

4015
02:43:30,359 --> 02:43:32,640
different kind of things you can do

4016
02:43:32,640 --> 02:43:35,160
yep and I just want to go ahead and add

4017
02:43:35,160 --> 02:43:36,479
one thing so I actually do a lot of

4018
02:43:36,479 --> 02:43:38,100
working with reporters and stuff I talk

4019
02:43:38,100 --> 02:43:40,439
to them a clean everything

4020
02:43:40,439 --> 02:43:42,060
um they're people just talk to them like

4021
02:43:42,060 --> 02:43:43,859
they're people and a lot of the onus

4022
02:43:43,859 --> 02:43:46,439
comes down to us to articulate what

4023
02:43:46,439 --> 02:43:48,600
we're trying to say in the right way so

4024
02:43:48,600 --> 02:43:49,920
when working with and like I said

4025
02:43:49,920 --> 02:43:51,240
working with a lot of reporters like

4026
02:43:51,240 --> 02:43:52,439
they just want to try and get a story

4027
02:43:52,439 --> 02:43:53,580
they want to hear your perspective

4028
02:43:53,580 --> 02:43:55,920
they're not technical people like we are

4029
02:43:55,920 --> 02:43:58,740
so try and imagine explaining something

4030
02:43:58,740 --> 02:44:00,300
like you explained to a parent and

4031
02:44:00,300 --> 02:44:02,880
everything so even word it like that

4032
02:44:02,880 --> 02:44:05,100
really pretty good on that

4033
02:44:05,100 --> 02:44:07,920
yeah one one last question right here

4034
02:44:07,920 --> 02:44:12,180
oh yeah oh uh hi so I'm getting a degree

4035
02:44:12,180 --> 02:44:14,280
in advertising and I know you guys kind

4036
02:44:14,280 --> 02:44:16,080
of like brushed over that a little bit

4037
02:44:16,080 --> 02:44:17,640
with the uh

4038
02:44:17,640 --> 02:44:19,439
like the the ad trackers and whatnot

4039
02:44:19,439 --> 02:44:21,120
yeah so I was wondering is there any

4040
02:44:21,120 --> 02:44:24,000
like model to get away from like SEO and

4041
02:44:24,000 --> 02:44:25,979
stuff like that and make articles a

4042
02:44:25,979 --> 02:44:29,479
little less like click bakey

4043
02:44:29,520 --> 02:44:32,580
that is kind of the that is a very big

4044
02:44:32,580 --> 02:44:34,260
question that everybody's been asking in

4045
02:44:34,260 --> 02:44:36,240
my world

4046
02:44:36,240 --> 02:44:38,100
um everybody's trying to figure out a

4047
02:44:38,100 --> 02:44:40,380
business model that works for journalism

4048
02:44:40,380 --> 02:44:43,560
um that isn't ad surveillance and

4049
02:44:43,560 --> 02:44:45,000
people are experimenting with different

4050
02:44:45,000 --> 02:44:46,560
things

4051
02:44:46,560 --> 02:44:48,000
um you know different kinds of

4052
02:44:48,000 --> 02:44:49,620
subscription models that aren't just

4053
02:44:49,620 --> 02:44:52,560
like traditional like give us money per

4054
02:44:52,560 --> 02:44:54,240
month and we won't you can get behind

4055
02:44:54,240 --> 02:44:55,560
the paywall but you have to log into

4056
02:44:55,560 --> 02:44:57,899
like every singer one of your devices

4057
02:44:57,899 --> 02:45:00,359
separately which is really annoying

4058
02:45:00,359 --> 02:45:02,520
um but nothing is really sort of like

4059
02:45:02,520 --> 02:45:04,680
taken off there necessarily so

4060
02:45:04,680 --> 02:45:06,600
unfortunately we're sort of saddled with

4061
02:45:06,600 --> 02:45:08,460
the business model that we have rather

4062
02:45:08,460 --> 02:45:10,260
than the one that we have not yet

4063
02:45:10,260 --> 02:45:13,080
imagined I guess uh I don't know if you

4064
02:45:13,080 --> 02:45:14,040
don't know if you haven't yeah yeah

4065
02:45:14,040 --> 02:45:15,840
there are like paid subscription models

4066
02:45:15,840 --> 02:45:18,000
and like events and and other kind of

4067
02:45:18,000 --> 02:45:20,100
strategies but I think like SEO and

4068
02:45:20,100 --> 02:45:21,720
clickbait are a little different because

4069
02:45:21,720 --> 02:45:24,000
I think like if I want an article that

4070
02:45:24,000 --> 02:45:26,760
has good SEO then I want people who are

4071
02:45:26,760 --> 02:45:28,439
searching for that topic to find my

4072
02:45:28,439 --> 02:45:30,540
article so that doesn't necessarily mean

4073
02:45:30,540 --> 02:45:32,700
I'm writing clickbait it means that like

4074
02:45:32,700 --> 02:45:34,200
I don't want to use some esoteric

4075
02:45:34,200 --> 02:45:35,640
language that people are not going to

4076
02:45:35,640 --> 02:45:37,859
find when they Google it and like if you

4077
02:45:37,859 --> 02:45:39,840
are writing SEO the way that I was

4078
02:45:39,840 --> 02:45:41,280
taught you're writing for people not

4079
02:45:41,280 --> 02:45:43,620
search engines it just happens that they

4080
02:45:43,620 --> 02:45:45,660
coincide a little bit like um

4081
02:45:45,660 --> 02:45:47,760
yeah and so like I don't think that SEO

4082
02:45:47,760 --> 02:45:49,740
in itself is bad as far as like ad

4083
02:45:49,740 --> 02:45:51,120
tracking like I just think that

4084
02:45:51,120 --> 02:45:52,920
companies should

4085
02:45:52,920 --> 02:45:55,380
stop tracking if people ask them to and

4086
02:45:55,380 --> 02:45:57,479
I think they're kind of learning that

4087
02:45:57,479 --> 02:45:59,220
the hard way because people are you know

4088
02:45:59,220 --> 02:46:00,660
setting up ad blockers so instead of

4089
02:46:00,660 --> 02:46:02,580
having this ongoing like more of

4090
02:46:02,580 --> 02:46:04,380
attrition between Adblock or block or

4091
02:46:04,380 --> 02:46:06,479
block or blocker blockers like they

4092
02:46:06,479 --> 02:46:07,979
should just do what people say and like

4093
02:46:07,979 --> 02:46:10,080
find another model but yeah it's easier

4094
02:46:10,080 --> 02:46:12,600
easier said than done

4095
02:46:12,600 --> 02:46:14,640
yeah it is one of those things where

4096
02:46:14,640 --> 02:46:17,300
like everybody know

4097
02:46:17,300 --> 02:46:19,620
I guess people

4098
02:46:19,620 --> 02:46:21,720
in the industry at least the vibe that I

4099
02:46:21,720 --> 02:46:23,100
get from people having talked to many

4100
02:46:23,100 --> 02:46:24,359
different journalists across different

4101
02:46:24,359 --> 02:46:27,120
kind of professions are like yeah I mean

4102
02:46:27,120 --> 02:46:30,060
look we we can either have this like

4103
02:46:30,060 --> 02:46:32,939
semi-shady like ad Network or we have

4104
02:46:32,939 --> 02:46:36,060
like fewer reporters on payroll like

4105
02:46:36,060 --> 02:46:37,500
um it is like basically just a

4106
02:46:37,500 --> 02:46:39,540
particular kind of economic question I

4107
02:46:39,540 --> 02:46:41,640
mean there are other ways of doing this

4108
02:46:41,640 --> 02:46:43,500
um uh propublica the markup all

4109
02:46:43,500 --> 02:46:46,200
non-profits uh this is all the way

4110
02:46:46,200 --> 02:46:49,500
Consumer Reports is a nonprofit too also

4111
02:46:49,500 --> 02:46:51,840
um what's the Salt Lake City newspaper

4112
02:46:51,840 --> 02:46:53,280
that became a nonprofit Salt Lake City

4113
02:46:53,280 --> 02:46:54,479
Tribune seems to be doing actually

4114
02:46:54,479 --> 02:46:57,000
pretty well as a non-profit which is

4115
02:46:57,000 --> 02:46:58,439
pretty cool

4116
02:46:58,439 --> 02:47:00,060
um companies like I think ABC which we

4117
02:47:00,060 --> 02:47:01,859
mentioned earlier also I think the BBC

4118
02:47:01,859 --> 02:47:04,920
uh I don't know about ABC I do know that

4119
02:47:04,920 --> 02:47:08,160
the BBC is funded by a television tax

4120
02:47:08,160 --> 02:47:10,020
so there's like an NPR of course has

4121
02:47:10,020 --> 02:47:12,180
like a small little share of the pie

4122
02:47:12,180 --> 02:47:14,640
that is also publicly funded so there's

4123
02:47:14,640 --> 02:47:16,100
different ways journalism can happen

4124
02:47:16,100 --> 02:47:18,620
unfortunately there there's uh

4125
02:47:18,620 --> 02:47:20,880
advertising is a thing that's sort of

4126
02:47:20,880 --> 02:47:23,720
like works as a standard even though

4127
02:47:23,720 --> 02:47:26,399
people just kind of a begrudgingly sort

4128
02:47:26,399 --> 02:47:28,740
of accept it uh but that's that's where

4129
02:47:28,740 --> 02:47:30,180
we're off for now where we are for now

4130
02:47:30,180 --> 02:47:31,740
like who knows what the future will hold

4131
02:47:31,740 --> 02:47:34,819
hopefully something else

4132
02:47:36,780 --> 02:47:39,680
thanks everybody

4133
02:47:40,620 --> 02:47:43,319
oh yeah this is our handles we're on

4134

04:54:28,980 --> 04:54:30,660
um I've been interested in computers now

4666
04:54:30,660 --> 04:54:34,798
for 25 years which when I think about

4667
04:54:34,798 --> 04:54:36,958
that

4668
04:54:36,958 --> 04:54:39,420

I'm used to speaking really loudly I've

4684
04:55:27,180 --> 04:55:28,620
never actually had to use a microphone

4685
04:55:28,620 --> 04:55:31,320
or my my level's okay

4686

excellent all right

4687
04:55:33,540 --> 04:55:36,718
um of those 25 years for about 12 of

4688
04:55:36,718 --> 04:55:40,320
them I have been a network administrator

4689
04:55:40,320 --> 04:55:44,218
for a local non-profit in the in the

4690
04:55:44,218 --> 04:55:45,060
valley

4691
04:55:45,060 --> 04:55:48,480
and that's where I fell in love with

4692
04:55:48,480 --> 04:55:51,480
Enterprise level stuff

4693
04:55:51,480 --> 04:55:52,920
yeah

4694
04:55:52,920 --> 04:55:54,240
yeah we'll talk more about that a little

4695
04:55:54,240 --> 04:55:58,440
later I am a recovering Windows user

4696
04:55:58,440 --> 04:56:00,780
user I have used just about every

4697
04:56:00,780 --> 04:56:03,240
version of Windows except for version

4698
04:56:03,240 --> 04:56:07,020
one and I skipped eight because gross

4699
04:56:07,020 --> 04:56:09,660
tonight anyone in here like that Metro

4700
04:56:09,660 --> 04:56:13,260
thing they know not right

4701
04:56:13,260 --> 04:56:16,920
right I haven't I still I've used 11 one

4702
04:56:16,920 --> 04:56:19,980
time and you could almost feel it spying

4703
04:56:19,980 --> 04:56:23,180
on you it's kind of gross

4704
04:56:27,600 --> 04:56:30,600
yep

4705
04:56:32,040 --> 04:56:33,780
um about three what happened was about

4706
04:56:33,780 --> 04:56:37,080
three years ago like any good

4707
04:56:37,080 --> 04:56:40,500
geek wood I install my monthly Windows

4708
04:56:40,500 --> 04:56:43,020
updates because they patch about 100

4709
04:56:43,020 --> 04:56:45,900
trillion different holes so you want to

4710
04:56:45,900 --> 04:56:48,180
install them and in fact it was this

4711
04:56:48,180 --> 04:56:50,700
laptop right here that fell victim to

4712
04:56:50,700 --> 04:56:53,700
well reboot to install your updates so

4713
04:56:53,700 --> 04:56:55,260
okay

4714
04:56:55,260 --> 04:56:57,540
and it never turned on again

4715
04:56:57,540 --> 04:57:00,298
it came back with some inaccessible boot

4716
04:57:00,298 --> 04:57:01,980
device

4717
04:57:01,980 --> 04:57:03,540
well that's funny all I did was restart

4718
04:57:03,540 --> 04:57:05,840
the machine so I spent about a month

4719
04:57:05,840 --> 04:57:09,360
trying every trick I could find on the

4720
04:57:09,360 --> 04:57:11,040
University of Google

4721
04:57:11,040 --> 04:57:13,620
and nothing works so finally I threw my

4722
04:57:13,620 --> 04:57:14,700
hands in the air I said you know what

4723
04:57:14,700 --> 04:57:17,600
I'm going to Linux I installed a live

4724
04:57:17,600 --> 04:57:20,040
distribution just to get my data off of

4725
04:57:20,040 --> 04:57:22,020
the hard drive formatted it installed

4726
04:57:22,020 --> 04:57:25,378
Linux and never looked back and now I'm

4727
04:57:25,378 --> 04:57:27,298
addicted to it I love it I want to get

4728
04:57:27,298 --> 04:57:29,760
rid of all my windows stuff and I'm

4729
04:57:29,760 --> 04:57:33,320
almost there this close

4730
04:57:36,718 --> 04:57:39,600
um I definitely have a passion for

4731
04:57:39,600 --> 04:57:43,260
networking and encryption

4732
04:57:43,260 --> 04:57:45,000
um of all the different stuff I do with

4733
04:57:45,000 --> 04:57:47,940
computers I absolutely love making them

4734
04:57:47,940 --> 04:57:51,060
talk to each other and doing so securely

4735
04:57:51,060 --> 04:57:54,958
my first network was two computers and a

4736
04:57:54,958 --> 04:57:56,760
Serial cable so I could play Quake 3

4737
04:57:56,760 --> 04:57:59,940
with my friend on a lan it was laggy but

4738
04:57:59,940 --> 04:58:02,480
it worked

4739
04:58:02,940 --> 04:58:05,400
um I'm also passionate about data

4740
04:58:05,400 --> 04:58:06,718
privacy

4741
04:58:06,718 --> 04:58:08,940
something that these days I'm sure you

4742
04:58:08,940 --> 04:58:11,820
all know everything you do everywhere

4743
04:58:11,820 --> 04:58:15,240
all the time no matter what is monetized

4744
04:58:15,240 --> 04:58:18,120
and I like to keep my data

4745
04:58:18,120 --> 04:58:22,378
my data unless I say you can have it I

4746
04:58:22,378 --> 04:58:25,798
am a home theater Fanboy I love

4747
04:58:25,798 --> 04:58:28,798
audio video stuff in fact part of the

4748
04:58:28,798 --> 04:58:30,600
reason my home network is what it is

4749
04:58:30,600 --> 04:58:34,080
today is because of my love of giant

4750
04:58:34,080 --> 04:58:38,298
screens loud sound and good movies

4751
04:58:39,780 --> 04:58:43,320
I think 16-bit era gaming was the

4752
04:58:43,320 --> 04:58:45,840
Pinnacle of gaming and I will die on

4753
04:58:45,840 --> 04:58:48,080
that Hill

4754
04:58:48,080 --> 04:58:52,080
all right Sega Super Nintendo were my

4755
04:58:52,080 --> 04:58:54,900
favorite consoles and Neo Geo which

4756
04:58:54,900 --> 04:58:58,200
technically wasn't 16-bit but whatever

4757
04:58:58,200 --> 04:58:58,860
um

4758
04:58:58,860 --> 04:59:01,440
I definitely spend more time than I

4759
04:59:01,440 --> 04:59:03,958
should cracking passwords I absolutely

4760
04:59:03,958 --> 04:59:06,180
there's something about

4761
04:59:06,180 --> 04:59:09,000
when hashcat spits out

4762
04:59:09,000 --> 04:59:11,760
that yeah got it you're like

4763
04:59:11,760 --> 04:59:15,900
yeah you did it's fantastic right and

4764
04:59:15,900 --> 04:59:19,440
I'm going to apologize in advance I am

4765
04:59:19,440 --> 04:59:23,160
not good with PowerPoint or office in

4766
04:59:23,160 --> 04:59:24,840
general so this is not going to be a

4767
04:59:24,840 --> 04:59:27,540
really exciting PowerPoint thing so I'm

4768
04:59:27,540 --> 04:59:29,400
say it's all plain and just like the one

4769
04:59:29,400 --> 04:59:33,020
color and stuff like that I tried

4770
04:59:34,020 --> 04:59:35,520
so

4771
04:59:35,520 --> 04:59:37,980
why bother securing your home network

4772
04:59:37,980 --> 04:59:39,900
right these days everyone's all about

4773
04:59:39,900 --> 04:59:41,458
you know securing the corporate Network

4774
04:59:41,458 --> 04:59:43,440
or going to the cloud or whatever it is

4775
04:59:43,440 --> 04:59:45,480
but then the poor home network which

4776
04:59:45,480 --> 04:59:47,520
used to be the center of everyone's love

4777
04:59:47,520 --> 04:59:51,420
and affection got ignored

4778
04:59:51,420 --> 04:59:53,160
um for me personally I don't trust my

4779
04:59:53,160 --> 04:59:55,440
ISP to do it

4780
04:59:55,440 --> 04:59:57,360
who here likes their ISP a whole bunch

4781
04:59:57,360 --> 04:59:58,740
anyone

4782
04:59:58,740 --> 05:00:00,900
I got a couple of Wiggly hands but no

4783
05:00:00,900 --> 05:00:05,340
one was like I love them no they they'll

4784
05:00:05,340 --> 05:00:07,138
put on their commercial oh we care about

4785
05:00:07,138 --> 05:00:09,660
your privacy and security yeah right up

4786
05:00:09,660 --> 05:00:11,638
until it doesn't make the money

4787
05:00:11,638 --> 05:00:14,940
you know and right

4788
05:00:14,940 --> 05:00:16,200
um

4789
05:00:16,200 --> 05:00:18,120
I also

4790
05:00:18,120 --> 05:00:20,458
tend not to put a lot of faith in

4791
05:00:20,458 --> 05:00:22,080
browsers

4792
05:00:22,080 --> 05:00:26,400
zero day anybody right

4793
05:00:26,520 --> 05:00:29,100
I'm sorry

4794
05:00:29,100 --> 05:00:31,080
right so

4795
05:00:31,080 --> 05:00:32,760
with those two things in mind it gives

4796
05:00:32,760 --> 05:00:35,040
me peace of mind I know with a secure

4797
05:00:35,040 --> 05:00:36,780
home network

4798
05:00:36,780 --> 05:00:40,200
my data is safe my devices are safe I'm

4799
05:00:40,200 --> 05:00:42,660
not part of some weird like the Mirai

4800
05:00:42,660 --> 05:00:45,480
botnet or some other strange thing right

4801
05:00:45,480 --> 05:00:48,540
my privacy is

4802
05:00:48,540 --> 05:00:51,180
as intact as it can be today you know

4803
05:00:51,180 --> 05:00:52,020
like

4804
05:00:52,020 --> 05:00:55,320
anyone here see the movie hackers

4805
05:00:55,320 --> 05:00:57,298
any of you still wish that your compute

4806
05:00:57,298 --> 05:01:00,298
your name only went through 17 computers

4807
05:01:00,298 --> 05:01:01,240
a day

4808
05:01:01,240 --> 05:01:04,980
[Laughter]

4809
05:01:04,980 --> 05:01:07,138
now not only I mean that's all fine and

4810
05:01:07,138 --> 05:01:09,120
good right having your your home network

4811
05:01:09,120 --> 05:01:12,060
safe you're like yeah all right anyone

4812
05:01:12,060 --> 05:01:13,980
here have kids

4813
05:01:13,980 --> 05:01:16,500
I have five of them running around the

4814
05:01:16,500 --> 05:01:20,298
house yeah that's right five little me's

4815
05:01:21,298 --> 05:01:23,760
right and yeah you can get parental

4816
05:01:23,760 --> 05:01:25,500
control software and all of that stuff

4817
05:01:25,500 --> 05:01:28,920
but I have found it

4818
05:01:28,920 --> 05:01:31,020
lacking

4819
05:01:31,020 --> 05:01:33,120
I want to have control over which

4820
05:01:33,120 --> 05:01:35,700
devices go where when they go there

4821
05:01:35,700 --> 05:01:37,440
how fast they can go there that kind of

4822
05:01:37,440 --> 05:01:39,480
stuff

4823
05:01:39,480 --> 05:01:42,540
it also has helped me in my job as a

4824
05:01:42,540 --> 05:01:45,080
network administrator

4825
05:01:45,080 --> 05:01:49,100
I do what's called

4826
05:01:49,260 --> 05:01:51,480
I do uh what's called hold my beer

4827
05:01:51,480 --> 05:01:53,218
troubleshooting sometimes

4828
05:01:53,218 --> 05:01:57,060
when right like I think I can fix that

4829
05:01:57,060 --> 05:01:58,860
Dave hold my beer I'm going to try

4830
05:01:58,860 --> 05:02:01,760
something you know

4831
05:02:01,760 --> 05:02:04,620
not really the best thing to do in a

4832
05:02:04,620 --> 05:02:06,660
production environment

4833
05:02:06,660 --> 05:02:09,240
right I don't test my code often but

4834
05:02:09,240 --> 05:02:13,860
when I do I do it in production right

4835
05:02:17,180 --> 05:02:21,360
and so my home network I can try this

4836
05:02:21,360 --> 05:02:23,580
try that and not worry about bringing

4837
05:02:23,580 --> 05:02:25,138
down my whole corporate Network and

4838
05:02:25,138 --> 05:02:28,760
getting in a lot of trouble for it

4839
05:02:29,040 --> 05:02:33,480
and also it gives me a place to learn to

4840
05:02:33,480 --> 05:02:37,320
practice to try red team stuff

4841
05:02:37,320 --> 05:02:40,820
so I can become a better blue team guy

4842
05:02:40,820 --> 05:02:43,200
at the office

4843
05:02:43,200 --> 05:02:44,580
right because that's what I'm supposed

4844
05:02:44,580 --> 05:02:45,780
to be doing there is keeping my

4845
05:02:45,780 --> 05:02:48,420
corporate Network safe so securing my

4846
05:02:48,420 --> 05:02:51,480
home network has taught me and I

4847
05:02:51,480 --> 05:02:52,980
actually have a couple of examples of

4848
05:02:52,980 --> 05:02:54,840
things I've done at home just I know

4849
05:02:54,840 --> 05:02:56,700
that looks neat let's try it they came

4850
05:02:56,700 --> 05:02:59,900
in handy at work

4851
05:03:05,940 --> 05:03:08,700
oh that is the stuff sweet nectar of

4852
05:03:08,700 --> 05:03:10,260
life

4853
05:03:10,260 --> 05:03:11,458
all right

4854
05:03:11,458 --> 05:03:12,780
so

4855
05:03:12,780 --> 05:03:14,520
what I'm going to talk about next is a

4856
05:03:14,520 --> 05:03:16,740
bit about some of the hardware that I

4857
05:03:16,740 --> 05:03:20,100
use the the home network itself why I

4858
05:03:20,100 --> 05:03:22,740
chose that Hardware

4859
05:03:22,740 --> 05:03:25,500
how I have the network set up that kind

4860
05:03:25,500 --> 05:03:26,700
of stuff

4861
05:03:26,700 --> 05:03:28,020
so

4862
05:03:28,020 --> 05:03:31,020
first up is the hardware itself yes that

4863
05:03:31,020 --> 05:03:33,660
is a full-size 42u server rack that I

4864
05:03:33,660 --> 05:03:34,878
have

4865
05:03:34,878 --> 05:03:38,280
in our dining room because I have the

4866
05:03:38,280 --> 05:03:40,500
most understanding girlfriend in the

4867
05:03:40,500 --> 05:03:42,120
history of girlfriends

4868
05:03:42,120 --> 05:03:44,400
I call it the man's armoire

4869
05:03:44,400 --> 05:03:47,280
[Laughter]

4870
05:03:47,280 --> 05:03:50,878
and in there you'll see if I know the

4871
05:03:50,878 --> 05:03:52,740
picture isn't the best picture but there

4872
05:03:52,740 --> 05:03:54,180
are a couple of what look to be like

4873
05:03:54,180 --> 05:03:56,760
Enterprise level storage arrays there

4874
05:03:56,760 --> 05:03:59,040
and a couple of servers those are

4875
05:03:59,040 --> 05:04:02,420
well they're shelves now

4876
05:04:02,940 --> 05:04:05,100
um the host you see in there is actually

4877
05:04:05,100 --> 05:04:07,798
just something I built uh a brief

4878
05:04:07,798 --> 05:04:09,060
overview of the hardware in there

4879
05:04:09,060 --> 05:04:11,280
actually get into more detail on on it

4880
05:04:11,280 --> 05:04:13,320
in just a minute

4881
05:04:13,320 --> 05:04:15,240
um I have an Enterprise switch which was

4882
05:04:15,240 --> 05:04:16,860
one of my favorite parts of the whole

4883
05:04:16,860 --> 05:04:17,700
thing

4884
05:04:17,700 --> 05:04:19,320
the reason why

4885
05:04:19,320 --> 05:04:21,620
vlans and qos

4886
05:04:21,620 --> 05:04:24,958
you can have such fine-grained control

4887
05:04:24,958 --> 05:04:27,360
over the traffic on your network it's

4888
05:04:27,360 --> 05:04:28,740
great when the kids are eating up all

4889
05:04:28,740 --> 05:04:30,120
the bandwidth

4890
05:04:30,120 --> 05:04:32,899
and they do

4891
05:04:33,540 --> 05:04:34,320
um

4892
05:04:34,320 --> 05:04:37,500
they also have a Lenovo desktop in there

4893
05:04:37,500 --> 05:04:42,180
for running PF sense and a Netgear Wi-Fi

4894
05:04:42,180 --> 05:04:43,580
router with

4895
05:04:43,580 --> 05:04:46,980
one two three antennas on it I know it's

4896
05:04:46,980 --> 05:04:49,620
not that uh what is it the Nighthawk one

4897
05:04:49,620 --> 05:04:51,958
with like it looks like an upside down

4898
05:04:51,958 --> 05:04:55,620
spider that thing it's pretty cool

4899
05:04:55,620 --> 05:04:57,420
all right so a little more detail about

4900
05:04:57,420 --> 05:05:01,440
the the hypervisor host I love virtual

4901
05:05:01,440 --> 05:05:03,240
machines but to run virtual machines

4902
05:05:03,240 --> 05:05:04,560
well you got to have something to run

4903
05:05:04,560 --> 05:05:05,580
them on

4904
05:05:05,580 --> 05:05:07,860
and so

4905
05:05:07,860 --> 05:05:10,680
I built this thing for one purpose to

4906
05:05:10,680 --> 05:05:13,798
run virtual machines so I went ahead I

4907
05:05:13,798 --> 05:05:15,900
got the biggest tower I could find that

4908
05:05:15,900 --> 05:05:19,520
wasn't like you know 500 pounds

4909
05:05:19,520 --> 05:05:23,160
it does run Windows Server 2019 I

4910
05:05:23,160 --> 05:05:24,298
haven't

4911
05:05:24,298 --> 05:05:26,878
quite gotten away from that yet but I

4912
05:05:26,878 --> 05:05:29,770
will because hyper-v

4913
05:05:29,770 --> 05:05:30,958
[Music]

4914
05:05:30,958 --> 05:05:33,958
got a an EVGA motherboard and I went

4915
05:05:33,958 --> 05:05:38,280
with a core i7 6900k

4916
05:05:38,280 --> 05:05:42,180
because of the extra PCI Lanes it offers

4917
05:05:42,180 --> 05:05:44,458
turns out when you don't do your

4918
05:05:44,458 --> 05:05:47,100
research you get the wrong processor and

4919
05:05:47,100 --> 05:05:49,620
you lose a couple of your PCI slots on

4920
05:05:49,620 --> 05:05:51,120
the on the old motherboard there so

4921
05:05:51,120 --> 05:05:53,539
careful

4922
05:05:53,878 --> 05:05:55,200
um

4923
05:05:55,200 --> 05:05:57,360
I slapped in as much RAM as the

4924
05:05:57,360 --> 05:05:59,940
motherboard would hold 128 gigabytes

4925
05:05:59,940 --> 05:06:01,740
because virtual machines are hungry for

4926
05:06:01,740 --> 05:06:07,160
Ram anyone here like swap files no

4927
05:06:07,680 --> 05:06:09,780
um

4928
05:06:09,780 --> 05:06:11,940
gigabit Ethernet of course and a total

4929
05:06:11,940 --> 05:06:14,280
of about 80 terabytes of storage because

4930
05:06:14,280 --> 05:06:16,500
in addition to all the other stuff like

4931
05:06:16,500 --> 05:06:18,900
gaming that I like to do I've made known

4932
05:06:18,900 --> 05:06:20,878
to download

4933
05:06:20,878 --> 05:06:22,260
stuff

4934
05:06:22,260 --> 05:06:24,900
you know and stuff takes up a lot of

4935
05:06:24,900 --> 05:06:27,600
room anyone here familiar with Cody

4936
05:06:27,600 --> 05:06:29,940
home theater software

4937
05:06:29,940 --> 05:06:34,440
yeah I love Cody and Cody requires a lot

4938
05:06:34,440 --> 05:06:36,859
of storage

4939
05:06:38,100 --> 05:06:41,040
um it needed a

4940
05:06:41,040 --> 05:06:42,958
a graphics card because you got to have

4941
05:06:42,958 --> 05:06:45,180
some kind of video output so I put a

4942
05:06:45,180 --> 05:06:48,298
1070 in it because well it was there

4943
05:06:48,298 --> 05:06:50,280
and of course it has the super cool

4944
05:06:50,280 --> 05:06:52,680
Blu-ray burner that I have never

4945
05:06:52,680 --> 05:06:54,860
actually used

4946
05:06:54,860 --> 05:06:57,180
when I was Bill I'm like oh you got to

4947
05:06:57,180 --> 05:06:59,458
have an OP this was 2016 when I was

4948
05:06:59,458 --> 05:07:00,900
putting this thing together so it used

4949
05:07:00,900 --> 05:07:02,940
to be like really beefy and now it's you

4950
05:07:02,940 --> 05:07:03,660
know

4951
05:07:03,660 --> 05:07:08,600
you know right I would never

4952
05:07:10,500 --> 05:07:12,060
um

4953
05:07:12,060 --> 05:07:14,760
moving on uh the switch like I mentioned

4954
05:07:14,760 --> 05:07:19,740
before it's a it's an hpe 1920 uh 24 G

4955
05:07:19,740 --> 05:07:23,400
it's 24 Port switch it has uh capability

4956
05:07:23,400 --> 05:07:25,440
for like SFP and stuff but I would have

4957
05:07:25,440 --> 05:07:27,480
that's fine and good whatever

4958
05:07:27,480 --> 05:07:31,080
I like it because of vlans I love vlans

4959
05:07:31,080 --> 05:07:33,120
I like to keep my data and it's like oh

4960
05:07:33,120 --> 05:07:35,820
he doesn't like vlans

4961
05:07:35,820 --> 05:07:38,340
oh fair enough all right

4962
05:07:38,340 --> 05:07:39,958
who's your who's your brand

4963
05:07:39,958 --> 05:07:42,420
Cisco said I can't argue with this

4964
05:07:42,420 --> 05:07:43,860
anyone here going to argue with Cisco

4965
05:07:43,860 --> 05:07:47,340
nah all right Cisco's good stuff

4966
05:07:47,340 --> 05:07:49,200
um and of course the most important

4967
05:07:49,200 --> 05:07:50,940
thing

4968
05:07:50,940 --> 05:07:53,878
cooler than a non-managed switch

4969
05:07:53,878 --> 05:07:57,480
you know come on the cool factors there

4970
05:07:57,480 --> 05:08:00,480
um my Lenovo think center that is used

4971
05:08:00,480 --> 05:08:04,200
to run PF sense which is my favorite

4972
05:08:04,200 --> 05:08:06,298
part of the whole thing I'll get into a

4973
05:08:06,298 --> 05:08:08,820
little bit more about using

4974
05:08:08,820 --> 05:08:11,280
not necessarily PF sense but some

4975
05:08:11,280 --> 05:08:14,400
Enterprise level router for your home

4976
05:08:14,400 --> 05:08:16,620
network because the amount of control it

4977
05:08:16,620 --> 05:08:19,440
gives you over things is so much better

4978
05:08:19,440 --> 05:08:23,638
than like the heiress that Cox sends you

4979
05:08:23,638 --> 05:08:27,900
know it has a firewall in it whatever

4980
05:08:27,900 --> 05:08:30,060
right

4981
05:08:30,060 --> 05:08:33,360
right so this little guy he

4982
05:08:33,360 --> 05:08:36,298
in there because you don't need like a

4983
05:08:36,298 --> 05:08:39,480
super Powerful Beast of a machine

4984
05:08:39,480 --> 05:08:41,520
to run PF sense

4985
05:08:41,520 --> 05:08:43,440
you can actually I think you can even

4986
05:08:43,440 --> 05:08:45,480
run it on a Raspberry Pi

4987
05:08:45,480 --> 05:08:48,000
so it really if you got old Hardware

4988
05:08:48,000 --> 05:08:50,040
floating around slap this on it and

4989
05:08:50,040 --> 05:08:51,180
you're well on your way to having

4990
05:08:51,180 --> 05:08:53,340
awesome internet

4991
05:08:53,340 --> 05:08:55,980
it also has an optical drive but it is

4992
05:08:55,980 --> 05:08:58,080
not nearly as cool as the other one it

4993
05:08:58,080 --> 05:09:01,200
just burns DVDs not even Blu-ray

4994
05:09:01,200 --> 05:09:03,600
I never used that one either

4995
05:09:03,600 --> 05:09:07,100
but it looks nice you know

4996
05:09:07,440 --> 05:09:09,780
um I didn't get a picture of a of my

4997
05:09:09,780 --> 05:09:12,540
Wi-Fi access point because it looks like

4998
05:09:12,540 --> 05:09:14,458
every other one there it's a rectangular

4999
05:09:14,458 --> 05:09:16,320
box with three antennas sticking out of

5000
05:09:16,320 --> 05:09:19,138
the back or top of it and it's way up on

5001
05:09:19,138 --> 05:09:20,700
top of the server rack and it was just

5002
05:09:20,700 --> 05:09:23,280
hard to get up there so

5003
05:09:23,280 --> 05:09:24,958
um the reason though

5004
05:09:24,958 --> 05:09:29,160
I went with Enterprise level Wi-Fi

5005
05:09:29,160 --> 05:09:32,458
is you can do things like SSID isolation

5006
05:09:32,458 --> 05:09:36,718
client isolation you can control

5007
05:09:36,718 --> 05:09:39,120
what new devices are allowed to join

5008
05:09:39,120 --> 05:09:41,280
even if they have your network here it

5009
05:09:41,280 --> 05:09:43,560
is Mac based I know you get that false

5010
05:09:43,560 --> 05:09:45,600
sense of security but it's still better

5011
05:09:45,600 --> 05:09:48,360
than not having it you can do scheduling

5012
05:09:48,360 --> 05:09:50,100
you can turn the Wi-Fi on and off when

5013
05:09:50,100 --> 05:09:51,180
you need to

5014
05:09:51,180 --> 05:09:54,360
and it also has multi-sid support which

5015
05:09:54,360 --> 05:09:57,000
comes in handy later it's actually

5016
05:09:57,000 --> 05:10:00,060
if you have really secure Wireless it's

5017
05:10:00,060 --> 05:10:02,160
actually pretty handy

5018
05:10:02,160 --> 05:10:04,980
and then there is software that pretends

5019
05:10:04,980 --> 05:10:07,260
to be Hardware virtual machines is

5020
05:10:07,260 --> 05:10:09,420
anyone in here I would imagine almost

5021
05:10:09,420 --> 05:10:11,100
all of you right have messed around with

5022
05:10:11,100 --> 05:10:12,780
some kind of virtual machine here or

5023
05:10:12,780 --> 05:10:17,660
there at my job we are literally 99

5024
05:10:17,660 --> 05:10:22,378
VMware I like VMware they're good

5025
05:10:22,378 --> 05:10:24,958
um but at home I because I run Windows

5026
05:10:24,958 --> 05:10:26,040
server

5027
05:10:26,040 --> 05:10:28,920
2019 I use hyper-v I actually want to

5028
05:10:28,920 --> 05:10:32,218
replace that with another piece of

5029
05:10:32,218 --> 05:10:35,340
software called xcpng from what I have

5030
05:10:35,340 --> 05:10:37,740
seen of it anyone here actually ever use

5031
05:10:37,740 --> 05:10:40,520
that by any chance

5032
05:10:40,920 --> 05:10:43,138
pretty decent that's yeah from what I've

5033
05:10:43,138 --> 05:10:45,420
seen it's comparable to VMware but

5034
05:10:45,420 --> 05:10:47,040
doesn't cost you know jillion dollars a

5035
05:10:47,040 --> 05:10:49,160
year

5036
05:10:55,020 --> 05:10:57,500
oh

5037
05:11:00,120 --> 05:11:02,458
interesting cool but to keep that in

5038
05:11:02,458 --> 05:11:03,900
mind

5039
05:11:03,900 --> 05:11:06,298
um so on the home network I run a domain

5040
05:11:06,298 --> 05:11:08,520
I love domains

5041
05:11:08,520 --> 05:11:10,680
it makes logging into multiple computers

5042
05:11:10,680 --> 05:11:12,540
really easy especially when you're doing

5043
05:11:12,540 --> 05:11:14,580
things like file sharing for you know

5044
05:11:14,580 --> 05:11:16,458
Cody

5045
05:11:16,458 --> 05:11:18,320
right

5046
05:11:18,320 --> 05:11:21,298
really really easy

5047
05:11:21,298 --> 05:11:23,760
um I also have a just a storage server

5048
05:11:23,760 --> 05:11:25,920
with 80 terabytes you got to have some

5049
05:11:25,920 --> 05:11:28,260
way to manage it you know I don't have

5050
05:11:28,260 --> 05:11:30,360
just one big 80 terabyte hard drive

5051
05:11:30,360 --> 05:11:32,638
which would be really cool if I did but

5052
05:11:32,638 --> 05:11:35,480
no it's a whole bunch of little ones USB

5053
05:11:35,480 --> 05:11:40,260
SSD spindle drives whatever the SATA

5054
05:11:40,260 --> 05:11:42,660
um I what's that

5055
05:11:42,660 --> 05:11:45,780
of course it's actually all mirrored

5056
05:11:45,780 --> 05:11:48,480
yeah I learned that lesson the hard way

5057
05:11:48,480 --> 05:11:50,458
too

5058
05:11:50,458 --> 05:11:52,680
what's that

5059
05:11:52,680 --> 05:11:54,780
it is not it is not

5060
05:11:54,780 --> 05:11:56,940
touch touche

5061
05:11:56,940 --> 05:12:00,840
I have a desktop used for downloading

5062
05:12:00,840 --> 05:12:02,340
things

5063
05:12:02,340 --> 05:12:04,680
I also have a database server which I

5064
05:12:04,680 --> 05:12:06,060
use for

5065
05:12:06,060 --> 05:12:09,000
um or Cali Cody

5066
05:12:09,000 --> 05:12:11,040
and then when I want to learn things

5067
05:12:11,040 --> 05:12:12,840
when I want to test out a new Linux

5068
05:12:12,840 --> 05:12:15,180
distribution and you know go distro

5069
05:12:15,180 --> 05:12:17,400
hopping or whatever it's really handy to

5070
05:12:17,400 --> 05:12:18,320
have

5071
05:12:18,320 --> 05:12:20,820
hypervisor to slap those machines on use

5072
05:12:20,820 --> 05:12:22,200
them test them out and then nuke them

5073
05:12:22,200 --> 05:12:24,298
when you're done you know or if you want

5074
05:12:24,298 --> 05:12:26,940
to do you know some red team testing

5075
05:12:26,940 --> 05:12:29,280
against like metasploitable

5076
05:12:29,280 --> 05:12:30,798
that kind of stuff

5077
05:12:30,798 --> 05:12:33,660
if you know windows isn't your cup of

5078
05:12:33,660 --> 05:12:35,400
tea

5079
05:12:35,400 --> 05:12:37,320
there are other options out there like

5080
05:12:37,320 --> 05:12:39,718
the xcpng I mentioned there's virtualbox

5081
05:12:39,718 --> 05:12:42,180
VMware Workstation player that kind of

5082
05:12:42,180 --> 05:12:43,980
stuff there are a ton of things what was

5083
05:12:43,980 --> 05:12:47,360
it Zen server I think you said right

5084
05:12:50,580 --> 05:12:54,200
no gotcha all right

5085
05:12:54,718 --> 05:12:57,420
oh gotcha and then of course because

5086
05:12:57,420 --> 05:12:59,820
it's a home network you've got the

5087
05:12:59,820 --> 05:13:03,480
obligatory battle station picture I

5088
05:13:03,480 --> 05:13:05,638
always see them pop around there if your

5089
05:13:05,638 --> 05:13:07,400
screen is an ultra wide are you even

5090
05:13:07,400 --> 05:13:10,940
screening come on

5091
05:13:12,060 --> 05:13:13,260
I

5092
05:13:13,260 --> 05:13:15,660
I love the ultra wide because there's no

5093
05:13:15,660 --> 05:13:19,218
line in the middle you know

5094
05:13:19,378 --> 05:13:22,638
so my home network

5095
05:13:23,340 --> 05:13:25,080
I didn't know how else to phrase this

5096
05:13:25,080 --> 05:13:26,820
the actual networking part of the home

5097
05:13:26,820 --> 05:13:30,000
network right the the the the data flow

5098
05:13:30,000 --> 05:13:32,400
so you know an ISP router really come on

5099
05:13:32,400 --> 05:13:35,100
and it's funny because I I know guys in

5100
05:13:35,100 --> 05:13:37,878
the like neck deep in the infosec

5101
05:13:37,878 --> 05:13:40,740
industry incident responders stuff like

5102
05:13:40,740 --> 05:13:43,378
that and they're still rocking

5103
05:13:43,378 --> 05:13:45,420
you know what their ISP gave them or I'm

5104
05:13:45,420 --> 05:13:47,040
like really come on what are you doing

5105
05:13:47,040 --> 05:13:48,378
man

5106
05:13:48,378 --> 05:13:52,080
right so personally I run pfSense there

5107
05:13:52,080 --> 05:13:54,600
are other options out there open sense

5108
05:13:54,600 --> 05:13:57,480
things like that and what happened was

5109
05:13:57,480 --> 05:14:00,600
uh this was I know 2014 something along

5110
05:14:00,600 --> 05:14:01,980
those lines

5111
05:14:01,980 --> 05:14:04,200
I came across an article

5112
05:14:04,200 --> 05:14:07,920
that a botnet was taking over ISP

5113
05:14:07,920 --> 05:14:10,200
routers particularly from like Action

5114
05:14:10,200 --> 05:14:13,980
Tech so I look in my room and

5115
05:14:13,980 --> 05:14:16,260
it was an action Tech and I was like but

5116
05:14:16,260 --> 05:14:18,660
wait I I didn't open any ports with

5117
05:14:18,660 --> 05:14:22,080
ports open and it turns out

5118
05:14:22,080 --> 05:14:24,360
that Century Link

5119
05:14:24,360 --> 05:14:26,878
kept the port open no matter what you

5120
05:14:26,878 --> 05:14:29,700
did so that way when you called them

5121
05:14:29,700 --> 05:14:31,560
they could remote into your router and

5122
05:14:31,560 --> 05:14:33,980
fix it for you that kind of thing

5123
05:14:33,980 --> 05:14:37,860
and that Port was being exploited on

5124
05:14:37,860 --> 05:14:40,620
people's devices that had weak passwords

5125
05:14:40,620 --> 05:14:42,660
now if you're using weak passwords will

5126
05:14:42,660 --> 05:14:45,000
you deserve what you get so cut it out

5127
05:14:45,000 --> 05:14:46,920
right

5128
05:14:46,920 --> 05:14:48,958
but it didn't sit right with me I didn't

5129
05:14:48,958 --> 05:14:50,218
like it

5130
05:14:50,218 --> 05:14:53,340
that's that's I bought my router like

5131
05:14:53,340 --> 05:14:55,980
from them I didn't rent it it was mine

5132
05:14:55,980 --> 05:14:58,680
I decide what's open on there not you

5133
05:14:58,680 --> 05:15:01,320
CenturyLink whatever

5134
05:15:01,320 --> 05:15:03,000
and so

5135
05:15:03,000 --> 05:15:05,160
I decided all right I'm going to look

5136
05:15:05,160 --> 05:15:07,680
for some kind of alternative what else

5137
05:15:07,680 --> 05:15:10,980
is out there that I could use

5138
05:15:10,980 --> 05:15:13,200
so I have control over what ports are

5139
05:15:13,200 --> 05:15:15,780
open what ports are closed that kind of

5140
05:15:15,780 --> 05:15:16,980
stuff and

5141
05:15:16,980 --> 05:15:19,020
did some research for a while and out of

5142
05:15:19,020 --> 05:15:20,760
everything I came across I found PF

5143
05:15:20,760 --> 05:15:23,520
sense and this is where I was just like

5144
05:15:23,520 --> 05:15:26,218
oh now I get it I had been using sonic

5145
05:15:26,218 --> 05:15:28,020
wall at work for a little bit in Sonic

5146
05:15:28,020 --> 05:15:29,940
wall is perfectly fine

5147
05:15:29,940 --> 05:15:32,040
if you want to pay thousands of dollars

5148
05:15:32,040 --> 05:15:33,600
a year to get all the cool stuff

5149
05:15:33,600 --> 05:15:37,760
unlocked it's like pay to win you know

5150
05:15:38,760 --> 05:15:41,900
right yeah so this here I love it

5151
05:15:41,900 --> 05:15:44,700
they're they're PF sense I slapped it on

5152
05:15:44,700 --> 05:15:46,980
there and I'll tell you what I haven't

5153
05:15:46,980 --> 05:15:49,860
seen an ad on my network in like a

5154
05:15:49,860 --> 05:15:52,020
decade

5155
05:15:52,020 --> 05:15:54,860
it's fantastic

5156
05:15:54,860 --> 05:15:57,840
goip filtering is something that I

5157
05:15:57,840 --> 05:15:59,458
absolutely love and that is another

5158
05:15:59,458 --> 05:16:01,260
thing that actually came in handy at

5159
05:16:01,260 --> 05:16:02,340
work

5160
05:16:02,340 --> 05:16:05,160
being a local non-profit we don't have a

5161
05:16:05,160 --> 05:16:07,980
huge presence in Russia so there was no

5162
05:16:07,980 --> 05:16:11,840
need to allow traffic to or from there

5163
05:16:13,458 --> 05:16:16,920
DNS block lists for a nicer cleaner

5164
05:16:16,920 --> 05:16:19,080
Internet that's right my friends they

5165
05:16:19,080 --> 05:16:22,340
are fantastic

5166
05:16:23,100 --> 05:16:26,458
well that's a big part of it total uh

5167
05:16:26,458 --> 05:16:28,560
yeah with all the lists I have on there

5168
05:16:28,560 --> 05:16:31,138
I think it's a total of about 640

5169
05:16:31,138 --> 05:16:32,100
000

5170
05:16:32,100 --> 05:16:34,130
sites that are blocked

5171
05:16:34,130 --> 05:16:34,620
[Music]

5172
05:16:34,620 --> 05:16:35,420
um

5173
05:16:35,420 --> 05:16:38,040
550 000 of them replaces the kids ought

5174
05:16:38,040 --> 05:16:39,420
not to be going

5175
05:16:39,420 --> 05:16:43,280
so again very handy

5176
05:16:48,718 --> 05:16:51,660
um you can have IP block lists as well

5177
05:16:51,660 --> 05:16:54,120
and those are really handy

5178
05:16:54,120 --> 05:16:56,218
um I have lists in there that are IP

5179
05:16:56,218 --> 05:16:58,680
addresses of known C2 servers known

5180
05:16:58,680 --> 05:17:01,798
ransomware hosts that kind of stuff so

5181
05:17:01,798 --> 05:17:03,718
that way when one of my kids does happen

5182
05:17:03,718 --> 05:17:06,180
to get click happy and they have and

5183
05:17:06,180 --> 05:17:08,520
still do

5184
05:17:08,520 --> 05:17:11,638
quick sidebar I come out into the dining

5185
05:17:11,638 --> 05:17:13,378
room all of our computers

5186
05:17:13,378 --> 05:17:15,120
are in the dining room

5187
05:17:15,120 --> 05:17:17,458
this was a few years ago when fortnite

5188
05:17:17,458 --> 05:17:20,760
was the business in my house the kids

5189
05:17:20,760 --> 05:17:22,138
loved it

5190
05:17:22,138 --> 05:17:23,878
I've never actually played it that's

5191
05:17:23,878 --> 05:17:25,920
right

5192
05:17:25,920 --> 05:17:27,060
so

5193
05:17:27,060 --> 05:17:30,600
one of the younger kids had come across

5194
05:17:30,600 --> 05:17:33,240
an article or something hey

5195
05:17:33,240 --> 05:17:35,820
you can get free V bucks

5196
05:17:35,820 --> 05:17:38,100
now he was excited because what kid

5197
05:17:38,100 --> 05:17:41,218
playing fortnite doesn't want v-bucks

5198
05:17:41,218 --> 05:17:42,840
oh

5199
05:17:42,840 --> 05:17:45,360
all you have to do the page says is

5200
05:17:45,360 --> 05:17:47,580
enter in all your information right here

5201
05:17:47,580 --> 05:17:49,200
now he was a younger kid he doesn't have

5202
05:17:49,200 --> 05:17:50,820
a lot of information to enter but

5203
05:17:50,820 --> 05:17:53,700
whatever information he did have he was

5204
05:17:53,700 --> 05:17:55,440
slamming it in their name address

5205
05:17:55,440 --> 05:17:57,420
whatever he could think of and it was

5206
05:17:57,420 --> 05:18:00,480
kind of like a slow motion

5207
05:18:00,480 --> 05:18:02,340
action movie

5208
05:18:02,340 --> 05:18:05,660
as I dove toward the computer no

5209
05:18:05,660 --> 05:18:08,040
you know

5210
05:18:08,040 --> 05:18:10,638
so

5211
05:18:10,798 --> 05:18:13,798
in times like that I'm glad that I have

5212
05:18:13,798 --> 05:18:16,798
a back end on the network that can help

5213
05:18:16,798 --> 05:18:19,500
prevent the kids from wandering off the

5214
05:18:19,500 --> 05:18:21,540
places oh you want to watch this video

5215
05:18:21,540 --> 05:18:24,240
click this player to install it you know

5216
05:18:24,240 --> 05:18:25,860
all that

5217
05:18:25,860 --> 05:18:29,458
vpns and DNS over TLS another thing I

5218
05:18:29,458 --> 05:18:31,980
absolutely love especially the DNS over

5219
05:18:31,980 --> 05:18:35,638
TLS your ISP is nosy

5220
05:18:35,638 --> 05:18:37,680
you know it they're always watching what

5221
05:18:37,680 --> 05:18:39,420
you're doing your DNS requests are all

5222
05:18:39,420 --> 05:18:41,458
just plain text flopping around for

5223
05:18:41,458 --> 05:18:43,680
everyone to see no good

5224
05:18:43,680 --> 05:18:47,520
right so with this PF sense and I I know

5225
05:18:47,520 --> 05:18:52,200
Firefox does it by default now

5226
05:18:52,200 --> 05:18:54,180
um I don't know if any of the other

5227
05:18:54,180 --> 05:18:57,540
Chrome does as well again going back to

5228
05:18:57,540 --> 05:18:59,100
what I said earlier I don't trust

5229
05:18:59,100 --> 05:19:00,840
browsers

5230
05:19:00,840 --> 05:19:02,940
they're lame

5231
05:19:02,940 --> 05:19:04,980
so with pfSense I'm able to actually

5232
05:19:04,980 --> 05:19:08,298
have DNS over TLS directly to

5233
05:19:08,298 --> 05:19:11,458
cloudflare's 1.1.1 I like them because

5234
05:19:11,458 --> 05:19:14,100
they don't log stuff

5235
05:19:14,100 --> 05:19:16,638
oh really

5236
05:19:19,680 --> 05:19:23,340
honestly I just Googled IP block lists

5237
05:19:23,340 --> 05:19:28,260
and DNS block lists for pfSense and I

5238
05:19:28,260 --> 05:19:29,820
can't remember off the top of my head

5239
05:19:29,820 --> 05:19:31,200
the site there were two sites in

5240
05:19:31,200 --> 05:19:34,700
particular that had phenomenal lists

5241
05:19:34,700 --> 05:19:36,780
and um

5242
05:19:36,780 --> 05:19:40,138
the false positives are a lot fewer than

5243
05:19:40,138 --> 05:19:41,878
you would think I do get some here and

5244
05:19:41,878 --> 05:19:43,500
there but you can it's got a white list

5245
05:19:43,500 --> 05:19:45,920
you can put

5246
05:19:48,298 --> 05:19:52,520
it yeah I remember Open DNS

5247
05:19:54,120 --> 05:19:57,240
uh one of my favorite things is the

5248
05:19:57,240 --> 05:19:59,458
ability to turn off internet access to

5249
05:19:59,458 --> 05:20:02,340
specific computers on a schedule

5250
05:20:02,340 --> 05:20:03,660
kids

5251
05:20:03,660 --> 05:20:05,580
who want to stay up all night watching

5252
05:20:05,580 --> 05:20:08,520
YouTube on their XBox on a school night

5253
05:20:08,520 --> 05:20:09,718
so

5254
05:20:09,718 --> 05:20:12,180
10 o'clock food

5255
05:20:12,180 --> 05:20:15,120
my youngest he's six

5256
05:20:15,120 --> 05:20:16,920
when 10 o'clock shows up because on

5257
05:20:16,920 --> 05:20:18,480
weekends they let them stay up late and

5258
05:20:18,480 --> 05:20:20,400
hang out and all that good stuff you

5259
05:20:20,400 --> 05:20:22,138
know but boy oh boy that 10 o'clock

5260
05:20:22,138 --> 05:20:23,760
shows up and you'd swear he'd cut off

5261
05:20:23,760 --> 05:20:24,958
his foot

5262
05:20:24,958 --> 05:20:27,780
he could why is it 10 o'clock I'm like

5263
05:20:27,780 --> 05:20:30,600
but that's how time works I don't know

5264
05:20:30,600 --> 05:20:34,579
but either way the internet's off go

5265
05:20:36,000 --> 05:20:38,280
um the dashboards Enterprise level

5266
05:20:38,280 --> 05:20:41,700
routers offer are absolutely wonderful

5267
05:20:41,700 --> 05:20:44,700
they give you so much information and

5268
05:20:44,700 --> 05:20:47,520
detail about what's go what's going

5269
05:20:47,520 --> 05:20:50,160
where how much bandwidth it's using in

5270
05:20:50,160 --> 05:20:53,580
this day and age of data caps I don't

5271
05:20:53,580 --> 05:20:55,620
like those either yeah it costs them

5272
05:20:55,620 --> 05:20:57,600
that much more money to send me 10 extra

5273
05:20:57,600 --> 05:20:58,980
gigabytes

5274
05:20:58,980 --> 05:21:00,660
70 bucks

5275
05:21:00,660 --> 05:21:02,458
whatever

5276
05:21:02,458 --> 05:21:05,100
and there are a lot of different plugins

5277
05:21:05,100 --> 05:21:07,440
that are available for it I use one

5278
05:21:07,440 --> 05:21:10,560
called ntop NG I absolutely love that it

5279
05:21:10,560 --> 05:21:12,480
lists out all of the hosts on the

5280
05:21:12,480 --> 05:21:13,980
network who they're talking to how much

5281
05:21:13,980 --> 05:21:16,260
bandwidth they're using what protocol it

5282
05:21:16,260 --> 05:21:18,298
is it's fantastic if it's happening on

5283
05:21:18,298 --> 05:21:20,700
my network I know and it's really fun to

5284
05:21:20,700 --> 05:21:22,138
watch when the kids try and go places

5285
05:21:22,138 --> 05:21:24,000
they ought not to go I have two

5286
05:21:24,000 --> 05:21:26,760
teenagers in the house a 17 year old 14

5287
05:21:26,760 --> 05:21:27,840
year old

5288
05:21:27,840 --> 05:21:29,900
so it's really fun to watch the little

5289
05:21:29,900 --> 05:21:34,020
counters go up like ah and you can even

5290
05:21:34,020 --> 05:21:37,280
see where they were trying to go

5291
05:21:37,560 --> 05:21:40,560
so just because I figure staring at

5292
05:21:40,560 --> 05:21:42,780
words for a long time is boring I threw

5293
05:21:42,780 --> 05:21:44,638
a picture in there this is the dashboard

5294
05:21:44,638 --> 05:21:47,280
of PF sense and all the juicy bits have

5295
05:21:47,280 --> 05:21:48,780
been blacked out so don't think you're

5296
05:21:48,780 --> 05:21:51,070
getting my IP address you leave me alone

5297
05:21:51,070 --> 05:21:54,420
[Laughter]

5298
05:21:56,700 --> 05:21:58,798
counters for blocked packets and things

5299
05:21:58,798 --> 05:22:01,260
like that it's got Hardware status how

5300
05:22:01,260 --> 05:22:02,760
much bandwidth have used all that good

5301
05:22:02,760 --> 05:22:05,120
stuff

5302
05:22:08,700 --> 05:22:12,000
right so how did you actually make it to

5303
05:22:12,000 --> 05:22:13,798
I'm not going to say that because we're

5304
05:22:13,798 --> 05:22:17,100
in public right now you know

5305
05:22:17,100 --> 05:22:19,980
my home network but without wires this

5306
05:22:19,980 --> 05:22:22,020
one

5307
05:22:22,020 --> 05:22:24,240
I don't like Wireless

5308
05:22:24,240 --> 05:22:27,540
it's unreliable it's finally getting

5309
05:22:27,540 --> 05:22:30,718
fast it's only taken what 20 years and

5310
05:22:30,718 --> 05:22:32,520
we're yeah

5311
05:22:32,520 --> 05:22:34,500
right but even then if your neighbor

5312
05:22:34,500 --> 05:22:36,180
happens to run on the same channel as

5313
05:22:36,180 --> 05:22:37,260
you

5314
05:22:37,260 --> 05:22:40,260
it's better now than it used to be and

5315
05:22:40,260 --> 05:22:44,359
I'm sorry but Wi-Fi keys are gross

5316
05:22:44,520 --> 05:22:47,060
right

5317
05:22:47,100 --> 05:22:50,040
40 96-bit certs are the way to

5318
05:22:50,040 --> 05:22:53,160
authenticate your wireless yeah that's

5319
05:22:53,160 --> 05:22:56,340
good stuff the downside to using 802.1x

5320
05:22:56,340 --> 05:22:57,958
or certificate based authentication

5321
05:22:57,958 --> 05:23:00,540
don't use EAP

5322
05:23:00,540 --> 05:23:03,780
anyone here like Ms chap

5323
05:23:03,780 --> 05:23:05,760
oh you almost raised his hand he was

5324
05:23:05,760 --> 05:23:08,239
like maybe

5325
05:23:08,340 --> 05:23:10,040
right

5326
05:23:10,040 --> 05:23:11,820
certificate-based authentication is

5327
05:23:11,820 --> 05:23:14,100
great on things that support you

5328
05:23:14,100 --> 05:23:16,080
installing certificates on them and

5329
05:23:16,080 --> 05:23:17,700
support Enterprise level Wi-Fi

5330
05:23:17,700 --> 05:23:20,040
authentication not everything does

5331
05:23:20,040 --> 05:23:21,900
that's where the multi-sid comes into

5332
05:23:21,900 --> 05:23:23,580
play later

5333
05:23:23,580 --> 05:23:25,740
because you can have different types of

5334
05:23:25,740 --> 05:23:27,958
authentication on different SIDS so you

5335
05:23:27,958 --> 05:23:30,060
get your important machines on one you

5336
05:23:30,060 --> 05:23:32,040
put the kids machines because who cares

5337
05:23:32,040 --> 05:23:34,440
about those no I'm kidding you put the

5338
05:23:34,440 --> 05:23:36,780
not in iot stuff and things like that on

5339
05:23:36,780 --> 05:23:38,580
the key based

5340
05:23:38,580 --> 05:23:40,920
Wi-Fi but you keep your important

5341
05:23:40,920 --> 05:23:43,138
machines the ones that I don't know if

5342
05:23:43,138 --> 05:23:44,940
any of you guys actually still Bank on a

5343
05:23:44,940 --> 05:23:46,798
desktop PC or if everyone here just uses

5344
05:23:46,798 --> 05:23:48,060
their phone for it

5345
05:23:48,060 --> 05:23:50,760
I'm I'm old school you'll pry my

5346
05:23:50,760 --> 05:23:52,798
computer for my cold dead hands you can

5347
05:23:52,798 --> 05:23:54,660
keep your phone with a little six inch

5348
05:23:54,660 --> 05:23:56,840
screen

5349
05:23:59,340 --> 05:24:01,860
um Sid and Ice uh client isolation are

5350
05:24:01,860 --> 05:24:04,860
also absolutely wonderful so you can

5351
05:24:04,860 --> 05:24:07,080
keep what point is having multiple SIDS

5352
05:24:07,080 --> 05:24:08,878
if they can talk across to one another

5353
05:24:08,878 --> 05:24:11,700
it's kind of silly you know

5354
05:24:11,700 --> 05:24:14,760
security there but with SSID isolation

5355
05:24:14,760 --> 05:24:16,740
and client isolation I don't go as far

5356
05:24:16,740 --> 05:24:18,958
as client isolation that's kind of mean

5357
05:24:18,958 --> 05:24:22,138
but Sid isolation yes absolutely I keep

5358
05:24:22,138 --> 05:24:25,200
the kids devices on their own network

5359
05:24:25,200 --> 05:24:27,660
named damn kids

5360
05:24:27,660 --> 05:24:29,520
I figure the neighbors get a kick out of

5361
05:24:29,520 --> 05:24:31,638
that

5362
05:24:32,160 --> 05:24:35,940
right other things that

5363
05:24:35,940 --> 05:24:37,980
you know like my computer that my my

5364
05:24:37,980 --> 05:24:39,718
stuff the girlfriend stuff that goes on

5365
05:24:39,718 --> 05:24:42,840
a different network and then for Cody it

5366
05:24:42,840 --> 05:24:44,760
has its own Wi-Fi network so there's no

5367
05:24:44,760 --> 05:24:46,860
other traffic and I know multi-user memo

5368
05:24:46,860 --> 05:24:48,600
takes care of all yeah

5369
05:24:48,600 --> 05:24:52,040
multi-sid it's good stuff

5370
05:24:52,040 --> 05:24:55,260
ipsec anyone here ever set up an ipsec

5371
05:24:55,260 --> 05:24:56,218
tunnel

5372
05:24:56,218 --> 05:24:58,920
cup one two three five right they're

5373
05:24:58,920 --> 05:25:00,920
they're all right they get the job done

5374
05:25:00,920 --> 05:25:03,780
and this is one of those areas where

5375
05:25:03,780 --> 05:25:06,240
messing around with Enterprise level

5376
05:25:06,240 --> 05:25:08,280
stuff at home actually helped me out at

5377
05:25:08,280 --> 05:25:10,520
work

5378
05:25:10,860 --> 05:25:14,040
way back when before smb3 was the cool

5379
05:25:14,040 --> 05:25:15,480
hotness

5380
05:25:15,480 --> 05:25:19,020
he had SMB too with no encryption gross

5381
05:25:19,020 --> 05:25:22,378
I wanted encryption because like I said

5382
05:25:22,378 --> 05:25:24,240
at the beginning I love encryption it's

5383
05:25:24,240 --> 05:25:26,340
fantastic you keep your eyes off my

5384
05:25:26,340 --> 05:25:27,718
stuff

5385
05:25:27,718 --> 05:25:29,878
so I figured a great way to do this

5386
05:25:29,878 --> 05:25:33,000
would be to set up an ifsc tunnel I like

5387
05:25:33,000 --> 05:25:35,700
vpns I use one for one of my computers

5388
05:25:35,700 --> 05:25:38,638
to go out to the internet ah I think you

5389
05:25:38,638 --> 05:25:40,260
might know which one the downloading

5390
05:25:40,260 --> 05:25:41,580
stuff one

5391
05:25:41,580 --> 05:25:44,958
hits in the Netherlands

5392
05:25:46,218 --> 05:25:48,298
what's that

5393
05:25:48,298 --> 05:25:51,320
hahaha haha

5394
05:25:51,320 --> 05:25:53,458
I don't know what that means but I like

5395
05:25:53,458 --> 05:25:55,638
it

5396
05:25:55,860 --> 05:25:58,400
oh

5397
05:25:59,940 --> 05:26:02,458
so I tinkered around with it I learned

5398
05:26:02,458 --> 05:26:04,320
the process for creating an ipsec tunnel

5399
05:26:04,320 --> 05:26:05,940
between two machines and I loved it it

5400
05:26:05,940 --> 05:26:07,620
was so great seeing it listed there and

5401
05:26:07,620 --> 05:26:09,718
it was encrypted and you know it got

5402
05:26:09,718 --> 05:26:12,420
warm and fuzzy and did a little dance

5403
05:26:12,420 --> 05:26:15,980
fast forward a few years

5404
05:26:16,440 --> 05:26:20,298
now at work we use cassaya

5405
05:26:21,718 --> 05:26:23,218
I yeah

5406
05:26:23,218 --> 05:26:26,940
yes anyone here remember caseya from

5407
05:26:26,940 --> 05:26:28,620
what was it like a year year and a half

5408
05:26:28,620 --> 05:26:30,180
ago something like that they had a

5409
05:26:30,180 --> 05:26:31,138
little

5410
05:26:31,138 --> 05:26:33,240
thing happen there

5411
05:26:33,240 --> 05:26:35,820
whoops they got

5412
05:26:35,820 --> 05:26:37,740
uh they got hit by a supply chain attack

5413
05:26:37,740 --> 05:26:39,180
and what was it two thousand three

5414
05:26:39,180 --> 05:26:40,320
thousand of their customers got

5415
05:26:40,320 --> 05:26:42,600
ransomware

5416
05:26:42,600 --> 05:26:43,980
weren't one of them

5417
05:26:43,980 --> 05:26:46,860
luckily enough we have an on-premises

5418
05:26:46,860 --> 05:26:48,298
setup

5419
05:26:48,298 --> 05:26:50,940
nonetheless as a result of that hack

5420
05:26:50,940 --> 05:26:52,200
they

5421
05:26:52,200 --> 05:26:54,660
took away the ticketing system that we

5422
05:26:54,660 --> 05:26:56,878
use internally we use cassayed actually

5423
05:26:56,878 --> 05:27:00,000
mostly for ticketing it works and it

5424
05:27:00,000 --> 05:27:02,160
works well we liked it they got rid of

5425
05:27:02,160 --> 05:27:03,780
the part

5426
05:27:03,780 --> 05:27:05,760
that we used and replaced it with

5427
05:27:05,760 --> 05:27:07,798
something not nearly as good

5428
05:27:07,798 --> 05:27:10,620
because of course right

5429
05:27:10,620 --> 05:27:13,320
and one of the functions of our old

5430
05:27:13,320 --> 05:27:15,000
ticketing system

5431
05:27:15,000 --> 05:27:18,000
was emailing people

5432
05:27:18,000 --> 05:27:20,218
right it would email us when the person

5433
05:27:20,218 --> 05:27:21,840
put in the ticket and it would email the

5434
05:27:21,840 --> 05:27:23,280
person when we replied to the ticket

5435
05:27:23,280 --> 05:27:27,138
with questions or answers what have you

5436
05:27:27,958 --> 05:27:29,820
indeed

5437
05:27:29,820 --> 05:27:32,218
right well

5438
05:27:32,218 --> 05:27:34,920
a problem popped up in that they're

5439
05:27:34,920 --> 05:27:37,378
super cool new awesome ticketing system

5440
05:27:37,378 --> 05:27:43,740
didn't support TLS 1.2 in 2021 or two

5441
05:27:43,740 --> 05:27:46,200
I think it was 2022.

5442
05:27:46,200 --> 05:27:49,798
they required TLS 1.1 which is

5443
05:27:49,798 --> 05:27:52,200
deprecated and gross and no one wants to

5444
05:27:52,200 --> 05:27:55,980
use it anymore and our Exchange Server

5445
05:27:55,980 --> 05:27:57,540
were on premises we don't we haven't

5446
05:27:57,540 --> 05:28:00,480
gone to the cloud hey you

5447
05:28:00,480 --> 05:28:02,400
we haven't gone to the Cloud yet we'll

5448
05:28:02,400 --> 05:28:04,980
get there we're old school so we turned

5449
05:28:04,980 --> 05:28:07,440
off all TLS except for 1.2 on our

5450
05:28:07,440 --> 05:28:09,180
Exchange Server because it's hanging out

5451
05:28:09,180 --> 05:28:11,638
there on the internet and mail service

5452
05:28:11,638 --> 05:28:13,680
kind of had those big Targets on them

5453
05:28:13,680 --> 05:28:15,840
they come get me

5454
05:28:15,840 --> 05:28:19,620
right so our new awesome super cool

5455
05:28:19,620 --> 05:28:22,080
ticketing system couldn't talk to the

5456
05:28:22,080 --> 05:28:23,760
mail server this was a problem because

5457
05:28:23,760 --> 05:28:25,680
it was all the ticketing for the

5458
05:28:25,680 --> 05:28:27,000
organization

5459
05:28:27,000 --> 05:28:30,060
and now we're not huge but it's like you

5460
05:28:30,060 --> 05:28:31,798
know a couple hundred people

5461
05:28:31,798 --> 05:28:34,320
that's a lot of email

5462
05:28:34,320 --> 05:28:37,080
now it turns out

5463
05:28:37,080 --> 05:28:40,020
the IMAP portion of it kind of worked

5464
05:28:40,020 --> 05:28:43,500
but only in plain text and well we're

5465
05:28:43,500 --> 05:28:45,298
not going to be sending plain text even

5466
05:28:45,298 --> 05:28:47,520
floating around so

5467
05:28:47,520 --> 05:28:49,200
I had one of those epipheral moments

5468
05:28:49,200 --> 05:28:50,520
where the light bulb

5469
05:28:50,520 --> 05:28:52,680
goes off and I was like dude we can

5470
05:28:52,680 --> 05:28:54,240
create an upset tunnel between the

5471
05:28:54,240 --> 05:28:56,160
cassaya server and the exchange server

5472
05:28:56,160 --> 05:28:58,680
and have it send the emails via that

5473
05:28:58,680 --> 05:29:00,780
tunnel so

5474
05:29:00,780 --> 05:29:02,940
a little bit later we tested it out lo

5475
05:29:02,940 --> 05:29:04,138
and behold we had a wonderfully

5476
05:29:04,138 --> 05:29:06,240
encrypted connection between the cassaya

5477
05:29:06,240 --> 05:29:08,458
server The Exchange Server it can extend

5478
05:29:08,458 --> 05:29:11,940
it can say emails problem solved

5479
05:29:11,940 --> 05:29:14,400
all because I got curious a couple of

5480
05:29:14,400 --> 05:29:16,320
years earlier and wanted to encrypt my

5481
05:29:16,320 --> 05:29:19,260
home network traffic because smb2 was

5482
05:29:19,260 --> 05:29:21,559
stupid

5483
05:29:23,218 --> 05:29:25,560
another part of that is

5484
05:29:25,560 --> 05:29:26,760
oh

5485
05:29:26,760 --> 05:29:29,820
uh certificate authorities

5486
05:29:29,820 --> 05:29:31,740
um they're really really handy if you

5487
05:29:31,740 --> 05:29:33,840
have internal websites which is rare on

5488
05:29:33,840 --> 05:29:35,218
a home network but if you get into

5489
05:29:35,218 --> 05:29:38,218
things like PF sense or prtg network

5490
05:29:38,218 --> 05:29:40,080
monitor

5491
05:29:40,080 --> 05:29:41,878
you can make the little lock show up I

5492
05:29:41,878 --> 05:29:43,320
don't know if anyone here is quite as

5493
05:29:43,320 --> 05:29:45,298
picky about that as I am but I like to

5494
05:29:45,298 --> 05:29:47,340
have the lock

5495
05:29:47,340 --> 05:29:49,440
it's nice

5496
05:29:49,440 --> 05:29:50,760
um

5497
05:29:50,760 --> 05:29:53,660
it also makes setting up a

5498
05:29:53,660 --> 05:29:55,680
certificate-based authentication for

5499
05:29:55,680 --> 05:29:57,718
your Wi-Fi much easier if you have a

5500
05:29:57,718 --> 05:30:00,420
certificate Authority and hey it turns

5501
05:30:00,420 --> 05:30:02,638
out you can't crack Wi-Fi key if you

5502
05:30:02,638 --> 05:30:05,040
don't use Wi-Fi keys

5503
05:30:05,040 --> 05:30:07,320
right so it is a great way to do it the

5504
05:30:07,320 --> 05:30:10,138
downside again being iot devices tablets

5505
05:30:10,138 --> 05:30:13,020
well tablets kind of support it you try

5506
05:30:13,020 --> 05:30:16,280
and get assert onto an Alexa

5507
05:30:17,218 --> 05:30:20,060
or your oven

5508
05:30:23,940 --> 05:30:25,500
on the internet

5509
05:30:25,500 --> 05:30:27,860
anyway

5510
05:30:30,780 --> 05:30:33,500
right right

5511
05:30:37,138 --> 05:30:39,958
um it can also be useful if if you're

5512
05:30:39,958 --> 05:30:43,200
into inline https inspection you dirty

5513
05:30:43,200 --> 05:30:45,480
man in the middle attackers you

5514
05:30:45,480 --> 05:30:48,660
cut it out PF sense supports like squid

5515
05:30:48,660 --> 05:30:50,040
and things like that where you can do

5516
05:30:50,040 --> 05:30:52,798
inline https inspection having assert

5517
05:30:52,798 --> 05:30:54,958
Authority makes that a lot easier

5518
05:30:54,958 --> 05:30:56,638
because then you can slap certs on

5519
05:30:56,638 --> 05:30:58,080
everything on the network and watch what

5520
05:30:58,080 --> 05:31:00,298
they're doing and be like ah got your

5521
05:31:00,298 --> 05:31:03,420
password and your bank account

5522
05:31:03,420 --> 05:31:05,940
and now Network stuff isn't the only

5523
05:31:05,940 --> 05:31:07,138
thing you got to keep safe you got to

5524
05:31:07,138 --> 05:31:09,120
keep your data safe

5525
05:31:09,120 --> 05:31:10,860
right you have tons of the stuff

5526
05:31:10,860 --> 05:31:12,420
floating around the house and yeah you

5527
05:31:12,420 --> 05:31:15,180
could use BitLocker whatever bitlugger's

5528
05:31:15,180 --> 05:31:17,820
great if you're on a laptop

5529
05:31:17,820 --> 05:31:20,878
what about all your hard drives at home

5530
05:31:20,878 --> 05:31:23,218
now me I use true Nas used to be called

5531
05:31:23,218 --> 05:31:24,600
freenas

5532
05:31:24,600 --> 05:31:29,760
I love trunes absolutely love it ZFS is

5533
05:31:29,760 --> 05:31:31,740
by far much cooler than the stuff that

5534
05:31:31,740 --> 05:31:34,860
isn't ZFS it encrypts data with flight I

5535
05:31:34,860 --> 05:31:37,500
think it's AES 200 256 which is

5536
05:31:37,500 --> 05:31:39,240
absolutely wonderful it's got a great

5537
05:31:39,240 --> 05:31:40,680
dashboard

5538
05:31:40,680 --> 05:31:43,740
with tons of information about your

5539
05:31:43,740 --> 05:31:46,860
storage and you can get particularly

5540
05:31:46,860 --> 05:31:48,780
granular

5541
05:31:48,780 --> 05:31:51,180
with your permissions which again helps

5542
05:31:51,180 --> 05:31:52,320
out

5543
05:31:52,320 --> 05:31:54,420
in my case with Cody

5544
05:31:54,420 --> 05:31:56,400
you know you can I don't want the kids

5545
05:31:56,400 --> 05:31:58,260
watching that stuff so you put a little

5546
05:31:58,260 --> 05:32:00,780
you block the permissions and then just

5547
05:32:00,780 --> 05:32:02,520
they click on the picture and it doesn't

5548
05:32:02,520 --> 05:32:04,860
work fantastic

5549
05:32:04,860 --> 05:32:07,560
if trunes doesn't really seem to fit

5550
05:32:07,560 --> 05:32:08,700
your bill

5551
05:32:08,700 --> 05:32:11,160
there are other storage options out

5552
05:32:11,160 --> 05:32:14,580
there like open media Vault or unraid is

5553
05:32:14,580 --> 05:32:16,200
another one I almost went with unraid

5554
05:32:16,200 --> 05:32:18,240
but true Nez won

5555
05:32:18,240 --> 05:32:20,940
because I don't know why honestly I

5556
05:32:20,940 --> 05:32:23,820
liked it unread cost money

5557
05:32:23,820 --> 05:32:25,440
right true and has the price is right

5558
05:32:25,440 --> 05:32:28,440
because there's not one unless you want

5559
05:32:28,440 --> 05:32:30,120
the fancy version but

5560
05:32:30,120 --> 05:32:32,580
it's not much different than this and

5561
05:32:32,580 --> 05:32:36,480
just a quick screenshot of what true Nez

5562
05:32:36,480 --> 05:32:37,920
right when I want to know about my

5563
05:32:37,920 --> 05:32:38,958
storage

5564
05:32:38,958 --> 05:32:43,138
it doesn't say TV shows and movies

5565
05:32:43,138 --> 05:32:45,739
it's fine

5566
05:32:46,620 --> 05:32:50,100
of course I do absolutely I am just I'm

5567
05:32:50,100 --> 05:32:53,400
an off-site archive specialist

5568
05:32:53,400 --> 05:32:56,638
right oh yeah sounds good

5569
05:32:56,638 --> 05:32:58,980
right now you may be thinking Chris this

5570
05:32:58,980 --> 05:33:00,480
has been great

5571
05:33:00,480 --> 05:33:03,240
but at what cost and the only time this

5572
05:33:03,240 --> 05:33:04,860
really gets out of hand cost wise is

5573
05:33:04,860 --> 05:33:06,360
when you decide that Windows server is

5574
05:33:06,360 --> 05:33:07,620
the way to go I was looking around today

5575
05:33:07,620 --> 05:33:10,138
at the prices Windows Server 2022 is

5576
05:33:10,138 --> 05:33:14,160
like an average of like 800 bucks

5577
05:33:14,160 --> 05:33:16,560
I'm not paying 800 bucks I have an msdn

5578
05:33:16,560 --> 05:33:19,680
thing so yay

5579
05:33:19,680 --> 05:33:22,200
there are tons of Open Source free

5580
05:33:22,200 --> 05:33:24,180
alternatives for everything that we've

5581
05:33:24,180 --> 05:33:26,520
talked about today you know or options I

5582
05:33:26,520 --> 05:33:28,920
should say not Alternatives but options

5583
05:33:28,920 --> 05:33:30,660
right so it doesn't have to cost you an

5584
05:33:30,660 --> 05:33:33,298
arm a leg a toe a tooth or anything like

5585
05:33:33,298 --> 05:33:34,860
that to secure your home network with

5586
05:33:34,860 --> 05:33:37,138
right

5587
05:33:37,138 --> 05:33:39,360
with Enterprise level

5588
05:33:39,360 --> 05:33:42,298
Protection security you got old Hardware

5589
05:33:42,298 --> 05:33:45,600
use it my my first PF sense box was an

5590
05:33:45,600 --> 05:33:50,340
HP DX 2400 from 2008.

5591
05:33:50,340 --> 05:33:53,580
I used that up until last year

5592
05:33:53,580 --> 05:33:55,798
when it got replaced with the Lenovo and

5593
05:33:55,798 --> 05:33:59,218
it it chugged it it was filled with dust

5594
05:33:59,218 --> 05:34:01,320
but it chalked it was good

5595
05:34:01,320 --> 05:34:04,260
it had a Core 2 Duo in it

5596
05:34:04,260 --> 05:34:08,458
four gigs of RAM 32-bit processor it was

5597
05:34:08,458 --> 05:34:10,940
a beast

5598
05:34:14,160 --> 05:34:17,218
so finally what about work

5599
05:34:17,218 --> 05:34:18,840
you said like three times it helped you

5600
05:34:18,840 --> 05:34:21,240
out at work it's definitely a two-way

5601
05:34:21,240 --> 05:34:23,218
street stuff I've done at home helped me

5602
05:34:23,218 --> 05:34:25,798
out in my professional life and stuff

5603
05:34:25,798 --> 05:34:28,680
that I did at work helped me secure my

5604
05:34:28,680 --> 05:34:30,958
home network so it's definitely a back

5605
05:34:30,958 --> 05:34:32,760
and forth

5606
05:34:32,760 --> 05:34:33,540
um

5607
05:34:33,540 --> 05:34:35,580
you know things like I mentioned earlier

5608
05:34:35,580 --> 05:34:38,218
goip filtering I was able to set that up

5609
05:34:38,218 --> 05:34:40,080
at work it was never done before and it

5610
05:34:40,080 --> 05:34:42,360
reduced the amount of spam we get by

5611
05:34:42,360 --> 05:34:45,000
like 80 percent

5612
05:34:45,000 --> 05:34:48,360
it was fantastic yes and there's also a

5613
05:34:48,360 --> 05:34:50,940
botnet filter that I had set up in there

5614
05:34:50,940 --> 05:34:52,920
as well so that helped out

5615
05:34:52,920 --> 05:34:54,780
um the ipsec tunneling I went into

5616
05:34:54,780 --> 05:34:56,700
enough detail about that I'm not going

5617
05:34:56,700 --> 05:35:00,240
to get into that radius which is part of

5618
05:35:00,240 --> 05:35:02,760
certificate based Wi-Fi authentication

5619
05:35:02,760 --> 05:35:05,218
it turns out if you want to start using

5620
05:35:05,218 --> 05:35:08,458
two-factor Authentication

5621
05:35:08,458 --> 05:35:10,920
with things like VMware Horizon and

5622
05:35:10,920 --> 05:35:12,718
stuff like that you need a radius server

5623
05:35:12,718 --> 05:35:14,700
well lucky me

5624
05:35:14,700 --> 05:35:16,980
I had one set up and played with it and

5625
05:35:16,980 --> 05:35:18,718
I'm familiar with the concepts and stuff

5626
05:35:18,718 --> 05:35:21,120
why because they did it at home

5627
05:35:21,120 --> 05:35:22,798
score

5628
05:35:22,798 --> 05:35:25,200
VPN setups

5629
05:35:25,200 --> 05:35:27,540
I use a VPN at home like I said I got

5630
05:35:27,540 --> 05:35:29,340
that one computer out there fantastic

5631
05:35:29,340 --> 05:35:31,260
well there was a point at which we had

5632
05:35:31,260 --> 05:35:35,100
to set up a site to site VPN

5633
05:35:35,100 --> 05:35:38,638
at work knew how to do that yeah another

5634
05:35:38,638 --> 05:35:41,820
win SSH tunneling which can be very

5635
05:35:41,820 --> 05:35:45,079
dangerous if you do it wrong

5636
05:35:45,120 --> 05:35:48,298
filter those IPS guys only let the right

5637
05:35:48,298 --> 05:35:50,520
ones in

5638
05:35:50,520 --> 05:35:53,160
indeed don't expect

5639
05:35:53,160 --> 05:35:55,320
your private Keys private

5640
05:35:55,320 --> 05:35:57,060
if there's anything if you take anything

5641
05:35:57,060 --> 05:36:00,120
from this take that

5642
05:36:00,120 --> 05:36:02,400
right and DNS block lists although sonic

5643
05:36:02,400 --> 05:36:05,520
wall has much more limited support for

5644
05:36:05,520 --> 05:36:07,920
them than PF sense does it does support

5645
05:36:07,920 --> 05:36:09,600
at least for email servers which is nice

5646
05:36:09,600 --> 05:36:11,280
you can put sorbs in there and get all

5647
05:36:11,280 --> 05:36:14,340
kinds of false positives it's fantastic

5648
05:36:14,340 --> 05:36:17,940
right and on my home network I was able

5649
05:36:17,940 --> 05:36:21,480
to develop

5650
05:36:21,540 --> 05:36:22,798
game

5651
05:36:22,798 --> 05:36:25,680
control over which devices are allowed

5652
05:36:25,680 --> 05:36:27,718
to connect to my network in the first

5653
05:36:27,718 --> 05:36:29,160
place

5654
05:36:29,160 --> 05:36:31,620
right using my Wi-Fi I can have access

5655
05:36:31,620 --> 05:36:33,660
control which by default says any new

5656
05:36:33,660 --> 05:36:34,860
device no

5657
05:36:34,860 --> 05:36:36,480
too bad for you you can't go on I have

5658
05:36:36,480 --> 05:36:39,120
to go in log in allow the device so I

5659
05:36:39,120 --> 05:36:40,620
know who's on there who's not that kind

5660
05:36:40,620 --> 05:36:42,600
of stuff

5661
05:36:42,600 --> 05:36:46,620
right I can control when they connect

5662
05:36:46,620 --> 05:36:48,958
which is the the Wi-Fi scheduling I was

5663
05:36:48,958 --> 05:36:50,820
talking about earlier

5664
05:36:50,820 --> 05:36:52,980
um very granular control over where

5665
05:36:52,980 --> 05:36:55,378
those devices go using the DNS block

5666
05:36:55,378 --> 05:36:57,240
list IP filters and things like that

5667
05:36:57,240 --> 05:36:59,458
that I had talked about earlier

5668
05:36:59,458 --> 05:37:01,680
and most importantly I can control how

5669
05:37:01,680 --> 05:37:03,798
much bandwidth they gobble up because

5670
05:37:03,798 --> 05:37:07,378
Cox charges 70 bucks

5671
05:37:07,378 --> 05:37:09,958
to go over like 50 gigabytes or

5672
05:37:09,958 --> 05:37:11,700
something like that

5673
05:37:11,700 --> 05:37:14,638
what is this 1998 get at it gigabyte

5674
05:37:14,638 --> 05:37:17,420
don't cost that much

5675
05:37:19,138 --> 05:37:20,878
um

5676
05:37:20,878 --> 05:37:22,920
I was able to set up and understand

5677
05:37:22,920 --> 05:37:25,138
Enterprise level storage management

5678
05:37:25,138 --> 05:37:27,420
which I had actually learned using IBM

5679
05:37:27,420 --> 05:37:29,458
store-wise anyone remember those before

5680
05:37:29,458 --> 05:37:31,080
they became Lenovo

5681
05:37:31,080 --> 05:37:33,780
had a DS 3200

5682
05:37:33,780 --> 05:37:37,020
fantastic and then of course I was able

5683
05:37:37,020 --> 05:37:38,638
to set up because of that Enterprise

5684
05:37:38,638 --> 05:37:42,298
level storage I can have redundancy I

5685
05:37:42,298 --> 05:37:44,700
know raid is in backup

5686
05:37:44,700 --> 05:37:47,340
but it's handy it's nice to know it's

5687
05:37:47,340 --> 05:37:49,138
mirrored at least

5688
05:37:49,138 --> 05:37:50,878
all right

5689
05:37:50,878 --> 05:37:53,160
thank you very much I appreciate you

5690
05:37:53,160 --> 05:37:56,240
coming to listen to my soothing voice

5691
05:37:56,240 --> 05:37:59,320
for 45 minutes thank you thank you

5692
05:37:59,320 --> 05:38:03,900
[Applause]

5693
05:38:03,900 --> 05:38:07,100
any questions

5694
05:38:07,440 --> 05:38:09,540
let's not get feedback let's not be that

5695
05:38:09,540 --> 05:38:15,060
guy yes wait uh here we go instead of a

5696
05:38:15,060 --> 05:38:17,340
um more recent more modern VPN like

5697
05:38:17,340 --> 05:38:19,020
wireguard

5698
05:38:19,020 --> 05:38:21,000
um just because it was in my house just

5699
05:38:21,000 --> 05:38:23,400
Windows machine to Windows machine I

5700
05:38:23,400 --> 05:38:25,020
wanted something built in

5701
05:38:25,020 --> 05:38:27,480
and I was like all right you know I know

5702
05:38:27,480 --> 05:38:29,458
it wasn't the best solution but it

5703
05:38:29,458 --> 05:38:30,840
worked really

5704
05:38:30,840 --> 05:38:33,798
worked really well

5705
05:38:34,020 --> 05:38:35,458
okay

5706
05:38:35,458 --> 05:38:36,958
anyone else no

5707
05:38:36,958 --> 05:38:39,900
okay well all right then thank you again

5708
05:38:39,900 --> 05:38:42,660
I appreciate you coming

5709
05:38:42,660 --> 05:38:44,280
hopefully it was entertaining

5710
05:38:44,280 --> 05:38:46,500
informational

5711
05:38:46,500 --> 05:38:48,980
fun

5712
05:38:49,138 --> 05:38:51,560
all right thank you thank you

05:51:54,680 --> 05:51:57,120
James and Jacob

5760
05:51:57,120 --> 05:52:00,000
uh PBR kittens

5761
05:52:00,000 --> 05:52:04,020
and um without further Ado here they are

5762
05:52:04,020 --> 05:52:07,458
hello hello so I'm Jacob this is James

5763
05:52:07,458 --> 05:52:10,138
uh we'll talk about who we are a little

5764
05:52:10,138 --> 05:52:12,718
bit later I wanted to start with what

5765
05:52:12,718 --> 05:52:14,878
this talk is it is definitely not a deep

5766
05:52:14,878 --> 05:52:16,980
dive on our tools or methodologies there

5767
05:52:16,980 --> 05:52:18,900
is way too much of this case to be able

5768
05:52:18,900 --> 05:52:21,480
to go in depth we could spend you know

5769
05:52:21,480 --> 05:52:23,280
an entire day going over everything that

5770
05:52:23,280 --> 05:52:26,040
had to go into this case it's not going

5771
05:52:26,040 --> 05:52:27,360
to train you to be a responder however

5772
05:52:27,360 --> 05:52:29,040
it may help you get kind of a responder

5773
05:52:29,040 --> 05:52:32,040
mentality perhaps this is a case study

5774
05:52:32,040 --> 05:52:35,218
of an enormous case that actually I've

5775
05:52:35,218 --> 05:52:37,440
been working since June or July of last

5776
05:52:37,440 --> 05:52:40,620
year James since April I believe for

5777
05:52:40,620 --> 05:52:42,480
about a year now yeah so we're getting

5778
05:52:42,480 --> 05:52:44,878
close on a year on this case and we're

5779
05:52:44,878 --> 05:52:47,520
still working with the client on things

5780
05:52:47,520 --> 05:52:49,798
uh we have removed a lot of identifying

5781
05:52:49,798 --> 05:52:51,540
details in fact all of them

5782
05:52:51,540 --> 05:52:53,100
um so forgive us if we're kind of vague

5783
05:52:53,100 --> 05:52:54,718
at times because obviously we don't want

5784
05:52:54,718 --> 05:52:56,458
to disclose our client

5785
05:52:56,458 --> 05:52:58,798
and we're going to try and tell you the

5786
05:52:58,798 --> 05:53:01,378
story of a real-life apt intrusion into

5787
05:53:01,378 --> 05:53:04,200
a oil and gas company

5788
05:53:04,200 --> 05:53:05,760
and then this is definitely our first

5789
05:53:05,760 --> 05:53:07,260
time presenting at a conference so

5790
05:53:07,260 --> 05:53:09,660
there's a little bit of nerves uh that's

5791
05:53:09,660 --> 05:53:12,160
where it's covered from

5792
05:53:12,160 --> 05:53:14,340
[Applause]

5793
05:53:14,340 --> 05:53:17,160
hi everyone uh I'm Jamie savaro I work

5794
05:53:17,160 --> 05:53:19,558
seven years as an I.T specialist at

5795
05:53:19,558 --> 05:53:21,660
network engineer for Department of

5796
05:53:21,660 --> 05:53:24,058
Defense then I pivoted over to the

5797
05:53:24,058 --> 05:53:26,100
Department of Homeland Security for my

5798
05:53:26,100 --> 05:53:29,520
first gig as a security lead analyst and

5799
05:53:29,520 --> 05:53:31,020
for the last 24 months I've been

5800
05:53:31,020 --> 05:53:33,120
dedicated as a d for consultant for

5801
05:53:33,120 --> 05:53:34,500
kudoski security

5802
05:53:34,500 --> 05:53:36,958
I'm also a senior instant responder and

5803
05:53:36,958 --> 05:53:38,638
Lead thread Hunter

5804
05:53:38,638 --> 05:53:40,680
so James finds the things that are

5805
05:53:40,680 --> 05:53:44,100
compromised I deal with them so uh I'm

5806
05:53:44,100 --> 05:53:46,020
our an incident response engineer for

5807
05:53:46,020 --> 05:53:49,558
cadel security uh I also our Elite Mr

5808
05:53:49,558 --> 05:53:52,080
lead for our post breach remediation so

5809
05:53:52,080 --> 05:53:54,540
like I said James finds what got hacked

5810
05:53:54,540 --> 05:53:56,340
it's my job to try and get the client

5811
05:53:56,340 --> 05:53:58,500
kind of working again

5812
05:53:58,500 --> 05:53:59,280
um

5813
05:53:59,280 --> 05:54:01,080
I've been with kadelski security for

5814
05:54:01,080 --> 05:54:03,120
about six months at this point uh fun

5815
05:54:03,120 --> 05:54:05,878
fact I have now worked two irgc gigs one

5816
05:54:05,878 --> 05:54:09,718
at a prior employer and one here I have

5817
05:54:09,718 --> 05:54:11,638
worked for an Electric Cooperative I

5818
05:54:11,638 --> 05:54:13,440
have also worked for a university so my

5819
05:54:13,440 --> 05:54:16,378
background is kind of non-profit space

5820
05:54:16,378 --> 05:54:19,620
so this is fun working actually for now

5821
05:54:19,620 --> 05:54:23,218
uh now an oil and gas client and I also

5822
05:54:23,218 --> 05:54:25,798
worked at at T but fun fact I started my

5823
05:54:25,798 --> 05:54:27,540
systems Administration journey in 2008

5824
05:54:27,540 --> 05:54:29,638
with Dapper Drake Ubuntu and so that

5825
05:54:29,638 --> 05:54:31,740
kind of started my whole career in I.T

5826
05:54:31,740 --> 05:54:33,900
my journey in assistant Administration

5827
05:54:33,900 --> 05:54:36,780
and now post breach remediation

5828
05:54:36,780 --> 05:54:39,480
so who here's uh familiar with the nist

5829
05:54:39,480 --> 05:54:41,580
incident response lifecycle

5830
05:54:41,580 --> 05:54:44,218
Okay so we've kind of structured this

5831
05:54:44,218 --> 05:54:46,020
talk to kind of work around the life

5832
05:54:46,020 --> 05:54:46,980
cycle

5833
05:54:46,980 --> 05:54:48,120
um obviously there's not very much

5834
05:54:48,120 --> 05:54:49,860
preparation because obviously we get

5835
05:54:49,860 --> 05:54:50,760
called

5836
05:54:50,760 --> 05:54:53,400
yeah and obviously the company wasn't

5837
05:54:53,400 --> 05:54:56,100
prepared so that's why we get called uh

5838
05:54:56,100 --> 05:54:57,180
but the other stuff like detection

5839
05:54:57,180 --> 05:54:59,820
analysis and containment eradication

5840
05:54:59,820 --> 05:55:02,340
recovery that's primarily what we'll be

5841
05:55:02,340 --> 05:55:04,440
covering

5842
05:55:04,440 --> 05:55:07,378
so what is an apt obviously you all

5843
05:55:07,378 --> 05:55:09,780
probably know what an apt is uh but for

5844
05:55:09,780 --> 05:55:11,040
those that are perhaps watching online

5845
05:55:11,040 --> 05:55:13,260
new to cyber security uh they're very

5846
05:55:13,260 --> 05:55:16,620
well funded they're sophisticated they

5847
05:55:16,620 --> 05:55:19,080
can be state sponsored though we're

5848
05:55:19,080 --> 05:55:21,120
seeing now of course uh criminal

5849
05:55:21,120 --> 05:55:23,458
organizations that are kind of getting

5850
05:55:23,458 --> 05:55:24,718
into that territory of advanced

5851
05:55:24,718 --> 05:55:27,180
persistent threat and they move

5852
05:55:27,180 --> 05:55:28,620
undetected for long periods of time

5853
05:55:28,620 --> 05:55:30,780
that's important in this case because

5854
05:55:30,780 --> 05:55:32,878
we'll give you the timeline a little bit

5855
05:55:32,878 --> 05:55:35,820
later but they did move undetected for

5856
05:55:35,820 --> 05:55:38,458
quite some time and in this particular

5857
05:55:38,458 --> 05:55:39,780
case we believe it was Espionage

5858
05:55:39,780 --> 05:55:41,580
motivated so

5859
05:55:41,580 --> 05:55:45,260
um and we'll get into that later

5860
05:55:45,600 --> 05:55:48,780
so these are our bad kitties uh Nemesis

5861
05:55:48,780 --> 05:55:50,580
kitten and Charming kitten otherwise

5862
05:55:50,580 --> 05:55:53,100
known as ap35 I believe phosphorus

5863
05:55:53,100 --> 05:55:54,680
there's all sorts of names that go under

5864
05:55:54,680 --> 05:55:58,020
uh all goes back to Iranian State Nexus

5865
05:55:58,020 --> 05:55:58,920
group

5866
05:55:58,920 --> 05:56:00,540
um that attack in this particular

5867
05:56:00,540 --> 05:56:05,120
instance oil and gas or energy companies

5868
05:56:05,940 --> 05:56:08,580
so to frame this story we have to

5869
05:56:08,580 --> 05:56:10,620
understand how this all happened

5870
05:56:10,620 --> 05:56:14,100
so we have two companies one was buying

5871
05:56:14,100 --> 05:56:16,320
the other the company that was purchased

5872
05:56:16,320 --> 05:56:19,500
had a on the Sans model security

5873
05:56:19,500 --> 05:56:22,260
awareness model was probably a zero uh

5874
05:56:22,260 --> 05:56:24,298
there was not very much security going

5875
05:56:24,298 --> 05:56:28,860
on at all okay uh and so when the

5876
05:56:28,860 --> 05:56:30,600
company that purchased them found out

5877
05:56:30,600 --> 05:56:32,878
what was going on they picked up the

5878
05:56:32,878 --> 05:56:35,040
phone and called kedelski security hey

5879
05:56:35,040 --> 05:56:39,240
we have information that uh is not so

5880
05:56:39,240 --> 05:56:42,540
great uh and so our client is actually

5881
05:56:42,540 --> 05:56:45,000
the company that acquired the other

5882
05:56:45,000 --> 05:56:46,558
company

5883
05:56:46,558 --> 05:56:48,718
um our client inherited all of their I.T

5884
05:56:48,718 --> 05:56:50,400
infrastructure all the vulnerabilities

5885
05:56:50,400 --> 05:56:53,638
all of the hack systems all of the mess

5886
05:56:53,638 --> 05:56:56,878
and it was not something that uh

5887
05:56:56,878 --> 05:56:59,638
was accounted for in the merger and

5888
05:56:59,638 --> 05:57:02,420
acquisition process

5889
05:57:02,760 --> 05:57:04,680
and so you are never fully prepared for

5890
05:57:04,680 --> 05:57:07,500
cyber incident uh this company was not

5891
05:57:07,500 --> 05:57:09,180
really prepared hardly at all

5892
05:57:09,180 --> 05:57:10,980
unfortunately

5893
05:57:10,980 --> 05:57:11,638
um

5894
05:57:11,638 --> 05:57:13,680
plans and playbooks help if you have

5895
05:57:13,680 --> 05:57:14,520
them

5896
05:57:14,520 --> 05:57:16,138
this company didn't

5897
05:57:16,138 --> 05:57:18,718
and then preparation of course is an

5898
05:57:18,718 --> 05:57:20,420
entire organization need

5899
05:57:20,420 --> 05:57:24,420
this organization had none of this so

5900
05:57:24,420 --> 05:57:25,920
that kind of sets the framework of what

5901
05:57:25,920 --> 05:57:28,638
we were dropping into

5902
05:57:29,400 --> 05:57:32,820
so starting in January 2022 uh these oil

5903
05:57:32,820 --> 05:57:35,458
and gas Refinery company a I started

5904
05:57:35,458 --> 05:57:37,200
receiving repeated notifications from

5905
05:57:37,200 --> 05:57:39,420
the FBI and sisa as you see below a

5906
05:57:39,420 --> 05:57:41,458
joint security advisories for them to go

5907
05:57:41,458 --> 05:57:43,020
look on host based indicators or

5908
05:57:43,020 --> 05:57:45,600
compromise reported as everyone knows as

5909
05:57:45,600 --> 05:57:49,260
IP addresses domains hashes

5910
05:57:49,260 --> 05:57:51,420
and it wasn't until the FBI special

5911
05:57:51,420 --> 05:57:54,540
agent actually sent out a direct email

5912
05:57:54,540 --> 05:57:56,878
to the refinery and notify them of

5913
05:57:56,878 --> 05:57:59,458
specific iocs for them to go hunt on

5914
05:57:59,458 --> 05:58:03,620
their domain back in April 22.

5915
05:58:03,900 --> 05:58:07,798
so detections we immediately deployed

5916
05:58:07,798 --> 05:58:10,020
crowdstrike in the environment on April

5917
05:58:10,020 --> 05:58:12,660
18th uh 2022 that's uh when the

5918
05:58:12,660 --> 05:58:14,160
detection was received within the

5919
05:58:14,160 --> 05:58:17,638
client's Palo Alto cortex EDR uh

5920
05:58:17,638 --> 05:58:19,500
regarding a malicious Powershell

5921
05:58:19,500 --> 05:58:21,180
download stream leveraged by the threat

5922
05:58:21,180 --> 05:58:23,700
actor unbeknownst to them uh that's when

5923
05:58:23,700 --> 05:58:25,620
they discover that their learning and

5924
05:58:25,620 --> 05:58:28,378
detection was turned off and disabled by

5925
05:58:28,378 --> 05:58:29,700
the actor

5926
05:58:29,700 --> 05:58:31,740
so what we did is uh we went ahead and

5927
05:58:31,740 --> 05:58:33,480
started writing custom detection queries

5928
05:58:33,480 --> 05:58:37,798
and ttps to identify the attacker and

5929
05:58:37,798 --> 05:58:39,958
one of the discoveries they identified

5930
05:58:39,958 --> 05:58:43,680
within their iocs was one of their OT

5931
05:58:43,680 --> 05:58:47,120
networks was impacted

5932
05:58:49,138 --> 05:58:52,080
so these are our apt detections that we

5933
05:58:52,080 --> 05:58:54,058
that Crosstrack immediately detected and

5934
05:58:54,058 --> 05:58:56,100
learned it on it notified us the

5935
05:58:56,100 --> 05:58:59,160
attribution to apt-35 Charming kidding

5936
05:58:59,160 --> 05:59:01,440
and Nemesis kitten and it's important to

5937
05:59:01,440 --> 05:59:03,298
note that crowdstrike while they had

5938
05:59:03,298 --> 05:59:05,340
some detections not everything this

5939
05:59:05,340 --> 05:59:07,440
threat actor did was actually detected

5940
05:59:07,440 --> 05:59:08,940
by crowdstrike after it got deployed

5941
05:59:08,940 --> 05:59:11,458
because obviously they didn't have a

5942
05:59:11,458 --> 05:59:13,680
data set to leverage off of so they

5943
05:59:13,680 --> 05:59:17,420
didn't know that it existed

5944
05:59:17,780 --> 05:59:20,458
analysis so what you're looking at here

5945
05:59:20,458 --> 05:59:22,500
is a result of the threat hunting the

5946
05:59:22,500 --> 05:59:24,360
digital forensics and the malware

5947
05:59:24,360 --> 05:59:27,058
analysis and the iocs that we picked up

5948
05:59:27,058 --> 05:59:29,400
we correlated the malware analysis to

5949
05:59:29,400 --> 05:59:33,180
apt-35 with a tunnel vision a Blog that

5950
05:59:33,180 --> 05:59:35,700
they posted on specific iocs and back

5951
05:59:35,700 --> 05:59:38,660
doors such as a Charles Bukowski and

5952
05:59:38,660 --> 05:59:40,920
interop.exe which we'll see further on

5953
05:59:40,920 --> 05:59:43,378
and the timeline shows that we

5954
05:59:43,378 --> 05:59:45,958
established is that on December 24 2021

5955
05:59:45,958 --> 05:59:49,980
log 4 shell was found December 26th two

5956
05:59:49,980 --> 05:59:51,840
days later the threat actors stood up

5957
05:59:51,840 --> 05:59:54,058
new infrastructure and then 13 days

5958
05:59:54,058 --> 05:59:55,020
later

5959
05:59:55,020 --> 05:59:57,718
the refiner was compromised

5960
05:59:57,718 --> 05:59:59,760
who here remembers log for Shell all of

5961
05:59:59,760 --> 06:00:00,900
us right

5962
06:00:00,900 --> 06:00:03,378
yeah

5963
06:00:03,540 --> 06:00:05,638
so we traced all those iocs and

5964
06:00:05,638 --> 06:00:07,798
attributions to these three Iranian

5965
06:00:07,798 --> 06:00:11,638
cyber actors uh think thanks to uh

5966
06:00:11,638 --> 06:00:14,580
secure Works IR team they were able to

5967
06:00:14,580 --> 06:00:17,700
identify a ransomware no leverage from

5968
06:00:17,700 --> 06:00:19,980
one of their ransomware campaigns if you

5969
06:00:19,980 --> 06:00:21,780
look closely here you're able to see the

5970
06:00:21,780 --> 06:00:24,420
Creator is Ahmed he's the guy in the

5971
06:00:24,420 --> 06:00:27,180
middle right there that you see at

5972
06:00:27,180 --> 06:00:29,160
if you identify one of these guys or

5973
06:00:29,160 --> 06:00:30,420
have information they're worth 10

5974
06:00:30,420 --> 06:00:33,058
million dollars a piece by the FBI and

5975
06:00:33,058 --> 06:00:34,320
unfortunately we're probably now on

5976
06:00:34,320 --> 06:00:37,040
their list as well

5977
06:00:38,520 --> 06:00:40,558
so thread hunting

5978
06:00:40,558 --> 06:00:43,020
based on those ad five advisories that

5979
06:00:43,020 --> 06:00:45,540
you saw previously from sisa I went

5980
06:00:45,540 --> 06:00:48,058
ahead and uh took my time and found the

5981
06:00:48,058 --> 06:00:50,458
patterns of those iocs and ttps to

5982
06:00:50,458 --> 06:00:52,400
correlate them with the nice

5983
06:00:52,400 --> 06:00:55,558
cyber threat detection campaign based on

5984
06:00:55,558 --> 06:00:57,660
initial access all the way to

5985
06:00:57,660 --> 06:00:59,940
exfiltration and ransomware and that's

5986
06:00:59,940 --> 06:01:01,620
what you're seeing right here listed

5987
06:01:01,620 --> 06:01:04,040
from top to bottom it's a log4j

5988
06:01:04,040 --> 06:01:06,660
according to identify malicious phishing

5989
06:01:06,660 --> 06:01:09,058
or weaponized documents web shelves

5990
06:01:09,058 --> 06:01:11,760
execution tunneling we found a lot of

5991
06:01:11,760 --> 06:01:15,480
and rock tunneling SSH DNS telling going

5992
06:01:15,480 --> 06:01:18,360
back out to their C2 infrastructures

5993
06:01:18,360 --> 06:01:20,280
now a little snippet of where you've

5994
06:01:20,280 --> 06:01:22,020
seen the command line being highlighted

5995
06:01:22,020 --> 06:01:25,260
here is that upon gaining access and

5996
06:01:25,260 --> 06:01:27,718
deploying our UDR and threat hunting we

5997
06:01:27,718 --> 06:01:30,420
identified SSH telling what the username

5998
06:01:30,420 --> 06:01:32,878
Draco malfloy so apparently there must

5999
06:01:32,878 --> 06:01:34,558
be Harry Potter fans

6000
06:01:34,558 --> 06:01:36,120
yeah this particular threat actor

6001
06:01:36,120 --> 06:01:37,320
actually made a couple literature

6002
06:01:37,320 --> 06:01:40,080
references so it's kind of fun

6003
06:01:40,080 --> 06:01:42,780
okay so here is our kill chain obviously

6004
06:01:42,780 --> 06:01:44,218
it's really small you probably can't see

6005
06:01:44,218 --> 06:01:46,080
it but they of course leveraged

6006
06:01:46,080 --> 06:01:48,240
everything across the board pretty much

6007
06:01:48,240 --> 06:01:50,100
any method that they could use to move

6008
06:01:50,100 --> 06:01:52,860
around this environment they did they

6009
06:01:52,860 --> 06:01:55,558
established multiple tunnels back to

6010
06:01:55,558 --> 06:01:57,600
their C2 infrastructure interestingly

6011
06:01:57,600 --> 06:02:01,138
enough one of them was Twitter they used

6012
06:02:01,138 --> 06:02:02,700
actually used Twitter as C2 which was

6013
06:02:02,700 --> 06:02:05,760
kind of an interesting finding uh and

6014
06:02:05,760 --> 06:02:08,340
yeah just had complete ownership over

6015
06:02:08,340 --> 06:02:10,440
the inside of this network they actually

6016
06:02:10,440 --> 06:02:13,440
leveraged log4j on VMware Horizon the

6017
06:02:13,440 --> 06:02:16,260
VMware identity manager was exposed uh

6018
06:02:16,260 --> 06:02:17,760
managed to get into that obviously you

6019
06:02:17,760 --> 06:02:19,680
get into the identity manager for VMware

6020
06:02:19,680 --> 06:02:22,080
and you now essentially have control

6021
06:02:22,080 --> 06:02:25,200
over a domain controller uh and so now

6022
06:02:25,200 --> 06:02:26,940
you now have credentials which is

6023
06:02:26,940 --> 06:02:30,120
probably how the uh Palo Alto cortex got

6024
06:02:30,120 --> 06:02:31,980
turned off but we don't know that for

6025
06:02:31,980 --> 06:02:34,320
sure because uh this all happened in

6026
06:02:34,320 --> 06:02:36,540
January we didn't engage until April and

6027
06:02:36,540 --> 06:02:40,138
you know logs age out and we're stuck

6028
06:02:40,138 --> 06:02:42,240
with what uh what the messes that we

6029
06:02:42,240 --> 06:02:44,480
discover

6030
06:02:45,180 --> 06:02:48,360
so uh we have two kind of categories of

6031
06:02:48,360 --> 06:02:50,700
systems so uh kadelski kind of

6032
06:02:50,700 --> 06:02:52,500
identifies compromise system and access

6033
06:02:52,500 --> 06:02:55,320
system so compromise systems are systems

6034
06:02:55,320 --> 06:02:56,458
where we can see there was actually

6035
06:02:56,458 --> 06:02:59,638
malicious code executed on them uh and

6036
06:02:59,638 --> 06:03:01,080
so if you actually look at the list here

6037
06:03:01,080 --> 06:03:03,240
I know it's small uh it's kind of a

6038
06:03:03,240 --> 06:03:04,860
handful of all the systems that we've

6039
06:03:04,860 --> 06:03:06,958
seen that definitely were compromised

6040
06:03:06,958 --> 06:03:08,700
it's everything from like a domain

6041
06:03:08,700 --> 06:03:11,160
controller uh some random servers of

6042
06:03:11,160 --> 06:03:13,680
course their VMware Horizon uh which is

6043
06:03:13,680 --> 06:03:15,780
their vdi platform

6044
06:03:15,780 --> 06:03:18,600
um some SQL servers uh they're exchange

6045
06:03:18,600 --> 06:03:20,100
servers of course those are always a

6046
06:03:20,100 --> 06:03:22,740
popular Target uh all the way down to

6047
06:03:22,740 --> 06:03:26,280
like even some user uh workstations and

6048
06:03:26,280 --> 06:03:27,840
they were spending a bunch of their time

6049
06:03:27,840 --> 06:03:30,480
like stealing data kind of zipping it

6050
06:03:30,480 --> 06:03:32,940
all up and exfil trading over the

6051
06:03:32,940 --> 06:03:34,980
tunnels that they had established

6052
06:03:34,980 --> 06:03:37,680
we also have access systems so these are

6053
06:03:37,680 --> 06:03:40,200
separate systems from the ones that were

6054
06:03:40,200 --> 06:03:41,820
compromised so these are systems that we

6055
06:03:41,820 --> 06:03:43,500
know that the threat actor had actually

6056
06:03:43,500 --> 06:03:47,040
logged into viewed data on uh pulled

6057
06:03:47,040 --> 06:03:48,480
data out of

6058
06:03:48,480 --> 06:03:51,120
um they actually named the the zip files

6059
06:03:51,120 --> 06:03:53,400
for their exfiltration like ret.zip

6060
06:03:53,400 --> 06:03:55,980
which I'm not sure what the reasoning

6061
06:03:55,980 --> 06:03:57,840
was between behind the name but that was

6062
06:03:57,840 --> 06:03:59,160
kind of an interesting finding so if you

6063
06:03:59,160 --> 06:04:00,660
ever see ret.zip in any of your

6064
06:04:00,660 --> 06:04:03,180
detections it's probably a bad guy you

6065
06:04:03,180 --> 06:04:05,458
shouldn't investigate

6066
06:04:05,458 --> 06:04:08,638
um they use sharp Hound uh Powershell of

6067
06:04:08,638 --> 06:04:11,100
course lots of law bins just all the way

6068
06:04:11,100 --> 06:04:13,798
through impact it like every tool that

6069
06:04:13,798 --> 06:04:16,320
you could imagine that somebody could

6070
06:04:16,320 --> 06:04:18,058
use on the inside of a network they used

6071
06:04:18,058 --> 06:04:19,920
which is kind of an interesting finding

6072
06:04:19,920 --> 06:04:22,920
for me because like

6073
06:04:22,920 --> 06:04:24,780
I when we usually talk about a kill

6074
06:04:24,780 --> 06:04:26,218
chain

6075
06:04:26,218 --> 06:04:28,080
Maki don't sue me

6076
06:04:28,080 --> 06:04:29,760
um we usually talk about kill chain like

6077
06:04:29,760 --> 06:04:31,798
they have a particular set of like run

6078
06:04:31,798 --> 06:04:33,718
books that they follow this particular

6079
06:04:33,718 --> 06:04:36,120
group like tried to embed themselves as

6080
06:04:36,120 --> 06:04:38,160
deeply into this environment as they

6081
06:04:38,160 --> 06:04:41,040
could and leave like breadcrumbs of back

6082
06:04:41,040 --> 06:04:42,780
doors and stuff they were very sloppy

6083
06:04:42,780 --> 06:04:46,138
yeah well sloppy but also like they

6084
06:04:46,138 --> 06:04:48,298
didn't want to get kicked out and so

6085
06:04:48,298 --> 06:04:49,620
when you have a total domain compromise

6086
06:04:49,620 --> 06:04:51,840
you're across basically all the servers

6087
06:04:51,840 --> 06:04:54,480
in the system uh going out and finding

6088
06:04:54,480 --> 06:04:56,940
every last backdoor takes a very very

6089
06:04:56,940 --> 06:04:59,160
long time and so that's why we've been

6090
06:04:59,160 --> 06:05:00,660
engaged with this client for a very long

6091
06:05:00,660 --> 06:05:03,420
time because uh the client kind of sees

6092
06:05:03,420 --> 06:05:05,700
us as a warm security blanket to wrap

6093
06:05:05,700 --> 06:05:06,958
around themselves at night so they could

6094
06:05:06,958 --> 06:05:10,378
sleep and so James of course uh does

6095
06:05:10,378 --> 06:05:12,660
threat Hunts on everything

6096
06:05:12,660 --> 06:05:16,138
um every week I'm actually still

6097
06:05:16,138 --> 06:05:18,900
patching systems it's taken that long to

6098
06:05:18,900 --> 06:05:20,340
get to where we can actually patch most

6099
06:05:20,340 --> 06:05:22,200
of the vulnerabilities

6100
06:05:22,200 --> 06:05:25,378
it's a long and slow process as we

6101
06:05:25,378 --> 06:05:27,600
mentioned before we do utilize

6102
06:05:27,600 --> 06:05:31,020
crowdstrike for for this client it was

6103
06:05:31,020 --> 06:05:32,580
our go-to partner

6104
06:05:32,580 --> 06:05:35,160
uh in this instance

6105
06:05:35,160 --> 06:05:37,200
um and we use crowdstrike containment

6106
06:05:37,200 --> 06:05:38,878
feature which is excellent so if you

6107
06:05:38,878 --> 06:05:41,100
have crowdstrike like that's a perfect

6108
06:05:41,100 --> 06:05:43,080
feature to use when you kind of suspect

6109
06:05:43,080 --> 06:05:45,420
that A System's compromised it allows us

6110
06:05:45,420 --> 06:05:47,940
to remotely get back into that system

6111
06:05:47,940 --> 06:05:50,040
pull whatever artifacts we want to pull

6112
06:05:50,040 --> 06:05:53,340
and not have to worry about that system

6113
06:05:53,340 --> 06:05:56,520
having code that pivots which is

6114
06:05:56,520 --> 06:05:57,798
excellent

6115
06:05:57,798 --> 06:06:00,540
it also allows us to do some systems

6116
06:06:00,540 --> 06:06:02,400
related things delete registry keys

6117
06:06:02,400 --> 06:06:04,798
delete scheduled tasks all the kind of

6118
06:06:04,798 --> 06:06:07,520
important ways to remove persistence

6119
06:06:07,520 --> 06:06:10,260
obviously if A System's been compromised

6120
06:06:10,260 --> 06:06:13,080
we want to probably replace it or

6121
06:06:13,080 --> 06:06:15,058
re-image it but that's not always a

6122
06:06:15,058 --> 06:06:18,298
choice and in the case of a oil refinery

6123
06:06:18,298 --> 06:06:20,340
they have to keep production going

6124
06:06:20,340 --> 06:06:22,500
because should we have to stop

6125
06:06:22,500 --> 06:06:24,420
production for any reason there may be

6126
06:06:24,420 --> 06:06:26,340
people that end up without gasoline or

6127
06:06:26,340 --> 06:06:29,160
diesel or some of these other things

6128
06:06:29,160 --> 06:06:31,260
that they they make that make Modern

6129
06:06:31,260 --> 06:06:33,240
Life possible and you don't necessarily

6130
06:06:33,240 --> 06:06:35,700
want entire states without fuel

6131
06:06:35,700 --> 06:06:38,700
uh and obviously we could restore to a

6132
06:06:38,700 --> 06:06:39,958
known good state

6133
06:06:39,958 --> 06:06:42,298
but the dwell time was very long they'd

6134
06:06:42,298 --> 06:06:43,260
been in the environment for a while

6135
06:06:43,260 --> 06:06:44,878
which meant all the backups included all

6136
06:06:44,878 --> 06:06:46,500
of their fancy back doors and everything

6137
06:06:46,500 --> 06:06:47,458
else

6138
06:06:47,458 --> 06:06:52,340
and so the backups were kind of useless

6139
06:06:53,400 --> 06:06:56,040
and so what are we doing now uh patching

6140
06:06:56,040 --> 06:06:58,200
lots and lots and lots of hatching lots

6141
06:06:58,200 --> 06:07:00,840
of patching uh I spent probably at least

6142
06:07:00,840 --> 06:07:02,760
10 hours a week in this environment

6143
06:07:02,760 --> 06:07:05,280
making sure that patches are applied it

6144
06:07:05,280 --> 06:07:08,040
is a very long and slow process it is an

6145
06:07:08,040 --> 06:07:10,680
oil refinery so I can't interrupt their

6146
06:07:10,680 --> 06:07:13,138
processes so I have to actually split

6147
06:07:13,138 --> 06:07:15,660
all of the patching out into groups and

6148
06:07:15,660 --> 06:07:18,000
I Target based on some parameters that

6149
06:07:18,000 --> 06:07:20,100
we set up with them okay this group

6150
06:07:20,100 --> 06:07:21,840
happens during this time this group

6151
06:07:21,840 --> 06:07:24,000
happens during this time so that I don't

6152
06:07:24,000 --> 06:07:28,320
interrupt their their flows uh we talked

6153
06:07:28,320 --> 06:07:31,200
to them about backups uh obviously like

6154
06:07:31,200 --> 06:07:33,120
backups were worthless at the beginning

6155
06:07:33,120 --> 06:07:34,980
but now that we're kind of patched we're

6156
06:07:34,980 --> 06:07:37,020
pretty sure there's nobody on the inside

6157
06:07:37,020 --> 06:07:39,540
we've got an EDR deployed to detect if

6158
06:07:39,540 --> 06:07:41,760
there's any known malicious stuff going

6159
06:07:41,760 --> 06:07:42,660
on

6160
06:07:42,660 --> 06:07:44,580
we can actually back up stuff and be

6161
06:07:44,580 --> 06:07:46,138
reasonably confident that we can restore

6162
06:07:46,138 --> 06:07:49,080
and if any uh thing happens

6163
06:07:49,080 --> 06:07:51,000
you have the option to rebuild systems

6164
06:07:51,000 --> 06:07:53,458
uh rebuilding systems is very disruptive

6165
06:07:53,458 --> 06:07:57,138
uh it takes a lot of time and energy uh

6166
06:07:57,138 --> 06:08:00,480
this particular client obviously is very

6167
06:08:00,480 --> 06:08:02,878
sensitive to that so there's some

6168
06:08:02,878 --> 06:08:05,040
systems that we essentially watch like a

6169
06:08:05,040 --> 06:08:06,900
hawk we've removed any persistence we

6170
06:08:06,900 --> 06:08:08,580
can find but we've not been able to

6171
06:08:08,580 --> 06:08:10,200
actually rebuild because they're

6172
06:08:10,200 --> 06:08:12,900
critical to their operations

6173
06:08:12,900 --> 06:08:15,360
uh and so we're using some tools for

6174
06:08:15,360 --> 06:08:17,458
vulnerability management uh tenable

6175
06:08:17,458 --> 06:08:20,160
nessus uh ping Castle is awesome if

6176
06:08:20,160 --> 06:08:22,200
you've never used paint Castle you have

6177
06:08:22,200 --> 06:08:23,218
to have a license if you're going to run

6178
06:08:23,218 --> 06:08:27,298
it uh to audit a client but if you're a

6179
06:08:27,298 --> 06:08:29,700
internal practitioner it's free so

6180
06:08:29,700 --> 06:08:32,160
definitely go and run it it'll tell you

6181
06:08:32,160 --> 06:08:33,780
more than you could ever probably

6182
06:08:33,780 --> 06:08:36,180
possibly fix on a active directory

6183
06:08:36,180 --> 06:08:38,820
domain it is excellent and then of

6184
06:08:38,820 --> 06:08:40,378
course crowdstrike's native Spotlight

6185
06:08:40,378 --> 06:08:43,558
functionality is super helpful uh allows

6186
06:08:43,558 --> 06:08:45,600
us to kind of prioritize what patches we

6187
06:08:45,600 --> 06:08:49,740
deploy and helps us keep track of what

6188
06:08:49,740 --> 06:08:51,058
we've actually patched which is

6189
06:08:51,058 --> 06:08:53,540
excellent

6190
06:08:53,760 --> 06:08:56,280
so we go into post incident obviously

6191
06:08:56,280 --> 06:08:58,558
we're still in that kind of phase so we

6192
06:08:58,558 --> 06:09:00,240
are

6193
06:09:00,240 --> 06:09:03,180
our lessons learned is you know patch

6194
06:09:03,180 --> 06:09:05,458
log for Shell when you get notified when

6195
06:09:05,458 --> 06:09:07,320
the FBI knocks on your door actually

6196
06:09:07,320 --> 06:09:09,718
like listen to them take notice right

6197
06:09:09,718 --> 06:09:12,000
take action don't just ignore the email

6198
06:09:12,000 --> 06:09:13,920
from an FBI special agent that's really

6199
06:09:13,920 --> 06:09:17,100
bad you shouldn't do that uh we've

6200
06:09:17,100 --> 06:09:18,660
actually implemented uh vulnerability

6201
06:09:18,660 --> 06:09:21,420
scanning on this client uh they had no

6202
06:09:21,420 --> 06:09:23,458
process for that before they had no

6203
06:09:23,458 --> 06:09:25,740
actually clue generally what was on

6204
06:09:25,740 --> 06:09:28,740
their Network to begin with their

6205
06:09:28,740 --> 06:09:32,100
documentation was non-existent so they

6206
06:09:32,100 --> 06:09:33,480
were you know everything was in the

6207
06:09:33,480 --> 06:09:34,798
systems administrator's head right

6208
06:09:34,798 --> 06:09:36,958
that's something we see all the time is

6209
06:09:36,958 --> 06:09:39,480
oh I know what subnet that is and what's

6210
06:09:39,480 --> 06:09:42,120
on it and then you do like a simple nmap

6211
06:09:42,120 --> 06:09:44,160
scan and you return like 20 more devices

6212
06:09:44,160 --> 06:09:45,360
than they knew

6213
06:09:45,360 --> 06:09:48,900
uh reporting reporting is important our

6214
06:09:48,900 --> 06:09:50,520
our report on this case is probably

6215
06:09:50,520 --> 06:09:54,180
about 600 Pages last I remember

6216
06:09:54,180 --> 06:09:56,940
um we add more as we go uh because it's

6217
06:09:56,940 --> 06:09:58,440
kind of a living document at this point

6218
06:09:58,440 --> 06:10:00,600
until the engagement's over

6219
06:10:00,600 --> 06:10:03,298
and yeah 600 pages is a lot to write

6220
06:10:03,298 --> 06:10:05,400
it's a lot to go through

6221
06:10:05,400 --> 06:10:06,240
um

6222
06:10:06,240 --> 06:10:07,740
you know I wish we could share it

6223
06:10:07,740 --> 06:10:09,660
because it'd be excellent reading

6224
06:10:09,660 --> 06:10:12,440
material to go to sleep

6225
06:10:12,500 --> 06:10:15,420
we also had uh so what's interesting

6226
06:10:15,420 --> 06:10:16,620
about this engagement is we actually

6227
06:10:16,620 --> 06:10:19,860
embedded some red teamers with us so

6228
06:10:19,860 --> 06:10:21,480
um we have a couple red teamers on our

6229
06:10:21,480 --> 06:10:24,420
team for this engagement that helped us

6230
06:10:24,420 --> 06:10:25,620
identify vulnerabilities that wouldn't

6231
06:10:25,620 --> 06:10:28,378
be picked up by nessus or uh or

6232
06:10:28,378 --> 06:10:30,200
tenable.io

6233
06:10:30,200 --> 06:10:33,000
and that was super helpful uh we in fact

6234
06:10:33,000 --> 06:10:35,760
uh found some stuff like human machine

6235
06:10:35,760 --> 06:10:37,680
interfaces for the OT Network that had

6236
06:10:37,680 --> 06:10:40,920
VNC on them that was wide open uh you

6237
06:10:40,920 --> 06:10:42,780
could actually watch like

6238
06:10:42,780 --> 06:10:45,360
though T Network do its processes and

6239
06:10:45,360 --> 06:10:47,280
conceivably then interrupt those

6240
06:10:47,280 --> 06:10:49,200
processes if anybody knows anything

6241
06:10:49,200 --> 06:10:52,138
about a Refinery one a fun little story

6242
06:10:52,138 --> 06:10:55,500
I learned on this gig was from their the

6243
06:10:55,500 --> 06:10:58,260
the new director of security that uh the

6244
06:10:58,260 --> 06:11:00,480
company that purchased this one is that

6245
06:11:00,480 --> 06:11:02,280
there's actually a component in the

6246
06:11:02,280 --> 06:11:04,138
refinery that they call the hydrogen

6247
06:11:04,138 --> 06:11:05,218
bomb

6248
06:11:05,218 --> 06:11:08,280
and if oxygen like gets into that space

6249
06:11:08,280 --> 06:11:10,620
it explodes and they actually have like

6250
06:11:10,620 --> 06:11:13,320
a ring around this Refinery of like if

6251
06:11:13,320 --> 06:11:14,878
you're outside of that ring you're safe

6252
06:11:14,878 --> 06:11:17,218
you don't die if you're inside that ring

6253
06:11:17,218 --> 06:11:18,540
you do die

6254
06:11:18,540 --> 06:11:20,940
ads so uh he was like yeah it's like

6255
06:11:20,940 --> 06:11:22,558
really important that we keep an eye on

6256
06:11:22,558 --> 06:11:24,718
these OT systems because

6257
06:11:24,718 --> 06:11:26,700
theoretically somebody could cause the

6258
06:11:26,700 --> 06:11:28,740
refinery to blow up

6259
06:11:28,740 --> 06:11:31,860
and then uh and in one site so this

6260
06:11:31,860 --> 06:11:33,420
client's across multiple sites and one

6261
06:11:33,420 --> 06:11:36,298
site uh I've closed over 317 000

6262
06:11:36,298 --> 06:11:38,940
vulnerabilities and this is not like a

6263
06:11:38,940 --> 06:11:40,860
site that has tens of thousands of

6264
06:11:40,860 --> 06:11:44,100
devices this is a site that has maybe a

6265
06:11:44,100 --> 06:11:45,780
few hundred

6266
06:11:45,780 --> 06:11:48,058
just to give you an idea of like the

6267
06:11:48,058 --> 06:11:50,580
depth of how far behind they were on

6268
06:11:50,580 --> 06:11:52,860
patching 317

6269
06:11:52,860 --> 06:11:54,600
000 vulnerabilities and that's you know

6270
06:11:54,600 --> 06:11:57,180
criticals highs mediums and lows but

6271
06:11:57,180 --> 06:12:00,680
most of those were criticals

6272
06:12:00,718 --> 06:12:03,180
yeah

6273
06:12:03,180 --> 06:12:05,820
so what we did is we took those ttps and

6274
06:12:05,820 --> 06:12:09,298
iocs and we leveraged the kadowski

6275
06:12:09,298 --> 06:12:11,540
Securities threat Navigator feature

6276
06:12:11,540 --> 06:12:14,820
mapped to miter attack to Monitor and

6277
06:12:14,820 --> 06:12:16,340
track the

6278
06:12:16,340 --> 06:12:18,958
adversaries in particular we drill down

6279
06:12:18,958 --> 06:12:21,480
to apt-35 here and what you're looking

6280
06:12:21,480 --> 06:12:24,540
at and the check marks we're looking at

6281
06:12:24,540 --> 06:12:27,480
defensive evasion sub technique impaired

6282
06:12:27,480 --> 06:12:29,940
defenses and those highlighted green

6283
06:12:29,940 --> 06:12:33,240
that's telling the client that that sub

6284
06:12:33,240 --> 06:12:35,458
technique is being covered and within

6285
06:12:35,458 --> 06:12:38,940
their environment so uh point of this is

6286
06:12:38,940 --> 06:12:41,638
when we find something on the IR team we

6287
06:12:41,638 --> 06:12:44,340
push it down to detection engineering or

6288
06:12:44,340 --> 06:12:46,980
to our cyber Fusion Center our sock the

6289
06:12:46,980 --> 06:12:49,440
idea being that we can then add it to

6290
06:12:49,440 --> 06:12:52,218
our list of things that we detect on

6291
06:12:52,218 --> 06:12:56,160
kadowski is an MDR provider so we want

6292
06:12:56,160 --> 06:12:58,920
to make sure that anything we find gets

6293
06:12:58,920 --> 06:13:00,840
shared because if we don't share it it's

6294
06:13:00,840 --> 06:13:02,940
pretty much useless yeah we help this

6295
06:13:02,940 --> 06:13:05,700
one client but we have clients in the

6296
06:13:05,700 --> 06:13:07,138
same vertical that we want to be able to

6297
06:13:07,138 --> 06:13:09,420
detect these things for and so if we can

6298
06:13:09,420 --> 06:13:13,260
genericize uh up and focus more on

6299
06:13:13,260 --> 06:13:15,780
tactic and procedure Less on IP

6300
06:13:15,780 --> 06:13:17,940
addresses domains hashes we can then

6301
06:13:17,940 --> 06:13:20,160
push it down and check all of our other

6302
06:13:20,160 --> 06:13:23,160
clients and and as part of our normal

6303
06:13:23,160 --> 06:13:24,840
threat hunting process

6304
06:13:24,840 --> 06:13:26,580
yeah and here's the overview of the

6305
06:13:26,580 --> 06:13:28,500
matter attack code chain which features

6306
06:13:28,500 --> 06:13:30,900
over 140 threat actors and you could

6307
06:13:30,900 --> 06:13:33,718
choose which vertical your company is

6308
06:13:33,718 --> 06:13:36,058
located in add different operators as

6309
06:13:36,058 --> 06:13:39,480
well in particular this is apt-35 that

6310
06:13:39,480 --> 06:13:41,580
we took our iocs and integrated them

6311
06:13:41,580 --> 06:13:43,860
within the security platform yeah and so

6312
06:13:43,860 --> 06:13:45,660
what you'll see on this uh chart I know

6313
06:13:45,660 --> 06:13:46,920
it's really small but everything that's

6314
06:13:46,920 --> 06:13:48,840
in gold is kind of a known tactic that

6315
06:13:48,840 --> 06:13:51,180
this threat actor uses and so this

6316
06:13:51,180 --> 06:13:53,520
information is sourced from wherever we

6317
06:13:53,520 --> 06:13:55,500
can find it so you know some of this

6318
06:13:55,500 --> 06:13:57,480
might be a blog post by say Sentinel one

6319
06:13:57,480 --> 06:13:59,400
it could be a blog post by crowdstrike

6320
06:13:59,400 --> 06:14:01,798
it could be uh information that we have

6321
06:14:01,798 --> 06:14:04,860
personally from our own ir and so we'll

6322
06:14:04,860 --> 06:14:06,840
take all of our detections all of our

6323
06:14:06,840 --> 06:14:08,040
queries

6324
06:14:08,040 --> 06:14:10,320
and they'll be turned into a sigma

6325
06:14:10,320 --> 06:14:12,058
notation

6326
06:14:12,058 --> 06:14:15,058
which then will be implemented here in

6327
06:14:15,058 --> 06:14:17,400
the back end so that we know what

6328
06:14:17,400 --> 06:14:18,958
controls we have in place for our

6329
06:14:18,958 --> 06:14:21,000
clients whether it's an EDR whether it's

6330
06:14:21,000 --> 06:14:24,360
Sim whether it's uh you know mail

6331
06:14:24,360 --> 06:14:27,058
filtering even like so we know where to

6332
06:14:27,058 --> 06:14:29,580
check for all of these tactics so if I

6333
06:14:29,580 --> 06:14:31,020
have a particular client that's like

6334
06:14:31,020 --> 06:14:33,718
okay I'm not knowing gas but let's say

6335
06:14:33,718 --> 06:14:37,200
I'm in electricity distribution we know

6336
06:14:37,200 --> 06:14:39,360
that these particular threat actors are

6337
06:14:39,360 --> 06:14:42,000
targeting that particular industry and

6338
06:14:42,000 --> 06:14:43,620
this gives us the flexibility to go okay

6339
06:14:43,620 --> 06:14:47,400
well you know maybe we want to do an

6340
06:14:47,400 --> 06:14:49,558
investment in a Sim but

6341
06:14:49,558 --> 06:14:51,540
you know that may not be the best option

6342
06:14:51,540 --> 06:14:53,580
right now uh EDR might be your better

6343
06:14:53,580 --> 06:14:56,280
option to kind of cover more of the

6344
06:14:56,280 --> 06:14:58,798
issue and so that's what this is it

6345
06:14:58,798 --> 06:15:00,360
gives us the ability to just say Okay

6346
06:15:00,360 --> 06:15:01,740
this particular thread actor is

6347
06:15:01,740 --> 06:15:03,420
targeting this we should probably invest

6348
06:15:03,420 --> 06:15:06,298
in these tools

6349
06:15:06,298 --> 06:15:08,638
and this is what an analyst sees on the

6350
06:15:08,638 --> 06:15:10,500
back end so when you drill down on a

6351
06:15:10,500 --> 06:15:13,080
magic count apt-35 you're able to see

6352
06:15:13,080 --> 06:15:15,840
the sub techniques and this is a

6353
06:15:15,840 --> 06:15:18,480
description of the particular case that

6354
06:15:18,480 --> 06:15:20,940
we investigated that analysts are able

6355
06:15:20,940 --> 06:15:23,280
to see and drill down on

6356
06:15:23,280 --> 06:15:25,138
yeah so if we have a detection come into

6357
06:15:25,138 --> 06:15:28,680
the cyberfusion center uh that is part

6358
06:15:28,680 --> 06:15:31,020
of this it trips uh Magic Hound Sigma

6359
06:15:31,020 --> 06:15:33,240
rules they can actually like in real

6360
06:15:33,240 --> 06:15:35,878
time it's part of their their research

6361
06:15:35,878 --> 06:15:38,040
click on links within their dashboard

6362
06:15:38,040 --> 06:15:39,780
and it'll actually take them to this

6363
06:15:39,780 --> 06:15:42,420
page and say okay this is probably a

6364
06:15:42,420 --> 06:15:45,360
tactic from Magic count AP 35 Charming

6365
06:15:45,360 --> 06:15:46,740
kit and Pioneer kit whatever whatever

6366
06:15:46,740 --> 06:15:48,780
the name of that threat actor is and

6367
06:15:48,780 --> 06:15:50,340
they can actually intelligently then

6368
06:15:50,340 --> 06:15:53,040
tell the client hey we have a detection

6369
06:15:53,040 --> 06:15:54,660
that matches this particular threat

6370
06:15:54,660 --> 06:15:56,458
actor it may or may not be them but it

6371
06:15:56,458 --> 06:15:57,900
does match that threat actor we probably

6372
06:15:57,900 --> 06:15:59,280
need to pull on this thread a little bit

6373
06:15:59,280 --> 06:16:01,260
more it's not generally going to be a

6374
06:16:01,260 --> 06:16:04,558
false positive so we can actually in

6375
06:16:04,558 --> 06:16:07,980
depth investigate it helps our clients

6376
06:16:07,980 --> 06:16:10,860
kind of have some visibility on what's

6377
06:16:10,860 --> 06:16:14,340
going on it allows them to be able to to

6378
06:16:14,340 --> 06:16:16,200
know kind of what threat actors are

6379
06:16:16,200 --> 06:16:19,500
after them and it gives our l1s and l2s

6380
06:16:19,500 --> 06:16:21,240
in the sock the capability to speak

6381
06:16:21,240 --> 06:16:23,218
intelligently about these detections so

6382
06:16:23,218 --> 06:16:26,820
as we build them there's more uh there's

6383
06:16:26,820 --> 06:16:28,558
more and more information as we go and

6384
06:16:28,558 --> 06:16:31,200
So eventually this Soul get aged and

6385
06:16:31,200 --> 06:16:34,260
will add more ttps as we research them

6386
06:16:34,260 --> 06:16:36,360
or if we stumble upon something else at

6387
06:16:36,360 --> 06:16:39,058
another client during an IR this will

6388
06:16:39,058 --> 06:16:40,500
get updated if it's this particular

6389
06:16:40,500 --> 06:16:44,000
threat actor and we can attribute it

6390
06:16:44,040 --> 06:16:45,718
and these are all the findings of the

6391
06:16:45,718 --> 06:16:47,940
threat hunting queries we take those

6392
06:16:47,940 --> 06:16:49,740
queries and findings and real-time

6393
06:16:49,740 --> 06:16:52,260
action and we're able to make them into

6394
06:16:52,260 --> 06:16:54,840
Sigma logic within condos security uh

6395
06:16:54,840 --> 06:16:58,200
team as well and it's multi-platform as

6396
06:16:58,200 --> 06:17:01,080
well within seams and edrs and in in

6397
06:17:01,080 --> 06:17:03,200
here the analyst is able to see

6398
06:17:03,200 --> 06:17:05,520
investigation steps how to identify a

6399
06:17:05,520 --> 06:17:07,378
true positive compared to a false

6400
06:17:07,378 --> 06:17:08,760
positive

6401
06:17:08,760 --> 06:17:11,100
yeah as you can see there uh this

6402
06:17:11,100 --> 06:17:14,100
particular Sigma file is valid across

6403
06:17:14,100 --> 06:17:15,138
elastic

6404
06:17:15,138 --> 06:17:17,820
logarithm Sentinel

6405
06:17:17,820 --> 06:17:21,000
um I believe that last one is Splunk and

6406
06:17:21,000 --> 06:17:22,980
so uh that's where the sigma kind of

6407
06:17:22,980 --> 06:17:24,718
comes in hand in handy obviously there

6408
06:17:24,718 --> 06:17:25,980
were other talks that talked about Sigma

6409
06:17:25,980 --> 06:17:28,740
uh but uh any queries that say James

6410
06:17:28,740 --> 06:17:30,900
rice for crowdstrike gets translated by

6411
06:17:30,900 --> 06:17:32,760
our detection engineering team and then

6412
06:17:32,760 --> 06:17:35,458
push down so that uh our analysts can

6413
06:17:35,458 --> 06:17:38,820
actually use them and it helps everybody

6414
06:17:38,820 --> 06:17:42,420
involved it's a it's a great process if

6415
06:17:42,420 --> 06:17:44,638
you're working for an external company

6416
06:17:44,638 --> 06:17:46,320
and you're not your IR team isn't

6417
06:17:46,320 --> 06:17:48,660
pushing stuff down to your sock to for

6418
06:17:48,660 --> 06:17:52,760
detections you should be doing it yeah

6419
06:17:53,458 --> 06:17:57,780
okay so tools we have used uh so pretty

6420
06:17:57,780 --> 06:17:59,638
much all these tools other than say

6421
06:17:59,638 --> 06:18:01,860
Sentinel one have been used on this

6422
06:18:01,860 --> 06:18:02,718
engagement

6423
06:18:02,718 --> 06:18:04,798
uh I don't necessarily want to bore you

6424
06:18:04,798 --> 06:18:06,840
with the whole list but every single one

6425
06:18:06,840 --> 06:18:09,660
of these uh is generally available other

6426
06:18:09,660 --> 06:18:12,600
than say crowdstrike or Sentinel one in

6427
06:18:12,600 --> 06:18:14,040
the case of cyborg security they've got

6428
06:18:14,040 --> 06:18:15,660
like a free account that has some of

6429
06:18:15,660 --> 06:18:17,820
their hunting stuff we use them to kind

6430
06:18:17,820 --> 06:18:20,700
of check ourselves uh when James is like

6431
06:18:20,700 --> 06:18:23,280
writing queries and stuff they sometimes

6432
06:18:23,280 --> 06:18:24,600
have queries for stuff we're looking for

6433
06:18:24,600 --> 06:18:27,660
so shout out to them for their a lot of

6434
06:18:27,660 --> 06:18:29,700
their work crowdstrike has been our

6435
06:18:29,700 --> 06:18:32,700
primary partner for IR their tool set is

6436
06:18:32,700 --> 06:18:35,580
excellent we really like working with

6437
06:18:35,580 --> 06:18:37,138
them

6438
06:18:37,138 --> 06:18:39,660
um other kind of tools of note uh high

6439
06:18:39,660 --> 06:18:41,520
boost is great for quick wins so if you

6440
06:18:41,520 --> 06:18:44,520
have a bunch of evtx files high boost is

6441
06:18:44,520 --> 06:18:48,240
open source it's on GitHub go get it you

6442
06:18:48,240 --> 06:18:49,920
just run it against the evtx files you

6443
06:18:49,920 --> 06:18:51,480
have it's got some Sigma you can even

6444
06:18:51,480 --> 06:18:53,700
drop in your own Sigma and it will

6445
06:18:53,700 --> 06:18:56,100
dynamically use that Sigma to identify

6446
06:18:56,100 --> 06:18:58,860
patterns in those evtx logs that could

6447
06:18:58,860 --> 06:19:01,500
be malicious it does have kind of a

6448
06:19:01,500 --> 06:19:02,940
false positive rate so obviously like

6449
06:19:02,940 --> 06:19:05,100
don't take everything that it outputs as

6450
06:19:05,100 --> 06:19:07,500
truth but if you need an answer like

6451
06:19:07,500 --> 06:19:10,260
right now you know you went and pulled a

6452
06:19:10,260 --> 06:19:11,940
collection off of a device and you've

6453
06:19:11,940 --> 06:19:13,558
got an hour to like figure out whether

6454
06:19:13,558 --> 06:19:15,540
this is actually compromised or not it's

6455
06:19:15,540 --> 06:19:17,400
a great starting point it'll actually

6456
06:19:17,400 --> 06:19:20,100
like flag service installations and

6457
06:19:20,100 --> 06:19:21,718
usually we'll get like a one or two

6458
06:19:21,718 --> 06:19:22,798
false positives like because we're

6459
06:19:22,798 --> 06:19:24,718
pushing crowdstrike at the same time

6460
06:19:24,718 --> 06:19:27,360
and so I actually have like in in

6461
06:19:27,360 --> 06:19:29,340
Hayabusa it'll say hey there's a

6462
06:19:29,340 --> 06:19:31,200
possibly malicious service installed and

6463
06:19:31,200 --> 06:19:33,660
it was crowdstrike being installed and

6464
06:19:33,660 --> 06:19:36,600
so uh it's excellent tool we also use

6465
06:19:36,600 --> 06:19:38,340
the Velociraptor collector uh the

6466
06:19:38,340 --> 06:19:40,558
offline collector heavily

6467
06:19:40,558 --> 06:19:41,218
um

6468
06:19:41,218 --> 06:19:43,620
it allows us to kind of pull artifacts

6469
06:19:43,620 --> 06:19:46,620
so we can go analyze them uh quickly we

6470
06:19:46,620 --> 06:19:49,920
can also hand it to a client and say hey

6471
06:19:49,920 --> 06:19:52,680
go run this on this machine so if I

6472
06:19:52,680 --> 06:19:54,540
don't have RTR access crosstracks not

6473
06:19:54,540 --> 06:19:57,000
deployed yet you know it's in the S3

6474
06:19:57,000 --> 06:19:59,580
bucket go grab it go to that machine

6475
06:19:59,580 --> 06:20:02,280
download it run it and it will collect

6476
06:20:02,280 --> 06:20:03,840
whatever we're looking for and it's

6477
06:20:03,840 --> 06:20:07,020
pretty much infinitely customizable so

6478
06:20:07,020 --> 06:20:09,540
if we know that it this particular IR

6479
06:20:09,540 --> 06:20:12,120
gig involves cryptocurrency they

6480
06:20:12,120 --> 06:20:14,218
actually have some crypto stuff uh

6481
06:20:14,218 --> 06:20:16,378
wallet stuff in Velociraptor artifacts

6482
06:20:16,378 --> 06:20:18,298
that you can go collect

6483
06:20:18,298 --> 06:20:19,680
um

6484
06:20:19,680 --> 06:20:21,360
chainsaw again it's kind of like

6485
06:20:21,360 --> 06:20:23,940
Hayabusa it's a great tool we also use

6486
06:20:23,940 --> 06:20:25,378
Eric Zimmerman's tools if you aren't

6487
06:20:25,378 --> 06:20:26,760
using those tools like what are you

6488
06:20:26,760 --> 06:20:28,260
doing

6489
06:20:28,260 --> 06:20:30,000
they're great for digital forensics and

6490
06:20:30,000 --> 06:20:32,340
identifying quick win artifact triaging

6491
06:20:32,340 --> 06:20:34,020
and that's what we're used for and

6492
06:20:34,020 --> 06:20:36,360
leveraging Eric Zimmerman tools we're

6493
06:20:36,360 --> 06:20:38,580
able to leverage timeline Explorer and

6494
06:20:38,580 --> 06:20:40,740
map out descriptions to get quick wins

6495
06:20:40,740 --> 06:20:43,260
on the security event logs immediately

6496
06:20:43,260 --> 06:20:47,600
and build our security forensic timeline

6497
06:20:48,240 --> 06:20:51,360
so other than that any thoughts opinions

6498
06:20:51,360 --> 06:20:52,980
questions I can't promise we can answer

6499
06:20:52,980 --> 06:20:54,180
every question because there's some

6500
06:20:54,180 --> 06:20:56,520
things that we don't want to get into uh

6501
06:20:56,520 --> 06:20:58,798
happy to answer what we can though

6502
06:20:58,798 --> 06:21:02,120
I see one person

6503
06:21:02,700 --> 06:21:04,920
yeah there's a catch box

6504
06:21:04,920 --> 06:21:07,638
so the long list

6505
06:21:09,180 --> 06:21:10,558
that so from what I understand you

6506
06:21:10,558 --> 06:21:11,820
mentioned that this was essentially a

6507
06:21:11,820 --> 06:21:14,040
way for you to narrow down exactly what

6508
06:21:14,040 --> 06:21:15,540
specific defenses you should be using

6509
06:21:15,540 --> 06:21:19,200
based on who you think it is right

6510
06:21:19,200 --> 06:21:20,340
yeah yeah you're talking about the

6511
06:21:20,340 --> 06:21:22,798
threat Navigator yeah so how how

6512
06:21:22,798 --> 06:21:24,718
industry standard is that like is that

6513
06:21:24,718 --> 06:21:26,700
just a youth thing or is that something

6514
06:21:26,700 --> 06:21:28,378
that multiple firms will go and do

6515
06:21:28,378 --> 06:21:29,160
because I don't think I've seen

6516
06:21:29,160 --> 06:21:30,480
something like this before yeah so

6517
06:21:30,480 --> 06:21:31,980
threat Navigator is an internal tool

6518
06:21:31,980 --> 06:21:34,020
we've developed uh you can actually see

6519
06:21:34,020 --> 06:21:36,240
the client-facing version of it in this

6520
06:21:36,240 --> 06:21:38,340
screenshot every single one of

6521
06:21:38,340 --> 06:21:41,580
kadowski's clients has this built into

6522
06:21:41,580 --> 06:21:44,040
their portal so we set up a portal for

6523
06:21:44,040 --> 06:21:46,440
the client and it kind of it's our not

6524
06:21:46,440 --> 06:21:47,700
only is it our ticketing system with

6525
06:21:47,700 --> 06:21:48,958
them so if the stock identifies

6526
06:21:48,958 --> 06:21:51,540
something uh they'd get a notice there

6527
06:21:51,540 --> 06:21:53,100
in addition to whatever other alerting

6528
06:21:53,100 --> 06:21:55,440
they they receive but they also have

6529
06:21:55,440 --> 06:21:57,600
access to the threat Navigator so it

6530
06:21:57,600 --> 06:21:58,920
allows us to kind of work with them

6531
06:21:58,920 --> 06:22:01,020
let's say the company has a limited

6532
06:22:01,020 --> 06:22:02,400
budget they need to actually put in a

6533
06:22:02,400 --> 06:22:03,958
budgetary request they can actually

6534
06:22:03,958 --> 06:22:06,058
prioritize what the best investment is

6535
06:22:06,058 --> 06:22:08,400
going to be it's all based on minor

6536
06:22:08,400 --> 06:22:11,218
attack uh all the sigma files of course

6537
06:22:11,218 --> 06:22:12,298
have run through our detection

6538
06:22:12,298 --> 06:22:14,820
engineering teams we've worked with them

6539
06:22:14,820 --> 06:22:17,820
for the things that come from IR so it's

6540
06:22:17,820 --> 06:22:20,280
kind of our if you will our killer app

6541
06:22:20,280 --> 06:22:21,320
right

6542
06:22:21,320 --> 06:22:24,480
keeps track of all of our stuff it's

6543
06:22:24,480 --> 06:22:25,860
super helpful

6544
06:22:25,860 --> 06:22:28,580
so I'm assuming this is

6545
06:22:32,340 --> 06:22:33,840
this is put essentially put this down to

6546
06:22:33,840 --> 06:22:35,280
a science

6547
06:22:35,280 --> 06:22:37,920
so we have teams of researchers uh

6548
06:22:37,920 --> 06:22:40,680
kadelski our particular component of

6549
06:22:40,680 --> 06:22:42,660
this is very very small it's whatever we

6550
06:22:42,660 --> 06:22:45,058
find on an IR so kind of that process

6551
06:22:45,058 --> 06:22:47,580
works we identify TTP we we make sure

6552
06:22:47,580 --> 06:22:50,218
that it's valid or an ioc for that

6553
06:22:50,218 --> 06:22:52,200
matter make sure it's valid and then we

6554
06:22:52,200 --> 06:22:54,420
work with detection engineering to make

6555
06:22:54,420 --> 06:22:56,100
sure it's in a format that can be

6556
06:22:56,100 --> 06:22:57,540
deployed across all the Technologies our

6557
06:22:57,540 --> 06:23:01,138
MDR supports so I don't want to say that

6558
06:23:01,138 --> 06:23:03,360
like this is our our tool the IR teams

6559
06:23:03,360 --> 06:23:05,580
tool this is all of kedelski's Tool It's

6560
06:23:05,580 --> 06:23:06,660
been a

6561
06:23:06,660 --> 06:23:09,660
massive undertaking to get it to put

6562
06:23:09,660 --> 06:23:11,878
together actually we just started

6563
06:23:11,878 --> 06:23:13,500
rolling it out to clients a couple

6564
06:23:13,500 --> 06:23:16,440
months ago I think so it's a great

6565
06:23:16,440 --> 06:23:19,320
resource for our clients and it's like I

6566
06:23:19,320 --> 06:23:20,878
said it's all based on minor attacks so

6567
06:23:20,878 --> 06:23:22,080
if you need

6568
06:23:22,080 --> 06:23:23,218
you know you want to look up a

6569
06:23:23,218 --> 06:23:24,298
particular tactic that you want to

6570
06:23:24,298 --> 06:23:25,740
defend against it'll tell you exactly

6571
06:23:25,740 --> 06:23:27,360
what technologies you need to deploy to

6572
06:23:27,360 --> 06:23:29,340
prevent it and I'm assuming that because

6573
06:23:29,340 --> 06:23:30,780
it's only internal it's not like

6574
06:23:30,780 --> 06:23:34,798
available to look at yeah so uh the

6575
06:23:34,798 --> 06:23:37,500
threat Navigator is to my knowledge only

6576
06:23:37,500 --> 06:23:39,840
available to our clients at the moment I

6577
06:23:39,840 --> 06:23:41,100
don't know that we're ever going to

6578
06:23:41,100 --> 06:23:43,680
release it outside

6579
06:23:43,680 --> 06:23:45,780
uh that's a question for people well

6580
06:23:45,780 --> 06:23:48,058
above the IR team

6581
06:23:48,058 --> 06:23:50,600
Max I'm interested

6582
06:23:55,138 --> 06:23:56,878
in the source you can look at is uh

6583
06:23:56,878 --> 06:23:59,820
attack miter and they show a lot of

6584
06:23:59,820 --> 06:24:02,760
these same mappings as you see here

6585
06:24:02,760 --> 06:24:04,980
right so that's free open source matter

6586
06:24:04,980 --> 06:24:06,780
attack framework they just probably

6587
06:24:06,780 --> 06:24:10,200
won't show you threat actors yeah so

6588
06:24:10,200 --> 06:24:11,700
um there's a lot of work what specific

6589
06:24:11,700 --> 06:24:14,340
groups have been attacking what right uh

6590
06:24:14,340 --> 06:24:15,718
and this is broken down you can't really

6591
06:24:15,718 --> 06:24:17,340
see it because of the size of the

6592
06:24:17,340 --> 06:24:19,378
screenshot but it's not just the threat

6593
06:24:19,378 --> 06:24:20,878
actors that are listed here it's also

6594
06:24:20,878 --> 06:24:23,700
industry verticals so you can actually

6595
06:24:23,700 --> 06:24:25,980
like go into this tool and like okay

6596
06:24:25,980 --> 06:24:28,020
let's say I wanted to look at an

6597
06:24:28,020 --> 06:24:31,080
industry vertical for food processing

6598
06:24:31,080 --> 06:24:33,660
and then it'll actually flip so this

6599
06:24:33,660 --> 06:24:35,100
particular screenshot that you see right

6600
06:24:35,100 --> 06:24:37,138
here is broken down to just our threat

6601
06:24:37,138 --> 06:24:38,520
actor for this case

6602
06:24:38,520 --> 06:24:40,320
but you could actually go through and

6603
06:24:40,320 --> 06:24:42,480
like select all you know 20 thread

6604
06:24:42,480 --> 06:24:44,280
actors that we know Target that industry

6605
06:24:44,280 --> 06:24:46,558
and it'll fill this out

6606
06:24:46,558 --> 06:24:48,420
and show you the coverage yeah what

6607
06:24:48,420 --> 06:24:50,280
attacks they're gonna let you know yeah

6608
06:24:50,280 --> 06:24:52,920
okay yeah very Advanced yeah it's

6609
06:24:52,920 --> 06:24:54,000
excellent

6610
06:24:54,000 --> 06:24:56,400
um it's been a long time coming and

6611
06:24:56,400 --> 06:24:59,458
it's a great great tool well if you had

6612
06:24:59,458 --> 06:25:01,020
cases where like you've had horrible

6613
06:25:01,020 --> 06:25:02,638
outliers that like

6614
06:25:02,638 --> 06:25:04,080
it was either a group you didn't

6615
06:25:04,080 --> 06:25:05,940
anticipate or like

6616
06:25:05,940 --> 06:25:08,760
all the time every engagement is

6617
06:25:08,760 --> 06:25:11,700
different that we receive so upon

6618
06:25:11,700 --> 06:25:14,400
discovering new iocs or ttps we're

6619
06:25:14,400 --> 06:25:16,020
constantly in Communications with our

6620
06:25:16,020 --> 06:25:17,760
detection Engineers to validate those

6621
06:25:17,760 --> 06:25:19,620
findings and integrating that to the

6622
06:25:19,620 --> 06:25:21,900
technology yeah and if possible we'll

6623
06:25:21,900 --> 06:25:24,120
have them lab it up so if we can get a

6624
06:25:24,120 --> 06:25:26,580
hold of a binary or something we'll pass

6625
06:25:26,580 --> 06:25:29,040
it off and have them you know see how it

6626
06:25:29,040 --> 06:25:29,940
works

6627
06:25:29,940 --> 06:25:31,860
if needed

6628
06:25:31,860 --> 06:25:33,718
um so obviously we'll have our log

6629
06:25:33,718 --> 06:25:37,320
artifacts we can share but uh I am not a

6630
06:25:37,320 --> 06:25:38,900
malware analyst

6631
06:25:38,900 --> 06:25:43,160
we have people that do that so

6632
06:25:44,638 --> 06:25:47,218
a two-part question uh how did the

6633
06:25:47,218 --> 06:25:50,160
threat actor gain access and uh noticed

6634
06:25:50,160 --> 06:25:51,240
you had a they had a lot of

6635
06:25:51,240 --> 06:25:53,100
vulnerabilities did you use a

6636
06:25:53,100 --> 06:25:55,080
vulnerability scanning tool if so which

6637
06:25:55,080 --> 06:25:58,860
one yeah so threat actor leverage log4j

6638
06:25:58,860 --> 06:26:00,660
hit their VMware environment that was

6639
06:26:00,660 --> 06:26:02,218
exposed to the internet uh this

6640
06:26:02,218 --> 06:26:04,558
particular client uh used uses lots of

6641
06:26:04,558 --> 06:26:07,740
vdi they actually don't have very much

6642
06:26:07,740 --> 06:26:10,260
presence as far as physical workstations

6643
06:26:10,260 --> 06:26:12,000
compared to the vdi environment they do

6644
06:26:12,000 --> 06:26:13,680
have several hundred machines at each of

6645
06:26:13,680 --> 06:26:16,620
their sites but most of their users are

6646
06:26:16,620 --> 06:26:19,378
using vdi which as you can also Imagine

6647
06:26:19,378 --> 06:26:21,480
makes trying to trace logs and things

6648
06:26:21,480 --> 06:26:23,638
very difficult because those VMS get

6649
06:26:23,638 --> 06:26:26,458
destroyed after a period of time and so

6650
06:26:26,458 --> 06:26:29,280
uh yeah it was log4j hit their VMware

6651
06:26:29,280 --> 06:26:30,480
environment and then they started

6652
06:26:30,480 --> 06:26:32,580
pivoting internally you know got a hold

6653
06:26:32,580 --> 06:26:34,620
of admin credentials the the usual story

6654
06:26:34,620 --> 06:26:37,980
that you hear in a bad breach uh you

6655
06:26:37,980 --> 06:26:39,000
know

6656
06:26:39,000 --> 06:26:40,378
stealing hash is the whole deal

6657
06:26:40,378 --> 06:26:43,040
everything

6658
06:26:43,860 --> 06:26:45,780
um and there was a second part right uh

6659
06:26:45,780 --> 06:26:47,820
when you scan for vulnerabilities did

6660
06:26:47,820 --> 06:26:50,878
you use a particular tool yeah so uh we

6661
06:26:50,878 --> 06:26:52,980
have a partnership with tenable uh so

6662
06:26:52,980 --> 06:26:55,260
that was kind of our go-to tool

6663
06:26:55,260 --> 06:26:56,878
um in this particular case we actually

6664
06:26:56,878 --> 06:26:59,700
didn't use IO we used just their Nexus

6665
06:26:59,700 --> 06:27:02,218
Pro uh because we were trying to be

6666
06:27:02,218 --> 06:27:05,400
targeted this particular client mixes

6667
06:27:05,400 --> 06:27:07,260
their OT and it environment in some

6668
06:27:07,260 --> 06:27:10,680
places and as you can imagine you run a

6669
06:27:10,680 --> 06:27:12,058
vulnerability scanner and you hit an OT

6670
06:27:12,058 --> 06:27:14,240
device bad things can happen

6671
06:27:14,240 --> 06:27:17,040
so we were very targeted with how that

6672
06:27:17,040 --> 06:27:19,500
was working most of our vulnerability

6673
06:27:19,500 --> 06:27:20,820
information comes from actually

6674
06:27:20,820 --> 06:27:23,580
crowdstrike Spotlight it's actually be

6675
06:27:23,580 --> 06:27:25,260
it's been used in this case as our

6676
06:27:25,260 --> 06:27:27,780
source of Truth so

6677
06:27:27,780 --> 06:27:28,378
um

6678
06:27:28,378 --> 06:27:30,298
uh spotlight's been kind of keeping

6679
06:27:30,298 --> 06:27:33,600
track of our uh our vulnerabilities were

6680
06:27:33,600 --> 06:27:35,940
closing and how many are open

6681
06:27:35,940 --> 06:27:37,798
um I've been patching this environment

6682
06:27:37,798 --> 06:27:41,780
so uh I always hate patch Tuesdays

6683
06:27:41,780 --> 06:27:44,458
because my numbers always look really

6684
06:27:44,458 --> 06:27:45,840
crappy

6685
06:27:45,840 --> 06:27:47,340
um this particular client we usually

6686
06:27:47,340 --> 06:27:48,780
meet with them on Thursdays so we'll

6687
06:27:48,780 --> 06:27:50,520
have a patch Tuesday by Thursday

6688
06:27:50,520 --> 06:27:52,020
crowdstrike's already loaded all the

6689
06:27:52,020 --> 06:27:54,200
vulnerabilities and into their platform

6690
06:27:54,200 --> 06:27:56,820
and you know you'll see my criticals and

6691
06:27:56,820 --> 06:27:58,440
everything go way up and I'm just like

6692
06:27:58,440 --> 06:28:00,120
okay well we're back to square one for

6693
06:28:00,120 --> 06:28:03,660
the month oh boy yeah it's uh

6694
06:28:03,660 --> 06:28:05,340
uh it's a never-ending battle I was

6695
06:28:05,340 --> 06:28:07,798
trying to say yeah it just never ends um

6696
06:28:07,798 --> 06:28:10,080
eventually this client will have a team

6697
06:28:10,080 --> 06:28:12,540
that is capable of taking over uh they

6698
06:28:12,540 --> 06:28:14,340
just don't yet

6699
06:28:14,340 --> 06:28:15,360
um they

6700
06:28:15,360 --> 06:28:17,340
the merger and acquisition process as

6701
06:28:17,340 --> 06:28:19,440
you can imagine is uh is an interesting

6702
06:28:19,440 --> 06:28:20,218
one

6703
06:28:20,218 --> 06:28:22,680
uh and so they're kind of bringing we're

6704
06:28:22,680 --> 06:28:24,780
kind of watching their acquisition as

6705
06:28:24,780 --> 06:28:27,120
they bring stuff over So eventually

6706
06:28:27,120 --> 06:28:28,260
they'll have brought everything into

6707
06:28:28,260 --> 06:28:30,900
their actual processes and we won't be

6708
06:28:30,900 --> 06:28:33,120
needed anymore

6709
06:28:33,120 --> 06:28:36,600
sure please drill into that more they

6710
06:28:36,600 --> 06:28:38,638
were not doing or were inadequately

6711
06:28:38,638 --> 06:28:41,040
doing patch management you're now doing

6712
06:28:41,040 --> 06:28:42,540
it for them there's going to be a team

6713
06:28:42,540 --> 06:28:44,040
that replaces you because obviously

6714
06:28:44,040 --> 06:28:48,020
you've got the fish right

6715
06:28:48,240 --> 06:28:50,520
how will you help them develop a program

6716
06:28:50,520 --> 06:28:52,080
to make sure that they are dedicating

6717
06:28:52,080 --> 06:28:54,420
the time the sysadmins net admins are

6718
06:28:54,420 --> 06:28:56,100
dedicating the time to do that patch

6719
06:28:56,100 --> 06:28:58,980
management versus all the breakfast fix

6720
06:28:58,980 --> 06:29:00,958
additions that their their users want

6721
06:29:00,958 --> 06:29:04,200
sure so the company that actually

6722
06:29:04,200 --> 06:29:07,440
acquired this one is much more with it

6723
06:29:07,440 --> 06:29:10,458
uh compared to the acquired company

6724
06:29:10,458 --> 06:29:12,540
they've got policies they've actually

6725
06:29:12,540 --> 06:29:14,340
got a team of people that you know are

6726
06:29:14,340 --> 06:29:16,558
familiar this this client uses a config

6727
06:29:16,558 --> 06:29:19,680
manager for their Windows patching so

6728
06:29:19,680 --> 06:29:21,058
they've got a team of people that

6729
06:29:21,058 --> 06:29:23,520
actually do that and so as they're

6730
06:29:23,520 --> 06:29:27,360
bringing sites and subnets over

6731
06:29:27,360 --> 06:29:29,878
um they're taking over that load so they

6732
06:29:29,878 --> 06:29:31,620
already have people in place that can do

6733
06:29:31,620 --> 06:29:33,660
it it's just

6734
06:29:33,660 --> 06:29:36,780
it's a it's a gradual process

6735
06:29:36,780 --> 06:29:37,378
um

6736
06:29:37,378 --> 06:29:40,200
and frankly they just want us to be sure

6737
06:29:40,200 --> 06:29:42,298
that there's nothing crazy on the inside

6738
06:29:42,298 --> 06:29:45,000
before they bring stuff over

6739
06:29:45,000 --> 06:29:47,760
um and so it was worthwhile to them to

6740
06:29:47,760 --> 06:29:49,920
kind of set me since with my sister's

6741
06:29:49,920 --> 06:29:51,860
Administration background on the problem

6742
06:29:51,860 --> 06:29:55,500
uh because I could do some of the

6743
06:29:55,500 --> 06:29:58,200
Automation and stuff uh for patch

6744
06:29:58,200 --> 06:30:00,540
management that their local teams could

6745
06:30:00,540 --> 06:30:01,520
not

6746
06:30:01,520 --> 06:30:05,480
and there's perhaps I'm gonna I'm gonna

6747
06:30:05,480 --> 06:30:09,240
speculate I'm not sure that the security

6748
06:30:09,240 --> 06:30:12,420
team at the acquiring company has

6749
06:30:12,420 --> 06:30:14,420
confidence in their local resources

6750
06:30:14,420 --> 06:30:18,958
necessarily uh to get the job done so

6751
06:30:18,958 --> 06:30:20,100
um

6752
06:30:20,100 --> 06:30:22,500
there's some Personnel things as well

6753
06:30:22,500 --> 06:30:25,740
that are not our purview so yeah uh

6754
06:30:25,740 --> 06:30:28,080
helping them get on a even footing is

6755
06:30:28,080 --> 06:30:30,840
pretty much like helping them set up

6756
06:30:30,840 --> 06:30:32,458
their automated patching process for

6757
06:30:32,458 --> 06:30:35,100
systems they don't care about I mean you

6758
06:30:35,100 --> 06:30:36,840
care about every system but like one

6759
06:30:36,840 --> 06:30:38,160
said if it goes down it's not going to

6760
06:30:38,160 --> 06:30:40,860
interrupt the flow of oil right uh and

6761
06:30:40,860 --> 06:30:43,860
so that's been an ongoing process

6762
06:30:43,860 --> 06:30:46,378
um unfortunately it's been pretty much

6763
06:30:46,378 --> 06:30:49,080
subnet by subnet group of devices by

6764
06:30:49,080 --> 06:30:50,638
group of devices there really isn't a

6765
06:30:50,638 --> 06:30:54,000
good way uh with how fragmented this

6766
06:30:54,000 --> 06:30:56,760
network is and the mixture of OT and it

6767
06:30:56,760 --> 06:30:58,740
that there's not really a good way to do

6768
06:30:58,740 --> 06:31:01,440
it in one Fell Swoop

6769
06:31:01,440 --> 06:31:02,100
um

6770
06:31:02,100 --> 06:31:04,260
and it's happening it's just a slow

6771
06:31:04,260 --> 06:31:06,679
process

6772
06:31:07,740 --> 06:31:10,340
whomever

6773
06:31:12,120 --> 06:31:14,340
location that apt-35 has made another

6774
06:31:14,340 --> 06:31:16,680
run at these guys after you've kicked

6775
06:31:16,680 --> 06:31:18,378
them out or since you've been monitoring

6776
06:31:18,378 --> 06:31:21,360
yeah with our continuous threat hunting

6777
06:31:21,360 --> 06:31:25,260
so I continually follow a lot of threat

6778
06:31:25,260 --> 06:31:27,600
Intel on this group because of the

6779
06:31:27,600 --> 06:31:29,160
impact they've had in this organization

6780
06:31:29,160 --> 06:31:32,340
and I'm constantly looking for new iocs

6781
06:31:32,340 --> 06:31:34,860
or tactics by the operator themselves

6782
06:31:34,860 --> 06:31:37,680
and new ransomware attacks that are

6783
06:31:37,680 --> 06:31:40,020
coming out of the country in a region so

6784
06:31:40,020 --> 06:31:42,058
on a weekly basis I'm scheduling and

6785
06:31:42,058 --> 06:31:45,298
conducting frequent threat hunts in the

6786
06:31:45,298 --> 06:31:46,860
environment looking for malicious

6787
06:31:46,860 --> 06:31:49,020
behavior patterns and interactive

6788
06:31:49,020 --> 06:31:52,620
activity within the boxes of chasing it

6789
06:31:52,620 --> 06:31:55,440
down to parent and child processes

6790
06:31:55,440 --> 06:31:58,740
yeah because because we've rolled this

6791
06:31:58,740 --> 06:32:00,420
acquired company into the parent

6792
06:32:00,420 --> 06:32:02,700
crowdstrike tenant we actually when we

6793
06:32:02,700 --> 06:32:04,798
perform a threat hunt it's across not

6794
06:32:04,798 --> 06:32:07,620
only the acquired company but also

6795
06:32:07,620 --> 06:32:09,900
the our actual client which is actually

6796
06:32:09,900 --> 06:32:12,360
seen as a value add for them so James is

6797
06:32:12,360 --> 06:32:14,400
not only hunting no this this

6798
06:32:14,400 --> 06:32:16,558
environment that was in such bad shape

6799
06:32:16,558 --> 06:32:18,180
but he's also hunting the environment

6800
06:32:18,180 --> 06:32:19,620
and they don't have a threat Hunter they

6801
06:32:19,620 --> 06:32:21,660
don't have you know they have an MD they

6802
06:32:21,660 --> 06:32:23,760
have our MDR so they have our like what

6803
06:32:23,760 --> 06:32:25,440
our threat Hunters do but they don't

6804
06:32:25,440 --> 06:32:26,878
have somebody that's like specifically

6805
06:32:26,878 --> 06:32:28,138
looking for things and we aren't just

6806
06:32:28,138 --> 06:32:29,940
looking for apt-35 in their environment

6807
06:32:29,940 --> 06:32:31,680
we're looking for anything we're looking

6808
06:32:31,680 --> 06:32:34,620
for all types of Apt activity uh

6809
06:32:34,620 --> 06:32:36,840
ransomware operators living off a land

6810
06:32:36,840 --> 06:32:39,298
binaries tactics procedures

6811
06:32:39,298 --> 06:32:41,760
anything that comes out real hot on the

6812
06:32:41,760 --> 06:32:44,400
web and Twitter we're searching for it

6813
06:32:44,400 --> 06:32:46,200
and hunting it and creating squeaky

6814
06:32:46,200 --> 06:32:48,240
threat hunts not only within our client

6815
06:32:48,240 --> 06:32:50,218
but also for the entire credulous

6816
06:32:50,218 --> 06:32:53,160
security clients out there so everybody

6817
06:32:53,160 --> 06:32:55,798
wins within uh the threat hunts we

6818
06:32:55,798 --> 06:32:58,100
conduct

6819
06:32:58,798 --> 06:33:00,780
so when you catch an attacker in a

6820
06:33:00,780 --> 06:33:02,820
system do you ever give them an

6821
06:33:02,820 --> 06:33:04,980
opportunity to like proceed forward

6822
06:33:04,980 --> 06:33:07,080
after like watching them very closely so

6823
06:33:07,080 --> 06:33:08,940
that you can gain more attributes we

6824
06:33:08,940 --> 06:33:11,660
surgically their activity we surgically

6825
06:33:11,660 --> 06:33:15,540
start erratic containing the the end

6826
06:33:15,540 --> 06:33:17,940
points surgically okay because we don't

6827
06:33:17,940 --> 06:33:19,680
want to tip our hand per se and let them

6828
06:33:19,680 --> 06:33:21,840
know hey we block we block them already

6829
06:33:21,840 --> 06:33:23,638
unfortunately when we start going to

6830
06:33:23,638 --> 06:33:25,260
pull logs and things it generally tips

6831
06:33:25,260 --> 06:33:28,440
them off that were there yeah okay so

6832
06:33:28,440 --> 06:33:30,240
um that's one of those things that's

6833
06:33:30,240 --> 06:33:33,660
like a very careful balance so we work

6834
06:33:33,660 --> 06:33:35,340
as a team at

6835
06:33:35,340 --> 06:33:38,218
James's uh detection analyst threat

6836
06:33:38,218 --> 06:33:40,920
Hunter kind of I'm I'm dealing with uh

6837
06:33:40,920 --> 06:33:44,100
he does some of the forensics too but uh

6838
06:33:44,100 --> 06:33:46,138
it's very like that's one of those

6839
06:33:46,138 --> 06:33:47,700
situations that we don't necessarily

6840
06:33:47,700 --> 06:33:49,200
make the decision ourselves we have to

6841
06:33:49,200 --> 06:33:50,520
escalate to our training command and

6842
06:33:50,520 --> 06:33:52,440
also the client to pull the trigger

6843
06:33:52,440 --> 06:33:54,780
based on our evidence and findings yeah

6844
06:33:54,780 --> 06:33:56,940
well then I had a second part what's the

6845
06:33:56,940 --> 06:34:00,000
process that you use during to like

6846
06:34:00,000 --> 06:34:03,000
during investigating that to get the

6847
06:34:03,000 --> 06:34:05,400
data back to your team like what is a

6848
06:34:05,400 --> 06:34:07,500
good process do you do that in during

6849
06:34:07,500 --> 06:34:10,378
the engagement or at the end so

6850
06:34:10,378 --> 06:34:13,680
to get the data back to our DLC game

6851
06:34:13,680 --> 06:34:15,600
that kind of thing yeah so we'll work

6852
06:34:15,600 --> 06:34:17,638
with a detection engineer

6853
06:34:17,638 --> 06:34:20,160
um and say okay here's our report

6854
06:34:20,160 --> 06:34:22,020
yeah and it may not be the final report

6855
06:34:22,020 --> 06:34:23,940
but it you know at least have most of

6856
06:34:23,940 --> 06:34:26,218
the information in it and say okay like

6857
06:34:26,218 --> 06:34:28,440
start looking at this what can you

6858
06:34:28,440 --> 06:34:30,780
corroborate with other sources right we

6859
06:34:30,780 --> 06:34:33,058
know that the threat actor did this in

6860
06:34:33,058 --> 06:34:35,340
this particular case uh we actually saw

6861
06:34:35,340 --> 06:34:38,700
the APT kick out a crypto mining

6862
06:34:38,700 --> 06:34:41,580
threat actor uh they actually kicked

6863
06:34:41,580 --> 06:34:45,958
them out and patched the hole uh and so

6864
06:34:45,958 --> 06:34:48,000
you have to be able to kind of separate

6865
06:34:48,000 --> 06:34:49,620
that out because obviously like these

6866
06:34:49,620 --> 06:34:51,480
guys aren't interested in crypto mining

6867
06:34:51,480 --> 06:34:53,400
probably

6868
06:34:53,400 --> 06:34:55,320
um they did try to deploy ransomware

6869
06:34:55,320 --> 06:34:56,700
when they figured out we were kicking

6870
06:34:56,700 --> 06:34:59,340
them out which yeah when we discovered

6871
06:34:59,340 --> 06:35:02,940
that a Twitter back door on on a box we

6872
06:35:02,940 --> 06:35:05,820
identified the forensic artifacts dated

6873
06:35:05,820 --> 06:35:10,378
to a January 8th okay that C2 that

6874
06:35:10,378 --> 06:35:14,760
Twitter back door didn't trigger and so

6875
06:35:14,760 --> 06:35:17,580
like June two months after we were doing

6876
06:35:17,580 --> 06:35:19,860
the initial triage right we believe we

6877
06:35:19,860 --> 06:35:21,718
we kicked out we identified all the web

6878
06:35:21,718 --> 06:35:25,138
shells back doors Etc but as soon as we

6879
06:35:25,138 --> 06:35:28,440
block that C2 connection to their back

6880
06:35:28,440 --> 06:35:30,958
door later on that night

6881
06:35:30,958 --> 06:35:33,718
I swear I mean right the next day we

6882
06:35:33,718 --> 06:35:35,160
started seeing impact of framework

6883
06:35:35,160 --> 06:35:38,040
lateral movement using wmi.pi and we

6884
06:35:38,040 --> 06:35:39,180
were just playing whack-a-mole just

6885
06:35:39,180 --> 06:35:40,260
trying to stop the bleeding like

6886
06:35:40,260 --> 06:35:42,600
literally stop the bleeding so time went

6887
06:35:42,600 --> 06:35:45,000
on and about seven or eight we get two

6888
06:35:45,000 --> 06:35:46,740
detections two alerts that triggered

6889
06:35:46,740 --> 06:35:49,080
that night and it dealt with a sched

6890
06:35:49,080 --> 06:35:51,958
persistent scheduled task and a volume

6891
06:35:51,958 --> 06:35:54,298
system Shadow copy attempt to be deleted

6892
06:35:54,298 --> 06:35:56,638
I mean crosstalk detected and blocked it

6893
06:35:56,638 --> 06:35:58,740
but when we researched and reported to

6894
06:35:58,740 --> 06:36:01,378
the client we told them hey this

6895
06:36:01,378 --> 06:36:03,058
seriously looks like an attempt to

6896
06:36:03,058 --> 06:36:05,040
Ransom and sabotage the whole network

6897
06:36:05,040 --> 06:36:08,100
all because we pretty much we kicked we

6898
06:36:08,100 --> 06:36:09,980
identified the last scene two for them

6899
06:36:09,980 --> 06:36:13,440
and as soon as we told the client that

6900
06:36:13,440 --> 06:36:15,360
he's he flipped on the switch and told

6901
06:36:15,360 --> 06:36:17,700
her team to go ahead and contain the box

6902
06:36:17,700 --> 06:36:20,040
and block it at the at the firewall

6903
06:36:20,040 --> 06:36:21,780
level yeah because they're running tools

6904
06:36:21,780 --> 06:36:24,120
that like don't exist anywhere else

6905
06:36:24,120 --> 06:36:26,340
you know like they've got binaries and

6906
06:36:26,340 --> 06:36:27,900
stuff that nobody's ever seen it was a

6907
06:36:27,900 --> 06:36:30,180
noble it was a noble binary and to this

6908
06:36:30,180 --> 06:36:33,718
day that uh IP address has zero hits on

6909
06:36:33,718 --> 06:36:36,480
VT there's there's nothing on it so

6910
06:36:36,480 --> 06:36:37,440
there's that I just looked yesterday

6911
06:36:37,440 --> 06:36:40,638
there's nothing on it though

6912
06:36:40,798 --> 06:36:43,740
that was fun yeah so taking a look at

6913
06:36:43,740 --> 06:36:46,638
like uh doing the IR with uh OT devices

6914
06:36:46,638 --> 06:36:49,320
because of how sensitive and usually

6915
06:36:49,320 --> 06:36:50,340
like

6916
06:36:50,340 --> 06:36:52,740
I've seen oftentimes proprietary to how

6917
06:36:52,740 --> 06:36:53,940
do you approach that like when you're

6918
06:36:53,940 --> 06:36:55,500
trying to like gather information in

6919
06:36:55,500 --> 06:36:57,180
forensics because I

6920
06:36:57,180 --> 06:36:59,280
that that is a very complicated subject

6921
06:36:59,280 --> 06:37:01,920
that is a very good question yeah that

6922
06:37:01,920 --> 06:37:04,519
is a

6923
06:37:05,100 --> 06:37:08,160
it's very delicate thing

6924
06:37:08,160 --> 06:37:08,940
um

6925
06:37:08,940 --> 06:37:11,940
so uh we of course dealt with a lot of

6926
06:37:11,940 --> 06:37:13,620
the HMI stuff

6927
06:37:13,620 --> 06:37:15,900
um the actual OT devices themselves we

6928
06:37:15,900 --> 06:37:17,878
don't believe are impacted uh just

6929
06:37:17,878 --> 06:37:20,218
because processes are working there's

6930
06:37:20,218 --> 06:37:22,020
nothing weird going on there uh

6931
06:37:22,020 --> 06:37:23,280
couldowski actually partners with

6932
06:37:23,280 --> 06:37:26,760
Clarity for visibility and OT so

6933
06:37:26,760 --> 06:37:27,958
um they can detect if there's kind of

6934
06:37:27,958 --> 06:37:29,940
squirreliness going on and they can

6935
06:37:29,940 --> 06:37:31,440
actually thumb print devices which is

6936
06:37:31,440 --> 06:37:33,660
kind of amazing to me they know exactly

6937
06:37:33,660 --> 06:37:35,160
what device it is and what software it's

6938
06:37:35,160 --> 06:37:36,900
running based on a packet capture that

6939
06:37:36,900 --> 06:37:38,940
just blows my mind and it's all based on

6940
06:37:38,940 --> 06:37:41,700
your rules as well yeah so

6941
06:37:41,700 --> 06:37:44,700
um yeah so this particular case uh

6942
06:37:44,700 --> 06:37:46,740
primarily we were just worried about you

6943
06:37:46,740 --> 06:37:48,120
know the windows box that's sitting

6944
06:37:48,120 --> 06:37:50,940
there that's however many version

6945
06:37:50,940 --> 06:37:53,058
patches behind

6946
06:37:53,058 --> 06:37:56,180
and how that particular

6947
06:37:56,180 --> 06:37:59,700
patching that impacts operations so like

6948
06:37:59,700 --> 06:38:02,400
in a in a OT environment like like this

6949
06:38:02,400 --> 06:38:03,958
there's usually like a control room

6950
06:38:03,958 --> 06:38:07,980
right and as long as some of those

6951
06:38:07,980 --> 06:38:09,480
systems in that control room are

6952
06:38:09,480 --> 06:38:11,820
operational they can keep things going

6953
06:38:11,820 --> 06:38:14,638
and so we have to be very careful and

6954
06:38:14,638 --> 06:38:17,218
very particular about how we deal with

6955
06:38:17,218 --> 06:38:18,138
those

6956
06:38:18,138 --> 06:38:20,700
because frankly a lot of them run some

6957
06:38:20,700 --> 06:38:22,680
really sensitive software a lot of them

6958
06:38:22,680 --> 06:38:25,080
are very out of date uh you know like

6959
06:38:25,080 --> 06:38:26,580
we're talking devices that maybe were

6960
06:38:26,580 --> 06:38:28,558
installed 20 years ago and the software

6961
06:38:28,558 --> 06:38:30,718
is probably just as old and you know

6962
06:38:30,718 --> 06:38:33,298
sometimes upgrading from say Windows

6963
06:38:33,298 --> 06:38:36,298
Vista is not an option you know so in

6964
06:38:36,298 --> 06:38:37,798
those cases it's a lot of like

6965
06:38:37,798 --> 06:38:40,558
containing Trying to minimize where a

6966
06:38:40,558 --> 06:38:42,840
threat actor could get in

6967
06:38:42,840 --> 06:38:44,878
it's it's very messy it's a very messy

6968
06:38:44,878 --> 06:38:46,080
process

6969
06:38:46,080 --> 06:38:48,120
so have you because you said that their

6970
06:38:48,120 --> 06:38:51,000
i-202 is intermix have you tried like uh

6971
06:38:51,000 --> 06:38:53,100
encouraging them to separate it out a

6972
06:38:53,100 --> 06:38:54,840
little bit more absolutely not possible

6973
06:38:54,840 --> 06:38:56,420
yeah those are called

6974
06:38:56,420 --> 06:38:59,000
recommendations

6975
06:38:59,000 --> 06:39:01,558
on the report so as I was saying the the

6976
06:39:01,558 --> 06:39:03,000
company that actually acquired this one

6977
06:39:03,000 --> 06:39:05,040
is kind of more with it

6978
06:39:05,040 --> 06:39:06,660
um and that's one of the things that

6979
06:39:06,660 --> 06:39:08,580
their folks are working on

6980
06:39:08,580 --> 06:39:11,160
um so uh that's not really something

6981
06:39:11,160 --> 06:39:14,160
that as the IR team would be doing

6982
06:39:14,160 --> 06:39:17,520
um but we definitely let our client know

6983
06:39:17,520 --> 06:39:19,860
that that was the case and yeah they've

6984
06:39:19,860 --> 06:39:21,420
been they've been installing their own

6985
06:39:21,420 --> 06:39:23,218
Hardware they've been moving things over

6986
06:39:23,218 --> 06:39:25,440
their own switches like they've improved

6987
06:39:25,440 --> 06:39:28,260
it's been a whole like lift and shift

6988
06:39:28,260 --> 06:39:29,820
um I've been kind of impressed with how

6989
06:39:29,820 --> 06:39:31,138
quickly they've been able to execute

6990
06:39:31,138 --> 06:39:35,218
sometimes and to my knowledge they've

6991
06:39:35,218 --> 06:39:38,400
not really interrupted uh operations I

6992
06:39:38,400 --> 06:39:40,500
did have one time I patched in their

6993
06:39:40,500 --> 06:39:44,100
VMware cluster fell over uh

6994
06:39:44,100 --> 06:39:47,580
so I hadn't split the vdis into separate

6995
06:39:47,580 --> 06:39:49,320
groups other than the particular

6996
06:39:49,320 --> 06:39:52,260
location that vdi was because I was

6997
06:39:52,260 --> 06:39:54,420
asked to patch as quickly as possible so

6998
06:39:54,420 --> 06:39:56,218
what did I do I set up a collection of

6999
06:39:56,218 --> 06:39:58,920
all the vdis at this particular site and

7000
06:39:58,920 --> 06:40:01,200
push the Windows patches to them

7001
06:40:01,200 --> 06:40:04,980
and then we got a phone call of hey none

7002
06:40:04,980 --> 06:40:07,500
of our systems work we had to stop

7003
06:40:07,500 --> 06:40:09,840
patchy yeah I had to I had to turn over

7004
06:40:09,840 --> 06:40:12,180
the whole network and it wasn't and it

7005
06:40:12,180 --> 06:40:14,940
wasn't the fact that Windows itself was

7006
06:40:14,940 --> 06:40:17,878
patching it was the download of all the

7007
06:40:17,878 --> 06:40:21,540
patches to the vdi system and it was the

7008
06:40:21,540 --> 06:40:23,700
processor utilization to install those

7009
06:40:23,700 --> 06:40:26,040
patches and so what actually caused the

7010
06:40:26,040 --> 06:40:28,558
vdi environment to fall over was just a

7011
06:40:28,558 --> 06:40:31,080
simple Act of patching like it wasn't

7012
06:40:31,080 --> 06:40:33,360
even like the reboots were not even part

7013
06:40:33,360 --> 06:40:34,500
of it like they hadn't even rebooted it

7014
06:40:34,500 --> 06:40:35,458
hadn't even hit their maintenance window

7015
06:40:35,458 --> 06:40:37,440
to reboot yet it was just the vdi

7016
06:40:37,440 --> 06:40:39,540
environment could not keep up with the

7017
06:40:39,540 --> 06:40:41,760
processing and stuff

7018
06:40:41,760 --> 06:40:43,980
we just got the one minute warning yeah

7019
06:40:43,980 --> 06:40:46,558
sorry about that guys I was I was

7020
06:40:46,558 --> 06:40:48,120
waiting for an opportunity to ask some

7021
06:40:48,120 --> 06:40:50,160
questions from Discord

7022
06:40:50,160 --> 06:40:51,240
um

7023
06:40:51,240 --> 06:40:55,500
so Shar on Discord would like to know if

7024
06:40:55,500 --> 06:40:58,740
the original company uh was there no

7025
06:40:58,740 --> 06:41:01,980
industry requirement for some minimal

7026
06:41:01,980 --> 06:41:03,660
security

7027
06:41:03,660 --> 06:41:07,020
I would assume there probably was I'm

7028
06:41:07,020 --> 06:41:08,700
not a GRC guy

7029
06:41:08,700 --> 06:41:11,458
uh we have an entire advisory arm that I

7030
06:41:11,458 --> 06:41:14,458
am sure that the uh the acquiring

7031
06:41:14,458 --> 06:41:17,100
company is using it's kind of out of my

7032
06:41:17,100 --> 06:41:19,500
purview but yes I am fairly sure that

7033
06:41:19,500 --> 06:41:21,120
there were we just dealt with the

7034
06:41:21,120 --> 06:41:23,340
digital forensics and incident response

7035
06:41:23,340 --> 06:41:25,620
portion yeah yeah

7036
06:41:25,620 --> 06:41:27,660
um yeah there's definitely probably

7037
06:41:27,660 --> 06:41:31,680
regulatory requirements all right

7038
06:41:31,680 --> 06:41:34,680
response ties into the next question was

7039
06:41:34,680 --> 06:41:36,980
there even

7040
06:41:37,740 --> 06:41:42,120
no no no IR plans playbooks run books or

7041
06:41:42,120 --> 06:41:44,760
proceed not seen we were the IR plans we

7042
06:41:44,760 --> 06:41:46,160
are the

7043
06:41:46,160 --> 06:41:48,260
foreign

7044
06:41:48,260 --> 06:41:50,638
and the last question which was

7045
06:41:50,638 --> 06:41:53,878
partially answered was um it sounds like

7046
06:41:53,878 --> 06:41:56,340
they had crowdstrike to start with but

7047
06:41:56,340 --> 06:41:58,558
didn't notice that alerting was disabled

7048
06:41:58,558 --> 06:42:00,958
for four months so they had cortex that

7049
06:42:00,958 --> 06:42:03,180
pile of lots of Cortex which was a

7050
06:42:03,180 --> 06:42:06,540
disabled the alerting and detection was

7051
06:42:06,540 --> 06:42:08,458
disabled by the threat actor wants to

7052
06:42:08,458 --> 06:42:10,558
gain access to the environment yeah okay

7053
06:42:10,558 --> 06:42:12,120
I don't I don't want to throw shade at

7054
06:42:12,120 --> 06:42:13,620
Palo Alto it wasn't really their fault

7055
06:42:13,620 --> 06:42:15,540
no it just poor configuration yeah

7056
06:42:15,540 --> 06:42:17,340
that's it

7057
06:42:17,340 --> 06:42:18,120
um

7058
06:42:18,120 --> 06:42:21,480
was that uh a matter of management

7059
06:42:21,480 --> 06:42:24,298
paying for tools and not people to

7060
06:42:24,298 --> 06:42:27,020
actually monitor or manage monitor

7061
06:42:27,020 --> 06:42:30,798
manage and patch I would be speculating

7062
06:42:30,798 --> 06:42:35,218
uh but based on the level of maturity of

7063
06:42:35,218 --> 06:42:37,020
the acquired company it would not

7064
06:42:37,020 --> 06:42:39,540
surprise me if they were getting alerts

7065
06:42:39,540 --> 06:42:43,260
and just not actioning on them yeah

7066
06:42:43,260 --> 06:42:46,260
um we kind of just sidestepped cortex in

7067
06:42:46,260 --> 06:42:48,298
this case uh and brought in our own

7068
06:42:48,298 --> 06:42:49,500
tools and brought in Crosstrack because

7069
06:42:49,500 --> 06:42:50,458
that's what we're most familiar with

7070
06:42:50,458 --> 06:42:52,920
there there are kind of lead partner for

7071
06:42:52,920 --> 06:42:56,160
ir and so that's what we do

7072
06:42:56,160 --> 06:42:58,080
not that we don't work on carbon black

7073
06:42:58,080 --> 06:43:00,600
and all the other ones but

7074
06:43:00,600 --> 06:43:03,480
um cortex was there but it wasn't

7075
06:43:03,480 --> 06:43:06,000
alerting so I

7076
06:43:06,000 --> 06:43:08,040
you know it wasn't very effective and we

7077
06:43:08,040 --> 06:43:09,718
know that a bad guy probably turned it

7078
06:43:09,718 --> 06:43:13,940
off so why are you gonna trust it

7079
06:43:14,100 --> 06:43:16,500
probably not

7080
06:43:16,500 --> 06:43:18,180
okay

7081
06:43:18,180 --> 06:43:20,520
we're happy to talk after so if you need

7082
06:43:20,520 --> 06:43:23,100
if you want have more questions uh feel

7083
06:43:23,100 --> 06:43:24,900

turn it over to him

7120
06:51:46,798 --> 06:51:48,600
all right great thank well thanks for

7121
06:51:48,600 --> 06:51:51,298
coming this is a topic that is uh it's

7122
06:51:51,298 --> 06:51:52,260
pretty close to my heart I've been

7123
06:51:52,260 --> 06:51:54,298
following cloud pen testing for a while

7124
06:51:54,298 --> 06:51:56,520
now started with Google went into

7125
06:51:56,520 --> 06:51:58,340
Microsoft for a little while did some

7126
06:51:58,340 --> 06:52:00,900
AWS and so I just thought kind of

7127
06:52:00,900 --> 06:52:02,458
consolidating a lot of that and talking

7128
06:52:02,458 --> 06:52:04,138
about some of the actual pen testing

7129
06:52:04,138 --> 06:52:06,180
rather than just the stunt hacking and

7130
06:52:06,180 --> 06:52:08,400
stuff that we see a lot in the offensive

7131
06:52:08,400 --> 06:52:11,700
security side uh so with that my name is

7132
06:52:11,700 --> 06:52:14,218
Mike Felch and I actually got started

7133
06:52:14,218 --> 06:52:17,100
exploiting way back in the day um so the

7134
06:52:17,100 --> 06:52:19,620
late 90s in bbs's so if anybody's from

7135
06:52:19,620 --> 06:52:21,780
like those old school BBS days it's kind

7136
06:52:21,780 --> 06:52:22,978
of where I started so I got my start

7137
06:52:22,978 --> 06:52:24,360
with some of the back doors that were in

7138
06:52:24,360 --> 06:52:28,200
some of the BBS softwares and um and so

7139
06:52:28,200 --> 06:52:29,458
my first vulnerability that I really

7140
06:52:29,458 --> 06:52:31,440
fell in love with was CGI Ben phf

7141
06:52:31,440 --> 06:52:33,958
anybody remember that from like 97 yeah

7142
06:52:33,958 --> 06:52:35,820
there's usually like a few of us ever

7143
06:52:35,820 --> 06:52:37,260
anywhere that knows even what I'm

7144
06:52:37,260 --> 06:52:39,540
talking about and I got started software

7145
06:52:39,540 --> 06:52:41,340
developing in vb3 those are the where's

7146
06:52:41,340 --> 06:52:42,478
days when you would get on like a

7147
06:52:42,478 --> 06:52:44,160
bulletin board and download like zip

7148
06:52:44,160 --> 06:52:46,798
files and decompress them

7149
06:52:46,798 --> 06:52:49,320
but I've been officially pen testing at

7150
06:52:49,320 --> 06:52:51,478
an organization in in some capacity of

7151
06:52:51,478 --> 06:52:54,058
my career since around 2005. I go by you

7152
06:52:54,058 --> 06:52:55,978
stay ready on Twitter so if you're on

7153
06:52:55,978 --> 06:52:57,780
Twitter feel free to reach out and I

7154
06:52:57,780 --> 06:52:58,620
work for Black Hills information

7155
06:52:58,620 --> 06:53:01,320
security as on the security research and

7156
06:53:01,320 --> 06:53:02,340
the red team

7157
06:53:02,340 --> 06:53:04,500
so we are pen testing firm we do a lot

7158
06:53:04,500 --> 06:53:06,718
of other stuff too but our specialty is

7159
06:53:06,718 --> 06:53:09,240
mainly on the pen testing side but we're

7160
06:53:09,240 --> 06:53:11,638
pretty much across the board now so just

7161
06:53:11,638 --> 06:53:12,900
to kind of give you a little bit of a

7162
06:53:12,900 --> 06:53:15,780
disclaimer on this talk so this is not a

7163
06:53:15,780 --> 06:53:17,160
reflection of Amazon so I don't know if

7164
06:53:17,160 --> 06:53:18,780
anybody's from Amazon here a lot of

7165
06:53:18,780 --> 06:53:20,760
friends there great company great

7166
06:53:20,760 --> 06:53:22,978
technology stack this isn't a reflection

7167
06:53:22,978 --> 06:53:26,340
of Amazon specifically we will in this

7168
06:53:26,340 --> 06:53:28,378
talk look at a lot of the AWS CLI

7169
06:53:28,378 --> 06:53:30,540
components and we're going to dig into

7170
06:53:30,540 --> 06:53:32,458
some of the services now the idea behind

7171
06:53:32,458 --> 06:53:35,100
this is some of the problems that I've

7172
06:53:35,100 --> 06:53:37,860
encountered on a pen test especially as

7173
06:53:37,860 --> 06:53:39,298
it relates to

7174
06:53:39,298 --> 06:53:42,360
having to scale across lots of AWS

7175
06:53:42,360 --> 06:53:44,218
accounts it's really difficult from a

7176
06:53:44,218 --> 06:53:46,680
pen testing perspective to do that and

7177
06:53:46,680 --> 06:53:48,718
so we'll discuss some of the the hurdles

7178
06:53:48,718 --> 06:53:50,040
that I've encountered and then ways to

7179
06:53:50,040 --> 06:53:51,958
get around them and then we'll talk

7180
06:53:51,958 --> 06:53:53,218
about reporting I know it's like

7181
06:53:53,218 --> 06:53:55,558
everybody loves reporting but we'll look

7182
06:53:55,558 --> 06:53:56,700
at that a little bit and we'll talk

7183
06:53:56,700 --> 06:53:57,420
about

7184
06:53:57,420 --> 06:53:59,760
um so pen testing in depth with this and

7185
06:53:59,760 --> 06:54:02,340
then how we could scale it in order to

7186
06:54:02,340 --> 06:54:04,378
kind of meet our customers needs or

7187
06:54:04,378 --> 06:54:06,180
whatever kind of engagements you're on

7188
06:54:06,180 --> 06:54:08,400
so with that um the agenda we're going

7189
06:54:08,400 --> 06:54:09,780
to talk about a high level testing

7190
06:54:09,780 --> 06:54:10,920
overview it's going to kind of walk

7191
06:54:10,920 --> 06:54:12,120
through all of your initial access

7192
06:54:12,120 --> 06:54:14,100
provisioning and what you would need in

7193
06:54:14,100 --> 06:54:16,558
order to kind of execute on an AWS pen

7194
06:54:16,558 --> 06:54:18,600
test we'll look at your traditional pen

7195
06:54:18,600 --> 06:54:21,360
test phases but as it relates to AWS pen

7196
06:54:21,360 --> 06:54:23,638
testing and then how to scale it I will

7197
06:54:23,638 --> 06:54:26,100
be releasing a new tool here and I have

7198
06:54:26,100 --> 06:54:27,298
some other cool stuff that I just kind

7199
06:54:27,298 --> 06:54:28,320
of threw in there that I thought

7200
06:54:28,320 --> 06:54:30,240
everybody would be kind of thrilled to

7201
06:54:30,240 --> 06:54:33,058
see with all the talk around it going on

7202
06:54:33,058 --> 06:54:33,900
right now

7203
06:54:33,900 --> 06:54:36,000
so with that let's talk about the high

7204
06:54:36,000 --> 06:54:37,740
level testing overview so what are we

7205
06:54:37,740 --> 06:54:40,798
actually testing so a lot of AWS

7206
06:54:40,798 --> 06:54:43,378
customers organize their AWS accounts in

7207
06:54:43,378 --> 06:54:44,878
an organization so at the top level

7208
06:54:44,878 --> 06:54:47,160
we're looking at an organization but

7209
06:54:47,160 --> 06:54:49,080
from a pen testing perspective we may

7210
06:54:49,080 --> 06:54:50,940
not actually be looking at all of the

7211
06:54:50,940 --> 06:54:53,340
AWS accounts in there now the AWS

7212
06:54:53,340 --> 06:54:54,360
account that we're going to be testing

7213
06:54:54,360 --> 06:54:56,400
Sorry if you have an AWS background I'm

7214
06:54:56,400 --> 06:54:57,600
going to talk about some of the the

7215
06:54:57,600 --> 06:55:01,320
boring stuff but we do want to know what

7216
06:55:01,320 --> 06:55:02,760
we're testing and so sometimes this can

7217
06:55:02,760 --> 06:55:04,620
be one AWS account that's a part of an

7218
06:55:04,620 --> 06:55:06,900
organization sometimes it can be across

7219
06:55:06,900 --> 06:55:09,240
all of them but it's really going to

7220
06:55:09,240 --> 06:55:10,740
depend on the resources and what they're

7221
06:55:10,740 --> 06:55:13,200
wanting to test now each AWS account is

7222
06:55:13,200 --> 06:55:14,820
going to have resources and those

7223
06:55:14,820 --> 06:55:16,378
resources might be in different

7224
06:55:16,378 --> 06:55:18,240
locations and so we need to really

7225
06:55:18,240 --> 06:55:19,920
understand all of that now that's super

7226
06:55:19,920 --> 06:55:21,600
important information to get during your

7227
06:55:21,600 --> 06:55:23,580
scoping call we want to know how many

7228
06:55:23,580 --> 06:55:25,558
AWS accounts are we testing how many

7229
06:55:25,558 --> 06:55:27,958
resources are there total within those

7230
06:55:27,958 --> 06:55:30,958
AWS accounts and then are they in

7231
06:55:30,958 --> 06:55:32,400
different regions because if we can

7232
06:55:32,400 --> 06:55:35,218
limit the testing down to U.S east one

7233
06:55:35,218 --> 06:55:37,260
and U.S east two are just a few

7234
06:55:37,260 --> 06:55:39,298
different regions it drastically

7235
06:55:39,298 --> 06:55:41,040
decreases the amount of effort that it

7236
06:55:41,040 --> 06:55:42,900
goes into the initial Recon and then

7237
06:55:42,900 --> 06:55:45,360
also the rate limiting that AWS puts on

7238
06:55:45,360 --> 06:55:46,920
you and kind of across the board so if

7239
06:55:46,920 --> 06:55:48,840
we know where those resources are

7240
06:55:48,840 --> 06:55:51,420
and we're on a time crunch let's limit

7241
06:55:51,420 --> 06:55:54,000
the scope down to those and also it also

7242
06:55:54,000 --> 06:55:55,320
depends on the customer so sometimes

7243
06:55:55,320 --> 06:55:57,420
we've had customers where they say hey

7244
06:55:57,420 --> 06:55:59,280
we want to simulate a developer that's

7245
06:55:59,280 --> 06:56:01,378
inside of a VPC and we want to know if

7246
06:56:01,378 --> 06:56:03,298
this developer account was compromised

7247
06:56:03,298 --> 06:56:05,520
what's the impact and so that's where

7248
06:56:05,520 --> 06:56:07,200
our initial footholds start so rather

7249
06:56:07,200 --> 06:56:08,760
than what we'll talk about which is a

7250
06:56:08,760 --> 06:56:11,400
read-only in Access it might start with

7251
06:56:11,400 --> 06:56:12,840
the developer access which might only

7252
06:56:12,840 --> 06:56:15,260
have access to do certain things within

7253
06:56:15,260 --> 06:56:18,360
avpc so really getting familiar with the

7254
06:56:18,360 --> 06:56:20,218
the needs of the customer and their

7255
06:56:20,218 --> 06:56:22,080
environment is super crucial in order to

7256
06:56:22,080 --> 06:56:25,860
execute a test that's effective for them

7257
06:56:25,860 --> 06:56:28,020
and so looking at the resources so

7258
06:56:28,020 --> 06:56:29,458
resources are what we're actually

7259
06:56:29,458 --> 06:56:31,860
testing and so a lot of this could be

7260
06:56:31,860 --> 06:56:33,780
virtual server virtual machines like

7261
06:56:33,780 --> 06:56:36,298
within the ec2 environment um they come

7262
06:56:36,298 --> 06:56:37,320
in different sizes in different

7263
06:56:37,320 --> 06:56:39,420
locations it might be object storage so

7264
06:56:39,420 --> 06:56:40,978
this could be everything from you know

7265
06:56:40,978 --> 06:56:42,840
S3 storage

7266
06:56:42,840 --> 06:56:44,058
um and where those are actually

7267
06:56:44,058 --> 06:56:46,200
registered within

7268
06:56:46,200 --> 06:56:48,840
um specific like regions

7269
06:56:48,840 --> 06:56:50,400
um and then RDS so you might have a

7270
06:56:50,400 --> 06:56:51,780
typical database that's configured

7271
06:56:51,780 --> 06:56:52,860
within there and these are going to be

7272
06:56:52,860 --> 06:56:54,600
what we're actually interacting with and

7273
06:56:54,600 --> 06:56:56,160
so if you're used to like an internal

7274
06:56:56,160 --> 06:56:58,378
pen test on an internal Network it's the

7275
06:56:58,378 --> 06:57:00,120
same Concepts but we're transferring

7276
06:57:00,120 --> 06:57:01,558
that stuff to the resources that are

7277
06:57:01,558 --> 06:57:03,900
provisioned within AWS and there's

7278
06:57:03,900 --> 06:57:05,458
there's over 200 different types of

7279
06:57:05,458 --> 06:57:06,958
services and so the interesting

7280
06:57:06,958 --> 06:57:09,120
component about this is they all snap

7281
06:57:09,120 --> 06:57:10,020
together

7282
06:57:10,020 --> 06:57:12,120
and so if you wanted to spin up like an

7283
06:57:12,120 --> 06:57:15,120
RDS a database over here in a compute

7284
06:57:15,120 --> 06:57:16,500
server over here and you wanted some

7285
06:57:16,500 --> 06:57:18,120
code to run over here in the micro micro

7286
06:57:18,120 --> 06:57:20,040
service it just gives you this really

7287
06:57:20,040 --> 06:57:21,600
easy flexibility to put them together

7288
06:57:21,600 --> 06:57:23,940
and if it's done right it can be really

7289
06:57:23,940 --> 06:57:25,680
difficult to actually escalate or

7290
06:57:25,680 --> 06:57:27,660
laterally move within a within an AWS

7291
06:57:27,660 --> 06:57:30,058
account however at the same time if

7292
06:57:30,058 --> 06:57:31,978
they're not configured properly it's

7293
06:57:31,978 --> 06:57:33,958
actually has some major consequences and

7294
06:57:33,958 --> 06:57:34,920
that's what we're going to kind of look

7295
06:57:34,920 --> 06:57:37,860
at and so the idea is we're trying to

7296
06:57:37,860 --> 06:57:39,900
exploit a resource so that we can

7297
06:57:39,900 --> 06:57:41,760
interact with other resources so if

7298
06:57:41,760 --> 06:57:42,718
you're familiar with like credential

7299
06:57:42,718 --> 06:57:44,638
snowballing on like an internal Network

7300
06:57:44,638 --> 06:57:46,080
where you just you know laterally move

7301
06:57:46,080 --> 06:57:47,878
into a computer you escalate privileges

7302
06:57:47,878 --> 06:57:49,378
you dump credentials you laterally move

7303
06:57:49,378 --> 06:57:50,580
into the other computer and you just

7304
06:57:50,580 --> 06:57:51,900
kind of find your way through the

7305
06:57:51,900 --> 06:57:53,878
network or through active directory it's

7306
06:57:53,878 --> 06:57:55,978
very similar to that but you're actually

7307
06:57:55,978 --> 06:57:57,660
doing it through resources and this is

7308
06:57:57,660 --> 06:57:59,520
where the bread and butter of a pen test

7309
06:57:59,520 --> 06:58:01,138
comes together and you're actually able

7310
06:58:01,138 --> 06:58:02,520
to show kind of the misconfigurations

7311
06:58:02,520 --> 06:58:04,080
and how to exploit them

7312
06:58:04,080 --> 06:58:05,760
and so as we're talking about scoping

7313
06:58:05,760 --> 06:58:07,978
this is super important because we'll

7314
06:58:07,978 --> 06:58:09,540
get we'll get on a scoping call and

7315
06:58:09,540 --> 06:58:11,100
they'll say yeah we want to test our AWS

7316
06:58:11,100 --> 06:58:13,320
environment okay great and then we walk

7317
06:58:13,320 --> 06:58:14,760
through it and then they come back and

7318
06:58:14,760 --> 06:58:16,440
they're like oh we have 200 accounts

7319
06:58:16,440 --> 06:58:18,540
well whoa like that's like do you really

7320
06:58:18,540 --> 06:58:21,600
want to focus on all in-depth 200

7321
06:58:21,600 --> 06:58:22,620
accounts I mean that's really difficult

7322
06:58:22,620 --> 06:58:25,620
to do but a lot of companies will Silo

7323
06:58:25,620 --> 06:58:27,120
different parts of the organization into

7324
06:58:27,120 --> 06:58:29,400
a separate AWS account knowing that up

7325
06:58:29,400 --> 06:58:31,320
front super important so what I like to

7326
06:58:31,320 --> 06:58:32,940
do just for a rule of thumb this is an

7327
06:58:32,940 --> 06:58:35,580
absolute but we usually say five to ten

7328
06:58:35,580 --> 06:58:37,620
accounts we could do like a one one week

7329
06:58:37,620 --> 06:58:39,240
in-depth test in-depth meaning like

7330
06:58:39,240 --> 06:58:41,280
we'll look at all the resources and the

7331
06:58:41,280 --> 06:58:42,780
policies and the permission models at a

7332
06:58:42,780 --> 06:58:44,040
lower level

7333
06:58:44,040 --> 06:58:45,840
when you find those customers that come

7334
06:58:45,840 --> 06:58:47,878
or maybe your organization has over a

7335
06:58:47,878 --> 06:58:50,218
hundred it gets really difficult and so

7336
06:58:50,218 --> 06:58:52,138
we try to find a way to time box that

7337
06:58:52,138 --> 06:58:54,120
the best we can it is good to know how

7338
06:58:54,120 --> 06:58:55,378
many resources we're dealing with in

7339
06:58:55,378 --> 06:58:57,058
each account up front although that

7340
06:58:57,058 --> 06:58:58,320
makes it a little bit difficult because

7341
06:58:58,320 --> 06:59:00,058
sometimes it's like Auto scaling and you

7342
06:59:00,058 --> 06:59:02,218
have like one cop or you have 100 copies

7343
06:59:02,218 --> 06:59:04,558
of one resource but it makes it a little

7344
06:59:04,558 --> 06:59:06,540
bit easier and then another way with the

7345
06:59:06,540 --> 06:59:08,580
regions like I said is to reduce the

7346
06:59:08,580 --> 06:59:10,440
reconnaissance and the actual testing by

7347
06:59:10,440 --> 06:59:12,718
limiting down to the regions so knowing

7348
06:59:12,718 --> 06:59:14,878
that um and this is super important also

7349
06:59:14,878 --> 06:59:17,100
to discuss with the client on the on the

7350
06:59:17,100 --> 06:59:19,320
call on the scoping call because we want

7351
06:59:19,320 --> 06:59:20,820
to set expectations because the last

7352
06:59:20,820 --> 06:59:22,138
thing you want to do is walk into a test

7353
06:59:22,138 --> 06:59:24,120
where you have 150 accounts and you only

7354
06:59:24,120 --> 06:59:25,620
have a week to do it like that's a

7355
06:59:25,620 --> 06:59:27,240
really difficult thing we've been there

7356
06:59:27,240 --> 06:59:30,000
we've done that it's not fun the scope

7357
06:59:30,000 --> 06:59:31,978
creep big time

7358
06:59:31,978 --> 06:59:33,660
and so how do we do this how do we get

7359
06:59:33,660 --> 06:59:36,240
this this high level testing going uh

7360
06:59:36,240 --> 06:59:38,340
well we need read-only access to start

7361
06:59:38,340 --> 06:59:40,200
the testing now this is an interesting

7362
06:59:40,200 --> 06:59:41,760
way to do this because we're basically

7363
06:59:41,760 --> 06:59:43,500
just looking at the resources we can't

7364
06:59:43,500 --> 06:59:45,420
interact with them we can't execute

7365
06:59:45,420 --> 06:59:46,798
anything within them we can't create

7366
06:59:46,798 --> 06:59:49,320
them we can't delete them modify them we

7367
06:59:49,320 --> 06:59:51,298
just want a read-only and so what we do

7368
06:59:51,298 --> 06:59:53,580
is we provide a read-only minimal policy

7369
06:59:53,580 --> 06:59:55,798
that they could create and then that

7370
06:59:55,798 --> 06:59:57,840
will do what they'll do is using the im

7371
06:59:57,840 --> 06:59:59,400
or the identity and access management

7372
06:59:59,400 --> 07:00:01,860
system they could set up the access for

7373
07:00:01,860 --> 07:00:04,620
us and the resources with that read-only

7374
07:00:04,620 --> 07:00:06,840
policy and they can assign it to our

7375
07:00:06,840 --> 07:00:08,580
user or a group or their permission

7376
07:00:08,580 --> 07:00:10,138
model however their environment actually

7377
07:00:10,138 --> 07:00:11,218
is set up

7378
07:00:11,218 --> 07:00:12,900
and they're going to use policies to

7379
07:00:12,900 --> 07:00:15,000
apply those permissions to the resources

7380
07:00:15,000 --> 07:00:17,580
or the different types of resources the

7381
07:00:17,580 --> 07:00:20,820
entities that we're going to be testing

7382
07:00:20,820 --> 07:00:23,218
in the in the account and so the idea

7383
07:00:23,218 --> 07:00:25,320
behind this is also they could provision

7384
07:00:25,320 --> 07:00:27,718
our account or in theirs if they want

7385
07:00:27,718 --> 07:00:30,420
and provide us with access keys and

7386
07:00:30,420 --> 07:00:32,458
they'll use password policies and so I

7387
07:00:32,458 --> 07:00:33,840
am kind of is just your traditional

7388
07:00:33,840 --> 07:00:35,280
identity and access management system

7389
07:00:35,280 --> 07:00:37,978
but it's within AWS they have their own

7390
07:00:37,978 --> 07:00:40,200
and so it's really cool and then we'll

7391
07:00:40,200 --> 07:00:42,058
you'll notice a principle here the

7392
07:00:42,058 --> 07:00:43,798
principle is an entity within AWS so

7393
07:00:43,798 --> 07:00:45,660
this could be a user this could be a

7394
07:00:45,660 --> 07:00:47,760
role but it's a principle and so

7395
07:00:47,760 --> 07:00:49,080
different terminologies for different

7396
07:00:49,080 --> 07:00:50,580
Cloud providers I'm just specif

7397
07:00:50,580 --> 07:00:52,978
specifying the ones for AWS because as

7398
07:00:52,978 --> 07:00:55,020
we talk you'll see as we we kind of walk

7399
07:00:55,020 --> 07:00:56,400
through some of the stuff what they're

7400
07:00:56,400 --> 07:00:58,978
looking at now the idea behind policies

7401
07:00:58,978 --> 07:01:00,478
is that they're applied to these

7402
07:01:00,478 --> 07:01:02,218
resources and these policies are a lot

7403
07:01:02,218 --> 07:01:03,660
of times vulnerable

7404
07:01:03,660 --> 07:01:05,700
if they're not configured properly you

7405
07:01:05,700 --> 07:01:07,080
probably heard the all the nightmare

7406
07:01:07,080 --> 07:01:10,260
stories of S3 S open S3 bucket that was

7407
07:01:10,260 --> 07:01:12,360
compromised and you know gigas gigs of

7408
07:01:12,360 --> 07:01:13,978
data leaked to whatever well that's

7409
07:01:13,978 --> 07:01:16,138
because a policy was misconfigured that

7410
07:01:16,138 --> 07:01:18,180
allowed anybody to access that S3 bucket

7411
07:01:18,180 --> 07:01:19,860
we're going to look at those but we're

7412
07:01:19,860 --> 07:01:20,760
going to look at it from the other

7413
07:01:20,760 --> 07:01:22,920
services and I'll give an example one

7414
07:01:22,920 --> 07:01:25,080
here in a second but while we're testing

7415
07:01:25,080 --> 07:01:26,700
with this read-only access what we're

7416
07:01:26,700 --> 07:01:28,500
trying to do is we're using this

7417
07:01:28,500 --> 07:01:30,000
read-only access and we're going to see

7418
07:01:30,000 --> 07:01:31,920
what we can uncover that gives us

7419
07:01:31,920 --> 07:01:33,420
lateral movement opportunities and

7420
07:01:33,420 --> 07:01:35,400
escalation opportunities in order to

7421
07:01:35,400 --> 07:01:37,558
find ways to compromise other resources

7422
07:01:37,558 --> 07:01:39,600
or escalate our privileges and so just

7423
07:01:39,600 --> 07:01:40,920
kind of looking at just seeing an idea

7424
07:01:40,920 --> 07:01:42,240
what a policy this is what a policy

7425
07:01:42,240 --> 07:01:43,440
looks like might be a little bit

7426
07:01:43,440 --> 07:01:44,700
difficult because I use the red on black

7427
07:01:44,700 --> 07:01:46,740
sorry that's my screenshot and didn't

7428
07:01:46,740 --> 07:01:48,780
change it before I did it but the top of

7429
07:01:48,780 --> 07:01:51,540
that shows effect allow so this is all

7430
07:01:51,540 --> 07:01:53,458
it allow policy

7431
07:01:53,458 --> 07:01:56,820
the action is SNS publish so this policy

7432
07:01:56,820 --> 07:02:01,260
allows someone to publish to an SNS

7433
07:02:01,260 --> 07:02:03,420
topic now SNS is like a notification

7434
07:02:03,420 --> 07:02:05,218
system within AWS so if you wanted to

7435
07:02:05,218 --> 07:02:07,200
like kick off notifications or whatever

7436
07:02:07,200 --> 07:02:09,298
that's what this is and you'll notice

7437
07:02:09,298 --> 07:02:11,700
that the resource there is saying all

7438
07:02:11,700 --> 07:02:14,820
SNS resources and the topic itself is

7439
07:02:14,820 --> 07:02:16,378
called security notifications this is a

7440
07:02:16,378 --> 07:02:18,660
real policy and then you'll notice that

7441
07:02:18,660 --> 07:02:20,280
the principal Arn This Is How They

7442
07:02:20,280 --> 07:02:24,000
assign who has access to this with this

7443
07:02:24,000 --> 07:02:26,458
policy in order to SNS publish and it's

7444
07:02:26,458 --> 07:02:29,280
I am and it's all asterisk well so right

7445
07:02:29,280 --> 07:02:30,958
off the bat you'll notice

7446
07:02:30,958 --> 07:02:32,878
this is allowing

7447
07:02:32,878 --> 07:02:35,100
publish to the SNS topic security

7448
07:02:35,100 --> 07:02:38,340
notifications for any AWS account and so

7449
07:02:38,340 --> 07:02:40,138
while you're reviewing these policies

7450
07:02:40,138 --> 07:02:41,580
and you're seeing these this is kind of

7451
07:02:41,580 --> 07:02:43,558
what you're looking for because in these

7452
07:02:43,558 --> 07:02:45,840
types of circumstances any AWS account

7453
07:02:45,840 --> 07:02:48,058
means any even external AWS account

7454
07:02:48,058 --> 07:02:49,798
which means if you created your free

7455
07:02:49,798 --> 07:02:51,058
tier which we're going to do here in a

7456
07:02:51,058 --> 07:02:52,200
minute not going to do it but I'm going

7457
07:02:52,200 --> 07:02:54,718
to show you you have your own AWS free

7458
07:02:54,718 --> 07:02:56,940
tier account well your AWS account would

7459
07:02:56,940 --> 07:02:58,440
be able to publish to this security

7460
07:02:58,440 --> 07:03:01,740
notifications topic of that account now

7461
07:03:01,740 --> 07:03:03,478
if that account is a critical one now

7462
07:03:03,478 --> 07:03:05,040
you could do that externally and this is

7463
07:03:05,040 --> 07:03:07,260
where we start getting into the cloud is

7464
07:03:07,260 --> 07:03:09,478
dangerous environment so

7465
07:03:09,478 --> 07:03:11,340
with that being said let's look at

7466
07:03:11,340 --> 07:03:13,138
initial access provisioning so I

7467
07:03:13,138 --> 07:03:14,878
mentioned that we have to have some sort

7468
07:03:14,878 --> 07:03:17,218
of initial access in order to start well

7469
07:03:17,218 --> 07:03:19,160
Cloud being Cloud right we could just

7470
07:03:19,160 --> 07:03:21,240
generate an account and I should be able

7471
07:03:21,240 --> 07:03:22,740
to interact with AWS and that's what

7472
07:03:22,740 --> 07:03:23,638
we're going to look at first that's

7473
07:03:23,638 --> 07:03:25,860
access credentials access credentials

7474
07:03:25,860 --> 07:03:28,080
are basically I am users that they

7475
07:03:28,080 --> 07:03:30,120
generate a access key in a secret access

7476
07:03:30,120 --> 07:03:33,000
key using those I can interact with the

7477
07:03:33,000 --> 07:03:36,120
AWS API and I could use those keys in

7478
07:03:36,120 --> 07:03:37,620
order to interact with the resources

7479
07:03:37,620 --> 07:03:39,780
that are provisioned with my user in

7480
07:03:39,780 --> 07:03:42,058
that AWS account now this is kind of a

7481
07:03:42,058 --> 07:03:44,218
bad idea I I don't recommend doing this

7482
07:03:44,218 --> 07:03:45,958
when I'm on an engagement when we're

7483
07:03:45,958 --> 07:03:48,058
provisioning access a lot of times

7484
07:03:48,058 --> 07:03:50,760
customers don't even allow IM users to

7485
07:03:50,760 --> 07:03:53,040
be provisioned within their AWS account

7486
07:03:53,040 --> 07:03:55,500
so with these credentials you could also

7487
07:03:55,500 --> 07:03:57,058
access the console so you'll have the

7488
07:03:57,058 --> 07:03:59,040
account ID you'll have the email and a

7489
07:03:59,040 --> 07:04:00,120
password you can log into the web

7490
07:04:00,120 --> 07:04:02,280
console I don't usually do that either

7491
07:04:02,280 --> 07:04:04,200
you can do that if you're if you like

7492
07:04:04,200 --> 07:04:05,458
the user interface and you want to kind

7493
07:04:05,458 --> 07:04:07,680
of Click around don't recommend it but

7494
07:04:07,680 --> 07:04:10,860
um it is harder for clients to generate

7495
07:04:10,860 --> 07:04:12,420
when you get into 100 accounts right

7496
07:04:12,420 --> 07:04:14,040
because you have 100 AWS accounts you're

7497
07:04:14,040 --> 07:04:16,020
needing to generate an IM user for all

7498
07:04:16,020 --> 07:04:18,600
hundred it just makes a big mess in

7499
07:04:18,600 --> 07:04:20,820
order to start provisioning what I

7500
07:04:20,820 --> 07:04:22,200
actually recommend is the assume Rule

7501
07:04:22,200 --> 07:04:24,958
and so this assume role allows internal

7502
07:04:24,958 --> 07:04:27,900
access to an account externally so what

7503
07:04:27,900 --> 07:04:29,760
can happen is this this IM feature if

7504
07:04:29,760 --> 07:04:32,040
you're familiar with like sudo it

7505
07:04:32,040 --> 07:04:34,680
enables assuming a role with certain

7506
07:04:34,680 --> 07:04:36,780
permissions to a specific user so you

7507
07:04:36,780 --> 07:04:38,420
could do that for the cloud resources

7508
07:04:38,420 --> 07:04:40,978
it's really great for allowing like

7509
07:04:40,978 --> 07:04:42,540
external accounts like I could bring my

7510
07:04:42,540 --> 07:04:44,700
own AWS account and then all they have

7511
07:04:44,700 --> 07:04:46,740
to do is apply that policy to an assumed

7512
07:04:46,740 --> 07:04:50,340
role and then apply provide that assume

7513
07:04:50,340 --> 07:04:52,860
role policy to me and I can configure my

7514
07:04:52,860 --> 07:04:55,320
environment to use my credentials and

7515
07:04:55,320 --> 07:04:56,760
assume the role that they gave my

7516
07:04:56,760 --> 07:04:58,080
account permission to

7517
07:04:58,080 --> 07:05:00,360
and so the other Beauty behind that is I

7518
07:05:00,360 --> 07:05:02,638
could generate my own access Keys once I

7519
07:05:02,638 --> 07:05:04,440
have that assumed role and and that's

7520
07:05:04,440 --> 07:05:06,478
what we're going to do so what we'll do

7521
07:05:06,478 --> 07:05:08,340
we'll provide the minimal read-only

7522
07:05:08,340 --> 07:05:10,080
policy and then they'll apply it and

7523
07:05:10,080 --> 07:05:11,520
then they'll provide us with that that

7524
07:05:11,520 --> 07:05:14,760
role Arn that Arn is the

7525
07:05:14,760 --> 07:05:16,558
um the resource number or resource name

7526
07:05:16,558 --> 07:05:18,660
for that resource and so they'll just

7527
07:05:18,660 --> 07:05:20,580
provide it back to me and and now they

7528
07:05:20,580 --> 07:05:22,138
can apply that across all of the

7529
07:05:22,138 --> 07:05:24,900
accounts and so it makes it really easy

7530
07:05:24,900 --> 07:05:27,478
and so with that now we have to set up

7531
07:05:27,478 --> 07:05:29,100
our testing environment

7532
07:05:29,100 --> 07:05:31,920
so first install AWS CLI super important

7533
07:05:31,920 --> 07:05:33,840
this is going to be able to give you the

7534
07:05:33,840 --> 07:05:35,280
ability to configure your own

7535
07:05:35,280 --> 07:05:36,420
credentials so you're going to want to

7536
07:05:36,420 --> 07:05:38,340
bring your own credentials and you're

7537
07:05:38,340 --> 07:05:40,378
going to set up your AWS account so you

7538
07:05:40,378 --> 07:05:42,840
set up your environment with AWS CLI you

7539
07:05:42,840 --> 07:05:44,878
provision your credentials you have a

7540
07:05:44,878 --> 07:05:46,500
profile now that you can pass into the

7541
07:05:46,500 --> 07:05:49,620
AWS CLI commands and and then you can

7542
07:05:49,620 --> 07:05:52,920
add your client AWS accounts into an

7543
07:05:52,920 --> 07:05:54,660
accounts.txt we'll talk about why that's

7544
07:05:54,660 --> 07:05:57,240
important later for scaling but so just

7545
07:05:57,240 --> 07:05:59,218
imagine an accounts.txt file with a

7546
07:05:59,218 --> 07:06:00,780
bunch of account numbers that they

7547
07:06:00,780 --> 07:06:02,040
provided you that you're going to be

7548
07:06:02,040 --> 07:06:04,680
testing this is your scope and just do

7549
07:06:04,680 --> 07:06:06,540
one per line this is what I do and we'll

7550
07:06:06,540 --> 07:06:07,740
talk about with that why that is

7551
07:06:07,740 --> 07:06:09,840
important later on but your keys are

7552
07:06:09,840 --> 07:06:11,218
actually going to be configured within

7553
07:06:11,218 --> 07:06:13,138
the the hidden AWS directory in a

7554
07:06:13,138 --> 07:06:15,600
credentials file on your machine so AWS

7555
07:06:15,600 --> 07:06:18,360
configure will provide you

7556
07:06:18,360 --> 07:06:20,100
with the opportunity to set your access

7557
07:06:20,100 --> 07:06:22,138
key in your secret access key you can

7558
07:06:22,138 --> 07:06:23,878
set the region if you want I usually

7559
07:06:23,878 --> 07:06:26,638
just leave it blank with that we'll also

7560
07:06:26,638 --> 07:06:29,700
configure our AWS config file so

7561
07:06:29,700 --> 07:06:32,458
remember they provided us with that roll

7562
07:06:32,458 --> 07:06:35,458
Arn for assuming that role so we're

7563
07:06:35,458 --> 07:06:37,500
going to assume a role in that customer

7564
07:06:37,500 --> 07:06:40,200
account using our credentials so we have

7565
07:06:40,200 --> 07:06:43,320
to set that profile name in the config

7566
07:06:43,320 --> 07:06:45,900
file so we do that with the Arn for the

7567
07:06:45,900 --> 07:06:47,218
role and it just looks like this we just

7568
07:06:47,218 --> 07:06:49,260
set the profile name to that account

7569
07:06:49,260 --> 07:06:51,298
number because remember we put those

7570
07:06:51,298 --> 07:06:52,920
account numbers in that accounts.txt

7571
07:06:52,920 --> 07:06:53,820
file

7572
07:06:53,820 --> 07:06:56,400
and um and with those in there now we

7573
07:06:56,400 --> 07:06:58,320
could reference the assume role profile

7574
07:06:58,320 --> 07:07:00,600
within AWS just by passing in that same

7575
07:07:00,600 --> 07:07:03,540
account number in a few and so when we

7576
07:07:03,540 --> 07:07:05,820
reference that as the profile name

7577
07:07:05,820 --> 07:07:07,680
um we'll have the Arn which is what they

7578
07:07:07,680 --> 07:07:09,298
provide us and then we're going to set

7579
07:07:09,298 --> 07:07:11,760
our source underscore profile to our

7580
07:07:11,760 --> 07:07:13,978
profile whatever we provisioned in the

7581
07:07:13,978 --> 07:07:16,978
initial AWS configure and so what ends

7582
07:07:16,978 --> 07:07:18,600
up happening is when we pass that

7583
07:07:18,600 --> 07:07:21,478
parameter AWS CLI command with the

7584
07:07:21,478 --> 07:07:23,700
profile name in this case it's one two

7585
07:07:23,700 --> 07:07:25,080
three four five six seven eight nine one

7586
07:07:25,080 --> 07:07:27,780
two three it's going to assume that role

7587
07:07:27,780 --> 07:07:30,718
with our credentials that gives us the

7588
07:07:30,718 --> 07:07:32,760
ability to kind of peer in

7589
07:07:32,760 --> 07:07:34,680
and so with that we could test our

7590
07:07:34,680 --> 07:07:35,878
credentials because this is obviously

7591
07:07:35,878 --> 07:07:36,780
what you're going to want to do before

7592
07:07:36,780 --> 07:07:38,040
the engagement starts because you don't

7593
07:07:38,040 --> 07:07:40,378
want to lose downtime so what we'll do

7594
07:07:40,378 --> 07:07:42,780
is we'll use that assume role profile

7595
07:07:42,780 --> 07:07:45,240
and we'll just pass in the STS get

7596
07:07:45,240 --> 07:07:47,940
caller identity and we should result we

7597
07:07:47,940 --> 07:07:49,320
should have the result of the account

7598
07:07:49,320 --> 07:07:51,540
and the Arn for that customer

7599
07:07:51,540 --> 07:07:53,340
environment that's how we know that our

7600
07:07:53,340 --> 07:07:54,840
credentials are working if it comes back

7601
07:07:54,840 --> 07:07:56,040
in error then we can go back to the

7602
07:07:56,040 --> 07:07:57,958
customer and say hey that profile is not

7603
07:07:57,958 --> 07:08:00,180
working properly or this uh role Arn is

7604
07:08:00,180 --> 07:08:01,740
not working properly and they can go

7605
07:08:01,740 --> 07:08:03,420
back and kind of provision it

7606
07:08:03,420 --> 07:08:05,580
and so with that let's talk about

7607
07:08:05,580 --> 07:08:07,080
resource reconnaissance so now we have

7608
07:08:07,080 --> 07:08:08,400
our environment set up we have our

7609
07:08:08,400 --> 07:08:10,080
credentials provisioned we're good we're

7610
07:08:10,080 --> 07:08:11,458
interacting with the customer of the

7611
07:08:11,458 --> 07:08:12,840
client's environment or our environment

7612
07:08:12,840 --> 07:08:14,580
now let's talk about resource

7613
07:08:14,580 --> 07:08:16,080
reconnaissance because this is super

7614
07:08:16,080 --> 07:08:17,820
critical and really understanding what

7615
07:08:17,820 --> 07:08:20,160
we're working for so for each AWS

7616
07:08:20,160 --> 07:08:22,080
account that's being tested we need to

7617
07:08:22,080 --> 07:08:24,600
know every region that has resources and

7618
07:08:24,600 --> 07:08:26,638
retrieve all of those resources and

7619
07:08:26,638 --> 07:08:27,840
while we're at it we're going to want to

7620
07:08:27,840 --> 07:08:30,120
pull the policies because part of this

7621
07:08:30,120 --> 07:08:32,340
is looking at the policies in order to

7622
07:08:32,340 --> 07:08:33,420
do that now there's going to be two

7623
07:08:33,420 --> 07:08:35,160
different ways we can exploit without

7624
07:08:35,160 --> 07:08:36,478
having to worry about going through all

7625
07:08:36,478 --> 07:08:37,260
that

7626
07:08:37,260 --> 07:08:38,940
but it's really important to be able to

7627
07:08:38,940 --> 07:08:40,798
pull those policies because we want to

7628
07:08:40,798 --> 07:08:43,080
check for them and so I recommend using

7629
07:08:43,080 --> 07:08:45,058
the Scout suite for this scout Suite is

7630
07:08:45,058 --> 07:08:46,680
an awesome tool it supports multiple

7631
07:08:46,680 --> 07:08:48,900
Cloud providers I use it specifically

7632
07:08:48,900 --> 07:08:52,558
for AWS and Azure but on the AWS side

7633
07:08:52,558 --> 07:08:54,600
it's really powerful it has a lot of

7634
07:08:54,600 --> 07:08:58,138
scans but it does seem to be a somewhat

7635
07:08:58,138 --> 07:09:00,780
dead project as of like last year I'm

7636
07:09:00,780 --> 07:09:02,340
concern saying that I've reached out to

7637
07:09:02,340 --> 07:09:03,780
the developers trying to find it we have

7638
07:09:03,780 --> 07:09:05,280
a lot of like pull requests that's been

7639
07:09:05,280 --> 07:09:08,160
ready to go I think it's dead a lot of

7640
07:09:08,160 --> 07:09:09,958
the the main developers that were on

7641
07:09:09,958 --> 07:09:12,478
that project have since left a company

7642
07:09:12,478 --> 07:09:15,180
that supports this project and so it

7643
07:09:15,180 --> 07:09:16,920
does seem to be dead but it does still

7644
07:09:16,920 --> 07:09:18,840
very powerful for what it's trying to do

7645
07:09:18,840 --> 07:09:21,000
so don't don't let that kid you it's a

7646
07:09:21,000 --> 07:09:22,500
really good tool for what it's needing

7647
07:09:22,500 --> 07:09:24,298
to do I will be releasing a forked

7648
07:09:24,298 --> 07:09:25,860
version soon I have a lot of new

7649
07:09:25,860 --> 07:09:27,840
vulnerabilities that are that have in

7650
07:09:27,840 --> 07:09:29,820
general that we have that we haven't

7651
07:09:29,820 --> 07:09:31,260
rolled out publicly yet but we will be

7652
07:09:31,260 --> 07:09:32,340
looking at that

7653
07:09:32,340 --> 07:09:34,260
I'm not gonna be doing it today but it

7654
07:09:34,260 --> 07:09:35,458
will be coming soon so just kind of keep

7655
07:09:35,458 --> 07:09:36,540
an eye out there I'm not sure if we're

7656
07:09:36,540 --> 07:09:37,558
going to keep it the same name or not

7657
07:09:37,558 --> 07:09:38,878
but we'll see

7658
07:09:38,878 --> 07:09:41,218
um but Scout Suite so it does generate a

7659
07:09:41,218 --> 07:09:43,620
amazing report that report has a

7660
07:09:43,620 --> 07:09:45,058
dashboard with all the details you could

7661
07:09:45,058 --> 07:09:47,218
drill into the different Services it'll

7662
07:09:47,218 --> 07:09:48,660
show you the policies where the

7663
07:09:48,660 --> 07:09:50,340
vulnerabilities within the policies are

7664
07:09:50,340 --> 07:09:52,798
if it found them so it's really powerful

7665
07:09:52,798 --> 07:09:54,360
for being able to quickly identify

7666
07:09:54,360 --> 07:09:57,180
potential issues it does like I said

7667
07:09:57,180 --> 07:09:59,340
support other Cloud providers but

7668
07:09:59,340 --> 07:10:01,200
for the most part AWS is probably the

7669
07:10:01,200 --> 07:10:03,120
one of the higher supported ones or at

7670
07:10:03,120 --> 07:10:04,860
least at the time another tool that I

7671
07:10:04,860 --> 07:10:08,218
like to use is AWS AWS list all and so

7672
07:10:08,218 --> 07:10:10,080
with credentials it will enumerate

7673
07:10:10,080 --> 07:10:12,240
everything everywhere really powerful

7674
07:10:12,240 --> 07:10:13,680
for quickly identifying where those

7675
07:10:13,680 --> 07:10:15,660
resources are at and what you might have

7676
07:10:15,660 --> 07:10:17,218
for an attack path now it doesn't

7677
07:10:17,218 --> 07:10:19,260
Discover anything bad but it gives you a

7678
07:10:19,260 --> 07:10:20,700
lay of the land and if you do any sort

7679
07:10:20,700 --> 07:10:23,458
of pen testing you know Discovery is one

7680
07:10:23,458 --> 07:10:24,780
of the most critical Parts if you don't

7681
07:10:24,780 --> 07:10:26,160
know your attack surface you're not

7682
07:10:26,160 --> 07:10:27,058
really going to be able to find a

7683
07:10:27,058 --> 07:10:29,160
vulnerable attack path and so this will

7684
07:10:29,160 --> 07:10:30,600
take a little bit of time it does

7685
07:10:30,600 --> 07:10:32,540
exhaust rate limits but it's super quick

7686
07:10:32,540 --> 07:10:34,920
for enumerating pretty much all services

7687
07:10:34,920 --> 07:10:37,500
in all regions and so highly recommend

7688
07:10:37,500 --> 07:10:38,340
that

7689
07:10:38,340 --> 07:10:39,840
and so let's talk about vulnerabilities

7690
07:10:39,840 --> 07:10:41,940
and exploitation now so one of the first

7691
07:10:41,940 --> 07:10:43,020
things that we're going to want to do is

7692
07:10:43,020 --> 07:10:45,600
analyze the Scout Suite results so as

7693
07:10:45,600 --> 07:10:47,280
we're stepping through that we want to

7694
07:10:47,280 --> 07:10:48,780
be careful here because there's a lot of

7695
07:10:48,780 --> 07:10:50,458
false positives these policies can get

7696
07:10:50,458 --> 07:10:52,558
really complicated really quick it does

7697
07:10:52,558 --> 07:10:54,298
a really good job at trying to find

7698
07:10:54,298 --> 07:10:56,280
where those vulnerabilities are within

7699
07:10:56,280 --> 07:10:58,558
the policies that it knows about but

7700
07:10:58,558 --> 07:11:00,600
they can get complex so what I would say

7701
07:11:00,600 --> 07:11:03,180
is once you use this I use this as like

7702
07:11:03,180 --> 07:11:04,798
a Looking Glass and then I jump straight

7703
07:11:04,798 --> 07:11:08,160
to AWS CLI and I'll use the AWS API to

7704
07:11:08,160 --> 07:11:09,958
kind of retrieve and interact and try to

7705
07:11:09,958 --> 07:11:11,878
exploit because that's the goal this

7706
07:11:11,878 --> 07:11:13,138
we're not vulnerability scanning here

7707
07:11:13,138 --> 07:11:15,058
we're literally trying to exploit

7708
07:11:15,058 --> 07:11:16,500
resources so we need to do that we need

7709
07:11:16,500 --> 07:11:18,540
to demonstrate it just giving them a

7710
07:11:18,540 --> 07:11:19,798
vulnerability report and saying you did

7711
07:11:19,798 --> 07:11:21,540
a pen test it's not going to fly you

7712
07:11:21,540 --> 07:11:24,360
want to absolutely show that this is

7713
07:11:24,360 --> 07:11:26,520
exploitable this is the risk of the

7714
07:11:26,520 --> 07:11:28,260
organization and be able to convey that

7715
07:11:28,260 --> 07:11:30,780
by demonstrating it with a pen test

7716
07:11:30,780 --> 07:11:33,058
and so the cool thing with Scout Suite

7717
07:11:33,058 --> 07:11:34,978
is the results file is a j as a

7718
07:11:34,978 --> 07:11:36,660
Javascript file because they have like

7719
07:11:36,660 --> 07:11:39,360
that web report interface but in there

7720
07:11:39,360 --> 07:11:42,000
is a huge Json blob that Json blob has

7721
07:11:42,000 --> 07:11:43,740
pretty much all the details of that scan

7722
07:11:43,740 --> 07:11:45,120
so it's really cool to just quickly find

7723
07:11:45,120 --> 07:11:48,240
it and parse it if you do dig into the

7724
07:11:48,240 --> 07:11:49,620
the user interface you can click down

7725
07:11:49,620 --> 07:11:50,760
it'll give you a little bit of a

7726
07:11:50,760 --> 07:11:53,340
description on what the issue is how

7727
07:11:53,340 --> 07:11:54,540
many different statements were checked

7728
07:11:54,540 --> 07:11:55,860
and which ones were vulnerable and you

7729
07:11:55,860 --> 07:11:57,298
could dig into those and it'll drill

7730
07:11:57,298 --> 07:11:59,760
down and show you why it thinks it's a

7731
07:11:59,760 --> 07:12:01,500
pretty bad pretty bad deal

7732
07:12:01,500 --> 07:12:02,820
and so there's different categories

7733
07:12:02,820 --> 07:12:04,860
there's like danger there's like a

7734
07:12:04,860 --> 07:12:06,000
warning and then there's just like

7735
07:12:06,000 --> 07:12:07,378
informational

7736
07:12:07,378 --> 07:12:08,940
um and then the other thing like I said

7737
07:12:08,940 --> 07:12:10,440
you could analyze this or you could just

7738
07:12:10,440 --> 07:12:12,298
kind of go straight for you know YOLO

7739
07:12:12,298 --> 07:12:14,760
and Brute Force this is actually not

7740
07:12:14,760 --> 07:12:17,340
that bad for some of the resources

7741
07:12:17,340 --> 07:12:20,160
so I use this at times what I'll do is

7742
07:12:20,160 --> 07:12:22,080
I'll just retrieve all the resources and

7743
07:12:22,080 --> 07:12:23,638
just try to send a message I mean what's

7744
07:12:23,638 --> 07:12:25,378
it going to say no so if it says yes

7745
07:12:25,378 --> 07:12:27,958
then we know it's vulnerable right so

7746
07:12:27,958 --> 07:12:30,180
um what we'll do is we'll retrieve the

7747
07:12:30,180 --> 07:12:31,680
Arn and just try to publish a message

7748
07:12:31,680 --> 07:12:33,900
this is just an example for being able

7749
07:12:33,900 --> 07:12:36,540
to publish a message to an SNS topic and

7750
07:12:36,540 --> 07:12:38,340
so for each region in this case I'm just

7751
07:12:38,340 --> 07:12:41,340
using two and this is a super you know

7752
07:12:41,340 --> 07:12:42,478
it gets complicated these these

7753
07:12:42,478 --> 07:12:45,240
one-liners get complicated but I don't

7754
07:12:45,240 --> 07:12:46,558
have to be smart in order to put these

7755
07:12:46,558 --> 07:12:47,580
one-liners together because everybody

7756
07:12:47,580 --> 07:12:51,420
knows chat GPT is like amazing and so

7757
07:12:51,420 --> 07:12:54,900
that's what I do uh I go to chat GPT and

7758
07:12:54,900 --> 07:12:57,240
I just say you know write a Linux

7759
07:12:57,240 --> 07:12:59,280
one-liner that generates an AWS CLI

7760
07:12:59,280 --> 07:13:01,920
command for retrieving ec2 user data in

7761
07:13:01,920 --> 07:13:04,440
these regions base64 the decode the

7762
07:13:04,440 --> 07:13:06,900
value of the user data value and search

7763
07:13:06,900 --> 07:13:08,280
the contents for the word password and

7764
07:13:08,280 --> 07:13:09,600
believe it or not it gives you this nice

7765
07:13:09,600 --> 07:13:11,340
beautiful one-liner you just copy you

7766
07:13:11,340 --> 07:13:13,378
paste it and you go and it's going to go

7767
07:13:13,378 --> 07:13:14,520
there it's going to pull all the user

7768
07:13:14,520 --> 07:13:16,620
data it's got a base64 decode it and

7769
07:13:16,620 --> 07:13:18,600
look for password

7770
07:13:18,600 --> 07:13:21,000
um and so you you obviously want to be

7771
07:13:21,000 --> 07:13:22,500
careful there's other things you can do

7772
07:13:22,500 --> 07:13:24,420
too you could take the actual policy if

7773
07:13:24,420 --> 07:13:26,100
anybody has seen I put some stuff on

7774
07:13:26,100 --> 07:13:27,540
Twitter recently you could literally

7775
07:13:27,540 --> 07:13:30,840
take a AWS policy and obviously you want

7776
07:13:30,840 --> 07:13:32,400
to redact the user ID or the account

7777
07:13:32,400 --> 07:13:33,900
numbers and any of this you know

7778
07:13:33,900 --> 07:13:35,340
self-identifying information about that

7779
07:13:35,340 --> 07:13:37,440
AWS account but you can send it to chat

7780
07:13:37,440 --> 07:13:39,180
GPT and say hey is this policy

7781
07:13:39,180 --> 07:13:40,920
vulnerable and it'll it'll just

7782
07:13:40,920 --> 07:13:42,780
completely reverse the policy down to

7783
07:13:42,780 --> 07:13:44,218
the nitty gritty and it'll say yes if

7784
07:13:44,218 --> 07:13:46,020
you use this and exploit this it's

7785
07:13:46,020 --> 07:13:47,218
vulnerable

7786
07:13:47,218 --> 07:13:49,378
um and it's it's it's amazingly smart

7787
07:13:49,378 --> 07:13:51,780
I've found real real policies that were

7788
07:13:51,780 --> 07:13:54,000
vulnerable during a pen test redacted

7789
07:13:54,000 --> 07:13:55,860
all of the stuff out of there verified

7790
07:13:55,860 --> 07:13:57,240
that it was vulnerable and it came back

7791
07:13:57,240 --> 07:13:59,280
it's just really cool

7792
07:13:59,280 --> 07:14:00,660
so the first thing that I just kind of

7793
07:14:00,660 --> 07:14:01,558
wanted to throw out there this is just

7794
07:14:01,558 --> 07:14:03,360
kind of like a silly one but it's

7795
07:14:03,360 --> 07:14:06,298
actually kind of fun is cloud GPT so I

7796
07:14:06,298 --> 07:14:07,740
put this together there's a link at the

7797
07:14:07,740 --> 07:14:11,340
bottom darkoptics.com cloudgpt you take

7798
07:14:11,340 --> 07:14:13,860
chat GPT and the python bono3 library

7799
07:14:13,860 --> 07:14:17,040
and you YOLO it you basically pull all

7800
07:14:17,040 --> 07:14:19,378
of your account policies I only did this

7801
07:14:19,378 --> 07:14:21,240
on my own so no customer data was

7802
07:14:21,240 --> 07:14:23,760
released but it does work it pulls all

7803
07:14:23,760 --> 07:14:25,920
of the policies it sends it the chat GPT

7804
07:14:25,920 --> 07:14:29,458
using the open API or the open API

7805
07:14:29,458 --> 07:14:32,700
um open AI API say that 10 times fast

7806
07:14:32,700 --> 07:14:35,340
and then it sends the policy in and then

7807
07:14:35,340 --> 07:14:37,020
it gets the response back and it's just

7808
07:14:37,020 --> 07:14:38,280
a little script it doesn't it's not a

7809
07:14:38,280 --> 07:14:39,900
full-blown tool although I started

7810
07:14:39,900 --> 07:14:41,580
building a tool I'll try to release some

7811
07:14:41,580 --> 07:14:43,558
more permanent you know project a little

7812
07:14:43,558 --> 07:14:45,478
bit later on but it's super cool it'll

7813
07:14:45,478 --> 07:14:46,320
kind of kick back all the

7814
07:14:46,320 --> 07:14:48,298
vulnerabilities for all the policies in

7815
07:14:48,298 --> 07:14:50,100
your environment and so I just kind of

7816
07:14:50,100 --> 07:14:51,058
threw it on there it's just kind of a

7817
07:14:51,058 --> 07:14:52,260
joke but it actually does work pretty

7818
07:14:52,260 --> 07:14:53,218
good

7819
07:14:53,218 --> 07:14:55,920
for what it is the next thing we want to

7820
07:14:55,920 --> 07:14:57,478
look for is more attack surface remember

7821
07:14:57,478 --> 07:14:59,520
we're looking we want to exploit the

7822
07:14:59,520 --> 07:15:00,780
environment we want to know kill chains

7823
07:15:00,780 --> 07:15:02,100
but we can't do that without knowing the

7824
07:15:02,100 --> 07:15:05,100
attack service so I recommend exporting

7825
07:15:05,100 --> 07:15:08,580
all publicly accessible IP addresses and

7826
07:15:08,580 --> 07:15:10,440
host names so you want to look at

7827
07:15:10,440 --> 07:15:12,180
elastic IP addresses that are configured

7828
07:15:12,180 --> 07:15:14,400
you want to pull ec2 public IP addresses

7829
07:15:14,400 --> 07:15:18,058
and the the elb DNS names for the load

7830
07:15:18,058 --> 07:15:20,400
balancers the the database endpoint

7831
07:15:20,400 --> 07:15:22,280
addresses you want to pull API Gateway

7832
07:15:22,280 --> 07:15:25,080
rest apis

7833
07:15:25,080 --> 07:15:26,878
um any of the Beanstalk endpoint URLs

7834
07:15:26,878 --> 07:15:28,620
and you pull all of those down and then

7835
07:15:28,620 --> 07:15:29,878
the cool thing is you could just treat

7836
07:15:29,878 --> 07:15:32,280
that infrastructure as an external pen

7837
07:15:32,280 --> 07:15:33,718
test right because now we're that's all

7838
07:15:33,718 --> 07:15:35,218
we're doing we're looking at what web

7839
07:15:35,218 --> 07:15:36,900
applications are running out there I

7840
07:15:36,900 --> 07:15:38,400
mean I found the craziest stuff like

7841
07:15:38,400 --> 07:15:40,620
wide open graphql databases with no

7842
07:15:40,620 --> 07:15:42,718
front I mean no no authentication just

7843
07:15:42,718 --> 07:15:44,400
by doing this like it would have been a

7844
07:15:44,400 --> 07:15:45,718
tax surface that I probably would have

7845
07:15:45,718 --> 07:15:48,360
overlooked had I only stayed focused in

7846
07:15:48,360 --> 07:15:50,760
the AWS resources but moving to an

7847
07:15:50,760 --> 07:15:52,080
external you just treat it as a normal

7848
07:15:52,080 --> 07:15:54,600
external you do a port scan you you know

7849
07:15:54,600 --> 07:15:56,100
you screenshot using go witness or

7850
07:15:56,100 --> 07:15:57,360
whatever you want to do you could fuzz

7851
07:15:57,360 --> 07:15:59,280
and do your dirtbuster

7852
07:15:59,280 --> 07:16:01,378
um or just if you find web applications

7853
07:16:01,378 --> 07:16:03,718
if you find web applications it's super

7854
07:16:03,718 --> 07:16:06,420
critical to look for vulnerabilities

7855
07:16:06,420 --> 07:16:08,280
within that web app if that web app is

7856
07:16:08,280 --> 07:16:10,558
hosted within an ec2 instance we'll talk

7857
07:16:10,558 --> 07:16:11,940
about why that's bad here in a little

7858
07:16:11,940 --> 07:16:13,320
bit

7859
07:16:13,320 --> 07:16:14,580
um but the other thing you could do too

7860
07:16:14,580 --> 07:16:16,200
and this is something that I haven't

7861
07:16:16,200 --> 07:16:18,180
really disclosed publicly but it's not

7862
07:16:18,180 --> 07:16:20,340
that it's not known you could Brute

7863
07:16:20,340 --> 07:16:22,978
Force I am users within AWS there is no

7864
07:16:22,978 --> 07:16:24,958
lockout policy like I'm talking about

7865
07:16:24,958 --> 07:16:26,638
like old school Brute Force password not

7866
07:16:26,638 --> 07:16:27,900
like password spraying but like I'm

7867
07:16:27,900 --> 07:16:29,040
going to try a million passwords against

7868
07:16:29,040 --> 07:16:30,840
this user um and there's no lockout

7869
07:16:30,840 --> 07:16:32,760
policy and so it's just it does it

7870
07:16:32,760 --> 07:16:34,740
boggles my mind I have no clue why um

7871
07:16:34,740 --> 07:16:36,000
and you can't even configure one like

7872
07:16:36,000 --> 07:16:37,798
even if you wanted to configure one the

7873
07:16:37,798 --> 07:16:38,820
only way you could do it is like if you

7874
07:16:38,820 --> 07:16:40,260
switch to like some sort of external

7875
07:16:40,260 --> 07:16:42,600
identity provider or something for your

7876
07:16:42,600 --> 07:16:44,638
accounts but if you don't do that like

7877
07:16:44,638 --> 07:16:46,860
and you're relying on IM users it's

7878
07:16:46,860 --> 07:16:49,680
dangerous there is a way you could

7879
07:16:49,680 --> 07:16:52,138
generate credential reports within AWS

7880
07:16:52,138 --> 07:16:54,240
and then I'll show you if there's MFA

7881
07:16:54,240 --> 07:16:56,100
enabled on that user the other thing I

7882
07:16:56,100 --> 07:16:57,718
wanted to kind of throw out there

7883
07:16:57,718 --> 07:17:01,020
AWS before November 2020 had no default

7884
07:17:01,020 --> 07:17:02,638
password policy which means you could

7885
07:17:02,638 --> 07:17:04,978
literally set a password as a like the

7886
07:17:04,978 --> 07:17:07,020
minimal character and there was no

7887
07:17:07,020 --> 07:17:08,280
password policy so if you pull that

7888
07:17:08,280 --> 07:17:10,020
credential report you could look at when

7889
07:17:10,020 --> 07:17:11,638
that user was created you could look at

7890
07:17:11,638 --> 07:17:13,260
their last password change date and

7891
07:17:13,260 --> 07:17:15,058
determine whether it's before I think

7892
07:17:15,058 --> 07:17:17,760
it's like November 20th 2020

7893
07:17:17,760 --> 07:17:21,120
um and uh and if those users don't have

7894
07:17:21,120 --> 07:17:24,058
a date that's set after that they could

7895
07:17:24,058 --> 07:17:25,558
be vulnerable to a weak password you

7896
07:17:25,558 --> 07:17:27,298
could just pretty much brute force them

7897
07:17:27,298 --> 07:17:28,978
um and all you have to do is just I'm

7898
07:17:28,978 --> 07:17:30,780
basically right here on this screen I'm

7899
07:17:30,780 --> 07:17:31,978
just I'm

7900
07:17:31,978 --> 07:17:35,120
password brute forcing the web console

7901
07:17:35,120 --> 07:17:37,920
authentication URL there is something

7902
07:17:37,920 --> 07:17:39,058
really cool that I was doing before

7903
07:17:39,058 --> 07:17:40,860
using API Gateway if you're familiar

7904
07:17:40,860 --> 07:17:42,718
with API Gateway I released I released

7905
07:17:42,718 --> 07:17:44,580
it to a while back called fire procs and

7906
07:17:44,580 --> 07:17:46,740
fireprox will spin up a API Gateway and

7907
07:17:46,740 --> 07:17:48,600
it'll rotate your IP address with every

7908
07:17:48,600 --> 07:17:50,760
single request so you get a new one and

7909
07:17:50,760 --> 07:17:53,180
so you could literally Point your API

7910
07:17:53,180 --> 07:17:56,820
Gateway IP or host to Amazon and have

7911
07:17:56,820 --> 07:17:58,500
Amazon punch its own itself in the

7912
07:17:58,500 --> 07:18:00,900
throat and Brute Force passwords using

7913
07:18:00,900 --> 07:18:02,340
API Gateway so they can't lock out

7914
07:18:02,340 --> 07:18:04,920
either if they wanted to kind of prevent

7915
07:18:04,920 --> 07:18:07,500
anything so it's just crazy

7916
07:18:07,500 --> 07:18:09,000
um there's another thing with the IM

7917
07:18:09,000 --> 07:18:10,860
users that um that there's a timing

7918
07:18:10,860 --> 07:18:12,780
attack so you could enumerate users I

7919
07:18:12,780 --> 07:18:13,920
don't have a slide in here but you could

7920
07:18:13,920 --> 07:18:16,740
literally enumerate users within um I am

7921
07:18:16,740 --> 07:18:19,620
by looking at the the time on valid

7922
07:18:19,620 --> 07:18:21,780
users it comes back a little bit slower

7923
07:18:21,780 --> 07:18:24,958
um and on um on on bad users it takes a

7924
07:18:24,958 --> 07:18:26,340
little bit longer or vice versa one of

7925
07:18:26,340 --> 07:18:27,240
the two but anyway you could look at the

7926
07:18:27,240 --> 07:18:29,638
timing in a literally a numerator

7927
07:18:29,638 --> 07:18:31,500
and so let's look at lateral movement

7928
07:18:31,500 --> 07:18:33,780
and privilege escalation so the idea

7929
07:18:33,780 --> 07:18:34,978
behind here is we're looking for

7930
07:18:34,978 --> 07:18:36,420
permission to snowball we talked about

7931
07:18:36,420 --> 07:18:38,040
credential snowball a little bit we're

7932
07:18:38,040 --> 07:18:39,540
looking for permission snowball I don't

7933
07:18:39,540 --> 07:18:40,860
know if it's a real term I just threw it

7934
07:18:40,860 --> 07:18:42,180
in here because it sounded like it was

7935
07:18:42,180 --> 07:18:43,620
like something that we would call this

7936
07:18:43,620 --> 07:18:45,600
but what we're doing is we're trying to

7937
07:18:45,600 --> 07:18:48,540
find assumable roles or credentials with

7938
07:18:48,540 --> 07:18:50,340
different permissions our goal is to go

7939
07:18:50,340 --> 07:18:52,558
from one resource to another resource

7940
07:18:52,558 --> 07:18:54,298
that might be able to do it right my

7941
07:18:54,298 --> 07:18:56,638
user might only be able to call ec2

7942
07:18:56,638 --> 07:18:59,280
but if I could pass a role to ec2 when

7943
07:18:59,280 --> 07:19:01,200
I'm calling it and I can get ec2 to

7944
07:19:01,200 --> 07:19:02,160
execute something with different

7945
07:19:02,160 --> 07:19:04,320
permissions I can leverage that ec2

7946
07:19:04,320 --> 07:19:05,940
permission model to do something

7947
07:19:05,940 --> 07:19:07,798
nefarious on another resource and

7948
07:19:07,798 --> 07:19:09,718
potentially give me escalation and so

7949
07:19:09,718 --> 07:19:10,740
that's kind of what we're doing here we

7950
07:19:10,740 --> 07:19:12,120
want to leverage services and kind of

7951
07:19:12,120 --> 07:19:14,160
pivot around between Services we're

7952
07:19:14,160 --> 07:19:15,718
going to unravel these roles and these

7953
07:19:15,718 --> 07:19:18,240
policies and try to interact with them

7954
07:19:18,240 --> 07:19:20,218
another thing too to look for is code

7955
07:19:20,218 --> 07:19:23,340
and repos obviously repo commits if they

7956
07:19:23,340 --> 07:19:24,958
haven't been rolled they might have

7957
07:19:24,958 --> 07:19:26,580
credentials if they kind of reverse it

7958
07:19:26,580 --> 07:19:28,620
out and so anywhere we can get

7959
07:19:28,620 --> 07:19:30,718
permissions within an environment within

7960
07:19:30,718 --> 07:19:33,240
AWS that gives us more access is what

7961
07:19:33,240 --> 07:19:35,100
we're looking for and so sometimes you

7962
07:19:35,100 --> 07:19:36,780
could leverage these external AWS

7963
07:19:36,780 --> 07:19:38,520
accounts like I said we could bring our

7964
07:19:38,520 --> 07:19:39,958
own and just leverage our own accounts

7965
07:19:39,958 --> 07:19:42,000
in order to execute it sometimes we need

7966
07:19:42,000 --> 07:19:43,920
to leverage internal roles or internal

7967
07:19:43,920 --> 07:19:45,660
credentials in order to do that

7968
07:19:45,660 --> 07:19:47,458
sometimes you don't even need

7969
07:19:47,458 --> 07:19:49,020
credentials you could pass in the no

7970
07:19:49,020 --> 07:19:51,240
sign request and literally if it doesn't

7971
07:19:51,240 --> 07:19:52,978
require it it just doesn't it just just

7972
07:19:52,978 --> 07:19:55,558
goes it gets kind of complicated if

7973
07:19:55,558 --> 07:19:56,760
you're trying to like organize attack

7974
07:19:56,760 --> 07:19:58,500
pass you kind of just go with your gut

7975
07:19:58,500 --> 07:20:01,440
and just just be tenacious with it

7976
07:20:01,440 --> 07:20:03,600
uh still really early in the AWS pen

7977
07:20:03,600 --> 07:20:06,600
testing you know scene for the most part

7978
07:20:06,600 --> 07:20:08,520
so third-party services this is like the

7979
07:20:08,520 --> 07:20:10,020
this is what I love this is like what I

7980
07:20:10,020 --> 07:20:12,478
gravitate towards so I'm looking for API

7981
07:20:12,478 --> 07:20:14,100
keys I'm looking for tokens I'm looking

7982
07:20:14,100 --> 07:20:15,478
for credentials I'm looking for whatever

7983
07:20:15,478 --> 07:20:18,180
I can within resources now even from a

7984
07:20:18,180 --> 07:20:21,058
read-only perspective ec2 has this user

7985
07:20:21,058 --> 07:20:23,340
data flag that user data flag is a

7986
07:20:23,340 --> 07:20:25,020
script that's basically for encoded that

7987
07:20:25,020 --> 07:20:27,058
you could issue whenever that ec2

7988
07:20:27,058 --> 07:20:28,798
virtual machine gets provisioned and

7989
07:20:28,798 --> 07:20:31,138
it'll execute that script but those

7990
07:20:31,138 --> 07:20:32,820
scripts a lot of times have credentials

7991
07:20:32,820 --> 07:20:34,138
hard-coded in them because they're

7992
07:20:34,138 --> 07:20:36,840
trying to use the same script across you

7993
07:20:36,840 --> 07:20:38,820
know lots of different resources and a

7994
07:20:38,820 --> 07:20:39,900
lot of times they're needing to say hey

7995
07:20:39,900 --> 07:20:42,540
I want to use this API to phone home to

7996
07:20:42,540 --> 07:20:44,580
over here or use these credentials to

7997
07:20:44,580 --> 07:20:46,260
log into the database over here

7998
07:20:46,260 --> 07:20:48,420
you pull that user data and you base64

7999
07:20:48,420 --> 07:20:50,100
decode it you will find credentials

8000
07:20:50,100 --> 07:20:52,440
almost every time obviously depending on

8001
07:20:52,440 --> 07:20:54,478
the engagement another really good one

8002
07:20:54,478 --> 07:20:56,340
is the Lambda environment variable so

8003
07:20:56,340 --> 07:20:57,718
Lambda if you're familiar with Lambda

8004
07:20:57,718 --> 07:20:59,700
it's serverless compute so you can take

8005
07:20:59,700 --> 07:21:01,378
your python python code and just throw

8006
07:21:01,378 --> 07:21:03,360
it in Amazon and they'll run the code

8007
07:21:03,360 --> 07:21:04,558
for you you don't have to spin up a

8008
07:21:04,558 --> 07:21:05,700
virtual machine or anything it's just

8009
07:21:05,700 --> 07:21:08,280
serverless microservice compute but a

8010
07:21:08,280 --> 07:21:09,478
lot of times you what they'll do is

8011
07:21:09,478 --> 07:21:11,100
they'll provision environment variables

8012
07:21:11,100 --> 07:21:12,900
that that python code needs to retrieve

8013
07:21:12,900 --> 07:21:14,940
from for sensitive data for credentials

8014
07:21:14,940 --> 07:21:17,040
for API Keys everybody says oh well

8015
07:21:17,040 --> 07:21:19,138
environment variables are safe right

8016
07:21:19,138 --> 07:21:20,760
they're always safe like we hear it all

8017
07:21:20,760 --> 07:21:22,200
the time we write it up in a report and

8018
07:21:22,200 --> 07:21:24,120
say hey environment variables had

8019
07:21:24,120 --> 07:21:25,920
credentials and they're like well where

8020
07:21:25,920 --> 07:21:27,180
am I supposed to provision them like

8021
07:21:27,180 --> 07:21:28,740
well in a credential manager I don't

8022
07:21:28,740 --> 07:21:31,500
know but environment variables is where

8023
07:21:31,500 --> 07:21:33,120
they're at you pull them you pull access

8024
07:21:33,120 --> 07:21:34,740
keys and there you go

8025
07:21:34,740 --> 07:21:37,378
uh cloud formation stock parameters so

8026
07:21:37,378 --> 07:21:39,058
cloud formation gives you the ability to

8027
07:21:39,058 --> 07:21:41,400
roll out a technology stack within AWS

8028
07:21:41,400 --> 07:21:43,320
with a bunch of provisioned resources

8029
07:21:43,320 --> 07:21:45,180
there's stack parameters that you could

8030
07:21:45,180 --> 07:21:46,620
actually apply in there so if you look

8031
07:21:46,620 --> 07:21:48,420
at those you'll find potentially plain

8032
07:21:48,420 --> 07:21:50,040
text credentials and the same thing with

8033
07:21:50,040 --> 07:21:51,900
code build is like Lambda code build is

8034
07:21:51,900 --> 07:21:53,458
another environment

8035
07:21:53,458 --> 07:21:55,200
um where there's variables that can be

8036
07:21:55,200 --> 07:21:57,120
used for the build processes of of code

8037
07:21:57,120 --> 07:21:59,280
build and then there's this thing called

8038
07:21:59,280 --> 07:22:01,500
SSM parameter store

8039
07:22:01,500 --> 07:22:04,200
SSM is like the systems manager

8040
07:22:04,200 --> 07:22:06,240
there's a secret data type in there

8041
07:22:06,240 --> 07:22:07,680
where it's called like secret I think

8042
07:22:07,680 --> 07:22:10,798
it's secure string or secret string the

8043
07:22:10,798 --> 07:22:13,378
or secure string secure string is where

8044
07:22:13,378 --> 07:22:15,360
you should use credentials if you're

8045
07:22:15,360 --> 07:22:16,798
trying to provision them within systems

8046
07:22:16,798 --> 07:22:18,660
manager but a lot of times people don't

8047
07:22:18,660 --> 07:22:19,920
go through that effort and they use

8048
07:22:19,920 --> 07:22:21,900
standard strings which means if you just

8049
07:22:21,900 --> 07:22:23,458
query the SSM you could read it from a

8050
07:22:23,458 --> 07:22:25,440
read-only perspective now you're going

8051
07:22:25,440 --> 07:22:27,420
to find AWS Keys resource credentials

8052
07:22:27,420 --> 07:22:28,500
you're going to find a lot of stuff in

8053
07:22:28,500 --> 07:22:30,478
here don't get overwhelmed you really

8054
07:22:30,478 --> 07:22:32,340
want to slow down because you'll find a

8055
07:22:32,340 --> 07:22:33,840
lot of times you'll find like 10

8056
07:22:33,840 --> 07:22:35,218
different copies of the same credentials

8057
07:22:35,218 --> 07:22:37,080
and you want to slow down you want to

8058
07:22:37,080 --> 07:22:39,360
really focus on trying to identify what

8059
07:22:39,360 --> 07:22:41,280
do these credentials go to because a lot

8060
07:22:41,280 --> 07:22:42,360
of times you're just looking at a key

8061
07:22:42,360 --> 07:22:44,040
value pair and so you want to kind of

8062
07:22:44,040 --> 07:22:45,360
differentiate well what does this key

8063
07:22:45,360 --> 07:22:47,400
mean what does this go to I mean I found

8064
07:22:47,400 --> 07:22:50,340
everything datadog send grid GitHub

8065
07:22:50,340 --> 07:22:54,420
Docker I've actually compromised a

8066
07:22:54,420 --> 07:22:57,000
SharePoint Administration account using

8067
07:22:57,000 --> 07:22:58,920
this so I was able to Pivot into another

8068
07:22:58,920 --> 07:23:00,840
cloud provider that they had all because

8069
07:23:00,840 --> 07:23:02,878
the credentials were in there there was

8070
07:23:02,878 --> 07:23:04,138
one there was a there was a techno

8071
07:23:04,138 --> 07:23:05,878
technology company that relied on

8072
07:23:05,878 --> 07:23:07,680
handheld devices mobile devices to run

8073
07:23:07,680 --> 07:23:09,840
their entire business across all of

8074
07:23:09,840 --> 07:23:11,878
their subsidiaries it was I can't give

8075
07:23:11,878 --> 07:23:13,138
the details but

8076
07:23:13,138 --> 07:23:15,958
their mobile platform I was able to

8077
07:23:15,958 --> 07:23:17,280
Leverage The credentials to log into

8078
07:23:17,280 --> 07:23:19,100
their Mobi control

8079
07:23:19,100 --> 07:23:21,240
device platform and I could push

8080
07:23:21,240 --> 07:23:22,620
firmware updates I could push app

8081
07:23:22,620 --> 07:23:24,360
updates I could do whatever I wanted I

8082
07:23:24,360 --> 07:23:25,620
had complete control over their whole

8083
07:23:25,620 --> 07:23:27,718
mobile Fleet all because I was able to

8084
07:23:27,718 --> 07:23:29,160
slow down and look at this key and say

8085
07:23:29,160 --> 07:23:30,718
well what is this key Googling around

8086
07:23:30,718 --> 07:23:32,638
and then someone referenced some code

8087
07:23:32,638 --> 07:23:34,320
and some manual and then you dig in the

8088
07:23:34,320 --> 07:23:35,700
manual and you realize wow this is going

8089
07:23:35,700 --> 07:23:38,458
to this Cloud Pro cloud provider and so

8090
07:23:38,458 --> 07:23:40,558
just kind of policy over it's pretty

8091
07:23:40,558 --> 07:23:41,458
awesome

8092
07:23:41,458 --> 07:23:44,878
and so moving on uh policies so these

8093
07:23:44,878 --> 07:23:46,558
are some of the weird higher permissions

8094
07:23:46,558 --> 07:23:47,700
that you could leverage within the

8095
07:23:47,700 --> 07:23:50,100
policies if you see these we really want

8096
07:23:50,100 --> 07:23:51,660
to zoom into these if you have access to

8097
07:23:51,660 --> 07:23:53,100
these we really want to zoom into these

8098
07:23:53,100 --> 07:23:55,920
there's been a number of a number of uh

8099
07:23:55,920 --> 07:23:58,080
reference material I put it here at the

8100
07:23:58,080 --> 07:24:00,420
bottom Spencer geitzen I don't know if

8101
07:24:00,420 --> 07:24:02,280
anybody knows him um he was an amazing

8102
07:24:02,280 --> 07:24:04,680
dude he passed away last year

8103
07:24:04,680 --> 07:24:07,378
um hands down the number one I learned

8104
07:24:07,378 --> 07:24:09,240
everything that I know from my AWS

8105
07:24:09,240 --> 07:24:09,840
um

8106
07:24:09,840 --> 07:24:12,120
framework from him I mean I've built on

8107
07:24:12,120 --> 07:24:13,920
it since then but I I can't I can't say

8108
07:24:13,920 --> 07:24:16,500
it enough like he was super huge on the

8109
07:24:16,500 --> 07:24:18,900
AWS side provided a lot of content out

8110
07:24:18,900 --> 07:24:20,218
there a lot of research a lot of these

8111
07:24:20,218 --> 07:24:22,500
techniques are from him but you can do

8112
07:24:22,500 --> 07:24:24,478
create policy version so if you have

8113
07:24:24,478 --> 07:24:27,058
access to create a policy version well

8114
07:24:27,058 --> 07:24:30,020
why don't you just create a new policy

8115
07:24:30,020 --> 07:24:33,058
version for an existing policy and then

8116
07:24:33,058 --> 07:24:34,920
set it as the default that way when that

8117
07:24:34,920 --> 07:24:36,718
policy gets executed you just enhance

8118
07:24:36,718 --> 07:24:39,058
your permissions based on that policy

8119
07:24:39,058 --> 07:24:40,860
that gets executed

8120
07:24:40,860 --> 07:24:42,718
um you can also do attach policy you can

8121
07:24:42,718 --> 07:24:44,638
attach policies to users groups or roles

8122
07:24:44,638 --> 07:24:46,320
but if you have that attached policy you

8123
07:24:46,320 --> 07:24:47,458
can do the same thing you could just add

8124
07:24:47,458 --> 07:24:50,340
a new policy as long as you are you're

8125
07:24:50,340 --> 07:24:51,478
doing it to something that you control

8126
07:24:51,478 --> 07:24:53,580
right so you can add a policy but you

8127
07:24:53,580 --> 07:24:55,020
want to add that policy to a resource

8128
07:24:55,020 --> 07:24:56,520
that you already have control over that

8129
07:24:56,520 --> 07:24:57,780
you're that you could actually execute

8130
07:24:57,780 --> 07:24:58,558
with

8131
07:24:58,558 --> 07:25:00,718
um there's also a put policy which is

8132
07:25:00,718 --> 07:25:02,280
similar but it's it's using in-line

8133
07:25:02,280 --> 07:25:04,320
policies if you're familiar with that

8134
07:25:04,320 --> 07:25:06,900
and you can also set a default policy so

8135
07:25:06,900 --> 07:25:09,120
imagine a policy that was set and it's

8136
07:25:09,120 --> 07:25:10,440
all version controlled so they have

8137
07:25:10,440 --> 07:25:12,058
different like five versions later let's

8138
07:25:12,058 --> 07:25:14,160
say that version one had like Global

8139
07:25:14,160 --> 07:25:15,660
everything and they're like oh that's

8140
07:25:15,660 --> 07:25:17,340
bad so let's add a new policy version

8141
07:25:17,340 --> 07:25:18,840
and by five they've got it really down

8142
07:25:18,840 --> 07:25:21,180
they get a reduced model if you have the

8143
07:25:21,180 --> 07:25:24,120
update assume rule policy or set default

8144
07:25:24,120 --> 07:25:26,520
policy version you could literally just

8145
07:25:26,520 --> 07:25:28,500
update the default policy version to

8146
07:25:28,500 --> 07:25:30,478
whatever that rollback one was and just

8147
07:25:30,478 --> 07:25:32,878
re-escalate so it's kind of it's kind of

8148
07:25:32,878 --> 07:25:33,780
interesting

8149
07:25:33,780 --> 07:25:35,580
there's also an update assume role

8150
07:25:35,580 --> 07:25:37,440
policy this is going to do that for the

8151
07:25:37,440 --> 07:25:38,940
assumed role that we kind of talked

8152
07:25:38,940 --> 07:25:40,080
about earlier these are just interesting

8153
07:25:40,080 --> 07:25:43,260
ones here's some odd ones past role so

8154
07:25:43,260 --> 07:25:45,120
in some cases like I mentioned earlier

8155
07:25:45,120 --> 07:25:46,620
if you wanted to like do something with

8156
07:25:46,620 --> 07:25:49,500
ec2 you could pass a role in if that

8157
07:25:49,500 --> 07:25:52,080
pass role is there it gets really bad

8158
07:25:52,080 --> 07:25:56,878
and so you could literally pass a a role

8159
07:25:56,878 --> 07:25:58,558
to a service where you're executing the

8160
07:25:58,558 --> 07:26:01,740
actions and you could basically execute

8161
07:26:01,740 --> 07:26:03,000
actions that are greater than what you

8162
07:26:03,000 --> 07:26:04,740
currently have because it's like that

8163
07:26:04,740 --> 07:26:06,298
pseudoers right so you're saying Hey I

8164
07:26:06,298 --> 07:26:08,700
want to execute on behalf of this role

8165
07:26:08,700 --> 07:26:10,558
and so you pass that assumed role or

8166
07:26:10,558 --> 07:26:13,378
that you pass that role it's it's a bad

8167
07:26:13,378 --> 07:26:16,260
day for that for that resource another

8168
07:26:16,260 --> 07:26:18,420
one that's really weird that I I see a

8169
07:26:18,420 --> 07:26:19,920
lot and I think it's just there's a lot

8170
07:26:19,920 --> 07:26:21,840
of confusion around it it's when you see

8171
07:26:21,840 --> 07:26:24,600
not actions mixed with the um effect

8172
07:26:24,600 --> 07:26:25,620
allow

8173
07:26:25,620 --> 07:26:27,298
what it does is it actually Ties That

8174
07:26:27,298 --> 07:26:28,978
Event Source

8175
07:26:28,978 --> 07:26:32,580
um and it creates a list of stuff that

8176
07:26:32,580 --> 07:26:34,920
you say deny these but that

8177
07:26:34,920 --> 07:26:36,900
automatically means allow everything

8178
07:26:36,900 --> 07:26:38,820
else and so it's just really a bad

8179
07:26:38,820 --> 07:26:40,440
combination to do you don't really want

8180
07:26:40,440 --> 07:26:42,240
to do that and there's some other ones

8181
07:26:42,240 --> 07:26:43,378
in here and there's a lot of odd

8182
07:26:43,378 --> 07:26:44,218
permissions I'm going to kind of skip

8183
07:26:44,218 --> 07:26:45,000
ahead because I want to make sure I

8184
07:26:45,000 --> 07:26:47,100
cover some other stuff but yeah there's

8185
07:26:47,100 --> 07:26:49,080
just you could add like SSH keys to Dev

8186
07:26:49,080 --> 07:26:51,298
endpoints and and create stacks and

8187
07:26:51,298 --> 07:26:52,558
stuff which is really bad especially if

8188
07:26:52,558 --> 07:26:54,718
you have pastoral so let's look at a

8189
07:26:54,718 --> 07:26:56,160
privilege escalation vulnerability so I

8190
07:26:56,160 --> 07:27:00,958
am roll with ec2 metadata so this imds

8191
07:27:00,958 --> 07:27:03,420
version 1 and version two it's a it's a

8192
07:27:03,420 --> 07:27:05,100
basically just the metadata service it's

8193
07:27:05,100 --> 07:27:07,558
called instance metadata service

8194
07:27:07,558 --> 07:27:09,000
um and so the idea behind that is you

8195
07:27:09,000 --> 07:27:12,120
can hit that URL at the top and if there

8196
07:27:12,120 --> 07:27:15,360
is an I am role assigned to an ec2

8197
07:27:15,360 --> 07:27:18,240
instance you can retrieve that metadata

8198
07:27:18,240 --> 07:27:21,600
if it's version one just by hitting the

8199
07:27:21,600 --> 07:27:23,520
I am security credentials it'll actually

8200
07:27:23,520 --> 07:27:26,340
pass the role in it'll provide you with

8201
07:27:26,340 --> 07:27:28,500
access keys of secret access keys this

8202
07:27:28,500 --> 07:27:29,878
came back to the web app vulnerabilities

8203
07:27:29,878 --> 07:27:31,740
that I was talking about earlier if you

8204
07:27:31,740 --> 07:27:33,240
happen to find like a server-side

8205
07:27:33,240 --> 07:27:35,878
request forgery vulnerability in a web

8206
07:27:35,878 --> 07:27:38,520
application that's hosted in ec2 instead

8207
07:27:38,520 --> 07:27:40,138
of retrieving like an external one you

8208
07:27:40,138 --> 07:27:42,180
can retrieve this metadata URL and it'll

8209
07:27:42,180 --> 07:27:44,100
just dump your access keys to the screen

8210
07:27:44,100 --> 07:27:45,840
and you could use those for temporary

8211
07:27:45,840 --> 07:27:47,760
auth now depending on what that role has

8212
07:27:47,760 --> 07:27:49,620
you can literally use those credentials

8213
07:27:49,620 --> 07:27:52,860
externally and escalate into the ec2

8214
07:27:52,860 --> 07:27:54,660
and kind of go from there now version

8215
07:27:54,660 --> 07:27:56,280
one does not require any sort of

8216
07:27:56,280 --> 07:27:57,600
authentication it's literally just a

8217
07:27:57,600 --> 07:27:59,218
metadata URL you just hit it with a get

8218
07:27:59,218 --> 07:28:00,540
request and it's going to come back and

8219
07:28:00,540 --> 07:28:01,920
it's going to pull those credentials

8220
07:28:01,920 --> 07:28:04,260
back obviously that was a big deal lots

8221
07:28:04,260 --> 07:28:05,760
of vulnerabilities that had any sort of

8222
07:28:05,760 --> 07:28:07,400
interaction with the metadata URL

8223
07:28:07,400 --> 07:28:09,600
created some problems so they can

8224
07:28:09,600 --> 07:28:11,458
release this version two version two

8225
07:28:11,458 --> 07:28:13,798
does require authentication but the

8226
07:28:13,798 --> 07:28:16,200
security fix was basically to make a put

8227
07:28:16,200 --> 07:28:18,718
request to the latest API token and

8228
07:28:18,718 --> 07:28:20,458
it'll retrieve a value that you would

8229
07:28:20,458 --> 07:28:21,958
put in the header and then you can make

8230
07:28:21,958 --> 07:28:23,878
that request to the metadata URL and

8231
07:28:23,878 --> 07:28:25,440
retrieve the credentials that way so it

8232
07:28:25,440 --> 07:28:27,478
requires two of them if you compromise

8233
07:28:27,478 --> 07:28:29,160
an ec2 instance for instance like if you

8234
07:28:29,160 --> 07:28:31,138
have like like if you're a local user on

8235
07:28:31,138 --> 07:28:33,420
an ec2 instance you could just like

8236
07:28:33,420 --> 07:28:37,558
literally wget or curl the the IM URL

8237
07:28:37,558 --> 07:28:39,180
metadata and grab those credentials

8238
07:28:39,180 --> 07:28:41,820
straight out of the the metadata it's

8239
07:28:41,820 --> 07:28:43,620
pretty cool so that's how I would

8240
07:28:43,620 --> 07:28:45,478
escalate within ec2 so Lambda there's

8241
07:28:45,478 --> 07:28:46,740
some assumed role vulnerabilities so

8242
07:28:46,740 --> 07:28:48,360
you're going to look for any sort of

8243
07:28:48,360 --> 07:28:50,700
policy versions that are in line or

8244
07:28:50,700 --> 07:28:52,620
managed that might have an assumed role

8245
07:28:52,620 --> 07:28:54,298
a lot of times what we're doing is we're

8246
07:28:54,298 --> 07:28:56,100
looking for our principle within that

8247
07:28:56,100 --> 07:28:58,798
assume role or an asterisk believe it or

8248
07:28:58,798 --> 07:29:00,660
not you know it these get complicated

8249
07:29:00,660 --> 07:29:02,218
deploying at devops and a lot of these

8250
07:29:02,218 --> 07:29:03,958
teams that are deploying technology it's

8251
07:29:03,958 --> 07:29:05,280
not easy to do this this is really

8252
07:29:05,280 --> 07:29:07,320
difficult sometimes and they and they

8253
07:29:07,320 --> 07:29:09,058
get it working and it's like ah it's not

8254
07:29:09,058 --> 07:29:10,138
working it's not working I'll just throw

8255
07:29:10,138 --> 07:29:11,340
an asterisk in there and then asterisk

8256
07:29:11,340 --> 07:29:12,780
starts working and they're like oh well

8257
07:29:12,780 --> 07:29:15,058
now all the all of our AWS accounts can

8258
07:29:15,058 --> 07:29:16,440
interact with this one which is good

8259
07:29:16,440 --> 07:29:18,240
right but it's really bad because it

8260
07:29:18,240 --> 07:29:20,760
means all which means mine as well and

8261
07:29:20,760 --> 07:29:22,680
so it's bad so we're looking for these

8262
07:29:22,680 --> 07:29:24,000
because if we could do these we could

8263
07:29:24,000 --> 07:29:26,160
just assume that role generate temporary

8264
07:29:26,160 --> 07:29:28,260
credentials and now we can execute with

8265
07:29:28,260 --> 07:29:31,020
whatever Lambda has access to

8266
07:29:31,020 --> 07:29:33,360
um if we could create Lambda functions

8267
07:29:33,360 --> 07:29:35,400
or update function code we can add new

8268
07:29:35,400 --> 07:29:36,780
layers we can update configurations

8269
07:29:36,780 --> 07:29:38,520
within Lambda there's lots of really

8270
07:29:38,520 --> 07:29:39,540
cool stuff we could do we can just

8271
07:29:39,540 --> 07:29:41,160
inject our own code our own code to do

8272
07:29:41,160 --> 07:29:42,660
certain things I'll let create function

8273
07:29:42,660 --> 07:29:44,280
I could just put my own back door that

8274
07:29:44,280 --> 07:29:46,860
says hey query RDS dump this data to the

8275
07:29:46,860 --> 07:29:49,500
screen I deploy my own function code I

8276
07:29:49,500 --> 07:29:51,180
execute my function and it just gives me

8277
07:29:51,180 --> 07:29:54,120
back the data so it's kind of cool it's

8278
07:29:54,120 --> 07:29:55,558
a cool feature but it's also cool for

8279
07:29:55,558 --> 07:29:57,180
exploitation

8280
07:29:57,180 --> 07:30:01,020
so ec2 with instance profiles

8281
07:30:01,020 --> 07:30:03,298
so with instance profiles it gives you

8282
07:30:03,298 --> 07:30:05,878
the ability to look for roles that have

8283
07:30:05,878 --> 07:30:08,280
run instances if you could do this you

8284
07:30:08,280 --> 07:30:09,900
could add and remove an instance rule

8285
07:30:09,900 --> 07:30:12,660
profile if you could add an or remove an

8286
07:30:12,660 --> 07:30:15,000
instance row profile you could generate

8287
07:30:15,000 --> 07:30:16,860
a key pair and then just run your own

8288
07:30:16,860 --> 07:30:19,080
ec2 instance and then the cool thing

8289
07:30:19,080 --> 07:30:20,700
with that is obviously you have to make

8290
07:30:20,700 --> 07:30:22,558
sure that the firewall or you find a

8291
07:30:22,558 --> 07:30:24,420
firewall security group that gives you

8292
07:30:24,420 --> 07:30:26,280
access to do whatever you want to do but

8293
07:30:26,280 --> 07:30:27,540
a lot of times that's all I do I just

8294
07:30:27,540 --> 07:30:29,580
generate a key a key pair that I have

8295
07:30:29,580 --> 07:30:31,680
access to and then I'll generate my own

8296
07:30:31,680 --> 07:30:33,718
ec2 instance in their VPC environment

8297
07:30:33,718 --> 07:30:35,940
and that just sshn well from there I can

8298
07:30:35,940 --> 07:30:37,320
now laterally move to any of the

8299
07:30:37,320 --> 07:30:39,000
internal IP addresses that are there so

8300
07:30:39,000 --> 07:30:41,100
if I found database credentials earlier

8301
07:30:41,100 --> 07:30:43,080
in like a Lambda environment variable I

8302
07:30:43,080 --> 07:30:45,058
just SSH into the ec2 instance and then

8303
07:30:45,058 --> 07:30:46,558
I pivot over to the RDS environment and

8304
07:30:46,558 --> 07:30:48,780
use my credentials from that machine

8305
07:30:48,780 --> 07:30:50,700
and so there's other stuff you could do

8306
07:30:50,700 --> 07:30:52,320
too you could do like send commands for

8307
07:30:52,320 --> 07:30:54,420
like a remote code execution

8308
07:30:54,420 --> 07:30:56,760
um and uh and so lots of really cool ec2

8309
07:30:56,760 --> 07:30:58,740
lateral movement techniques

8310
07:30:58,740 --> 07:31:00,180
um another one that we have is Cognito

8311
07:31:00,180 --> 07:31:01,558
identities does anybody familiar with

8312
07:31:01,558 --> 07:31:03,000
Cognito identities these things are

8313
07:31:03,000 --> 07:31:03,900
weird

8314
07:31:03,900 --> 07:31:07,440
um so there's these user poll user pools

8315
07:31:07,440 --> 07:31:09,058
that assist with like signing up users

8316
07:31:09,058 --> 07:31:10,740
so like let's say I've seen them with

8317
07:31:10,740 --> 07:31:12,478
Hardware so Hardware devices that like

8318
07:31:12,478 --> 07:31:14,340
want to provision a hardware device in

8319
07:31:14,340 --> 07:31:16,378
some sort of cloud environment it

8320
07:31:16,378 --> 07:31:18,058
creates a user but in order to create a

8321
07:31:18,058 --> 07:31:20,700
user it goes to these user pools and it

8322
07:31:20,700 --> 07:31:22,558
generates all of the functionality for

8323
07:31:22,558 --> 07:31:25,740
signing in and signing up those identity

8324
07:31:25,740 --> 07:31:28,020
pools that it for Cognito give you the

8325
07:31:28,020 --> 07:31:30,360
ability to say this user has access to

8326
07:31:30,360 --> 07:31:31,680
these things

8327
07:31:31,680 --> 07:31:33,900
so what we're actually looking for is

8328
07:31:33,900 --> 07:31:36,120
identity pool IDs and so a lot of times

8329
07:31:36,120 --> 07:31:37,798
these are in JavaScript libraries so if

8330
07:31:37,798 --> 07:31:38,878
you look through the JavaScript you

8331
07:31:38,878 --> 07:31:41,100
might be able to find the pool IDs you

8332
07:31:41,100 --> 07:31:42,718
can look at response headers as you're

8333
07:31:42,718 --> 07:31:44,820
making web requests if you open burp and

8334
07:31:44,820 --> 07:31:46,200
you're just kind of spidering the site

8335
07:31:46,200 --> 07:31:47,760
and kind of going through stuff you

8336
07:31:47,760 --> 07:31:49,138
could look for the response headers and

8337
07:31:49,138 --> 07:31:50,340
just do a quick search and see if you

8338
07:31:50,340 --> 07:31:52,500
can find pool IDs you can check GitHub a

8339
07:31:52,500 --> 07:31:53,820
lot of times they're hard-coded in code

8340
07:31:53,820 --> 07:31:55,320
or environment variables that are like

8341
07:31:55,320 --> 07:31:57,780
in files and then there's some

8342
07:31:57,780 --> 07:32:00,120
interaction with JWT to the identity

8343
07:32:00,120 --> 07:32:01,798
pool it's going to retrieve some

8344
07:32:01,798 --> 07:32:03,718
temporary AWS keys

8345
07:32:03,718 --> 07:32:06,540
so if you find a pool ID and you're able

8346
07:32:06,540 --> 07:32:08,458
to pass in that JWT and retrieve that

8347
07:32:08,458 --> 07:32:11,340
those AWS Keys now you could go back to

8348
07:32:11,340 --> 07:32:13,020
square one and reconnaissance again

8349
07:32:13,020 --> 07:32:15,420
using those AWS keys because we want to

8350
07:32:15,420 --> 07:32:16,920
find out what we have access to because

8351
07:32:16,920 --> 07:32:18,478
a lot of times these Cognito pools might

8352
07:32:18,478 --> 07:32:20,160
have access to do stuff like update a

8353
07:32:20,160 --> 07:32:22,020
profile for instance if you could update

8354
07:32:22,020 --> 07:32:23,458
your profile or do something like that

8355
07:32:23,458 --> 07:32:25,440
there might be other ways you can update

8356
07:32:25,440 --> 07:32:28,200
permissions on that entity in order to

8357
07:32:28,200 --> 07:32:29,820
escalate privileges and so these are

8358
07:32:29,820 --> 07:32:31,440
these are super common in mobile apps

8359
07:32:31,440 --> 07:32:35,820
and hardware and Hardware devices and so

8360
07:32:35,820 --> 07:32:37,440
let's talk about data X fill I want to

8361
07:32:37,440 --> 07:32:38,400
kind of Breeze through this part this

8362
07:32:38,400 --> 07:32:41,458
had pretty cool stuff but public Amis

8363
07:32:41,458 --> 07:32:42,958
um there's actually if you go to the web

8364
07:32:42,958 --> 07:32:44,878
console you could just search and go to

8365
07:32:44,878 --> 07:32:46,260
the filter change it to public images

8366
07:32:46,260 --> 07:32:47,520
and they just tell you all the public

8367
07:32:47,520 --> 07:32:49,500
images but what we're wanting to do is

8368
07:32:49,500 --> 07:32:51,840
we're wanting to query the images that

8369
07:32:51,840 --> 07:32:53,638
are within the account that we're

8370
07:32:53,638 --> 07:32:56,340
testing for that public flag we want to

8371
07:32:56,340 --> 07:32:58,620
see is that public flag true or false if

8372
07:32:58,620 --> 07:33:00,298
it's true that means we can just go to

8373
07:33:00,298 --> 07:33:02,820
our own AWS account we could run our own

8374
07:33:02,820 --> 07:33:06,000
ec2 instance using that public Ami and

8375
07:33:06,000 --> 07:33:08,458
then in that account we're testing and

8376
07:33:08,458 --> 07:33:09,958
we could just Mount the file system and

8377
07:33:09,958 --> 07:33:11,218
enumerate it just like we're back in

8378
07:33:11,218 --> 07:33:14,400
1999. and so the same thing with EBS

8379
07:33:14,400 --> 07:33:16,260
volumes and snapshots so we could

8380
07:33:16,260 --> 07:33:17,638
describe the snapshots in the

8381
07:33:17,638 --> 07:33:18,718
environment and look for that public

8382
07:33:18,718 --> 07:33:21,000
flag if that public flag is set to true

8383
07:33:21,000 --> 07:33:24,000
we can go to our external AWS account

8384
07:33:24,000 --> 07:33:27,180
and we can attach an EBS volume to our

8385
07:33:27,180 --> 07:33:29,820
ec2 instance it's basically just like

8386
07:33:29,820 --> 07:33:32,878
mounting like a file share in a

8387
07:33:32,878 --> 07:33:34,620
customer's account but within our

8388
07:33:34,620 --> 07:33:35,638
account so we don't have to be on the

8389
07:33:35,638 --> 07:33:37,680
network we just mounted in ours and if

8390
07:33:37,680 --> 07:33:38,878
you like there's some cool stuff that

8391
07:33:38,878 --> 07:33:40,680
you could do where like even save costs

8392
07:33:40,680 --> 07:33:43,260
if you're like on the free tier but yeah

8393
07:33:43,260 --> 07:33:45,200
and we're back to once again you know

8394
07:33:45,200 --> 07:33:48,900
enumerating the EBS volume

8395
07:33:48,900 --> 07:33:51,600
um you could also modify a snapshot so

8396
07:33:51,600 --> 07:33:52,860
if you have modified snapshot

8397
07:33:52,860 --> 07:33:54,840
permissions you could just modify that

8398
07:33:54,840 --> 07:33:58,260
EBS volume and then add your account as

8399
07:33:58,260 --> 07:33:59,580
authorized and then you can just go into

8400
07:33:59,580 --> 07:34:00,600
your account and do it that way so

8401
07:34:00,600 --> 07:34:02,340
you're not even worried about public I

8402
07:34:02,340 --> 07:34:04,218
strongly strongly

8403
07:34:04,218 --> 07:34:08,040
don't make an EBS volume public to

8404
07:34:08,040 --> 07:34:09,958
everybody this looks super horrible like

8405
07:34:09,958 --> 07:34:10,978
it's just really really bad practice

8406
07:34:10,978 --> 07:34:13,680
like I I don't I've heard about it I

8407
07:34:13,680 --> 07:34:15,120
just I don't recommend doing that it's a

8408
07:34:15,120 --> 07:34:16,620
really bad idea

8409
07:34:16,620 --> 07:34:19,260
um and so don't do that bad

8410
07:34:19,260 --> 07:34:21,478
and then S3 buckets obviously these are

8411
07:34:21,478 --> 07:34:23,400
this is what everybody's familiar with

8412
07:34:23,400 --> 07:34:24,840
um so I just instead of kind of putting

8413
07:34:24,840 --> 07:34:27,000
emphasis on all of the S3 bucket stuff I

8414
07:34:27,000 --> 07:34:28,620
I wanted to talk about how we find them

8415
07:34:28,620 --> 07:34:31,080
a lot of times you could just go to

8416
07:34:31,080 --> 07:34:32,000
um

8417
07:34:32,000 --> 07:34:34,978
something.s3.amazon uh aws.com meaning

8418
07:34:34,978 --> 07:34:37,378
like a domain uh or you could browse to

8419
07:34:37,378 --> 07:34:40,378
the IP address of a host and if it

8420
07:34:40,378 --> 07:34:42,718
redirects you to AWS S3 it's an S3

8421
07:34:42,718 --> 07:34:45,840
bucket you could also do NS lookup S3

8422
07:34:45,840 --> 07:34:48,660
Dash website Dash region

8423
07:34:48,660 --> 07:34:50,400
and uh so if it's like you know whatever

8424
07:34:50,400 --> 07:34:53,458
your website is domain.com uh Us East

8425
07:34:53,458 --> 07:34:55,798
one am is on aws.com if that comes back

8426
07:34:55,798 --> 07:34:57,478
you'll know it's an S3 bucket

8427
07:34:57,478 --> 07:34:58,860
and you can do the domain you can just

8428
07:34:58,860 --> 07:35:00,180
go to the web browser and do the domain

8429
07:35:00,180 --> 07:35:01,620
and do this I just put them in there for

8430
07:35:01,620 --> 07:35:03,360
the slide deck mainly you can also look

8431
07:35:03,360 --> 07:35:06,000
at the SSL um the certificates so if you

8432
07:35:06,000 --> 07:35:07,620
look at the subject alternative names on

8433
07:35:07,620 --> 07:35:09,420
a certificate you could pull them and

8434
07:35:09,420 --> 07:35:11,040
then just kind of brute force them or in

8435
07:35:11,040 --> 07:35:12,298
your reconnaissance if you treat it like

8436
07:35:12,298 --> 07:35:14,040
an external and just generate a bunch of

8437
07:35:14,040 --> 07:35:15,298
host names you can kind of go back and

8438
07:35:15,298 --> 07:35:18,000
see you can check GitHub and and Google

8439
07:35:18,000 --> 07:35:19,978
there's also a burp plugin called AWS

8440
07:35:19,978 --> 07:35:22,378
extender which is really cool

8441
07:35:22,378 --> 07:35:24,120
and so scaling let's talk about scaling

8442
07:35:24,120 --> 07:35:25,080
because I know we only get a little bit

8443
07:35:25,080 --> 07:35:26,638
of time left um and so looping through

8444
07:35:26,638 --> 07:35:28,200
the accounts remember that accounts.txt

8445
07:35:28,200 --> 07:35:30,240
file that we talked about earlier so the

8446
07:35:30,240 --> 07:35:31,978
way to quickly scale all of these tools

8447
07:35:31,978 --> 07:35:34,740
is kind of across the board is you can

8448
07:35:34,740 --> 07:35:36,540
cat that accounts file and while you're

8449
07:35:36,540 --> 07:35:39,360
reading it just run Scout suite and then

8450
07:35:39,360 --> 07:35:41,160
dump the report into a folder and it's

8451
07:35:41,160 --> 07:35:42,298
just going to Loop through all of them

8452
07:35:42,298 --> 07:35:44,760
so if you like I had I think 349 is my

8453
07:35:44,760 --> 07:35:47,760
largest account test I think it was 349.

8454
07:35:47,760 --> 07:35:50,100
and so I just put 349 accounts in there

8455
07:35:50,100 --> 07:35:52,138
349 profiles and then I just ran a for

8456
07:35:52,138 --> 07:35:54,360
Loop for each account in that run the

8457
07:35:54,360 --> 07:35:56,340
tool dump the data because what we're

8458
07:35:56,340 --> 07:35:58,558
trying to do is send like a really wide

8459
07:35:58,558 --> 07:36:00,780
net to acquire all the data so we can

8460
07:36:00,780 --> 07:36:02,638
kind of go through the data and then we

8461
07:36:02,638 --> 07:36:04,440
could generate the report we have a

8462
07:36:04,440 --> 07:36:06,660
handy and and kind of go through it rate

8463
07:36:06,660 --> 07:36:08,458
limits do suck Scout does have a couple

8464
07:36:08,458 --> 07:36:10,860
Flags you could kind of do that with uh

8465
07:36:10,860 --> 07:36:12,420
for for doing that so if you want to do

8466
07:36:12,420 --> 07:36:14,580
some quick analysis on this stuff now we

8467
07:36:14,580 --> 07:36:16,680
we ran it we ran Scout for 300 accounts

8468
07:36:16,680 --> 07:36:18,478
we generated reports we have the Json

8469
07:36:18,478 --> 07:36:20,400
objects if we needed them

8470
07:36:20,400 --> 07:36:22,500
we want to find those Json objects and

8471
07:36:22,500 --> 07:36:23,700
we want to look for issues that are

8472
07:36:23,700 --> 07:36:26,040
within them and so what I like to do is

8473
07:36:26,040 --> 07:36:27,840
I create these these one-liners I put

8474
07:36:27,840 --> 07:36:29,580
some in here right now but I put these I

8475
07:36:29,580 --> 07:36:30,840
create these one-liners and I just keep

8476
07:36:30,840 --> 07:36:33,718
them in my knowledge base and I can Loop

8477
07:36:33,718 --> 07:36:35,520
through all of the Scout results in all

8478
07:36:35,520 --> 07:36:38,340
349 directories I could parse out the

8479
07:36:38,340 --> 07:36:40,558
Json and then I could query the Json

8480
07:36:40,558 --> 07:36:44,040
using Jake the JQ library and I could

8481
07:36:44,040 --> 07:36:46,680
query the instances pull the user data

8482
07:36:46,680 --> 07:36:48,298
and now I just have it all and I could

8483
07:36:48,298 --> 07:36:50,100
basically 4D code it into a big text

8484
07:36:50,100 --> 07:36:52,020
file and then I go through the text file

8485
07:36:52,020 --> 07:36:54,000
now you have like you know I don't know

8486
07:36:54,000 --> 07:36:55,320
how many resources you have but in a

8487
07:36:55,320 --> 07:36:57,000
text file um you do the same thing for

8488
07:36:57,000 --> 07:36:58,798
Lambda environment variables

8489
07:36:58,798 --> 07:37:00,840
go through dump all of the variables for

8490
07:37:00,840 --> 07:37:03,120
all of the reports into a file and now

8491
07:37:03,120 --> 07:37:05,400
you just kind of Step through them and

8492
07:37:05,400 --> 07:37:06,540
you're going to want to spend time here

8493
07:37:06,540 --> 07:37:07,440
this is where you're going to be doing

8494
07:37:07,440 --> 07:37:10,680
that and then so it's just a really

8495
07:37:10,680 --> 07:37:12,058
quick way to kind of dig into the

8496
07:37:12,058 --> 07:37:13,680
resources across all of the different

8497
07:37:13,680 --> 07:37:16,138
accounts and at scale makes it a little

8498
07:37:16,138 --> 07:37:18,900
bit easier so I am releasing a tool that

8499
07:37:18,900 --> 07:37:20,520
kind of help with some of this it's

8500
07:37:20,520 --> 07:37:22,978
called Outpost

8501
07:37:22,978 --> 07:37:25,138
I'll have a slide on the next slide I'll

8502
07:37:25,138 --> 07:37:27,240
have the URL for it but with Scout Suite

8503
07:37:27,240 --> 07:37:29,878
or what Outpost does is it generates

8504
07:37:29,878 --> 07:37:32,160
your AWS config for your assume role

8505
07:37:32,160 --> 07:37:33,840
profiles so if they give you your

8506
07:37:33,840 --> 07:37:35,700
accounts and your your profile or your

8507
07:37:35,700 --> 07:37:38,160
assume role name it'll generate your

8508
07:37:38,160 --> 07:37:40,080
config file for you and It'll point it

8509
07:37:40,080 --> 07:37:42,058
to yours it'll also test all of the

8510
07:37:42,058 --> 07:37:43,138
accounts that are in there so if you

8511
07:37:43,138 --> 07:37:44,820
have 349 accounts and you wanted to test

8512
07:37:44,820 --> 07:37:46,680
them all it'll test them all for you

8513
07:37:46,680 --> 07:37:48,660
using STS get caller identity and tell

8514
07:37:48,660 --> 07:37:49,920
you which ones are valid which ones are

8515
07:37:49,920 --> 07:37:52,440
not valid and it'll also generate the

8516
07:37:52,440 --> 07:37:54,360
findings from Scout so if you're wanting

8517
07:37:54,360 --> 07:37:55,920
to quickly generate some boilerplate

8518
07:37:55,920 --> 07:37:57,240
language that you're going to use for

8519
07:37:57,240 --> 07:37:59,218
your report it goes through Scout it

8520
07:37:59,218 --> 07:38:00,600
pulls all of the findings that are in

8521
07:38:00,600 --> 07:38:03,600
there it reconciles them to the accounts

8522
07:38:03,600 --> 07:38:05,040
and the resources that are vulnerable

8523
07:38:05,040 --> 07:38:06,600
and then dumps the boilerplate language

8524
07:38:06,600 --> 07:38:10,798
the observation the the discussion the

8525
07:38:10,798 --> 07:38:12,000
recommendation

8526
07:38:12,000 --> 07:38:13,920
it'll kind of dump all that into a file

8527
07:38:13,920 --> 07:38:15,420
for you and then you can just kind of

8528
07:38:15,420 --> 07:38:17,280
import that into word and then as you're

8529
07:38:17,280 --> 07:38:18,900
enumerating the vulnerabilities and

8530
07:38:18,900 --> 07:38:20,280
exploiting them and you find your false

8531
07:38:20,280 --> 07:38:22,378
positives you can pull them out of it

8532
07:38:22,378 --> 07:38:23,820
um and so it just it doesn't really good

8533
07:38:23,820 --> 07:38:25,378
and it doesn't have scale so I liked it

8534
07:38:25,378 --> 07:38:27,240
a lot it was really helpful for me it's

8535
07:38:27,240 --> 07:38:29,520
kind of been built out of a necessity uh

8536
07:38:29,520 --> 07:38:31,020
especially for trying to identify quick

8537
07:38:31,020 --> 07:38:32,878
wins and so that's just the command line

8538
07:38:32,878 --> 07:38:34,138
There's the link down at the bottom if

8539
07:38:34,138 --> 07:38:35,638
you want I just made it public a little

8540
07:38:35,638 --> 07:38:37,860
while ago a couple hours ago

8541
07:38:37,860 --> 07:38:40,440
um super helpful so helpful little tool

8542
07:38:40,440 --> 07:38:42,000
um we use it I use it on pretty much

8543
07:38:42,000 --> 07:38:45,080
every engagement on AWS

8544
07:38:45,080 --> 07:38:46,978
make sure everybody got a screenshot

8545
07:38:46,978 --> 07:38:49,680
before I move on

8546
07:38:49,680 --> 07:38:51,298
and I'll put the slide decks out there

8547
07:38:51,298 --> 07:38:53,340
too so if you follow me on Twitter I'll

8548
07:38:53,340 --> 07:38:55,940
just tweet it if you don't um you can

8549
07:38:55,940 --> 07:38:57,958
I'm sure cactuscon will make them

8550
07:38:57,958 --> 07:39:00,180
available or something we'll see

8551
07:39:00,180 --> 07:39:01,860
um so closing thoughts so

8552
07:39:01,860 --> 07:39:03,478
recommendations for clients so if you're

8553
07:39:03,478 --> 07:39:05,580
managing an environment of AWS and you

8554
07:39:05,580 --> 07:39:06,660
came here because you wanted to learn

8555
07:39:06,660 --> 07:39:08,280
where some of the attacks are coming

8556
07:39:08,280 --> 07:39:10,440
from I recommend always using cloudtrail

8557
07:39:10,440 --> 07:39:11,820
you won't believe how many times I see

8558
07:39:11,820 --> 07:39:13,978
cloudtrail not being used and there's no

8559
07:39:13,978 --> 07:39:15,718
Discovery there's no you know indicators

8560
07:39:15,718 --> 07:39:18,600
there's no no dashboards lighting up for

8561
07:39:18,600 --> 07:39:19,798
anything that I'm doing

8562
07:39:19,798 --> 07:39:22,440
and so I would also Implement a routine

8563
07:39:22,440 --> 07:39:25,138
AWS pen test on all accounts staging

8564
07:39:25,138 --> 07:39:27,478
production testing QA smoke whatever you

8565
07:39:27,478 --> 07:39:30,540
got Iowa test it and then I would also

8566
07:39:30,540 --> 07:39:33,058
restrict all policies to specific

8567
07:39:33,058 --> 07:39:35,100
principles never use asterisk it's just

8568
07:39:35,100 --> 07:39:37,978
a bad idea always Implement at least

8569
07:39:37,978 --> 07:39:39,958
privileged model so if you know Lambda

8570
07:39:39,958 --> 07:39:42,120
only has to interact with ec2 don't give

8571
07:39:42,120 --> 07:39:44,760
it access to you know S3 like only give

8572
07:39:44,760 --> 07:39:45,900
it to what it needs on the least

8573
07:39:45,900 --> 07:39:47,458
privilege privileged model it makes it

8574
07:39:47,458 --> 07:39:49,138
really difficult for attackers and for

8575
07:39:49,138 --> 07:39:51,240
pen testers I would also say if you have

8576
07:39:51,240 --> 07:39:53,760
web apps block the metadata host like

8577
07:39:53,760 --> 07:39:55,798
just block it like unless you absolutely

8578
07:39:55,798 --> 07:39:57,478
need it I won't even do that I would

8579
07:39:57,478 --> 07:39:58,500
find another way to do it I wouldn't

8580
07:39:58,500 --> 07:40:00,600
even do it through the metadata URL

8581
07:40:00,600 --> 07:40:02,218
um you want to watch out for past role

8582
07:40:02,218 --> 07:40:03,600
on asterisk asterisk is bad with

8583
07:40:03,600 --> 07:40:05,100
pastoral so I put those in here for the

8584
07:40:05,100 --> 07:40:07,320
screenshots and then avoid using

8585
07:40:07,320 --> 07:40:08,940
principle with an asterisk

8586
07:40:08,940 --> 07:40:11,100
and then um not actions if you're a pen

8587
07:40:11,100 --> 07:40:12,718
tester follow the traditional pen test

8588
07:40:12,718 --> 07:40:14,580
phases the more attack surface you know

8589
07:40:14,580 --> 07:40:16,138
the better the test there's lots of

8590
07:40:16,138 --> 07:40:19,620
accounts spread the net focus in if it's

8591
07:40:19,620 --> 07:40:21,360
a few accounts discover everything that

8592
07:40:21,360 --> 07:40:23,160
you can and keep digging keep digging

8593
07:40:23,160 --> 07:40:24,240
keep digging you're going to find stuff

8594
07:40:24,240 --> 07:40:25,558
that I didn't talk about you're going to

8595
07:40:25,558 --> 07:40:26,700
find stuff that nobody's talked about

8596
07:40:26,700 --> 07:40:28,620
there's so many services that nobody's

8597
07:40:28,620 --> 07:40:30,058
even pen testing I haven't even tested

8598
07:40:30,058 --> 07:40:31,558
all of them just because there's so many

8599
07:40:31,558 --> 07:40:33,240
of them I focus on the big ones but I

8600
07:40:33,240 --> 07:40:35,218
mean it's really hard and just get

8601
07:40:35,218 --> 07:40:36,540
familiar with their offerings if you're

8602
07:40:36,540 --> 07:40:38,580
really trying to do this and so if you

8603
07:40:38,580 --> 07:40:40,200
have any questions or want to you want

8604
07:40:40,200 --> 07:40:41,760
to learn how to pen test AWS more you

8605
07:40:41,760 --> 07:40:43,620
want to reach out just reach out I'll be

8606
07:40:43,620 --> 07:40:45,298
I'll be available you can follow me on

8607
07:40:45,298 --> 07:40:47,580
on Twitter at you stay ready

8608
07:40:47,580 --> 07:40:49,200
if you're looking for a pen test I

8609
07:40:49,200 --> 07:40:50,400
highly recommend you know Black Hills

8610
07:40:50,400 --> 07:40:51,540
obviously because that's where I work

8611
07:40:51,540 --> 07:40:53,820
but if you're looking for a AWS pen test

8612
07:40:53,820 --> 07:40:56,160
or any cloud pen test we pen test AWS

8613
07:40:56,160 --> 07:41:00,718
Azure office 365. gcp

8614
07:41:00,718 --> 07:41:03,000
um pretty much everything I think it's

8615
07:41:03,000 --> 07:41:04,860
everything through the board so I think

8616
07:41:04,860 --> 07:41:06,180
we're out of time I don't know if we

8617
07:41:06,180 --> 07:41:07,920
have any time for questions but

8618
07:41:07,920 --> 07:41:11,298
um I'll just throw it out there

8619
07:41:12,298 --> 07:41:15,058
he's on closing statements start in five

8620
07:41:15,058 --> 07:41:16,798
minutes but does anybody have any

8621
07:41:16,798 --> 07:41:20,100
questions real quick

8622
07:41:20,100 --> 07:41:23,400
we do have one on Discord from Shar

8623
07:41:23,400 --> 07:41:25,620
um it sounds like your AWS pen testing

8624
07:41:25,620 --> 07:41:28,620
approaches white box getting access to

8625
07:41:28,620 --> 07:41:31,680
read everything how often do clients ask

8626
07:41:31,680 --> 07:41:33,900
you to try and discover accounts and

8627
07:41:33,900 --> 07:41:36,660
resources they don't know about

8628
07:41:36,660 --> 07:41:38,160
yeah that's a that's a great question

8629
07:41:38,160 --> 07:41:40,500
I've never had that request a lot of

8630
07:41:40,500 --> 07:41:42,600
times the concern is we want to test

8631
07:41:42,600 --> 07:41:44,340
what we know right so we're taking a

8632
07:41:44,340 --> 07:41:46,820
white box approach is the the most best

8633
07:41:46,820 --> 07:41:50,100
money for the buck right for the time

8634
07:41:50,100 --> 07:41:51,540
we don't have as much time as an

8635
07:41:51,540 --> 07:41:53,040
attacker so attackers you know they have

8636
07:41:53,040 --> 07:41:54,600
unlimited time we're on time boxes

8637
07:41:54,600 --> 07:41:56,638
usually so they want to give the best

8638
07:41:56,638 --> 07:41:58,200
best coverage that they can get for

8639
07:41:58,200 --> 07:41:59,520
their resources so I haven't had that

8640
07:41:59,520 --> 07:42:00,540
before

8641
07:42:00,540 --> 07:42:03,260
um but yeah
