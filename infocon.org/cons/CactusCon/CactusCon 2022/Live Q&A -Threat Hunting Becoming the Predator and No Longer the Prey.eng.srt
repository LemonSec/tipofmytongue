1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,240
and

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:07,359
all right awesome christian howdy where

3
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:08,720
are you where are you coming in from

4
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:09,679
today

5
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:11,360
yeah i'm actually out of uh gilbert

6
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,040
arizona still in the area but wasn't

7
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:15,120
able to make it out to the conference

8
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,840
today yeah well i appreciate you so much

9
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,840
for uh bringing this talk to us we had

10
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,320
so much chatter in the chat for this one

11
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,560
it was uh great you know a lot of people

12
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,000
yeah a lot of people are really excited

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,519
about the topic

14
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:28,640
um

15
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,679
hold on youtube wanted to talk to us

16
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:33,840
um but uh yeah so i gathered a few

17
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,559
questions from the chat and then also i

18
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:38,320
have some of my own

19
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,000
but um

20
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:40,879
something

21
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:43,040
that pudge mentioned was when starting a

22
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,719
threat hunt do you start with the actor

23
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:47,360
in mind or do you try to find activity

24
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,440
or does it depend i guess

25
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,680
yeah that's that's a great question um

26
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,360
you know are you looking for a very

27
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,280
specific behavior or can you you know

28
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,920
take a an adversary and kind of start

29
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,399
with that i love that idea of starting

30
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:02,640
with an adversary my favorite hunts are

31
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,159
actually um

32
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:06,240
my favorite idea is to actually go at

33
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,040
the

34
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,200
at it from a camp campaign expense

35
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,159
campaign perspective so you know taking

36
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:14,080
a campaign that's out there and wrapping

37
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,000
those up because that will give you a

38
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,520
lot of different ways to you can kind of

39
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:18,560
scatter

40
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,400
across your environment to look to try

41
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,000
and identify you know an attack or a

42
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,880
successful compromise um but i like the

43
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,240
idea of starting with an adversary

44
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,439
particularly because you can choose

45
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:29,200
adversaries that you may already know

46
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,360
are targeting your sector or

47
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,200
organizations that are similar to your

48
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,119
own so that gives you a huge advantage

49
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:36,960
because you can't you know we have a

50
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,799
limited amount of time that we're able

51
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:41,119
to take this intelligence and perform

52
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:42,960
that analysis so

53
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,880
being able to prioritize it with

54
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,880
intelligence like an adversary is that's

55
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,119
a great way to start now you will

56
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:51,920
eventually bring it down to some

57
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,159
individual pieces of behavior and

58
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:55,680
individual activities that you're

59
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,520
looking for but being able to you know

60
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,799
start with a list of several that you

61
00:01:58,799 --> 00:01:59,840
want to

62
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,920
hunt for based off of what an adversary

63
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,759
will typically do is a great great start

64
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:06,240
great way to poach it yeah and i imagine

65
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,239
that like even that slide you posted at

66
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:10,000
the end of all those various like zip

67
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,319
file created in temp directory etc

68
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:14,319
there's so many detections that can

69
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:16,000
actually lead you towards what threat

70
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,760
actor you're dealing with um because

71
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:18,560
you're

72
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,879
stumbling upon their own techniques

73
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:23,200
yeah another awesome benefit of the

74
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,360
miter framework um being able to take a

75
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,920
lot of those you know it we often

76
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,440
talk about trying to profile an

77
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,640
adversary in our environment if you

78
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,080
actually find vent and you're trying to

79
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,840
maybe look at what adversaries have

80
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,760
those sorts of ttps you know that's

81
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:36,879
something that

82
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:39,599
mitre and a lot of other threat intel um

83
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:42,000
researchers already do try and map those

84
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,920
techniques to um adversaries so you

85
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,760
could potentially you know even end up

86
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,519
going the other way around and having an

87
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:50,319
idea of what type of or you know an idea

88
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:53,040
of what adversary might be uh you might

89
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,200
be looking at

90
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,040
yeah and another thing i really loved

91
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,120
about your talk was the regular

92
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,519
inclusion of definitions

93
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:03,519
um i i just you know especially with

94
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:05,680
threat hunting it reminded of

95
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,360
me of a conversation with a colleague

96
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,280
where i was like well i kind of built

97
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,959
this like in my head it's a threat

98
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:12,800
hunting queue because it's like a good

99
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,800
it's the kind of searches you would use

100
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,159
to look for

101
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:18,400
obscure things but he was like no no

102
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,239
threat hunting is manual and i was like

103
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:21,840
yeah but i'm using the search you would

104
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,840
manually use

105
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:24,640
um

106
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,120
but not creating the alert out of it

107
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,080
yeah it's kind of funny um but you know

108
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,920
it's not something you ever really need

109
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,040
to be you know i don't want to be

110
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,120
dogmatic about or you know

111
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,120
there's there's an extent where maybe

112
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,040
it's not helpful but i do really think

113
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,519
that just um clarifying terms can be

114
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:43,599
really helpful because you know like

115
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:46,239
like in the example that i gave um if

116
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:47,920
your boss comes to you or if you're

117
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,519
hired for position and they say threat

118
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:51,040
hunt and you have a different idea of

119
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,439
what that means then whoever's asking

120
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:55,360
you to do it or if you're on a team

121
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,200
that's threat um there's multiple people

122
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,560
threat hunting

123
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,280
you know we might be communicating

124
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,519
different ideas so i think it's helpful

125
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:06,400
to maybe pick a helpful phrase or help

126
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,799
or helpful definition uh to kind of work

127
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:12,080
with as you know we dig into the topic

128
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,439
yeah um

129
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:15,040
especially yeah there's just so many

130
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,560
different teams and so many arms of the

131
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,720
security organization that like it's

132
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,079
just making sure people are on the same

133
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,240
page so when you do the work it is all

134
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,040
aligned and works well together

135
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,639
right yeah exactly

136
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:28,720
um another one i'm curious that also

137
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,320
from pudge pudge thank you for the great

138
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,160
questions um

139
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,280
was

140
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,120
i agree that being proactive is critical

141
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,800
to the purpose of conducting a threat

142
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,639
hunt but i'm curious on why you are

143
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:40,880
separating the use of automation would

144
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,800
you mind expanding

145
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,080
yes i i love that question because uh

146
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,800
you know with some of my uh with some of

147
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,120
the hunts i posted you know again it

148
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,280
comes down to semantics but with some of

149
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,880
the things i posted you might notice

150
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,120
that i am leveraging and leaning on

151
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,199
trying to automate a lot of manual work

152
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:03,039
and and using automation to um filter

153
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:05,360
out the data to summarize the data to

154
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,560
parse out the data and to um you know

155
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,160
put as much much of that out of the way

156
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,160
as you can is definitely something

157
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,800
that's going to aid a threat hunter um

158
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,639
and i think that's you know as you're

159
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:17,919
maturing

160
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:19,680
the outputs of your hunts can actually

161
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,720
feed back into any sort of automated

162
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,600
searches or queries like you mentioned

163
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,199
that you can actually tune that for next

164
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:29,199
time and you can run i love the idea of

165
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:31,280
running searches at night and collecting

166
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,880
this data you know and then being able

167
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,360
to come at it and just review it and i

168
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,919
love all that the the particular thought

169
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:40,080
i was trying to communicate there was

170
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,840
um you know with the sock security

171
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,199
operations in general i'll say

172
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:45,440
traditional sock we do want to keep

173
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:48,320
pushing towards and um a lot of the

174
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,160
detections that come out of our security

175
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,800
controls can and maybe should be

176
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,800
automated and we should be pumping them

177
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,120
into a soar or often these products have

178
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,960
you know automated integrations

179
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,440
themselves um but the idea with what

180
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,720
we're when we're looking at threat

181
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,319
hunting a lot of times we're gonna be

182
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:06,400
looking at very large

183
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,639
um you know sometimes large reports if

184
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,240
you're looking for

185
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,240
all the places like shadow

186
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,560
shadow copy is a great example one of

187
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,720
them that i gave

188
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,479
if you're looking at programs that

189
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:20,720
modify that you don't want to just

190
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,080
necessarily

191
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,160
go ahead and you know

192
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,919
if if a search returns a result and

193
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:28,880
there's a process that's um

194
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,600
augmenting the shadow cop shadow copy

195
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,600
you know prevent that or delete that or

196
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,600
contain the host because there can be

197
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,160
legitimate use cases for that and so i

198
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,520
think with this idea that we're no

199
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,720
longer just trying to find out what's

200
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,720
malicious or benign but we're trying to

201
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,960
delineate between an admin and our

202
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,199
adversary which is often

203
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:49,360
you know trying to look like the admin

204
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,120
it is going to take at this point there

205
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,120
is still a heavy reliance on human

206
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,280
analysis of the data that's returned and

207
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,919
so that's i think that the delineation i

208
00:06:57,919 --> 00:06:59,520
was trying to point out there but that

209
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,440
was yeah sure you don't want to mess up

210
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,560
that that particular automation like uh

211
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,759
there there's some things that are

212
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,680
important to uh things running in a

213
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,599
corporate network that if you break

214
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:13,039
could could go very badly yes yes

215
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:13,919
um

216
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,759
awesome i'm glad

217
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:17,120
i'm glad we had some time for some

218
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,039
questions i just i personally was

219
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,720
interested you mentioned sort of doing

220
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,039
social media threat hunting in the chat

221
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:24,639
and i was curious

222
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:26,639
what what lessons from your talk came

223
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:28,479
from from that experience

224
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:30,560
yeah that was actually a new uh new

225
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,759
endeavor for me actually this summer um

226
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:36,000
with the uh utopia olympics i had an

227
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,400
opportunity and i was i was first

228
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,440
exposed to smth and social media threat

229
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,800
hunting um

230
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,720
and i think that was there was also

231
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,479
great conversation about this idea of

232
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:48,240
external threat hunting and again

233
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,319
semantics can vary especially i'll note

234
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:52,639
from sector to sector i've learned over

235
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,560
the time um

236
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,080
but you know i think this idea that

237
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,160
we're looking at you know events or some

238
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,599
threat intelligence out there and kind

239
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:01,280
of hunting those and enumerating those

240
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,879
with threat intelligence i think that's

241
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:04,800
lending itself to what people what we

242
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,639
were discussing in terms of external

243
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:08,240
threat hunting whereas maybe the

244
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,520
delineation for internal threat

245
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,599
hunting's relying on our an

246
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:13,280
organization's internal logs and we're

247
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,120
trying to you know actually you know

248
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,680
follow up process ids and and map things

249
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,520
out and understand comprehensively

250
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,879
what's going on there

251
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:23,039
um but in terms of this external threat

252
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:25,199
hunting or just you know threat hunting

253
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:29,120
term as it's applied to social media

254
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,199
um you know there's a lot of good great

255
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:33,039
tools that were mentioned i shared a few

256
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:35,679
um twitter deck is gives you

257
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:37,360
the capacity to

258
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,200
be able to follow a lot of different

259
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,519
trends tags or strings and look for

260
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:43,919
those um in the

261
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,760
cyber resiliency institute we use this

262
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:46,560
for

263
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,920
sports events like the olympics to be

264
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,120
able to follow all the relationships

265
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,640
that all the uh the things that are

266
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,160
relating to that

267
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,120
and the

268
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,920
use cases differ far greater than cyber

269
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,680
security just in terms of you know we're

270
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,040
we were looking for compromise with

271
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,959
cyber threat hunting and in that case

272
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:03,440
that also included like physical um

273
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,959
threats that needed to be escalated to

274
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:06,560
the authorities of a particular sporting

275
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:10,160
event um or uh you know another big one

276
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,240
is taking advantage of people who maybe

277
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,120
were

278
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,760
looking to get access to streams

279
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,839
without paying for it and a lot of those

280
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:19,839
were malicious and

281
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:21,120
anyone who went to try and take

282
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,120
advantage of those

283
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,959
in fact actually there were also some

284
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:26,160
that

285
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,560
proposed to sell tickets or to sell

286
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,480
access and they were also completely

287
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,320
malicious and fictitious as well so it

288
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,160
included kind of all those things and

289
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,160
then we also have a few sites that we

290
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,000
were kind of using as honeypots they

291
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,320
were hosting content and we were able to

292
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,120
see

293
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,200
attacks that were um

294
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,720
being thrown at

295
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,519
organizations related to or partnered

296
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,680
with i should say um the olympics in

297
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,080
this case or your own company in other

298
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:55,600
cases um looking for you know uh domain

299
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,600
squatting type activities is you know

300
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,720
another good use case and there's

301
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,440
actually products um and vendors who

302
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,440
have solutions for social media threat

303
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,120
hunting as it relates to an organization

304
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:05,839
and

305
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:07,360
looking at things that as it could

306
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,360
relate to your own domain but there's a

307
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,880
there's a whole you know another talk

308
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,880
there and a whole another topic that i

309
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,040
am actually still excited to be learning

310
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:18,160
about and still getting into myself but

311
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,760
well great well we would love to have

312
