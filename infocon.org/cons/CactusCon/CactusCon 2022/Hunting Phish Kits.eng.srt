00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:05,520
hello everyone my name is josh rickard

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:07,200
and today we're going to be talking

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,920
about hunting fish kits

4
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:12,320
so a little bit about myself

5
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,880
um well i have a background in digital

6
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,760
forensics and incident response um i

7
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,480
started in the system administration

8
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,920
you know what actually helped us and

9
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,720
then moved into system administration

10
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:25,680
then

11
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:26,800
got kind of

12
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,199
moved over to our security team at that

13
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:31,920
place and focus mostly on digital

14
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,760
forensics more than the incident

15
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,040
response

16
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,239
but um

17
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:38,320
love to write a lot of open source

18
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,559
software as much as i can

19
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:43,680
and i love sharing that out um i love to

20
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,960
also automate everything um from my

21
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,559
lights to

22
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:51,360
um posting on social media

23
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,920
i consider myself a

24
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,199
you know open sourcer um and

25
00:00:57,199 --> 00:00:59,760
basically love to contribute back to the

26
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,600
security community it as much as

27
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,359
possible

28
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:07,680
so uh in fact uh that is me uh in that

29
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:08,960
um

30
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,240
unicorn

31
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:15,280
whatever rubber mask um just that way

32
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,960
so

33
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,479
why me

34
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:21,920
you know why should i why should you

35
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,799
listen to me about this topic

36
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:25,600
well

37
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,560
i've fought against fishing at a pretty

38
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,320
large scale um from anywhere from

39
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,159
uh you know

40
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:36,240
a dozen to

41
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,400
up to man i've seen weeks where a

42
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,400
thousand different unique fishing emails

43
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,600
come in

44
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,240
um that's kind of where i i focused the

45
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,720
start of my career was around fishing

46
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:50,159
especially at that scale um back in 2014

47
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:52,720
and 15 you know a while ago

48
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,720
no one really um

49
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,200
cared much about fishing i mean everyone

50
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,680
always cared but but not really at a

51
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,360
huge scale

52
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,240
and

53
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,079
uh during that time you know i was

54
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:06,640
actually out to lunch with a with a

55
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,919
friend of mine and um you know i was

56
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:12,640
mad or you know upset just like man why

57
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,080
can't people

58
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,879
understand and forward

59
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:19,120
an email attachment

60
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,680
a phishing message as an attachment

61
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,959
they'd be like man that would be awesome

62
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:24,560
if like a user could just like click a

63
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,879
button and do it and i was like oh oh

64
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:32,000
crap so this is about uh early 2014

65
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,519
and uh

66
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:35,040
man i'd say

67
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,959
two months later i had the first version

68
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,000
of a open source project to report uh

69
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,760
phishing messages

70
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,319
we implemented it at my past job it went

71
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:46,000
on uh

72
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,840
17 000

73
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,720
plus different desktops and it was all

74
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,200
in like bb script and you know it was

75
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,440
kind of crap but but it worked right

76
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,760
and so during that i actually released

77
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,800
it uh publicly and then a few months

78
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,120
probably about a month later um i had a

79
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,000
company fish me uh or co-fence and they

80
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
actually reached out and uh offered me a

81
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,239
position to kind of manage and take

82
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:13,280
their um version which was much better

83
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,159
um to the next level uh currently at

84
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:17,920
that point they only had you know a

85
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,000
million insoles or so

86
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,920
i took that from

87
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,640
me and my team of course um

88
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,680
of eight plus people uh took that from

89
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,239
one million to about 18 million uh

90
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:32,959
installs globally by the time i left um

91
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:34,560
and i think it's much much larger than

92
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,400
that now

93
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,920
so i've also automated a lot of phishing

94
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,480
response um by creating a lot of

95
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,560
different tools to interface with

96
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,920
microsoft exchange outlook itself

97
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:51,200
um as well as you know gmail and and

98
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,439
several other tools both on the client

99
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:55,360
side as well as you know through graph

100
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,080
api and and so on and so forth

101
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,200
so

102
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,280
that's a little bit about my background

103
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,000
around fishing uh i'm still you know

104
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,480
very much a part of that community um i

105
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,480
haven't contributed as much because it's

106
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,959
not really my primary focus anymore um

107
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:16,959
it's more of a hobby and a passion so

108
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:19,358
all right now let's talk

109
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:21,199
about the structure that we're going to

110
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:22,720
talk about today

111
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,000
so there's going to be several different

112
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,440
sections we're going to go through some

113
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,400
things

114
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,680
but

115
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,240
pretty much what it boils down to is

116
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,320
that you know we're all the same we're

117
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,280
all fighting the the same kind of um

118
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,320
battles

119
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,280
and

120
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,880
we're all victims

121
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,639
everyone has been a victim no matter if

122
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:42,800
you're the smartest person in the world

123
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,080
you've been a victim in some capacity

124
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,080
maybe not directly maybe you're maybe

125
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,520
your users maybe um you know maybe you

126
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,520
have been uh impacted directly but

127
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,400
either way we are victims

128
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,240
and if you're listening to this talk

129
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,039
this is very much a blue team on defense

130
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:02,800
uh talk but

131
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,280
in that respect we're all defenders

132
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,880
no matter who you are

133
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,240
if you're a user

134
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,800
um all the way to you know a sock

135
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,000
analyst to a manager to ciso um we're

136
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
all defenders and we're all trying to

137
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,759
protect ourselves as well as people that

138
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:22,960
are within our organization

139
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:24,960
but

140
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,880
because of those challenges and because

141
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:30,160
we're um victims and and we try and

142
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,639
we're passionate and we

143
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:34,800
attempt to you know protect and serve

144
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,479
we're going to talk about you know we're

145
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:37,600
on our own

146
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,400
um

147
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,360
but

148
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,160
there's some positive to that

149
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,240
where we need to actually get together

150
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,320
and start communicating and we'll go

151
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,759
into that

152
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:50,000
finally i'll just kind of wrap it up um

153
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,080
with the conclusion so just wanted to

154
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,840
give you a structure before we start

155
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,320
diving in

156
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,680
we're all the same

157
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,000
you know i i've talked about this uh

158
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,120
previously now we're all

159
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,639
the we're all trying to you know defend

160
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,479
or um

161
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:12,720
defend against a similar practice or a

162
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,680
similar attacks um imagine

163
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,160
as an analogy that we have a an

164
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,680
apartment building

165
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,800
and that apartment building has you know

166
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,120
individual apartments where they're

167
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,600
pretty much the same yeah they may have

168
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,680
different things inside of them they may

169
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,560
have different locks and different doors

170
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,199
and and different security measures

171
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:36,800
you know but

172
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,440
internally we're all the same

173
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,800
you know we have

174
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,000
authentication meth mechanisms we

175
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,560
um have patching we have windows we have

176
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,520
mac we have all these kind of core

177
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,680
components of networking

178
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,639
where

179
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:54,319
we really are

180
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:58,160
all the same if you boil it down

181
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:00,639
again

182
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:04,880
we we as as defenders we are you know

183
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,720
trying to protect our little house our

184
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,240
little border

185
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,280
we we put up you know the best firewalls

186
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:15,120
the the you know the best ids the the

187
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,400
exchange and email filters and and so on

188
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,120
and so forth and when we try to protect

189
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,880
as much as possible

190
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,440
because it's our realm it's our little

191
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,080
slice it's our little home

192
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:28,880
and

193
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,759
we we continue to do this over and over

194
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:34,639
and over we're we're kind of not really

195
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:37,840
making a lot of you know headway um we

196
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,120
are

197
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,280
implementing a lot of different tools

198
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,520
the latest and greatest whatever

199
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,720
but

200
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,160
it continues to rise and we continue to

201
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:52,000
you know fight ag against this and again

202
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,599
we may have different structures and we

203
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:56,000
may have different tools and utilities

204
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,879
and money and and resources available to

205
00:07:58,879 --> 00:07:59,680
us

206
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,800
but

207
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,720
when you boil it down

208
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,639
our apartment is just like another

209
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:07,840
apartment in that building

210
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,960
so imagine you know you've been out

211
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,759
there and uh you're let's say on

212
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:16,639
vacation or you you took a break

213
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:19,520
whatever and all of a sudden you get

214
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,879
fished you know you there's a mass uh

215
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:25,520
a mass attempt to try to

216
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:29,280
exfiltrate or penetrate your network

217
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,360
and so you're out there man you know

218
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,519
you're just trying and trying and trying

219
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:35,679
to you know defend but hey you're on

220
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:38,640
break and so a lot of the times you know

221
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,399
if you're in security you probably know

222
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:41,279
this

223
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:43,599
it's not typically a nine-to-five job it

224
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:45,200
is a life

225
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,920
um a lifestyle and so

226
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,240
you know you probably break out maybe

227
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,880
you don't good for you um a lot of

228
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,320
people are not fortunate enough to do

229
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,480
that

230
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:00,640
but what it boils down to is that again

231
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,200
we're all in a similar situation

232
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,800
and we're all victims

233
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:08,080
uh whether you know they're trying to

234
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,839
attempt to

235
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:12,880
fish us for intellectual property

236
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:17,440
uh maybe data uh maybe money um

237
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,399
maybe content whatever it is

238
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:22,399
they're all trying to

239
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:25,839
you know attack and gain a foothold or

240
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:26,800
um

241
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,279
you know have some sort of leverage uh

242
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:30,640
against you

243
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:34,240
and it comes down to

244
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,279
being

245
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:37,200
fairly similar but we need to actually

246
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,760
communicate to to make this to make this

247
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,959
work in reality

248
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,399
and no matter what

249
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:49,279
if you know let's say you are yeah you

250
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:50,560
know they're stealing everything

251
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,680
hopefully they're not trying to steal

252
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,959
your baby

253
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:55,760
um but um you know

254
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,200
they're always trying to take something

255
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,160
from you right that's the end goal why

256
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:03,959
else would they want to

257
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,040
it'd probably look like this

258
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,640
you know i i just love this image um

259
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,120
they they you know have uh

260
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,600
hoodies and ski masks right

261
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,279
uh i mean maybe but but typically not

262
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:20,640
you know they're

263
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,600
um

264
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,760
they're just people just like us

265
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,160
um a lot of them a lot of organizations

266
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,040
or a lot of uh groups actually have you

267
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,440
know rotation they have hours they're on

268
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,399
shift

269
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:35,040
um and they um

270
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,640
it's not just some guy in a basement

271
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,959
sometimes it is but large-scale

272
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:42,480
operations are are managed and and

273
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,360
some even have you know paid time off

274
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,720
just like us you know um or or i don't

275
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,480
know if they go as far as health care or

276
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,959
anything like that but um

277
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:54,399
you know they they have a lot of

278
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:55,920
benefits

279
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:59,279
and it is again a lifestyle they know

280
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:01,120
when we're on and they know when we're

281
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,320
off

282
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,959
vice versa

283
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:07,200
again

284
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,079
we're always you know we have we we are

285
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:12,079
the same and we're trying to defend

286
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:15,839
against um you know our organization

287
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,160
we may implement some of the biggest

288
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,959
tools out there we may put the fanciest

289
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:24,160
you know locks on our doors we may uh

290
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:27,200
put you know sensors everywhere you may

291
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,959
even change um you know physical uh

292
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:32,800
you know appearance of things

293
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,800
um we may put you know decoys out there

294
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,120
um we may do all these different things

295
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,680
but we're all trying to you know defend

296
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:45,200
against um our organization and in our

297
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:49,200
little slice of of heaven

298
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,279
typically you know when you're in an

299
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:54,240
organization this is a very very uh you

300
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,279
know high level uh diagram

301
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:59,360
that i wanted to show where you know

302
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,200
typically you're going to have some sort

303
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,720
of uh process outlined uh to defend

304
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,120
against fishing just like you do with uh

305
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,160
you know

306
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,959
hopefully like tabletop exercises or you

307
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:12,959
know how you handle evidence as far as

308
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:15,200
digital forensics

309
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,360
so on and so forth so

310
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,360
typically you're going to have a user a

311
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,000
user receive that that phishing message

312
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,720
they're either going to notify you uh by

313
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,760
let's say an outlet plug-in uh you know

314
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,000
to to report that message or maybe

315
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,079
they're just forwarding it on um like

316
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:34,639
they would uh normally

317
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:37,760
some way of notifying you

318
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,320
all that typically goes into that

319
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,240
centralized mailbox

320
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,040
um and part of that centralized mailbox

321
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,560
we may have

322
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:50,160
rude or accrued automation around

323
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,120
um

324
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,040
you know extracting attributes from that

325
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,600
message like the receipt from headers

326
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,880
the senders the reply to

327
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,120
attachments links in the body you know

328
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,519
so on and so forth

329
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:06,079
at that point we may do some sort of you

330
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:08,320
know threat intelligence lookup maybe a

331
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,600
buyer's total

332
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,480
hybrid analysis wherever it's at

333
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,680
and if we've made a decision that a it

334
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:18,480
is malicious at that point or is you

335
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,880
know suspiciously malicious

336
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,440
um we may you know block it in the

337
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,000
firewall we may take that action you

338
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,800
know drop that url no matter what

339
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,760
or we may actually go even further or

340
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:35,360
both of deleting that message from your

341
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,279
that user's mailbox or all users

342
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:40,240
mailboxes um whether that's an exchange

343
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:44,240
or gmail or or wherever um we attempt to

344
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,920
prevent others

345
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:50,479
from falling victim to to that um threat

346
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,800
so all of this is pretty common

347
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,800
right and

348
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,839
some may not have this automation it may

349
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,240
honestly just be manual process where

350
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,600
you're

351
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,680
downloading that mill or that email um

352
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,240
you know open it up in notepad plus plus

353
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,440
or visual studio or wherever and um you

354
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,079
know inspecting it manually doing those

355
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:17,120
lookups

356
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,279
you know making that decision

357
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:20,800
hopefully you get to the point where you

358
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,360
can automate that um it'll it'll speed

359
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,199
up your response and your capabilities a

360
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:27,519
lot so you can focus on other things but

361
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:30,240
if you can't i totally understand i've

362
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,120
been in that situation

363
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:38,399
we also as part of our defense uh you

364
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:40,880
know we attempt to

365
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,320
automatically

366
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:47,199
uh try to congrat or to train our users

367
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:49,600
so i'm not saying that that you have to

368
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,600
but i think that training users is a

369
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,120
very good thing it's it's all

370
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,399
opinionated

371
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:56,240
there is some science behind it but but

372
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,160
there's also a lot of um

373
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,600
[Music]

374
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,600
uh opposite views

375
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,720
of that but i think that you know

376
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,279
you you can train and you should train

377
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:09,360
i've actually written uh several blogs

378
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,920
about this where um you need to train

379
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,839
your users but you need to

380
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:15,839
not punish them for failing

381
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:19,680
right it is literally a game um

382
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,800
a gamification of you know

383
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,360
defense make them be part of the

384
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,399
organization make them out of um

385
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:31,440
passion for protecting themselves as

386
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,720
well as everyone else in the

387
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,959
organization so

388
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:37,040
i won't go into too much detail with

389
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:41,199
that but um i love this this image um

390
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:43,120
i don't know who made it or or where it

391
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,519
came from but um

392
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:46,880
if you can't

393
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,120
the i.t department congratulated me on

394
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,880
not opening the phishing test email

395
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,839
today me who hasn't checked my

396
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:57,360
i i just think that's awesome

397
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,079
so we've all been you know attacked

398
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:03,839
right uh both from uh vendor perspective

399
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,360
as well as you know

400
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,360
physically or or i mean not physically

401
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,279
but like um you know from the phishing

402
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:10,959
attack but we've all seen these kind of

403
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:13,279
you know new tools being thrown at us

404
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:15,759
all the time like blockchain enabled

405
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:17,680
zero i mean zero trust is kind of a

406
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:18,800
thing but

407
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,880
quantum

408
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,320
i don't i just threw out a whole bunch

409
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:25,440
of things but you know neural network

410
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:29,680
detection you know so on and so forth

411
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,920
i think that you know we we see all

412
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:35,199
these words all the time um

413
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:37,360
but you know do they really solve

414
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,560
anything

415
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,639
um you know some of them may

416
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:43,279
but at the same time yeah they're kind

417
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:44,959
of overwhelming

418
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:46,480
right

419
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,240
we're we're again

420
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,120
all

421
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,079
uh being attacked uh no matter where

422
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:54,639
we're at whether it's from you know a

423
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:56,240
vendor side or

424
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,440
from you know the actual malicious um

425
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:02,959
attackers but we're always trying to you

426
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:04,720
know we want to defend as much as

427
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,120
possible

428
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:11,520
so before we get into too much uh

429
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,119
more i wanted to kind of give you a

430
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:15,439
baseline of what i'm talking about

431
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:18,319
you know when we talk about fishing kits

432
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:19,280
you know

433
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:23,039
we need to understand what that means

434
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:27,599
a fish kit is typically going to be a

435
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:31,120
zip file or some sort of file

436
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,600
that or even a phishing as a service the

437
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,360
p-a-a-s

438
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:38,640
that is a thing but it's going to be a

439
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:42,480
set up files that can be easily deployed

440
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,360
by

441
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,880
um

442
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,799
a threat actor

443
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,480
that um

444
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,559
you know maybe mimic a service like

445
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:53,840
paypal or office 365 or

446
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,600
some bank or

447
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,000
you know wherever whatever it is

448
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,919
but what they do is they can actually

449
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:03,360
upload you know that that zip file up to

450
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:06,240
you know the web server extract it

451
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:09,200
and then all their files are right there

452
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,960
ready for them and they just have to do

453
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:13,120
maybe a little bit of configuration like

454
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:16,000
like modify a text file or a json file

455
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,760
and they're off to the races

456
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,120
that's it

457
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:22,480
and um those kits are you know

458
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:25,039
very in complexity um they have a lot of

459
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:26,720
other features and we'll go into that

460
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,400
but i want to give you a

461
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,640
baseline of what it looks like or you

462
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:34,480
know what what it contains

463
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:39,039
my explanation of what a

464
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:40,320
baseline

465
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,640
deployable web app is going to look like

466
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,960
or or what a fish kit is there's a

467
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,200
deployable web application

468
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,440
it's really literally a set of tools

469
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,120
that an attacker

470
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,320
can deploy

471
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,520
uh to

472
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,840
build or make a phishing exploit or

473
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:59,120
attempt against an organization

474
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,080
so

475
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,000
you can think of again it's it's that

476
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,400
zip file that's super easy to deploy

477
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,080
some even have automation you know

478
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,200
around them

479
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,360
just depends

480
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,960
typically they're going to have you know

481
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,520
some sort of image folder there

482
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,120
um because they don't want to actually

483
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,600
call back to your paypal or whatever

484
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,919
that organization they're trying to mock

485
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:24,640
because they can actually track them so

486
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,960
um what they do is they'll embed those

487
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:30,480
images in um in a folder and reference

488
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,280
them from there

489
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:35,760
additionally they're going to have like

490
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,120
an ht

491
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,039
access file if you're not familiar with

492
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:42,960
htaccess uh basically says who can who

493
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,760
can access these files or who can access

494
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,039
this site

495
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:49,760
um they'll typically deny a lot of

496
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,000
ranges because those are known bots like

497
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,799
from google or from wherever

498
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:55,679
but

499
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:57,440
typically they're pretty

500
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:57,720
um

501
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,120
[Music]

502
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,600
static

503
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:05,039
but i'll show you in a little bit why we

504
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:08,240
should pay attention to this

505
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:12,240
they also will have like a robots.txt uh

506
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,679
again these are typical uh web

507
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:17,679
files that you will find

508
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:19,600
basically you know hey these are the

509
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,159
user agents that we will allow

510
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:24,480
um you know in this example they're

511
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,400
allowing all but a lot of the times

512
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,320
they'll try to restrict those like

513
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,919
restrict python

514
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:33,360
um as a user agent in any request

515
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,200
so on interpreter

516
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,000
they'll also you know disallow access to

517
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,320
to certain files

518
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,480
or certain paths

519
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,840
on that site

520
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:46,159
funny enough

521
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:47,120
um

522
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,200
they don't actually well a lot of times

523
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,080
they do not disallow access to the dot

524
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:55,200
zip that they uploaded and extracted so

525
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,760
this is becomes a um

526
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:02,760
extremely valuable resource for us

527
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:07,360
again they'll have some crude um some of

528
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,360
it's pretty pretty advanced uh don't get

529
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,480
me wrong

530
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,400
some of it's very crude um here's an

531
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:16,679
example of this uh anti-bots.php

532
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,640
most notably i want to say that with

533
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,120
fishkits a lot of the the code base is

534
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,960
going to be

535
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:27,919
some javascript css html and mostly php

536
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:28,880
um

537
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:31,520
not sure why um i'm guessing because

538
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:34,799
it's just super easy to use but um

539
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:38,159
yeah i'm just not a fan of ph

540
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:40,080
you know and with this anti-bots they

541
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,720
will actually look for you know again

542
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:46,400
words or maybe in the http request

543
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,080
headers maybe they'll look at user

544
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:51,200
agents ip ranges so on and so forth

545
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,280
and they call this an anti-bots

546
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,720
file because they're they're just trying

547
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,159
to stop

548
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:58,880
people from finding out what

549
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,720
the type of site is

550
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:04,480
uh and if you can see i i love the echo

551
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:07,840
statement i think it's on line 50. um uh

552
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,760
just i'm not going to really repeat it

553
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:14,720
but uh come on it's pretty awesome

554
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,799
they'll also have sometimes depending on

555
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:18,080
you know the different sites uh

556
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,400
depending on what they are um though i

557
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,000
actually have some credit card

558
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,880
validation in there um it's it's crude

559
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,360
some of it's sometimes advanced but in

560
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,360
this example they're just trying to find

561
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:32,480
an amex card or a visa card or whatever

562
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,440
and and

563
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:36,480
they do this based on you know common

564
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,480
knowledge

565
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,360
one of the cool things that they

566
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,120
actually have

567
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,640
is logs

568
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,840
um

569
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,840
one of the things that they you know for

570
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:52,480
testing and forever else they can

571
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:55,679
actually track those individual logs

572
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:59,039
um what that means is that when a user

573
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:01,440
submits some data or you know enters

574
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,880
into the form

575
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,520
um they'll actually you know track what

576
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:09,280
their ip user agent what link they went

577
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:12,000
to blah blah blah

578
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,039
but

579
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:14,799
when um

580
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:16,240
and any questions are answered you can

581
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,720
see at the bottom but

582
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:21,440
i i don't know why but

583
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,640
sometimes when they're zipped up and

584
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,799
when they're made they test from these

585
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:26,640
certain uh vpns

586
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:30,080
and and they leave those logs in there

587
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,720
so you get the original ip at the person

588
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:36,400
that was testing this uh fish kit along

589
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:39,120
with the new log that that was created

590
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:42,000
so very strange uh but

591
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,760
good for us um

592
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,360
you know we can actually use that that

593
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,440
information to peek around a little bit

594
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:50,440
further

595
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:55,039
also sometimes you're lucky and you get

596
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:57,600
all the wares that you you get you know

597
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,919
everything uh sometimes it is literally

598
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:01,919
a staging ground uh sometimes they're

599
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:03,600
even you know

600
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,919
a lot of people have compromised one

601
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:06,799
host

602
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:08,159
and are

603
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:10,240
offering up you know lots of different

604
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,000
uh phishing kits

605
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,559
on one web server um

606
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:15,360
but

607
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:18,240
in this example this was like some

608
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,559
website but um you can see that there's

609
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:22,320
a logs file there

610
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,760
but then it had tons of different

611
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:27,360
powershell uh exploits or objected code

612
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,720
that would download

613
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,440
other things and you know go from there

614
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,919
but um it was very very interesting to

615
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:37,279
see to see this is a while ago but um

616
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:39,440
yeah so sometimes you'll come across

617
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,679
this

618
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:45,279
but my absolute favorite

619
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:47,600
is the ascii yard

620
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,919
and it's really valuable um

621
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:51,919
it doesn't seem like it is but you can

622
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:54,559
see that they have different versions of

623
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:56,320
these fish kits or they will have

624
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,720
different groups that are making them

625
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,640
and you can actually track that over

626
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:03,200
over time which is very very interesting

627
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,960
uh they'll have certain groups uh

628
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:07,120
certain um you know

629
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:10,880
functions uh are added or removed um and

630
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,600
you can actually look at um some of them

631
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,600
even uh i think this work

632
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,440
uh work hard

633
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:21,520
uh by zetas oh i don't know um it

634
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,760
basically he had a he had a facebook

635
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:26,640
um for his his kit so

636
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,600
um

637
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:28,640
yeah

638
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,080
pretty funny

639
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:32,880
anyways uh i i just love the damn art i

640
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:36,080
mean it's just classic

641
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,880
like i said mid

642
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,480
you know that's a little bit about uh

643
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,400
fish kits in in general

644
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:45,840
um but what we want to you know try to

645
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:49,600
prevent is from them stealing our data

646
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:50,640
right

647
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,880
where we we are trying

648
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:56,400
our best to protect and and serve

649
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,880
ourselves as well as

650
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,880
you know the people within

651
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:03,760
our organization

652
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:06,799
we're all defenders

653
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:09,520
we're all trying to defend against

654
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:10,640
something

655
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:13,600
whether that is you know a straight um

656
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:16,240
phishing attack or whether that is you

657
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,360
know a

658
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:20,000
more advanced attack but

659
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,400
in in hindsight or or

660
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:25,279
you know as defenders we're passionate

661
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:28,080
and we want to defend we want to help

662
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,559
you know it's just just how it's it's

663
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:32,799
the nature of who we are

664
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:36,080
and um you know we try our best to

665
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:38,400
defend and we implement you know the

666
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,880
best tools and the best things

667
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,600
but when it boils it all down no matter

668
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:44,799
what you do

669
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:45,840
we're all

670
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,840
defenders

671
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:48,720
but

672
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,400
as you know

673
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:54,000
we're all drowning we're all overloaded

674
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,720
by the amount of data coming at us the

675
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:59,200
amount of the lack of resources the lack

676
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,159
of um i hate to say this but bodies

677
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:04,799
um you know to to manage some of this

678
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:07,840
stuff um we don't even have time to you

679
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:10,159
know write automation or you know write

680
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:12,320
code or or you know

681
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,840
dive into things because we're just

682
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:16,400
inundated by the amount of data

683
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,399
um i worked at an organization where

684
00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:22,240
there was five of us for uh man um

685
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,360
i'd say

686
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:27,679
overall 30 to 40 000 you know users

687
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:29,600
for a security team

688
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,120
just fine

689
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:33,440
how do you manage that you just can't

690
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:37,120
it's just overwhelming so um

691
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:39,120
you know we

692
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:42,799
we try our best um from a you know

693
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:44,559
security perspective

694
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:46,159
but we need help

695
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:49,279
right we have to help up

696
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:50,880
but

697
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,720
no one is coming

698
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:55,039
no one's going to save us

699
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:58,080
all these tools out here all the things

700
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,320
that are that are going to work um you

701
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:04,080
know they do reduce a lot of the false

702
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,399
positives they do help i'm not saying

703
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:09,279
they do do not but it does not solve the

704
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:10,880
problem

705
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:14,240
it hasn't and i don't think it will

706
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,559
and we need to understand that that no

707
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:19,600
one is going to come and we're not going

708
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,520
to buy a product we're not going to buy

709
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,760
things that um

710
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,200
are going to save us

711
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,640
just not

712
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,399
there's things that are going to help

713
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:31,360
for sure no matter what

714
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,559
but

715
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:34,720
they were not going to be just it

716
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:37,520
fishing is not going to go away

717
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,559
because

718
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:40,399
of a product

719
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:42,879
it's not

720
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:44,960
again we're going to look at you know

721
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:48,320
that baseline uh process that we that we

722
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:50,000
would typically have

723
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,080
but i i think that this is a really

724
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:55,200
great you know process again train your

725
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:58,480
users um you know have a way for them to

726
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,799
report messages um

727
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:05,360
build some rude or crude uh automation

728
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:07,279
around it or you know implement an

729
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:08,640
automation tool

730
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:11,200
um whatever it is but but have kind of

731
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,760
that that baseline process

732
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:16,159
and i think all of that is really

733
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:19,440
critical um and still extremely useful

734
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:22,399
for for everyone no matter what

735
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:24,840
but i also think

736
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:28,799
that we need to take it a step further

737
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:31,279
we need to add some little um components

738
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:32,240
here

739
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,559
so if you can see at the very very top

740
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:37,279
um i added hunt for fish kids

741
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:39,840
what i mean is that we need to go out

742
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,520
and when we get that email we're

743
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:45,039
extracting things we need to go and grab

744
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:46,240
that kit

745
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,880
as soon as possible or grab as much data

746
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:52,799
from that site as soon as possible

747
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:54,960
because there's well there's a lot of

748
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,720
reasons uh

749
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,000
number one

750
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,399
you now have insight of who is actually

751
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:01,919
attacking you what what kits they're

752
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:04,320
using uh maybe not the individual

753
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,640
but you have you have insights and how

754
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:09,279
they're they're attacking um how they're

755
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:11,760
attempting to um get into your

756
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,360
organization what are they using what

757
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:16,158
tools are they using

758
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:19,840
at that point you also have access to

759
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:23,039
other information like logs

760
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:25,919
now once you actually have

761
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:27,360
those logs

762
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,520
then you can actually

763
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:33,200
take that information and understand who

764
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,960
may have felt victim within your

765
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,880
organization

766
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:39,679
you have clear insight and you know who

767
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:42,399
who filled out the form maybe no one did

768
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:43,600
great

769
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:46,399
but also at the same time you know other

770
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:48,080
organizations that may have felt victim

771
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,399
as well or other people

772
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:53,039
so using that that information and that

773
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:55,919
data helps us build

774
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:56,919
a

775
00:30:56,919 --> 00:31:00,000
repository let's say of intelligence

776
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,840
around

777
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:04,559
who is attacking us how are they they

778
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:07,279
they doing it um are they you know just

779
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:09,039
looking for are they just trying to drop

780
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:10,799
software or are they just trying to get

781
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:13,039
you know financial information

782
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:15,120
those are completely different uh ways

783
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,399
that we need to handle or is it just

784
00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:19,279
mass spam man uh mass fishing like it

785
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:21,679
can be totally maybe it's not targeted

786
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:23,919
i mean it is in some way but but not

787
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:25,840
like very very specific

788
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,360
but um

789
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:29,440
we need to grab as much information as

790
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,360
we can from from that source at the

791
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:32,720
get-go

792
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:33,760
and build

793
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:37,120
a um i'm going to say crude like

794
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:39,600
database or repository excel sheet

795
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:42,320
whatever maybe even just a file share of

796
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:44,320
this information because it's really

797
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:45,600
going to help

798
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:48,158
going forward

799
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:53,600
we're all you know

800
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,919
being being hit from everywhere more

801
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:57,440
we're all

802
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:01,279
trying to um you know attempt to

803
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:04,399
defend and and block these things but

804
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:07,200
i think that what we need to do

805
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,440
as uh security professionals and

806
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,440
security teams is that we need to fight

807
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:12,399
back

808
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:14,480
not in a literal sense you know there's

809
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,799
some legalities there and i'm not going

810
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:17,600
to

811
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:20,320
uh tell you to go and and

812
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,240
take down a server

813
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,480
or you know

814
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:27,120
do any sort of um

815
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:30,080
malicious act against those people

816
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:30,799
but

817
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:33,039
we need to fight back

818
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:34,880
we have to fight back

819
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,559
all the things that we're doing

820
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:38,080
are not going to stop it it has gone

821
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:40,720
through all of your filters it you know

822
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,559
people have reported it

823
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:43,440
great

824
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,279
but we need to start tracking and and

825
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:48,880
providing some some attribution um to

826
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:51,679
these individuals

827
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,240
i mean don't go

828
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,720
like i said don't go like

829
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:57,519
uh

830
00:32:57,519 --> 00:32:59,760
stab somebody or or

831
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:02,320
in other words don't go and and

832
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:06,960
um you know literally attack back um

833
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,720
you know there there's some gray area

834
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:12,480
there um you know we

835
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:16,480
i i don't know if yeah hack back or not

836
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,640
um is up to debate but there's some

837
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:20,240
legality issues you have to be worried

838
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,440
about but

839
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,440
we need to to fight back

840
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,399
and

841
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:26,720
we need to take that information that

842
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:29,600
that we have gathered from those kids

843
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:34,320
and and fight back in a in a real way

844
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:37,120
and i understand you know you may not

845
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:40,000
have time you may not have the resources

846
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,799
to do so um and i'll share some

847
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:44,240
information about that in a little bit

848
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:47,200
but we need to actually fight back as

849
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:50,679
security professionals

850
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:53,279
again

851
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:54,720
we're on our own

852
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:57,120
no matter what i mean no one is going to

853
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:59,840
come and save us so we need to band

854
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:01,039
together

855
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:03,120
we need to share information we need to

856
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,080
talk

857
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:06,080
no matter what we're all fighting the

858
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,200
same fight

859
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,719
yes it's different different attack

860
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:11,199
vectors everyone wants to hoard data

861
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:13,280
you know everyone wants to afford this

862
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:15,599
kind of threat intel for whatever reason

863
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:16,800
i

864
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,480
never really understood it

865
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,879
but when we're looking at

866
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:23,760
we're all trying to yeah extract you

867
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,280
know details about your organization

868
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:28,079
like like buzz it out whatever well we

869
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:30,320
need to actually take initiative and

870
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,399
then start talking and building this

871
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:34,399
because it's not going to solve itself

872
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:36,639
and we cannot expect a vendor to

873
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:39,839
automatically do this for us

874
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:44,159
i'm a big believer of you know ttps but

875
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:46,879
i also want to say that i do not think

876
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:49,359
that irc's are dead

877
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:51,760
um there's a lot of iocs and fish kits

878
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,918
that we can actually utilize to to our

879
00:34:53,918 --> 00:34:55,359
advantage

880
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:57,839
and what i typically like to say is that

881
00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:00,800
iocs are for active defense

882
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:04,400
um yes we should focus on ttps um

883
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:07,280
techniques um tactic tactics techniques

884
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,560
and procedures

885
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:11,040
but at the same time we should also be

886
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:13,040
looking at these iocs because it's about

887
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:16,880
an active attack active um

888
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:19,599
active defense

889
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:22,320
for example tracking fish kit names and

890
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,000
versions

891
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,760
you know if you can track this over time

892
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:28,960
then you get visibility into maybe uh

893
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,720
they serve maybe they start blocking

894
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:32,880
your ip because they notice it and their

895
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,240
logs

896
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:36,160
maybe they start changing the way that

897
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:38,240
they handle what their antibodies

898
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:40,560
because of that maybe they just change

899
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:41,839
the content

900
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:44,800
tracking that allows us to have a better

901
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:45,839
insight of

902
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:48,880
what they're seeing and and how we're uh

903
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:51,520
going after that information as well as

904
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:52,800
um

905
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,320
fighting back

906
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,440
logs

907
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:58,000
again logs are super awesome and super

908
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,119
critical you can look at you know ips a

909
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:03,040
lot of the time they'll have user agents

910
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:05,839
um they'll have you know who fell victim

911
00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:08,160
so on and so forth

912
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:10,720
you can also now you know that you know

913
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:13,040
this host look at the hosting providers

914
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:16,400
and then do reverse lookups from there

915
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,160
really good information

916
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:20,880
um track who is an art app

917
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:24,480
who is art app is a new form um

918
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:27,599
of who is info uh about that host the

919
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:30,400
domain so on and so forth

920
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:33,119
and um email addresses that that were

921
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:36,160
used uh to forward any of that captured

922
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:38,880
content what i mean by content

923
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:41,440
is that someone filled out that form

924
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,599
and they hit submit

925
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:46,400
then you know they are capturing that

926
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,160
information and they're not leaving it

927
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,760
straight on that server yes they may

928
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,280
have a log of it but they're forwarding

929
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:55,839
it off to some sort of email address

930
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:59,280
here's an example

931
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:01,520
this is a little bit different than the

932
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,040
others

933
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:05,520
this is a encoded

934
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,680
as you can see basics foreign coded

935
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:08,640
string

936
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:13,119
that was rot 13 then gz inflate rod 13

937
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:16,240
and yeah like

938
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:19,599
most of the these kits are being used by

939
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:22,560
um i like to call um

940
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,480
they are threat

941
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:27,040
actors but um

942
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,480
typically

943
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,000
an individual

944
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,520
when i talk about okay they have the

945
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,839
victim the individual and then the

946
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:34,880
builder

947
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:35,760
so

948
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:38,480
the individual will submit that form and

949
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:41,040
that form is typically that that fish

950
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:43,440
kit is bought by some sort of builder

951
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,920
and that that throat actor is deploying

952
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:49,599
it and um using it for their game

953
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:51,920
but what they don't know because they're

954
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:54,640
typically not super technically

955
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:55,520
you know

956
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:56,320
uh

957
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:58,160
mature

958
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:59,920
they um

959
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:02,720
they actually have done this base64 uh

960
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:05,520
encoding and and all of this and when

961
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,760
you decode it

962
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,040
i love this

963
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:10,960
um it looks like

964
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:13,280
this

965
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:16,320
they have literally um

966
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,119
back

967
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:19,599
so what i like to call it they have

968
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:20,840
backdoored the

969
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,240
[Music]

970
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:23,359
um

971
00:38:23,359 --> 00:38:26,400
the hackers are hacking the hackers

972
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,000
like that they have literally uh

973
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,079
obfuscated certain email addresses that

974
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:32,400
anytime someone submits that form

975
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,920
uh the victim

976
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,920
uh the the attacker will get it that

977
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:38,720
that bot and is using that that fish kit

978
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,320
uh they'll get the information maybe

979
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,160
credit card information username and

980
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:44,240
password but at the same time they're

981
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:46,960
also afforded on back to the builders

982
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:47,920
so

983
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:50,240
and a lot of times those builders have

984
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:51,839
infrastructure and automation around

985
00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:54,160
that that that they can um just

986
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:55,440
automatically use that credit card

987
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:56,640
information

988
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,160
on the flight

989
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:00,560
um so there's a

990
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:03,280
lot of um complexity here it's just

991
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:06,720
funny um the hackers literally the

992
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,720
the hackers are hacking the hackers it's

993
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:11,879
it's awesome

994
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:18,320
again we're you know all in the same

995
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:19,760
boat

996
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,760
we're all trying to defend our little

997
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,760
slice of heaven our little you know

998
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:24,960
apartment

999
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:27,520
we you know again have different locks

1000
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:29,280
uh different tools within our

1001
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:32,320
organization different capacities um

1002
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:35,359
different resources both uh physical and

1003
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:37,599
and uh you know virtual

1004
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:42,400
uh we also have a lot of um you know

1005
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,400
different defensive capabilities

1006
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:47,119
depending on you know the size of an

1007
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:48,240
organization

1008
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:50,400
but we're all essentially the same

1009
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,079
no matter what

1010
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:55,960
we're all just trying to defend

1011
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:00,000
what i think that we need to to go and

1012
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,520
start doing

1013
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:03,440
is taking this approach where we're

1014
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,680
gathering this information as much as

1015
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:07,839
possible from the get-go

1016
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:10,400
and start collecting it man

1017
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:11,839
even if you're just

1018
00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:13,520
hoarding that information that that's

1019
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:16,720
fine um i mean ultimately you need to

1020
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:19,920
have the baseline uh image that i showed

1021
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:22,240
previously without the hunting for fish

1022
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:23,440
kits

1023
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:25,520
you need to have a way for a user to you

1024
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:28,240
know report a message you need to have

1025
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:31,520
some sort of uh extracting

1026
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:33,440
automation you you should you know

1027
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:36,079
automate the looking up of those ips or

1028
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:37,760
whatever in

1029
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,520
your threat intelligence or tip or

1030
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:40,720
wherever

1031
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:42,880
and maybe even go as further you know

1032
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:45,440
hey if it's malicious or or whatever you

1033
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:47,119
know blocking firewall and delete from

1034
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:49,359
exchange you know have like some crude

1035
00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:52,160
automation around it

1036
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:54,240
but i also think that we should start

1037
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:56,079
collecting this information as much as

1038
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:57,599
possible and there's a lot of different

1039
00:40:57,599 --> 00:40:59,440
ways that you can do this

1040
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:01,280
once you do that you need to share that

1041
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:03,040
information

1042
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:06,400
we're all trying to protect you know the

1043
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,240
via the whole

1044
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:09,119
um

1045
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:10,960
again we're all different we're all

1046
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:13,680
different but we need to protect

1047
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,599
each other because no one else is going

1048
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:17,680
to come and see this

1049
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:21,440
so we need to save each other

1050
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:24,319
my you know i you may work um you know a

1051
00:41:24,319 --> 00:41:26,880
different location let's say energy or

1052
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:29,200
finance or wherever it is

1053
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:32,319
um or in government

1054
00:41:32,319 --> 00:41:34,720
they have different um different threat

1055
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,000
models

1056
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,800
and so we need to still though protect

1057
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,560
because some other organization some

1058
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:42,400
other apartment building may get broken

1059
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,839
into

1060
00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:45,280
right so

1061
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:47,119
we've already seen that

1062
00:41:47,119 --> 00:41:49,760
we have encountered this typically a

1063
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:52,000
threat actor will go from one to the

1064
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:52,800
other

1065
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,880
now just keep going down the list

1066
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:57,359
and so we can use that information that

1067
00:41:57,359 --> 00:41:58,960
someone higher up in the future maybe

1068
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:00,720
they are the first to get attacked by

1069
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:02,880
this way or or whatever

1070
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:04,480
you need to start sharing that

1071
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:05,920
information

1072
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:08,000
even if it's redundant it doesn't really

1073
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,160
matter it's it's still useful

1074
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:11,359
information

1075
00:42:11,359 --> 00:42:13,119
because it's going to be slightly

1076
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:14,400
tweaked it's going to be different

1077
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,880
domains different ips different senders

1078
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:19,200
blah blah blah but we can start tracking

1079
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:21,119
this information across different orgs

1080
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:22,880
and how they're actually

1081
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:23,920
um

1082
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:24,880
fighting

1083
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:26,720
or how they're

1084
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:28,319
attacking

1085
00:42:28,319 --> 00:42:31,839
across verticals

1086
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:34,400
there's a lot of different ways that we

1087
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:36,240
can help them

1088
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:39,040
right if you can take this that whole

1089
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:41,040
process let's say you have your entire

1090
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:44,079
process all the way down and you have it

1091
00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:46,480
uh automated and you can you can hunt

1092
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:47,920
for fish kits you want to go a step

1093
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:49,200
further

1094
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:51,200
i've taken it a step further in my own

1095
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:53,920
regard where i can start pulling data

1096
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:57,119
from certificate transparency logs or

1097
00:42:57,119 --> 00:42:59,280
uh who is information look at every

1098
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:00,720
single domain

1099
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:02,240
dumpster fire

1100
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:05,200
well don't go to paceman but uh web

1101
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:08,000
analyzer fire hole ip block list you

1102
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,240
know start looking at those sources and

1103
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:12,079
beating them back in and you can start

1104
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:13,839
gathering a little bit more information

1105
00:43:13,839 --> 00:43:16,800
being more proactive against these

1106
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:20,640
threat actors than you were previously

1107
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:23,119
also there's several different other

1108
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:24,640
ways that you can do it one of the

1109
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:27,280
biggest i think is from twitter

1110
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:30,079
um you can use these hashtags um and

1111
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:32,480
actually you know like open dir means

1112
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:35,760
open directory or open index or uh if

1113
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:37,040
you've ever seen a page where it says

1114
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:40,000
index of and it lists all the files um

1115
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,480
that that's an open directory

1116
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:45,040
you can search for just fishkit

1117
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:47,280
or a phishing kit

1118
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:49,680
and you'll get a lot of different people

1119
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:52,079
posting online and

1120
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:54,000
you know sharing that information back

1121
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,920
and that's what we need to get to we

1122
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:57,760
need to take that information that we've

1123
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:00,079
gathered and start sharing it back

1124
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:02,720
as soon as possible so other researchers

1125
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:04,240
other people can start building

1126
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:06,079
detection rules can

1127
00:44:06,079 --> 00:44:09,839
capture and track this information

1128
00:44:09,839 --> 00:44:12,800
okay some examples

1129
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:15,040
here's from from twitter you know you

1130
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:16,640
can see that they're using fishing

1131
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:17,760
fishing kit

1132
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:20,000
whatever open door and they're sharing

1133
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,319
these urls and they're sharing sometimes

1134
00:44:22,319 --> 00:44:23,680
they're doing screenshots and all that

1135
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:25,760
you don't even have to get to that but

1136
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:28,480
just share that url and share the path

1137
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:31,760
hey we just saw this um we're seeing you

1138
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:34,000
know someone trying to redirect a chase

1139
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:34,880
or

1140
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:37,040
paypal wherever it is

1141
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:38,240
here it is

1142
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:39,680
let others do it

1143
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:42,720
they love to do it i love to do it

1144
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:43,680
so

1145
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:45,359
to share it back

1146
00:44:45,359 --> 00:44:49,400
is always going to be useful

1147
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:53,040
one of the things that i wanted to to do

1148
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:54,160
to help

1149
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:55,119
uh

1150
00:44:55,119 --> 00:44:56,880
help you all

1151
00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:00,079
is i created this little tool um

1152
00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:02,480
it's all in python but it's called tweet

1153
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:03,680
fish

1154
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:05,920
and go out there and use it um you'll

1155
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:08,160
have there's some directions about like

1156
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:10,480
getting uh twitter information you'll

1157
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:12,960
have to get some api keys but

1158
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,960
um you can actually once you configure

1159
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:17,200
it uh you and

1160
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:20,400
it shows you all that um save the config

1161
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:22,880
pass in all those tokens uh and it'll

1162
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:25,520
save it to you know this uh yam or json

1163
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:28,240
file i can't remember and um the next

1164
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:31,599
time that you get any sort of uh url

1165
00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:33,280
then you can actually just all you have

1166
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:35,040
to do in your command console or

1167
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:37,359
whatever is tweet fish

1168
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:40,480
tweet and then the url

1169
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:43,200
that's it and it'll post to twitter for

1170
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:45,359
you

1171
00:45:45,359 --> 00:45:46,640
all you have to do so the next time you

1172
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:48,640
get a phishing email you see some sort

1173
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:50,480
of uh url

1174
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:53,359
um then you just paste it in there along

1175
00:45:53,359 --> 00:45:55,280
with that command and

1176
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:57,040
then go on to the next one

1177
00:45:57,040 --> 00:45:58,720
but at least you're sharing it it's very

1178
00:45:58,720 --> 00:45:59,680
quick

1179
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:01,200
very and uh

1180
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:03,520
you know unobtrusive like it's not gonna

1181
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:05,359
mess with your your operations your

1182
00:46:05,359 --> 00:46:06,960
day-to-day you know

1183
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:08,960
it is just gonna share that information

1184
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:11,440
as quick as possible so others can

1185
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:13,839
insert uh investigating if you just

1186
00:46:13,839 --> 00:46:16,400
don't have time

1187
00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:19,440
also

1188
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:22,160
i want to say that you can you can send

1189
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:23,280

00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:28,400
um

1193
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:32,280
it is uh l0phius

1194
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:35,119
protonmail.com

1195
00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:37,920
um and i will look at it

1196
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:39,839
order that email to me send me a link

1197
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:40,880
whatever

1198
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:44,480
i'll start looking at it and i'm i'm

1199
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:45,680
currently hooking it up to some

1200
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:48,640
automation anyways so um send it off man

1201
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:50,079
and and um

1202
00:46:50,079 --> 00:46:51,760
i'll take a look at it and i'll all

1203
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:53,839
gather the data and post it back and

1204
00:46:53,839 --> 00:46:55,520
share it out

1205
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:57,680
just you need to share this information

1206
00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:01,359
we have to start protecting each other

1207
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:04,160
it's also a lot of other tools out there

1208
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:06,480
to help you know automate some of this

1209
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:09,359
um you know your addition catcher

1210
00:47:09,359 --> 00:47:12,319
fishing kit hunter stock fish i mean

1211
00:47:12,319 --> 00:47:14,560
there's tons and tons of them there just

1212
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:16,000
go uh

1213
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,720
go on github and search like all github

1214
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:21,280
for the word fishing or fish

1215
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:24,480
with ph oh man there's tons of tools uh

1216
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:27,200
tons of utilities tons of

1217
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:30,319
databases of fishing i mean

1218
00:47:30,319 --> 00:47:33,680
the the uh there's a repositories of

1219
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:35,440
phishing kits out there that you can

1220
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:36,480
look at

1221
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:39,760
um so tons of tons of tools out there

1222
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:41,920
and a lot of people are focusing on this

1223
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:46,160
we just need to get it at a bigger scale

1224
00:47:47,359 --> 00:47:49,119
one thing that i did

1225
00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:51,280
um it's a little out of date so i

1226
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:54,160
apologize but there are a lot of cool

1227
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:56,559
critical pieces in here um

1228
00:47:56,559 --> 00:47:59,359
but i built a tool and i'll share a link

1229
00:47:59,359 --> 00:48:01,839
of this but it's called troll

1230
00:48:01,839 --> 00:48:04,720
and it is a docker compose of multiple

1231
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:08,160
different containers that um stand up

1232
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:10,000
for you so you just run like docker

1233
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,400
compose up and it'll stand it up for you

1234
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:14,720
again there's some you know bugs and i

1235
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:15,839
haven't touched it

1236
00:48:15,839 --> 00:48:17,520
in a while so

1237
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:19,040
bear with me

1238
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:21,920
but uh one of the things is that you

1239
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:23,200
have spotter

1240
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:24,800
spotter will actually go from any of

1241
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:26,400
those sources

1242
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:29,440
and what it does is based on a schedule

1243
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:32,880
we'll go out and throw them into a queue

1244
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:35,599
which then trawler will

1245
00:48:35,599 --> 00:48:38,240
it's another container will pull and

1246
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:40,240
start scraping those sites

1247
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:42,400
for you and start gathering those kits

1248
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:43,839
as much as they can

1249
00:48:43,839 --> 00:48:46,559
and then saving them into a mongodb

1250
00:48:46,559 --> 00:48:48,640
which we call entrails

1251
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:51,040
which is then used across other services

1252
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:54,319
but um go check it out um again

1253
00:48:54,319 --> 00:48:55,920
there's some

1254
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:57,280
there might be some build issues i

1255
00:48:57,280 --> 00:49:00,480
haven't looked at in a while but um at

1256
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:02,079
least you can start if you're into

1257
00:49:02,079 --> 00:49:04,400
python and docker and you understand how

1258
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:06,480
all that works um there's some really

1259
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:10,160
good uh code in there for free

1260
00:49:11,599 --> 00:49:12,800
again

1261
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:17,599
you know i wanted to just explain that

1262
00:49:17,599 --> 00:49:19,920
fishing and then fishing kits are you're

1263
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:21,839
not going to be sold by

1264
00:49:21,839 --> 00:49:23,920
any certain tool don't get me wrong

1265
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:27,040
vendors and and

1266
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:29,760
secure email gateways

1267
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:31,520
all of these tools are really going to

1268
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:32,640
help

1269
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:34,960
diffuse a lot of the noise but

1270
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:36,079
attackers are always going to find a

1271
00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:37,839
winner no matter what

1272
00:49:37,839 --> 00:49:40,000
you can have the best locks in the world

1273
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,760
you can have the best security systems

1274
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:44,400
in the world you gonna have you know all

1275
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:46,559
the staff that you ever need

1276
00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:48,800
um but they're still gonna find a way in

1277
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:51,760
right uh but we have to protect as much

1278
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:54,079
as possible and we have to start not

1279
00:49:54,079 --> 00:49:55,680
just protecting us

1280
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:59,280
we need to protect others around us

1281
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:01,119
i mean you can even and i want to say

1282
00:50:01,119 --> 00:50:03,520
that you can even start with

1283
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:06,000
just you know your local group maybe you

1284
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
have a little hacker group or

1285
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,680
just a local community you can even

1286
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:12,400
start there if you wanted to

1287
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:14,400
we're all going to get attacked

1288
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:16,079
right we're all

1289
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:18,720
uh getting chased by a bear like we're

1290
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:21,520
constantly just beat um

1291
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:22,240
we're constantly

1292
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:23,520
[Music]

1293
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:25,680
hit with with different attack vectors

1294
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:28,000
all the time and just the data alone

1295
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:28,960
yeah i mean

1296
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:30,480
it's hard to automate it's hard to wrap

1297
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:32,640
your head around it's complex

1298
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:35,599
um and we um

1299
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:37,440
but we're all trying to just defend as

1300
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:38,839
much as

1301
00:50:38,839 --> 00:50:41,839
possible but we need to understand that

1302
00:50:41,839 --> 00:50:43,280
even though we are getting attacked and

1303
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:45,520
we implement all those tools

1304
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:48,319
no superhero no one is going to come and

1305
00:50:48,319 --> 00:50:51,520
actually you know save us from day one

1306
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:54,960
so we need to talk

1307
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:57,599
we need to share with between us

1308
00:50:57,599 --> 00:50:59,920
we are the experts

1309
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:00,800
yes

1310
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:03,040
you know maybe some vendors maybe they

1311
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:06,240
are you know i i think that automation

1312
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:08,480
and all the other capabilities are are

1313
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:09,599
critical

1314
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:11,920
and they're going to help

1315
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:14,240
but you still have to build that and you

1316
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:16,240
still have to you know automate that and

1317
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:18,319
you still are going to have false false

1318
00:51:18,319 --> 00:51:19,520
positive and you're still going to have

1319
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:21,280
a lead through but

1320
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:23,359
no matter what you do whatever data you

1321
00:51:23,359 --> 00:51:25,760
do get share it

1322
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:27,680
like we need to fight back

1323
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:29,280
because these tools aren't just going to

1324
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:33,200
solve it we are going to solve it

1325
00:51:34,319 --> 00:51:35,520
so

1326
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:38,559
in kind of a synopsis here um again my

1327
00:51:38,559 --> 00:51:41,040
name is uh josh rickard you can find me

1328
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:45,920
at ms uh for microsoft administrator

1329
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:49,599
um damn it simi uh semifish

1330
00:51:49,599 --> 00:51:52,800
i will take them and i will process them

1331
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:55,119
and i will share them for you if you

1332
00:51:55,119 --> 00:51:56,559
don't have time

1333
00:51:56,559 --> 00:51:58,640
um again those two tools that i

1334
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:01,200
mentioned i have uh tons and tons uh

1335
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:03,760
more i think like 150 or something like

1336
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:04,640
that

1337
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:07,040
open source tools but um you can go to

1338
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:09,680
tweet fish tweet fish

1339
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:10,480
or

1340
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:12,640
swim lane which is under the swimlane

1341
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:15,280
umbrella troll t-r-a-w-l

1342
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:16,960
and that's that big doctor composed

1343
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:19,280
thing that i was talking about so

1344
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:20,480
um
