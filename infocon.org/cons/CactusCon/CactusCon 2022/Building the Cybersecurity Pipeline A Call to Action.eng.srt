1
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:13,120
can everybody hear me okay

2
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:14,639
all right perfect

3
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:16,960
so i am extremely cognizant that i am

4
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,119
the last thing between you and whatever

5
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:20,480
after uh

6
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,240
session activities you're gonna be doing

7
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:24,480
so hopefully i don't put you to sleep um

8
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,960
we always talk about be brief be

9
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,119
brilliant be gone i can only promise you

10
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:30,880
two of those things

11
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,079
you can figure out which ones are going

12
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:32,960
to be

13
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,480
so my name is paul wagner i'm with the

14
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,000
university of arizona please don't judge

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,399
me i understand i'm in sun devil country

16
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:40,320
um

17
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,800
but i really want to talk about

18
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,399
a kind of a problem and it's already

19
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:46,559
been discussed a number of times today

20
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:48,719
so i like this winding road that's on

21
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:50,399
here because that's a lot of people's

22
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:52,079
pathway into cyber security where they

23
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:54,160
came from how they got to this point and

24
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,559
what's going on and ideally when we

25
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:58,640
talked to i talk to my students it's

26
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,640
like well tell me the path how do i get

27
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,120
there what do what do i do it's like

28
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,199
yeah it doesn't work that way

29
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:07,600
so my journey started in the army i grew

30
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,400
up in the midwest where it was farming

31
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,439
maybe a manufacturing company or college

32
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:15,680
and i wasn't a college person at that

33
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,759
point so when i joined i got to about

34
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:19,200
halfway through i was getting ready to

35
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,240
get out

36
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,400
i was a infantry person a recruiter i

37
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,320
had my master's degree i'm like i'm

38
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,000
going to rock it fortunately it was

39
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,360
2008.

40
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,200
taking a 30 thousand dollar pay cut

41
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,880
wasn't really in the cards for me so i

42
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,560
went to another country and it worked

43
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,000
out better than i could have possibly

44
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,240
imagined but that was humbling to go

45
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,759
through and think that i was going to

46
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:39,439
get that job that i was going to do that

47
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:41,439
thing and it wasn't in tech it was just

48
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:42,640
getting out i thought i had the

49
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,399
credentials that i needed to be

50
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:46,079
successful

51
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:48,079
so fast forward i did learn something

52
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:50,079
like infantry is probably not the most

53
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:52,079
versatile skill to kind of transition

54
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:53,840
into the workforce and i'm like well i

55
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,520
need to do something tech

56
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,680
so i became a communications officer

57
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,439
it was great but i was a communications

58
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:01,439
officer i was a manager

59
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:03,360
so i had my soldiers that would look at

60
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,560
me like

61
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,920
can you do this i'm like i don't even

62
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,119
know what you're talking about you speak

63
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:09,758
this lingo what do i need to do so it

64
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:11,760
was always this game of ketchup to do

65
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,200
what i needed to do to be able to figure

66
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,520
out what were they talking about to lead

67
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,520
them in the best way that i could

68
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,760
um transitioning towards the end i was

69
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,400
in an intelligence unit and

70
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,280
my journey into cyber kind of began with

71
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,720
literally being cornered in a parking

72
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,640
lot which may sound very confusing but i

73
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,560
was offered an opportunity to take some

74
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,319
free classes like do you want to do this

75
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:35,519
pen testing class i'm like yes yes i do

76
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:36,959
so i went over to this class i'm walking

77
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:38,879
out and the director of the program uh

78
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:40,400
came up to me and said

79
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,280
i think you can teach i'm like okay

80
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,480
he's like

81
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,000
why are you standing so close to me can

82
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,319
you please move back and uh it was dark

83
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:50,080
it was after hours but it worked out

84
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,080
great so during that time i got into

85
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,840
cyber i've done a lot of things to try

86
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,000
to prepare myself but it was a winding

87
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
road and that's where we kind of come

88
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,239
into this and i put this v sizzo thing

89
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:02,000
on there because it was another one of

90
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,920
those opportunities reached out on

91
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,440
linkedin i said

92
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,200
hey do you think i can do this the guy's

93
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,360
like absolutely you'll be fine like that

94
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,040
imposter syndrome kicking and why would

95
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,560
somebody listen to me why does somebody

96
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,879
want to be involved in this

97
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:17,120
so when we're looking at this it becomes

98
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,720
of what the problem is and we're really

99
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,080
here for

100
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,480
500 000 plus positions domestically

101
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,760
they're open

102
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,480
3.5 million positions globally

103
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,599
we'll talk about some of these other

104
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:29,760
things that are listed here but that's a

105
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,400
problem but it's also the marketing so

106
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,920
when my students come to me it's like

107
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,280
they try to do the math and they're like

108
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,480
okay so 5 500 000 jobs if i apply if i

109
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,159
get this degree you're going to give me

110
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:41,519
a job right

111
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:42,879
no that doesn't work that way either

112
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:44,080
what are you going to do to set yourself

113
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,760
for for success how are you going to

114
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,080
take this stuff and do it

115
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,400
so real quick this is on here and i got

116
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,400
a couple of slides but just raise your

117
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,840
hand is cyber security an entry-level

118
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,720
job

119
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,840
what are your thoughts yes raise your

120
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:02,159
hand so there's two out of

121
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,400
so two out of 50 that think that this is

122
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,720
an entry-level job okay

123
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,560
so but why isn't it why do we have

124
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,159
entry-level positions that are listed

125
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:13,519
out there and what does that mean

126
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:16,560
so cyberseek.org says

127
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,399
you look at that left hand side there

128
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:20,639
feeder role it means that no cyber

129
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:23,280
security isn't an entry level role you

130
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,280
should have background in one of those

131
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,759
things that then transitions into entry

132
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:28,800
level

133
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,759
but is is that right according to the uh

134
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:33,199
participants here

135
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:34,720
that's about right that's probably a lot

136
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,320
of people's journeys they had some

137
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,240
experience and some background that took

138
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,800
them to that situation and now they can

139
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,040
kind of figure it out but what does this

140
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,120
do for the person like myself i wasn't

141
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,360
willing to take a 30 000 pay cut to get

142
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,840
out of the army in 2008. i couldn't do

143
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,919
it i couldn't support my family but what

144
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:53,680
about people that are in this situation

145
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,600
where they took a career path that

146
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,600
career path for whatever reason covid it

147
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,000
just the industry died and they were

148
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,120
making 50 60 70 000 a year and the

149
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,479
answer to them is

150
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:06,000
well good luck you're going to be on the

151
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,400
help desk for 15 an hour it's not going

152
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,000
to happen so how do we create those

153
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,840
barriers we say that we can do this this

154
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,680
is an inclusive environment for us to do

155
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,639
it

156
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:16,479
but is that the reality and how do we

157
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:18,800
make it a reality

158
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,680
so indeed says that an entry-level job

159
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,759
requires minimal education training and

160
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:25,039
experience

161
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:28,320
so this 2019 study looked at 12 000 jobs

162
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,000
they scraped all of these websites and

163
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,840
the information that's on here

164
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,360
is what they said

165
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,280
60 percent needs a college degree

166
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,320
required not preferred required well

167
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,240
okay so that's is that entry level what

168
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,759
are we talking about here

169
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,680
then on the right we see certifications

170
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,600
another easy answer or question that i

171
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,960
get from students is

172
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,880
what certification should i get first

173
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,720
it's like okay yes yes there's

174
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,080
certifications and we'll talk about that

175
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,680
a little bit more but

176
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,120
there isn't a right answer there isn't

177
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,120
this path this magical way that i'm

178
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,720
going to become the stock analyst this

179
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,600
sizzo this whatever your job goals are

180
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,319
but there is some discrepancies 2019 to

181
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:06,800
where we're at a cissp requires five

182
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,560
years of minimum experience in some kind

183
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,880
of itn management but

184
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,479
five percent of the jobs as an entry

185
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,400
level require five years of experience

186
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,080
then why are we classifying it as that

187
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,400
entry level position

188
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,840
so i pulled some job ads and i was

189
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,919
actually pretty pleased with this so

190
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:24,160
we've seen a reduction well at least in

191
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,800
my brief analysis of what are the key

192
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,880
skills what are the requirements so on

193
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,800
this slide here you see degree not

194
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,639
required we would like some basic

195
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:33,840
experience

196
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:37,280
willing to seek cissp okay well that's

197
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,880
another strange one it's like no degree

198
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,960
no experience nothing but you need to go

199
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,720
through this after five years what are

200
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,639
we doing so a little bit of discrepancy

201
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:46,840
there so we're talking like where is the

202
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,720
miscommunication here's another one

203
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,720
qualifications none

204
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,120
8570 get your security plus do something

205
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,240
like that and we're going to be able to

206
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,360
have you work for the government okay

207
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,120
minimum requirements one year

208
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,919
internships classes projects i like this

209
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:03,599
so not only do you not have to have that

210
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:06,000
actual experience but they're looking at

211
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,840
what did i do outside of the traditional

212
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,160
educational realm to be able to get some

213
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,000
experience and that's valuable you may

214
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,240
even learn more for that so how do we

215
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,639
look at that kind of stuff

216
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:18,240
and then how do you express it is

217
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,919
another thing that i think students

218
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:21,360
struggle with or anybody that's going

219
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,039
into it doesn't have to be students how

220
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:24,720
do you articulate the skills that you

221
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,639
spend whatever your lifetime is whether

222
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:27,520
it's

223
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,240
you're 18 20 or you're 60 trying to make

224
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,759
this transition how do you articulate

225
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:35,919
and here's another one experience hack

226
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:37,599
the box try hack me i've seen a lot of

227
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:39,919
linkedin profiles i'm top five percent

228
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:41,919
and try hack me i'm top one percent in

229
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:43,360
this

230
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,520
that's a way for you to differentiate

231
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,440
yourself in some way to be able to do

232
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,160
the things that you're trying to do

233
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,160
okay so what do i need so again i work

234
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,520
with a lot of students i try to be

235
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,759
mentor to them i work with an

236
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:57,599
organization called vetsec.org where

237
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:59,199
they're trying to get

238
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:00,560
individuals

239
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,560
no veteran that wants to get a security

240
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,360
job should go without that kind of a job

241
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,599
they offer free training they just got

242
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:11,440
approved for a work study with sans like

243
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:14,960
apply here go here 2500 bucks

244
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,479
it's interesting how many people took

245
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:18,400
advantage of that opportunity

246
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,960
it was one it's like wait what

247
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,319
i'll take it but

248
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:24,160
what are we doing here so do we need

249
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,759
education here's kind of that big thing

250
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:27,520
the spider-man meme pointing at each

251
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,879
other like no no you need this you need

252
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:31,520
this you need this you need education

253
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,120
okay so let's go back to that raise a

254
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,279
hand is education the most important

255
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:36,640
piece for being a cyber security

256
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,839
professional who thinks

257
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:40,399
yes

258
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:43,039
okay good no hands are up here

259
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:44,480
well what about certifications it's

260
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,080
obviously certifications if i am

261
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,040
certified if i'm comptia i'm isc squared

262
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,279
that means i'm a cyber professional our

263
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:53,200
certification's the best indicator of

264
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,120
somebody's knowledge skills and ability

265
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,519
anybody say yes

266
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:59,760
okay again no okay good

267
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,640
experience is this the end all be all is

268
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,480
it all about the experience if you have

269
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,959
that experience what does that mean and

270
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:08,080
i'm going to define this a little bit

271
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,760
before i ask the question

272
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,000
is experience solely defined by the job

273
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,080
that you had you must have been a sock

274
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,760
analyst you must have been

275
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,080
an i.t specialist a help desk operator

276
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,600
is that the definition of experience

277
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,440
that we're looking for so if based on

278
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,440
that definition is that a yes is that

279
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,800
the level of competency that we're

280
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,959
looking for

281
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:29,200
no okay so we're looking to be more

282
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,360
inclusive but then there's the and

283
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,120
well i need to belong to a professional

284
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,399
group do i

285
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:36,399
no it's a means to an end skill

286
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:38,160
development capture the flags coming to

287
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,320
conferences figuring out what's going on

288
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,160
building a computer doing something

289
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,360
above and beyond the structured

290
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,519
curriculum that's there and trying to be

291
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:48,160
better at your craft

292
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,320
networking here's a big one cornered in

293
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,480
a parking lot okay that i don't know if

294
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,760
i would call that networking but it

295
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,839
worked out for me okay um

296
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:57,440
linkedin reaching out to that connection

297
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,680
to say hey what are your thoughts that

298
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,200
was networking

299
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,519
why am i here today um i actually just

300
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:05,680
got a reminder from sand saying that

301
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,279
congratulations on graham this is your

302
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:09,920
one year anniversary so ryan was my

303
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,839
instructor for this so i texted him i'm

304
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:13,120
like hey man i know we talked

305
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,720
appreciated your class what are your

306
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,160
thoughts about this as a topic for

307
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,079
cactus connie's like sure let's do it

308
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:19,440
how's the sausage made what are we going

309
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,560
to talk about

310
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,480
that was networking figuring out who

311
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,640
would give you the opportunity

312
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,480
to do something like this

313
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,079
and then volunteering

314
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:30,240
so i look out here and i see one of our

315
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,720
students who is volunteering so i put in

316
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,880
a discord channel saying hey

317
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,320
again after talking to ryan we've done

318
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,680
it for two years now

319
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,480
can i advertise volunteer jobs

320
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,560
yes we need as many people as possible

321
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,000
to help us out because it doesn't run

322
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,120
itself

323
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,519
those are the differentiations between

324
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:49,519
what people have that experience that we

325
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:51,760
talked about but you learn you network

326
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,079
you bring all of these pieces together

327
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,680
so that you can be that cyber

328
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,279
professional the most well-rounded

329
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:58,800
person so when you go and you fill out

330
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,560
your resume it's not that you have 10

331
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,240
years of experience it's

332
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,160
i am that person that is willing to do

333
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,000
whatever it takes to be your best

334
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,120
employee but i need a chance i will work

335
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,959
for you and you've demonstrated that it

336
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:12,320
can't be the

337
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,000
well i promise i'm going to work really

338
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,720
hard when you hire me it's like no no

339
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,000
put some skin in the game what did you

340
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,920
do to get here

341
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,720
so how do i get there so i i like

342
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,079
backwards planning okay then maybe

343
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:25,440
that's a military thing where it's like

344
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,880
i need i know i need to go take that

345
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,720
hill to go do that thing

346
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,480
well okay but what's our goal it doesn't

347
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,079
have to be like this huge mission where

348
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:33,519
i'm going to go invade another country

349
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:35,120
and all that kind of stuff is it a

350
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,920
degree is it a cert is it a job it could

351
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,399
be something as simple as a project

352
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:42,800
i want to be able to write hello world

353
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,760
okay that is a step and that can be very

354
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,600
intimidating to some people like i am

355
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,519
not a computer science person so when

356
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:50,639
they're like oh you need to build this

357
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:52,639
algorithm i'm like

358
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:54,160
what is that i don't even know what

359
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,279
you're talking about an algorithm it

360
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:56,480
sounds like this fancy thing that's

361
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,440
going to like

362
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,000
rocket ships and things like that

363
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,760
it reminds me of my first job as an

364
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,760
officer was in space command before

365
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,040
space force there's still a space

366
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,040
command there's rocket scientists and

367
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,399
they're like so you need to go talk to

368
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:09,760
them about the orbital mechanics and the

369
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,120
thrust to get the satellite and how long

370
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,959
it's going to be i'm like you lost me so

371
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:15,120
i'm like hey you're really smart at this

372
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,639
you're going to come to this meeting and

373
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:17,920
i'm going to look at you i'm going to

374
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,000
parrot you i'm going to learn from you

375
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,200
but i'm going to make sure that you're

376
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,279
my champion so that we can do this so

377
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:24,880
you got to have a goal

378
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:25,760
and then you need to do a

379
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,959
self-assessment i am very cognizant of

380
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:31,200
my strengths and my weaknesses

381
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,639
but if you don't take that time to

382
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,560
self-assess you have no idea how to

383
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,399
build your plan

384
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:38,240
to get to where you need to go so you

385
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,160
need that goal you need to bring it back

386
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,880
but i like smart okay because i see a

387
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,720
lot of people like

388
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,639
first course that they ever took i'm

389
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:50,399
gonna go get graham um or gxpen or

390
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:52,880
whatever i'm not a programmer

391
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,639
some reason i signed up for gx pen that

392
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:56,480
did not work out really well in my favor

393
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,079
but it was a stretch i knew it was going

394
00:12:58,079 --> 00:12:59,200
to be

395
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,200
a challenge for me to go through that so

396
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,279
what is that goal is it achievable

397
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:04,800
saying i'm going to have a degree in two

398
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,480
years and you've never taken a college

399
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,839
class

400
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:10,000
maybe but it's not really achievable and

401
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,920
is it timely that's another thing that

402
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,120
people forget is as they're going

403
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,720
through this whole process

404
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,959
that

405
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:18,480
you've got to put a time limit on it i

406
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,480
i'm a procrastinator like i was having

407
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,839
conversations with some people in this

408
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:23,440
room and i'm like yeah my slides aren't

409
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,959
done yet i'm figuring out what's going

410
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:26,079
on i don't know what i want to talk

411
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:27,279
about

412
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:29,120
but here we are slides are there so

413
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,480
we'll figure out how well this goes i'll

414
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,240
get some feedback after this but it

415
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,560
needs to be timely if it wasn't for this

416
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,240
conference i wouldn't have put these

417
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,600
slides together i wouldn't have made

418
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,199
this go through

419
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:41,040
so some other things i'm not saying that

420
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,199
education is the end-all be-all it's one

421
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:45,360
tool to be able to get to the goal that

422
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,320
you have

423
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,160
and there are some standards not all

424
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,399
education institutions not all programs

425
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:52,079
in those institutions are created

426
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:53,920
equally but there's some things that you

427
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,440
can look at to determine what's a better

428
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,760
program than others so the center of

429
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:00,480
academic excellence cae community

430
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,160
goes through and designate school based

431
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,760
on a list of criteria so the schools

432
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,519
have to apply so they actually took that

433
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:07,760
initiative to do that again not all

434
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,519
created equally but here's a starting

435
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:11,760
point so when we talk to people and like

436
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,519
how do i get into this industry how do i

437
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,680
go do these things it's like you need to

438
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,760
do some research you need to figure out

439
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,839
what you want and where is the best

440
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:22,320
place there's some of these dots on this

441
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,600
map that's a 60 000 investment or more

442
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,760
plus four years of your life is that the

443
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,040
right path

444
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,639
i don't know

445
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:32,480
and then the certification i love this

446
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,160
slide because people like i need a

447
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:37,440
certification it's like okay maybe 8570

448
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,440
working for the government yes that is a

449
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,760
strict requirement for that well which

450
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,680
one

451
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,120
you look at the slide it makes your head

452
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,399
hurt and these are some of the better

453
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:48,240
ones there's also some where

454
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,320
i i was reading a book it was on pen

455
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,160
testing it's like i wrote this book and

456
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,000
then i wrote this certification and for

457
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,320
an extra 80 on top of this

458
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,399
you can also get this certification i'm

459
00:14:58,399 --> 00:14:59,120
like

460
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,959
who are you and does anybody even think

461
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:03,120
this is realistic there needs to be

462
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,199
value there needs to be a reason why you

463
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:07,120
are getting the certification but it's

464
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,720
one piece of the problem because we hear

465
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,880
in the news like get certified you will

466
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,279
get employment take this boot camp and

467
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:15,680
you will get employment

468
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,360
okay maybe

469
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,880
so what is being done i mean it's one

470
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:19,920
thing to kind of pick these little

471
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,760
pieces apart that's kind of that triad

472
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,279
education experience all of those

473
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:24,480
different things

474
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,320
but there's a lot of amazing things that

475
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,920
are going on to try to solve this

476
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,079
workforce problem and it comes with a

477
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:31,759
lot of innovation

478
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:33,440
so this was a great week i've spent the

479
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,040
whole week up here meeting with partners

480
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,480
trying to build some pathways figuring

481
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,560
out what's going on and i've had more

482
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,959
aha if i was this day old

483
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:43,199
before i knew this and it's been

484
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:45,519
eye-opening so we look at externships

485
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:47,199
and i'll give you one of those examples

486
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:48,639
internships and apprenticeships i'll

487
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:50,320
give you some examples of those

488
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,399
community outreach and development we're

489
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:53,920
looking at different things like micro

490
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,600
credentialing so it shouldn't be that i

491
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,680
need a four year degree it's like i need

492
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,920
the skill where can i get it so that i

493
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,920
can demonstrate that skill immediately

494
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,399
so an employer can look at it and say

495
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:05,759
we'll send you to this because we know

496
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:07,360
as soon as you get back

497
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,560
you're going to be employer you're going

498
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,480
to be a better employer and that kind of

499
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,240
looks at it so we have different people

500
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,680
in this room if you're an employer and

501
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,240
you're not investing in your workforce

502
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,920
how long before they leave what's going

503
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,920
to happen and that's okay you get

504
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,920
turnover but are we investing what are

505
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,279
we doing

506
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:25,680
the last thing on here is the diversity

507
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,320
issue diversity equity inclusion

508
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,560
from my experience and it's hard to say

509
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,720
i'm a white guy from the midwest so i've

510
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,399
had opportunity i get it i grew up in a

511
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:36,560
very poor rural area but i don't know

512
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,639
the struggles of other people but what i

513
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:40,639
have seen is it has become a very

514
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:42,880
inclusive environment i have never seen

515
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,959
a cyber person if you ask them that

516
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:46,480
they're not gonna yeah what do you wanna

517
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,240
know how can i tell you i'll share my

518
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,560
story so figure that story out

519
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,720
and the other piece is cyber safety

520
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,360
so we look at it as like cyber security

521
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,600
and i don't necessarily agree with that

522
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,519
because we teach kids

523
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,440
that put on a helmet before you get in a

524
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,519
car let's buckle you into your seat belt

525
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:05,520
but here take this phone don't worry

526
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,599
about the bad people that are there

527
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:09,039
and they just walk away with it like

528
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:10,959
wait what's happening and then the

529
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:12,799
parents ask the question like

530
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:14,240
where did they learn that i can't

531
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,240
believe that's what they said

532
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,160
what are you doing and it's not even the

533
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,480
content it's the ads that start getting

534
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,839
pushed into it it's all of these

535
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:23,119
different things that kind of create

536
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:25,599
that environment so what do we do i mean

537
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:27,839
it's always these things so of course i

538
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:28,960
get it gotta talk about the university

539
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,039
of arizona but only briefly and it's not

540
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:33,120
because we have the best program we we

541
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,280
have a program i'd like to think it's

542
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,600
the best it is one but what i like about

543
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,280
is the innovation so education kind of

544
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,039
gets a bad rap that it's like theory no

545
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:42,880
we're only going to do this you got to

546
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,200
open the book that's from 20 years ago

547
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,679
read through it take this test good luck

548
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:49,760
now you're a cyber security person

549
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,320
so when we talk about innovation

550
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:55,520
one of our faculty is chris hednegy so

551
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,679
he came to us and he said

552
00:17:57,679 --> 00:17:59,600
well it was agreement and i'm kind of

553
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,600
paraphrasing but

554
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,360
we want you to build a program that you

555
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,880
would hire those students as soon as you

556
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:05,919
came out

557
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:07,679
okay that's that's great he knows what

558
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:09,200
he's talking about he's a great guy he's

559
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,720
very caring

560
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,480
but the innovation came when we had a

561
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,640
company said we will let your students

562
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,400
that have no certifications no

563
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,640
experience conduct a social engineering

564
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,480
test with your guidance

565
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,000
on our company

566
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,080
and it went amazing students got real

567
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,600
world experience they were able to do

568
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,559
these things

569
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:28,799
that's the innovation that's there

570
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:30,240
another thing that's really good is we

571
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,799
set up um university of arizona as a soc

572
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:34,799
security operations center so we set up

573
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:36,640
an internship program for our students

574
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:39,280
either it's paid internship as a student

575
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,840
worker we also have hey i just need some

576
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,120
experience i'll do whatever you tell me

577
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,720
i'll show up 15 hours a week 20 hours a

578
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,480
week just tell me what i need to do or

579
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,919
they can use it for credit so they have

580
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:49,200
three options

581
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,280
so we've had i think it's eight now um

582
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,039
over the last couple semesters they just

583
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:55,039
don't have the ability to take more or

584
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:58,000
they would but two of those are now

585
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,320
full-time employees so we it's kind of

586
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,960
like breeding success we gave them the

587
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,559
opportunity they were the most

588
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:06,400
successful candidates on national

589
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,160
searches because they had that

590
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,679
experience they knew what was going on

591
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:11,520
they were there to protect

592
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,280
those are some good things

593
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,720
we'll deal into some of the pathways and

594
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,120
partnerships but i got to brag on some

595
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,480
of our people

596
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,559
so basha high school so it's here in

597
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:22,240
chandler arizona

598
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,919
the director of that program said we're

599
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:25,200
going to change the world we are going

600
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,720
to do something new and innovative that

601
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,559
nobody else has done before

602
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:31,280
so they set up to the ninth grade

603
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,520
the ability for them to partner

604
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,880
with

605
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:35,760
oh

606
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,160
that's not supposed to happen

607
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,320
bad slides anyways so let's put basha

608
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,960
back on there and we'll talk

609
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,080
they said they're going to partner with

610
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,760
a community college and that community

611
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:46,799
college is going to partner with the

612
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:48,799
university of arizona so a student a

613
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:51,120
freshman will go through this process

614
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,120
shave off time for them they come

615
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,480
through they get certified they get

616
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,000
hands-on experience all of these

617
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,559
programs were designed to be able to

618
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:01,679
give a pathway one option but starting

619
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:03,280
much earlier so they can come out with

620
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,440
that and we're currently working to find

621
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,440
out how do we give them experiences

622
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,440
cyber patriot capture the flag national

623
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,960
cyber league how do we get them that

624
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,720
experience coming through and they're in

625
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,320
the ninth grade so that when they're

626
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:15,600
coming through and they come to the

627
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,720
employers that are in the room they're

628
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:17,760
like

629
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,640
okay i like that how can we get involved

630
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,720
i apologize they're going to be gone

631
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:23,919
chandler gilbert another one of those

632
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:25,200
aha moments

633
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,360
so it's all of the maricopa schools they

634
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,000
will translate certifications into

635
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,520
college credits

636
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,360
and it's a 40 fee for them to be

637
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:36,080
assessed that's newish um it used to be

638
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,440
where you had to pay per credit that you

639
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,520
were getting they're like it took me 15

640
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:40,799
minutes to evaluate why are we going to

641
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:42,640
charge people reducing the barriers

642
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,159
removing barriers making sure that

643
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,000
people can get through this process and

644
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
those credits are transferable to us at

645
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,240
the university of arizona so that person

646
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,559
that said hey i didn't choose education

647
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:54,559
for whatever reason i couldn't afford it

648
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:56,480
i didn't have the grades i got into the

649
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,799
workforce i got my certification i come

650
00:20:58,799 --> 00:20:59,679
back

651
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:01,440
to that educational piece to do what

652
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,679
needs to happen to take that next level

653
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:05,200
maybe i want to be a manager maybe i

654
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,960
want to do these things what is the

655
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,400
answer

656
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,480
so it's a pathway the other thing that's

657
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,720
new i think this was released earlier

658
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,840
this year or something like that

659
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,720
apprenticeships i'm like i don't even

660
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,240
know cyber security had apprenticeship

661
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,760
so what are these mythical things it's

662
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:20,559
like

663
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:21,840
isn't that what you do with a plumber an

664
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:22,960
electrician

665
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:23,760
no

666
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,679
here's some unfortunately there's only

667
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:28,559
one in arizona so if you are a company

668
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:30,720
that's willing to develop these programs

669
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,400
they will send you people to go down

670
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,799
this path line yes it takes investment

671
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:36,559
some of the statistics is

672
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:38,559
96 of the people that complete that

673
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:40,080
apprenticeship program

674
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,919
are the best employees

675
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:43,679
they stay with that company they're

676
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:45,440
engaged with that company they're

677
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,799
they're harder working they're more

678
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:49,360
loyal that's what's coming out of these

679
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,600
and nice will actually advertise those

680
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,440
positions so it'll be national searches

681
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,120
for what's going on i thought that was

682
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,200
pretty interesting

683
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,280
so then we have some great non-profits

684
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:02,240
an arizona cyber initiative so they

685
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,480
actually got a grant this year

686
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,640
working with google and trying to

687
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:09,200
facilitate opportunities down to the

688
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,960
high school but they didn't even say

689
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,960
well we're going to stop there no they

690
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,559
want to partner with the community

691
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:16,159
college and the four-year institutions

692
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:18,720
and anybody to be the mentors for those

693
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,559
high school students so we're pushing

694
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:22,400
that cyber talent to the left we're

695
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,919
getting it younger but then we're

696
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:25,440
encouraging the mentorship the

697
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,200
leadership the skill building as they're

698
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,720
going through that stuff

699
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,640
that's pretty powerful so i had to put a

700
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,159
big plug manny felix so if you need

701
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:33,840
information but there's three different

702
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,200
options the

703
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,039
one on the left if you scan that if

704
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:38,559
you're a high school student i don't

705
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:39,919
might not have anybody but if you have a

706
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:41,600
kid that's a high school student

707
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,480
scan this have them sign up it's a paid

708
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:47,280
opportunity for some of these things um

709
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,400
and i'll talk about another one there

710
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,120
too

711
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:51,520
the instructors they receive a stipend

712
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,679
um and then if you want to sponsor feel

713
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:56,080
free so it's a plug for the organization

714
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,520
they're amazing they're passionate they

715
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,120
travel all over the country all over the

716
00:22:59,120 --> 00:22:59,919
state

717
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:02,559
trying to develop opportunities

718
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:04,240
so they have a

719
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,919
i'm not going to remember the word so

720
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:07,280
i'll just leave it at that awesome

721
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,799
organization this is just one these are

722
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:10,320
the people that i know and like i said

723
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,159
over the last couple weeks i'm like oh

724
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:13,360
my gosh there's another thing there's

725
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,280
another slide how do i add all these

726
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,559
things there's so many great things that

727
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:18,799
are happening so many good initiatives

728
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:20,559
and then pima community college so we

729
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:22,400
heard mary about ego right

730
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,559
so two years ago pima community college

731
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:26,000
said we're going to change the world

732
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,520
again we're going to look at what this

733
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,840
is and you see the picture at the top

734
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:32,400
left that's they built a sock like

735
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,320
screens all over the place computers and

736
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,320
students work with that they are part of

737
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,240
the arizona cyber warfare range which is

738
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,320
where you get that ego piece so not only

739
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,919
are they looking for students so the

740
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:43,679
first time they gave me a tour of this

741
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:44,640
they're like

742
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,039
leave your ego at the door i'm like i

743
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:48,240
don't get it

744
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,000
but people do have an ego it's about

745
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,440
learning it's about collaborating it's

746
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,279
about networking but it wasn't just for

747
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:54,559
the students

748
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:55,600
i

749
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,600
i will mess up that person's name so i'm

750
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,360
going to try

751
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:01,919
i think she was 60 65 years old she was

752
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:03,440
one of the mentors she's like i know

753
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,440
nothing about this but i like being here

754
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,200
because i'm learning and i could be

755
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,960
wrong with the age but it was

756
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,720
inspiring to see somebody that's like i

757
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,080
don't need to be a cyber professional

758
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,760
but i like what's happening and i like

759
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,120
being here to help

760
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,960
so that's kind of impressive how are we

761
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,480
building this

762
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,559
ability how are we building these skills

763
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:22,159
that these are working on it and they're

764
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:23,919
working with data they're securing the

765
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:25,919
state of arizona while they're doing

766
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:27,039
this and they're teaching the next

767
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:28,880
generation of cyber professionals and

768
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,159
that's just a few of the great things

769
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:32,000
that they're doing

770
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,679
phoenix chamber of commerce so i was

771
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:36,320
pretty excited to work with non-fam

772
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,480
she's like hey we're going to pay people

773
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:41,200
to come here to learn about this this is

774
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,679
a great partnership with organizations

775
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:45,600
industry they actually pay they put a

776
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,360
stipend in so that students

777
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,760
get money to come learn about cyber

778
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,360
it starts at 16 i think they'll take

779
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,039
younger but

780
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:55,200
looking to connect people to get that

781
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,679
advocacy out to find those champions to

782
00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:01,279
be able to move this mission forward

783
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:03,679
so it comes up with a pathway

784
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:05,360
actually looks pretty good up there

785
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:08,240
so a pathway is one option but we need

786
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,240
to figure out how do we change it and it

787
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,360
was funny because i was standing in the

788
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,360
back and kind of listening to people

789
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:14,400
talk and while i've been at this

790
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,240
conference like i just need people to

791
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,000
have a couple of skills they're really

792
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,760
good at it they have some passion they

793
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,120
can do it

794
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,039
okay but how do we create that how do we

795
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:24,640
create that opportunity how do we figure

796
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,080
out what's going on

797
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:28,720
so this overlay is just following

798
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,320
regular grade school but how do we

799
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,159
introduce that cyber safety as soon as

800
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:34,000
we hand them some technology and

801
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,279
sometimes we're not handing them

802
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:37,600
technology

803
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,200
when my daughter was about to be born i

804
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,720
was in

805
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,159
i think babies r us i think it was still

806
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:43,760
open at that time probably not so much

807
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,840
anymore but it was like push a button

808
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:46,799
and

809
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:48,480
the stroller would like collapse i'm

810
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,039
like what are we doing and it would like

811
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:52,720
move on its own i had a remote control

812
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,840
i'm like

813
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,840
okay that's kind of weird and that was

814
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,600
eight years ago so that was not really i

815
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,679
mean iot was there but really what are

816
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:02,080
we doing and how many

817
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:04,000
baby monitors are connected to the

818
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
internet how many people have some kind

819
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,840
of voice activated assistant that's

820
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:10,480
sitting in the bedroom of that kid um i

821
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,799
woke up one morning and the heat was on

822
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:15,279
i'm like what is going on

823
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:16,880
my young daughter came and said oh i was

824
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,720
cold so i told google to turn up the

825
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:19,919
heat and i'm like

826
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:22,400
wait okay we need to fix this what is

827
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,480
going on but it was that aha moment

828
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:27,039
again she gave me many um but it was

829
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:29,279
very strange to see what's going on so

830
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:31,039
how do we link these opportunities

831
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:33,200
together how do we give them on the job

832
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,520
experience

833
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,440
who here is a business owner who who

834
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,880
does hiring if you're not a business

835
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,320
owner anybody

836
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,840
okay so we got a few hands in the room

837
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,279
would you hire a 16 year old to come

838
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:45,520
work in your sock or do work for you in

839
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:48,000
a security a lot of head shaking like

840
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:48,960
no

841
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:49,840
i don't know what you're talking about

842
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,279
but that's security risk would you hire

843
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:53,279
an 18 year old

844
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:54,080
okay

845
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,640
people would okay talk to me afterwards

846
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,400
we got some people that we can uh kind

847
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,400
of push down your path there

848
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,159
but that's important how do we do that

849
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:03,600
how do we change that paradigm what

850
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,039
opportunities can we give them to

851
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:06,880
simulate the work experience for them to

852
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,159
be able to do the things that they need

853
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:10,799
to do we often hear like i just can't

854
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:12,480
find good enough people to work for me

855
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,880
like okay well what chances are you

856
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,400
taking what innovations are you doing

857
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,640
how are you changing the paradigm to get

858
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,080
people out there to do what they need to

859
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:20,960
do

860
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,320
so the other piece that this doesn't

861
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,840
really talk about though

862
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:26,720
is a slightly different factor it shows

863
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,880
that seamless progression and i use that

864
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,720
basha community college to four-year

865
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,880
institution model as this

866
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,640
but it doesn't say the 18 year old high

867
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,080
school student that says i'm going to go

868
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,520
join the military and then i'm going to

869
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,520
come back i'm going to go do this path

870
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,039
and then i'm going to come back well the

871
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:42,559
problem with that is and i experienced

872
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:45,200
this is i took all of these steps i'm

873
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,200
like well i want to go do that program

874
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,399
they're like see you need these

875
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:49,840
prerequisites you got to do this and i'm

876
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:50,720
like

877
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,240
okay so i shuffled over to the community

878
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,480
college and i'm taking my first c class

879
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,840
and i take my second one they're like

880
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,679
see but you can't get there because you

881
00:27:57,679 --> 00:27:58,960
didn't do this now you need to go back

882
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:01,200
and take this math paul does not do math

883
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,679
calculus is not my friend so

884
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:06,240
i it it stopped that progression they

885
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:09,039
said no they didn't say well what if we

886
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:11,200
can do this i was emailing instructors

887
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,200
because like can i get a waiver you said

888
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,720
i have to take these other eight classes

889
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:17,679
can i like ah sure come on in i'm like

890
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:19,760
okay but if paul can do it why can't

891
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,279
everybody else and it really looks at

892
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:23,360
what is happening so we need to find a

893
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,919
way to yes and i get it you don't want

894
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:27,600
to say yes to everybody but they should

895
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:28,880
have options they should have the

896
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,559
ability to navigate

897
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:32,159
this system to figure out where they're

898
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:33,760
going

899
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:36,799
so what does the future look like so

900
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:38,960
i'll talk about education

901
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,960
we talk about cyber professionals and we

902
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,559
can't hire people

903
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:45,360
there's 500 000 jobs right

904
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,279
are we paying them enough okay we heard

905
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:48,320
mary say

906
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:50,240
what's the industry standard

907
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,559
now try putting a cyber professional

908
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:54,480
into an elementary school try putting a

909
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,640
cyber professional into a high school

910
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:59,039
you're gonna have somebody with degrees

911
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:00,880
uh certifications and say

912
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:03,440
i'm gonna pay you 35 000 a year but we

913
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,039
really need you

914
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:06,399
no that's not going to work and there's

915
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:08,320
some very passionate people that will do

916
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,279
that

917
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:11,039
but is that the norm no i mean we have

918
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:12,720
people like a lot of our students look

919
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:13,600
at like

920
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,880
well they said it's a hundred thousand

921
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,720
dollar year job

922
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:20,159
maybe but where well in la in san

923
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:22,240
francisco in dc it's like

924
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,080
okay so you're making about 15 an hour

925
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,440
let's face it it's really expensive to

926
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,799
live there and they don't see that they

927
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:28,240
see the dollar sign that comes in their

928
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,279
pocket

929
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:31,200
so the cyber innovation fund i met with

930
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,640
a couple of partners to try to figure

931
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,399
out a way where we can centralize some

932
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:36,399
of those resources so we can pay those

933
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:38,960
teachers a better wage to still be able

934
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,799
to complete the mission

935
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:43,760
raytheon intel a lot of companies are

936
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:46,000
focusing on you need to give back you

937
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,120
need to go

938
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,440
sponsor mentor do something

939
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,520
and teach or whatever the thing is but

940
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:52,799
what if we could bring all of these

941
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:55,120
people together and

942
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:57,360
be synergistic we could solve these

943
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,559
problems we could figure out what's

944
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:00,880
going on and i get it at a certain point

945
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,880
in people's life time and money it's

946
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:03,840
like

947
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,840
my girl skills girl scout cookies

948
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,120
anybody anybody

949
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,720
okay let me know i'll get you the link

950
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,159
and you can buy some girl scout cookies

951
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:12,399
but it's not really that it's

952
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:14,240
so okay so i gotta spend eight hours at

953
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:16,799
a booth this weekend uh can i just write

954
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:18,000
you a check for a hundred dollars what

955
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,919
are we doing here um so i get it it's

956
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:21,679
time money effort how are we going to

957
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:23,760
give back to our community how are we

958
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,360
going to bring up that next generation

959
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:27,760
of cyber professionals what are we going

960
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:30,320
to do it's not paul it's not all of you

961
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:32,080
sitting in the room everybody has a

962
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,440
stake in this and everybody has some

963
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:36,720
responsibility if we want to do that

964
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,000
so we need to collaborate we need

965
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,200
pathways

966
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,120
reducing barriers

967
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,880
i was out on the east coast working with

968
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:45,760
a foundation and they're like we give

969
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,600
these eight certification boot camps for

970
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,919
free we don't charge anybody they sign

971
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:50,880
up

972
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,080
we give it to them for free we're

973
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:54,159
reducing the barriers because where they

974
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:57,120
were look located in the quantico region

975
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,480
all of those companies needed those

976
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,919
basic certifications all the way up to

977
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:01,600
cissp i was like

978
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:02,720
that's pretty impressive that's good

979
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,720
stuff and they have an amazing lab where

980
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,320
they do summer camps they try to do this

981
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,320
stem education they're changing the

982
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,159
paradigm they're changing the narrative

983
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:13,440
to change the needle of what this is

984
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,519
certifications

985
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:17,200
they're a necessary evil at this point

986
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,039
um and it really depends but we already

987
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:20,159
talked about

988
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:21,840
there's too many and what are the

989
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,919
important ones and do do people even

990
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:26,559
know what they are like if the hr person

991
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:27,519
says

992
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:30,320
cissp does hr know what cissp is

993
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,399
probably not so who is the technology

994
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:34,240
person that said hey i need this i.t the

995
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,679
security person

996
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:38,000
and just put a job at out you need to

997
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,519
articulate what it is what are you

998
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:40,960
looking for what are those skills so

999
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:43,120
that people can get there

1000
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:45,440
stackable certs but cyber is a life

1001
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:48,480
skill like finances and which isn't

1002
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,000
really taught a whole lot either but we

1003
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,600
need to figure out how do we integrate

1004
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:54,080
this threat of cyber the cyber safety

1005
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:56,159
into everybody's life so that people see

1006
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:58,640
it as a skill as an opportunity as a way

1007
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,640
to thrive we do a lot of work with the

1008
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,320
borderland community

1009
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:05,279
i grew up in rural uh midwest there was

1010
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:07,760
no tech path that just didn't exist for

1011
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,600
me so how do we get those people to

1012
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,919
understand that it not only is it there

1013
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:14,320
it's an option it's achievable for them

1014
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,840
so we have to get out there and be

1015
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,519
advocates

1016
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:19,840
so this is um last slide and i'm way

1017
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:20,880
ahead of schedule but that's okay

1018
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,640
because i'll open up the questions

1019
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,080
but if you're an applicant and you're

1020
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:26,000
looking for this you have a

1021
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,720
responsibility this isn't like i took

1022
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,640
this degree or i got security plus which

1023
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,559
means you will give me a job it doesn't

1024
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:35,120
work that way if you are an applicant

1025
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,640
mary said it too you have to put in the

1026
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,799
work you have to go through that process

1027
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:40,880
it is not going to be handed to you and

1028
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,559
that certification is not going to do

1029
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:44,320
you any good when they sit you down in

1030
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:45,840
their interview and they say

1031
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:48,320
describe your home network to me

1032
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,480
well cox came in and they hooked it up

1033
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,320
and gave me my password and now we're

1034
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,480
good to go it's like no no what but did

1035
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:55,760
you set up a guest network how did you

1036
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,120
secure it what are you doing what what

1037
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,399
are the things that are associated with

1038
00:32:58,399 --> 00:32:59,279
it

1039
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:03,039
i don't know oh okay so describe this

1040
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:05,120
how does like ssl tls just basic

1041
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:07,200
questions how does this work

1042
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,240
um

1043
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,399
i know it secures the traffic is that

1044
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:12,159
what you're looking for

1045
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:14,080
so you need to own it um and that's just

1046
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:16,720
the skills but you also own your journey

1047
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:19,120
i took advantage of the opportunities as

1048
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:21,440
they came along if i would have said

1049
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,799
stranger danger and walked away from

1050
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:24,559
that individual in the parking lot okay

1051
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:26,399
yes i did trust them and please if it is

1052
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:29,039
a stranger danger please walk away um

1053
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:30,799
but i wouldn't have even realized that i

1054
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:33,039
was open to any opportunity that came my

1055
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:36,000
way i talked about vetsec.org i've seen

1056
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,760
so much training come through that slack

1057
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:38,799
channel

1058
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:40,960
and i asked the director and i said hey

1059
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,399
how many people took advantage how many

1060
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:44,399
people signed up one

1061
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:46,799
i have slots that i can't even fill but

1062
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:48,559
yet if you look at the other channel for

1063
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:50,559
education and certification like how do

1064
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:52,000
i get this opportunity what do i need to

1065
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,760
do how do i get there

1066
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,519
but they don't take advantage of those

1067
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:57,360
opportunities

1068
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,600
asking for help this is humbling i get

1069
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:00,399
it

1070
00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:02,240
going out and saying i don't know

1071
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,919
something and i come from the world of

1072
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:06,720
academia where phds are flourishing all

1073
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,239
over the place and they are the experts

1074
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:10,079
in their field and you ask them a

1075
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:11,760
question well you know i'm really

1076
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:14,079
focused on this piece it's like

1077
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:15,520
okay but this is the question i'm like

1078
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,119
is this a politician what am i doing

1079
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:18,800
here i need an answer to this you said

1080
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,239
you taught these eight classes how do

1081
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:22,000
you do this thing well you know i'm

1082
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
really focused on this

1083
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,199
okay

1084
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:26,879
ask for help people are willing to

1085
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:28,480
mentor people are willing to be there

1086
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,520
for you

1087
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,520
if you're an organization

1088
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:33,679
time i get it time money whatever it is

1089
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:35,679
if you have a cause or you work for a

1090
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:38,960
company find out a way to give back to

1091
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,560
some of these organizations whether it's

1092
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,000
a non-profit whether it's a school

1093
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,839
district we have school districts that

1094
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:45,679
are trying to do cyber security

1095
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:47,440
all over the state

1096
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:48,639
where they don't have laptops they don't

1097
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:50,800
have computers so how many life cycles

1098
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:53,040
go through your organizations where

1099
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,480
you just dump this stuff off at some

1100
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,960
kind of a repo and it just goes to waste

1101
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:59,119
figure out a way to turn it into a

1102
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:00,480
school district

1103
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,400
get some tax advantage off of it but

1104
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,920
then you give the resources to somebody

1105
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,839
else to be able to do something

1106
00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:08,079
financial support it's always easy well

1107
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:09,599
depending on the company it's nice to be

1108
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:10,960
able to write a check

1109
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:12,160
i talked about a recent thing i don't

1110
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:13,200
know if it

1111
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,040
i follow the academic news but dakota

1112
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,400
state university

1113
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,240
middle of nowhere south dakota just

1114
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:21,200
received 90 million dollars

1115
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,800
i think it was 50 million of that was

1116
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:25,359
from a single donor like hey we need to

1117
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:28,000
change cyber security in this state they

1118
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,240
developed a cyber

1119
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:32,560
governor cyber academy for k-12

1120
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:34,800
education focusing on it they realize

1121
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,720
what the problem is they're taking steps

1122
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,160
to be able to do that

1123
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:39,760
why can't we do that in arizona why

1124
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,520
can't we change the way that things are

1125
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:42,880
being done

1126
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:45,280
and then jobs and internships um

1127
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,880
i get it takes a lot of time to train

1128
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:50,160
and mentor and my experience

1129
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:53,280
80 of my time was dealing with the five

1130
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,440
percent of the population that were just

1131
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,440
a hassle it's like the kid that didn't

1132
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:58,720
know what they need to do they're always

1133
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:00,640
getting in trouble i gotta go to jail to

1134
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:03,440
pick this person up what is happening

1135
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,359
but treating those people as

1136
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:06,880
humans as individuals to make sure that

1137
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,480
they were successful you don't treat

1138
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:10,079
them differently because they didn't

1139
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:11,839
make good decisions did they know how to

1140
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:13,280
make good decisions did they know how to

1141
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,599
get there so what are you going to do to

1142
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:17,680
be able to give that job so we have

1143
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:18,880
students that are graduating i'm not

1144
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,480
saying all students are created equal i

1145
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,720
get it but they want an opportunity if

1146
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,720
you have an opportunity let's connect

1147
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,400
let's try to do that that's not just

1148
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,640
paul university of arizona asu same

1149
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,560
thing they graduate people multiple

1150
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,320
times a year the high school student

1151
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,079
that's coming out how do we give them an

1152
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:35,599
opportunity whether it's showing them

1153
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:36,480
away

1154
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,680
sponsoring

1155
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:38,960
a summer camp

1156
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,720
maybe that's equipment so that we can do

1157
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:42,400
that thing we have plenty of passionate

1158
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,680
people that are willing to do so many

1159
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:45,119
things for that

1160
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:47,040
and then if you're a professional

1161
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:49,119
share your experience share your journey

1162
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:51,839
it's one thing where i am confident that

1163
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:53,440
if we ask everybody in this room what

1164
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,520
was your journey to cyber security

1165
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:57,040
it's a completely different journey for

1166
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:59,280
every single one of us it is a different

1167
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:01,520
way for us to be able to get to where we

1168
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,440
are today and that's not the end of the

1169
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:05,599
journey it's some point along that

1170
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:07,920
journey so how do we help them and i'm

1171
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:10,000
not saying that the person that asks you

1172
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,079
that that that's the roadmap that's the

1173
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:14,960
blueprint that's the dna no that is one

1174
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:16,800
option so you can start to connect with

1175
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,240
those individuals in their stories and

1176
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,760
maybe say

1177
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,520
that really aligns with where i'm at

1178
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:22,480
that

1179
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,720
that speaks to who i am how do i figure

1180
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:27,280
out it connects them with that

1181
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:29,599
possibility it allows them to go and to

1182
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:31,280
go share

1183
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,960
so with that

1184
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,240
i think that's it

1185
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:37,839
so does anybody have any questions

1186
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:41,280
and if not you are out of here early to

1187
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:44,640
go enjoy your evening

1188
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:47,839
absolutely so

1189
00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:50,560
team how does that work

1190
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:53,040
okay yeah email me absolutely and so at

1191
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,720
the end of these and

1192
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,640
so here

1193
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,720
yep so i added a bunch of different

1194
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:00,160
things in here i didn't want to go over

1195
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:02,160
all of them they kind of align with what

1196
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:04,480
i think people should do or like reach

1197
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,000
out and it's

1198
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,400
one of very few opportunities that are

1199
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,160
actually listed there so

1200
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:11,680
i got cards too if you want those but

1201
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,359
yeah please reach out connect

1202
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:15,520
paul is not the end-all be-all the

1203
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:16,960
university of arizona is not the end-all

1204
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:19,040
be-all if i don't know something but i

1205
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,880
know somebody i will connect you in a

1206
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,800
heartbeat to say hey you need to go talk

1207
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,880
to bob over here or this person over

1208
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,560
there it's about connecting making

1209
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,720
opportunities but it's for students it's

1210
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:33,000
for the arizona it's for security

1211
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:46,480
yeah so that's a good question so i will

1212
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:48,240
speak for the university of arizona so

1213
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:49,839
our program is actually a two-year

1214
00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:51,200
program so we don't get freshman and

1215
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,240
sophomore

1216
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:53,760
it's just kind of a unique way for our

1217
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:56,560
college right now we graduate about 150

1218
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:58,480
students a semester ish give or take

1219
00:38:58,480 --> 00:38:59,599
depending

1220
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:02,480
winner graduation is less than spring

1221
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:04,480
right now we just got a grant for

1222
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,640
workforce development to increase that

1223
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:08,480
the state says we should be at 2 000

1224
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,079
students within the next couple of years

1225
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:11,760
and we need to graduate but it's that

1226
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,280
two-year piece so that's the goal so

1227
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:16,000
that's just one school of

1228
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,160
the statistics for i brought up like

1229
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:20,000
that national center of academic

1230
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
excellence in cyber security that nsa

1231
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,920
fbi funded thing

1232
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:26,160
there's 24 that hold the cyber

1233
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:28,560
operations designation it's the

1234
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,880
engineers exploit writer kind of folks

1235
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:33,200
very computer science heavy

1236
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,839
and then there's i think

1237
00:39:34,839 --> 00:39:37,760
350 400 of schools that are designated

1238
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,359
otherwise but they're putting these

1239
00:39:39,359 --> 00:39:41,119
people out but then it gets back to the

1240
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:42,880
question of do they have the right

1241
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,800
skills what are they coming out with and

1242
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,240
that's where that industry partnership

1243
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:47,520
is important

1244
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:49,920
you need to tell us as educators what is

1245
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,599
important to you and we can't change

1246
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:53,599
curriculum overnight

1247
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:54,960
you think we could but it doesn't work

1248
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,720
that way there's a lot of approvals but

1249
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,400
we are willing to add a class and a

1250
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,320
certificate certification whatever we

1251
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:02,720
need to do to meet the needs of industry

1252
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:04,319
and community colleges are much better

1253
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:08,079
at it than than for your institutions so

1254
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:10,640
that's what we do so multiply that by i

1255
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:11,680
don't know

1256
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:13,920
400 and we're we're pushing out a lot of

1257
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,680
talent

1258
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:18,319
other questions

1259
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:22,160
all right thank you all for your time

1260
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:23,980
have a great night have a great weekend

1261
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:29,670
[Applause]

1262
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:35,880
almost made it what's up

1263
00:40:42,319 --> 00:40:44,400
great so i and i love that question so

1264
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,800
it kind of
