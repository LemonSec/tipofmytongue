1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,520
motivations

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:04,400
it is not unusual for an attackers to

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:06,319
prey on a collective vulnerable state of

4
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:07,440
mind

5
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,120
throughout the pandemic we did see

6
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:10,639
several attackers

7
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:13,599
use covid19 as a pretext

8
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:15,440
and they weren't stopping at any time

9
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:16,960
throughout it

10
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:18,400
with these high stress factors

11
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,400
throughout the pandemic humans were more

12
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,920
error-prone than ever from what i

13
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,199
observed

14
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:24,720
while we often say that you know the

15
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:25,920
human is the weakest link of an

16
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,160
organization i thought

17
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,679
well i observed that this was even more

18
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:30,480
so

19
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,800
um not to mention that kovid 19 changed

20
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,320
the way that millions of americans

21
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,120
worked

22
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,880
there was a huge unprecedented shift to

23
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,559
remote work and i'm sure we can all

24
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:40,399
relate that some things just did not

25
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:42,480
work the way that they used to

26
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,399
so it was really my job to try and

27
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:46,079
capitalize on that

28
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:47,680
and this was shown um all throughout the

29
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,600
pandemic um i'm sure we've received

30
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:53,760
texts emails using covet 19 as a pretext

31
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,360
and a lot of them were extremely

32
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,120
successful from attackers with multiple

33
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,600
breaches being reported and as observed

34
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,399
throughout my testing

35
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,840
so as i mentioned attackers were quick

36
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,479
to capitalize as demonstrated with these

37
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:10,080
screenshots a lot of these social

38
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,799
engineering campaigns relied on fear a

39
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:14,320
lot of them preyed on emotion in a

40
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,320
vulnerable state of mind

41
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,320
the situation with covet 19 also

42
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,159
progressed significantly faster than i

43
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:22,159
think a lot of people expected

44
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:24,799
victims had a very short amount of time

45
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:27,360
to actually you know adapt to their new

46
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,280
work environment which meant that

47
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,439
attackers were able to distribute

48
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:33,360
malware obtain credentials and do you

49
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,799
know your usual cyber crime things

50
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:38,479
this also evolved throughout the

51
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:39,680
pandemic

52
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,159
i thought it was really interesting how

53
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:44,079
attackers just continued to tailor their

54
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:46,560
campaigns throughout the pandemic so for

55
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,200
example at the beginning we saw kovit 19

56
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,520
maps being used to distribute malware

57
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,000
we then saw that shift into things like

58
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,119
using stimulus checks as a pretext and

59
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:58,560
recently we're seeing things like

60
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,320
student loan extensions being used as

61
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,880
pretext and attackers campaigns

62
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,000
and i believe that this is going to

63
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,240
continue after the pandemic and we're

64
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,000
really just waiting for the you know

65
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,360
next big thing that happens for

66
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,720
attackers to capitalize on

67
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,239
so as i said i would love to talk about

68
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:17,200
ethics

69
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,520
this was kind of a discovery while i was

70
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,800
writing this talk

71
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,720
this was something that after doing a

72
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,280
lot of research into i felt like it was

73
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,000
probably time to talk about it

74
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,840
there were many debates had for and

75
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,720
against the use of covet 19 pretexts

76
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,560
a lot of these from the kind of attacker

77
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,040
side was that attackers are doing this

78
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,360
day-to-day we should train our employees

79
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,120
we should prep them we should ensure

80
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,560
that they're ready for the next big

81
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,680
threat

82
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,800
um

83
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,560
what i kind of saw on the defense side

84
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,640
is is what i agreed with

85
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,560
a lot of it was uh this could be

86
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,280
unethical um we don't want an employee

87
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,800
to get an email

88
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,599
get phished and then we point the finger

89
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:00,319
and employees don't get real information

90
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:01,599
we don't want to be the reason that

91
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:03,360
someone doesn't open an actual email

92
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,840
from hr or the cdc or any other type of

93
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,840
source

94
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,560
and you know not take that information

95
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,840
at the end of the day you know

96
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,519
regardless of your stance there is a

97
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:15,280
public health emergency

98
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,120
i personally don't want to be of a

99
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,640
reason that someone doesn't get that

100
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,480
information

101
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,920
there's a great tweet from marshall

102
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,840
banana on this topic which i've kind of

103
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,760
modified a little which is that orgs

104
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,360
that are already doing well need their

105
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,120
users to learn and determine what is

106
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,400
real and

107
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,400
and what is not using fine-grained

108
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,360
methods

109
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,200
immature organizations just need to

110
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,200
learn how to identify phishing emails

111
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,040
and they shouldn't be challenged on this

112
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,560
and i found myself agreeing with that

113
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,319
so it's for this reason that i really

114
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:46,480
decided to follow my own ethics

115
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,200
um one of the first things was that um

116
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,360
that kind of happened when covet 19 was

117
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,519
uh you know going on

118
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:55,599
a lot of the things was that uh

119
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:57,920
organizations were using covid19 as a

120
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,840
pretext unethically

121
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,280
so i'm not sure

122
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,959
if anyone else saw this on twitter when

123
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:03,599
it

124
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:05,120
when pretexts were first announced for

125
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,159
covet 19 but a lot or a few companies

126
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:09,920
were using these in what i'd consider an

127
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,519
unethical manner

128
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:13,680
a lot of them were promising monetary

129
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,959
rewards

130
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:17,120
bonuses throughout the pandemic and

131
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,199
using these as a pretext to basically

132
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:20,959
get high success rates

133
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,840
and while i do agree that attackers are

134
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,040
doing this

135
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,199
i do find it to be used in a really poor

136
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:28,479
manner

137
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:30,560
that type of money was life-changing for

138
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,919
a lot of people at the beginning of the

139
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:34,720
pandemic and still could be and i didn't

140
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,000
want to be the guy

141
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,960
or have a company one of my clients

142
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,479
have to tell the employee that it was a

143
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:41,919
phishing test and they weren't getting

144
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:43,280
that bonus that they were promised

145
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,360
previously

146
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,000
so using covet 19 pretexts i decided

147
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,840
that they shouldn't be a surprise

148
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,560
i was always very very uh in talks with

149
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,160
the point of contact

150
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,080
and i felt like i should not and will

151
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,840
not make the decision of whether or not

152
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,720
covet 19 should be used as a pretext

153
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,720
rather i decided to be as clear as

154
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,240
possible and assure of a client

155
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,199
throughout the process that it's okay

156
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,479
if they don't want to do this type of

157
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:09,520
pretext

158
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,120
that's perfectly fine we don't need to

159
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,160
test it

160
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,840
you know we can focus on doing another

161
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,840
pretext and move into covid19 when

162
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,280
they're ready

163
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,960
furthermore one of the rules that i

164
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,720
really wanted to follow was not to

165
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,720
impersonate official sources

166
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,360
so i didn't want to impersonate the cdc

167
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,680
i didn't want to impersonate any other

168
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,080
type of health organization

169
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,520
what i was trying to do was just

170
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,919
impersonate and take a twist on covet 19

171
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:36,880
pre or pre-covet 19 pretext that i was

172
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,560
using

173
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,560
so at a high level overview i tailored

174
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,240
my campaigns throughout the pandemic to

175
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,720
focus on the consequences of covet 19

176
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,160
rather than sending an email with the

177
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,320
subject line you've got covid or someone

178
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:51,039
you know has tested positive for covid

179
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:52,880
i also found a tweet from leslie carhart

180
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,800
while researching for this presentation

181
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,800
that said the pretext itself is not the

182
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,039
intended security education but instead

183
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:01,199
the actual depths that an adversary will

184
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:03,440
sync

185
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:08,240
to so some of my key observations and i

186
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,759
think it needs to be said that several

187
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:12,560
clients did opt out of these engagements

188
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,479
at the beginning of a pandemic

189
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:16,400
and this is for multiple reasons

190
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,880
one of the big ones being budget cuts

191
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,720
there was a lot of budget cuts going on

192
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,240
in the security world and social

193
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,759
engineering engagements were not the

194
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:26,160
priority for a lot of companies

195
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,919
additionally a lot of companies saw this

196
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:30,160
as adding fuel to the fire

197
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,840
do we really want to test our users with

198
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,680
this when there's significantly worse

199
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,199
issues going on in the real world right

200
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:36,160
now

201
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,160
and i guess my question is was that the

202
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,639
right move um to be honest i'm not

203
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,080
entirely sure

204
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,840
there was an unprecedented high of

205
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,600
phishing attacks and while we should be

206
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,600
training our users it's also important

207
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,479
that

208
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:50,400
we give our employees you know

209
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,400
time to get away from these things and

210
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,840
not constantly be pointing the finger

211
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,880
when they click on a phishing email

212
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,240
additionally one of my biggest

213
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,000
observations was that a majority of

214
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,400
pretexts used prior to the pandemic were

215
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,319
still as successful

216
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:06,880
i didn't need to tailor a covet 19

217
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,120
pretext just to get a click

218
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,720
while it was

219
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,560
while i did see increased interaction

220
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,120
rates while using these pretexts

221
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,199
it wasn't required

222
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:19,680
so one of my first big observations was

223
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,360
that if coveted 19 was in the subject

224
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,759
line coronavirus pandemic similar kind

225
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:24,880
of words

226
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,479
it was usually an instant click from the

227
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:27,840
employee

228
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,520
although they may not have necessarily

229
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,280
downloaded the malware browse to the

230
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,199
link and entered their credentials i

231
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:35,039
still got their click

232
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:36,560
and that tells me a lot about the

233
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,800
employee just in itself i know that that

234
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,120
user's active maybe i can target them in

235
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,720
a red teaming campaign in the future

236
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,919
since i know that they're checking their

237
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:46,960
emails i know that it bypassed defenses

238
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,479
if i wasn't whitelisted for this

239
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:49,599
engagement

240
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:50,960
there's a lot of information that i can

241
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,599
get from this

242
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,400
i also thought that uh pretexts that

243
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,639
were just as efficient did not have to

244
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:01,120
be modified heavily so i didn't need to

245
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,120
go and rewrite an entire pretext which

246
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,400
i'm looking forward to showing you in a

247
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,799
little bit

248
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:08,720
additionally i think there's a lot of

249
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,840
talk at the beginning of the pandemic

250
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,800
that said working from home is the dream

251
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,720
this is not always the case which i'm

252
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,479
sure some people found

253
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:18,160
there's a lot of troubles that can come

254
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,919
from working from home

255
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:22,960
kids new processes and procedures

256
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,680
you know dogs barking at you every hour

257
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,440
there's a lot of different stresses that

258
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,599
can you know increase these error prone

259
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:32,399
tendencies that we have

260
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:34,240
additionally i kind of saw that

261
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,000
increased interaction rates were likely

262
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,039
due to

263
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:39,440
a lot of processes being changed so new

264
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,360
login portals some

265
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,120
employees were having to use a vpn for

266
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,320
the first time

267
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,760
they were learning a lot of new

268
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,519
processes and procedures

269
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:49,200
which enabled me to you know take

270
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,279
advantage of this and potentially

271
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:52,800
get a click or some credentials from a

272
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,000
campaign in the midst of this confusion

273
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,560
it's also i don't find that it's really

274
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,080
a surprise that a lot of these employees

275
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,440
are more error-prone

276
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,839
it was a big shift and a stressful time

277
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:05,200
for a lot

278
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,200
but overall i did see a higher rate of

279
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,800
success throughout my social engineering

280
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,240
engagements due to a lot of these

281
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,720
factors

282
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:15,519
so as i've mentioned a few times

283
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:18,080
cybercriminals can be lazy we don't need

284
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,320
to reinvent the wheel when it comes to

285
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,440
pretext that i used throughout covet 19.

286
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,959
a lot of these pretexts were working

287
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:26,880
fine before the pandemic and they're

288
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,519
going to work fine after and during it

289
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:31,440
really what i wanted to do is tailor

290
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,760
what i had to the ongoing pandemic

291
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,279
and i'll have an example of that coming

292
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:37,200
up shortly

293
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,760
verizon also observed this i was reading

294
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:40,880
an article where they stated that

295
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,959
criminals are ultimately lazy and again

296
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:44,720
there was no reason to reinvent these

297
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,480
attack strategies to accomplish their

298
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,480
goal

299
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,560
so one of the pretexts which i've used

300
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,279
before of a pandemic was a dress code

301
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:57,600
dress code is always guaranteed to get

302
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,800
me a click

303
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,800
dress code is always guaranteed to get

304
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,360
some type of document downloaded um i've

305
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,360
i've seen just incredibly high success

306
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,640
rates using it

307
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,000
and it's been one of my favorites just

308
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,079
because of these interaction rates

309
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:13,440
so minor modifications throughout covid

310
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,200
really just heightened this

311
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,800
i mean you can cite management policies

312
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,160
you can

313
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,320
use a link contact a manager

314
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,160
and then these can be observed even more

315
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,200
so

316
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:25,920
if

317
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,240
the employees are working remotely so

318
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,440
rather than

319
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,760
businesses where employees are working

320
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,519
remote you can tailor it to zoom

321
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:36,399
etiquette you can also tailor it to

322
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:39,279
the return to work in person

323
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:41,440
a lot of companies love to post online

324
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,959
what day their employees will be

325
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:44,880
returning to work and starting work from

326
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,040
the office and it's very easy to take

327
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,079
advantage of this as an attacker

328
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:51,680
additionally i did see higher amounts of

329
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,440
employees opening the emails and

330
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,200
combining this with a landing page or an

331
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,440
employee login portal is a surefire way

332
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,040
to get credentials

333
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,040
furthermore these templates as i said

334
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,880
can be easily modified

335
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,880
i was able to get a shell using a very

336
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,959
similar pretext to this and just

337
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:08,880
combining it with something

338
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,959
like a malicious document is more than

339
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:13,959
enough

340
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:16,880
another really successful survey was um

341
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,880
surveys or sorry another really

342
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,120
successful pretext was surveys um

343
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,480
usually i would use something like a

344
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,480
starbucks gift card but in this case i

345
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,680
really wanted to revolve around the

346
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,640
company

347
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,120
was handling covet 19.

348
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,200
again paired with a login form this does

349
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,120
work beautifully otherwise you can

350
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,800
always collect information about the

351
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,800
internal workings of the company try and

352
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,160
understand if there's anything that you

353
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,440
didn't know before

354
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,040
enumerate information that isn't

355
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,519
publicly accessible

356
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:45,279
i do also believe that

357
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:47,200
not over complicating a phishing email

358
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,440
and keeping it simple is the way to go

359
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,880
i want to make sure that employees can

360
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,959
read these quickly and click before they

361
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:55,360
think a lot of the time

362
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,040
um i do have a story pretty early on

363
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,279
under the pandemic um i did send this

364
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:02,079
email to a point of contact so for those

365
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:03,440
of us who may not be familiar with

366
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,360
social engineering engagements

367
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,959
i do like to give

368
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:08,959
my point of contact some time to either

369
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:10,880
read through the pretexts or notify them

370
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,800
if it's a whitelisted engagement that

371
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,360
i'm going to be sending these emails

372
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,120
so usually they'll know the contents of

373
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,040
the email the topic

374
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,399
they'll know the domain that it's coming

375
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:22,480
from there's a lot of opportunities for

376
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,360
these

377
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,639
you know point of contacts to catch it

378
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:26,320
when it lands in their inbox

379
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,760
and a lot of the time i'll send them an

380
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,399
email before as well

381
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:32,240
at the time i sent this email i'd

382
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,000
notified him and he clicked on it very

383
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,200
shortly after and entered his

384
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,639
credentials

385
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:38,720
and it's a love-hate relationship when

386
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,600
your point of contact does that um

387
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,839
but i mean he he said in the meeting he

388
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:45,040
was the first to admit it during the

389
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,360
readout call that this you know preyed

390
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,000
on his emotions um he had a lot to say

391
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
about covet at the moment and while he

392
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,839
was aware of these types of behaviors

393
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:55,440
and attacks going on and he knew that i

394
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,120
was performing it

395
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,200
he just clicked and entered it before he

396
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,639
really stopped to think about it

397
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:04,079
i did use a few other pretexts

398
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:05,760
throughout the pandemic while i would

399
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,200
love to include them all i will have

400
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,279
those available online

401
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:11,279
but updates to an employee handbook are

402
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:14,320
great too update to hr policies

403
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,959
and impersonating i.t is another great

404
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:17,760
one

405
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,600
with this shift to remote work

406
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,920
impersonating i.t more than ever was a

407
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,320
really great way to harvest credentials

408
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:27,839
or get users to browse to a site

409
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:31,360
so talking about wishing

410
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,480
vision can be a lot more unpredictable

411
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,480
wishing engagements are probably some of

412
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,320
the most fun and wild because not

413
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,480
everything always goes according to plan

414
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,000
and while i do have a script later that

415
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,680
i like to kind of follow for the intro

416
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,000
to a vision call things can go off

417
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,600
script pretty quickly depending on the

418
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,040
employee

419
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,959
so um it's not weird to be the new

420
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:52,880
employee anymore it was one of my big

421
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,399
observations

422
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:56,320
prior to covet 19 when i was kind of

423
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,000
calling up employees and i try to

424
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,600
impersonate a brand new employee to the

425
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,560
company

426
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,880
it could backfire on me there's a lot of

427
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,880
times where the company's small enough

428
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,279
and everyone knows each other um maybe

429
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:09,199
you've tried to impersonate an employee

430
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:10,639
and you don't sound like them and they

431
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:12,959
know this employee there's a lot of ways

432
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:14,639
that these campaigns can quickly go from

433
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:17,199
good to bad and even if you say that

434
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:19,279
you're a new employee people are going

435
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:22,880
to be untrusting um they've never met me

436
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,160
and they like to do something which i

437
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,839
like to call vetting bingo where they

438
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:27,839
like to ask you tons of questions which

439
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:29,680
you can easily you know answer if you've

440
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,199
been googling the company and performing

441
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:32,480
the right amount of enumeration and

442
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,320
ocean

443
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,399
but still this doesn't always convince

444
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:37,760
them

445
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,120
this was less of an issue throughout the

446
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,600
pandemic it wasn't weird anymore to be

447
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,920
that guy that nobody's ever met

448
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,519
a lot of employees

449
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:46,880
kind of stated on the phone but while

450
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,240
they'd never met me maybe they would

451
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,320
when we moved back into the office

452
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,160
and this this also meant that there are

453
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,000
less opportunities for employees to be

454
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,160
onboarded during the pandemic there were

455
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,720
no company meetups there were no

456
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,240
opportunities to go around the office

457
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,240
and interact for a lot of companies so

458
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,920
meeting employees became significantly

459
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,760
harder

460
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,079
one of my favorite changes that i

461
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:09,199
observed throughout phishing and the

462
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:11,680
pandemic is that background noise was

463
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,120
less of an issue

464
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,480
uh if you've looked at the screen you

465
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,560
can see my two furry babies and they are

466
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,160
bork machines

467
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,160
they love to bork

468
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,079
and there's nothing worse than a dog

469
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:23,120
starting to bark when you're in the

470
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,199
middle of a vision call

471
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:26,880
it really sets off your campaign

472
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,160
especially if you're playing like

473
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,000
background noise uh if you've got some

474
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,680
type of pretext that maybe you know

475
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,600
you're at the airport

476
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,120
there's a lot of ways that this can kind

477
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:38,160
of ruin your pretext

478
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,519
and then one of the biggest most

479
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,360
significant uh things that i observed

480
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,959
was that there was finally someone to

481
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:44,000
talk to

482
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,320
uh kovit impacted a lot of people who

483
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,440
maybe didn't live with a lot of

484
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,600
roommates weren't able to see family for

485
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,519
a long time and

486
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:52,880
a lot of people just wanted to have a

487
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,560
conversation with me

488
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,320
the issue with this is that the longer i

489
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,160
can keep someone on the phone the longer

490
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,320
i can build that false trust

491
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,920
it's easier for me to get someone to go

492
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,519
to a link or browse something if we've

493
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:05,519
been talking about dogs

494
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:07,600
kids you know the weather outside

495
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,959
anything else that's going on

496
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,639
additionally

497
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:14,720
i just really thought it was interesting

498
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,720
how a lot of kind of

499
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,560
like conversations changed throughout my

500
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,240
vision pretexts

501
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,920
while i often go into calls trying to

502
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:24,320
get the end goal complete however i can

503
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,320
um i did find myself a few times just

504
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,160
talking to employees because

505
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,320
it was nice to have a conversation again

506
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,199
um

507
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:33,279
it was just really interesting

508
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:35,199
there was a story pretty early on in the

509
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:36,399
pandemic which

510
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:38,000
i still feel bad about i'm not sure if

511
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,600
anyone's ever gotten off a vision call

512
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,360
and you've just kind of felt bad you've

513
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,440
had that feeling in your stomach

514
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,440
but i talked to a lady for

515
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,600
probably about 20 minutes while she

516
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,440
attempted to browse to this login portal

517
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,199
and enter her credentials

518
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:52,480
and while i realized that this was

519
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,240
easily behavior that an attacker could

520
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,040
do

521
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,279
and i was able to obtain credentials

522
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:58,880
from this and log into the portal and

523
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,560
eventually compromise the domain

524
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,639
controller

525
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:06,400
it just didn't feel right in some ways

526
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:09,359
so a view a few vision pretexts that had

527
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:11,280
a high success rate with my cove at 19

528
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,319
twist

529
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:14,799
like i said impersonating i.t

530
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:17,119
while i use this in phishing i love

531
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:19,119
doing this over the phone

532
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:21,280
it's significantly easier for me to call

533
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,959
up an employee pretending to be in a

534
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:24,959
panic and asking them to verify if they

535
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:26,559
can still access a site using their

536
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:28,079
credentials

537
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:29,679
additionally a lot of companies

538
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:31,919
experienced outages during covid

539
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:33,600
there was a lot of times where a vpn

540
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,039
went down and testing another

541
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:37,520
alternative login site or another vpn or

542
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,880
just another place to enter your

543
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,320
credentials wasn't weird of behavior

544
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,080
additionally i could expand upon this

545
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,520
pretext to enumerate sensitive

546
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,559
information

547
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:47,280
so

548
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:50,400
using something like survey again

549
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,080
asking employees

550
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,240
different kinds of questions like where

551
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,760
do they use things like a password vault

552
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,360
how are they storing their password even

553
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,280
just asking for their password in a lot

554
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,120
of cases you can receive this

555
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,678
information

556
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:05,919
we also saw this exact type of behavior

557
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:08,559
when twitter was compromised in 2020.

558
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:10,160
it was stated that employees at twitter

559
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,760
fell for this because they are utilizing

560
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,840
a vpn and were experiencing connection

561
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,039
issues at the time throughout the

562
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:17,600
pandemic and while this is an unusual

563
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,679
behavior prior to the pandemic i do

564
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:21,520
think that the pandemic played a part

565
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,520
and you know made the situation

566
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,559
extremely more stressful

567
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,520
um i did want to demonstrate a vishing

568
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,760
script i used um while this wishing

569
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,360
script is pretty simple in this

570
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,160
situation um i do just like to write out

571
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,720
what i'm going to say prior to a call

572
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,120
really just having multiple scenarios on

573
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,120
hand i like to at least have something

574
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,799
written up so that in the moment i'm not

575
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:46,960
going to panic if something goes astray

576
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,480
and i do have goals at the end right

577
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,720
like i either want to get the target to

578
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,039
go to a link i want to get information

579
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:55,039
out of them i want to be able to come

580
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:56,640
off of the call having gained something

581
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:00,080
that i can write into the report

582
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:04,000
so i did want to talk about what we

583
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,520
should do

584
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,039
continuing to raise awareness and

585
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:08,559
educate employees is always going to be

586
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:09,919
one of the most important things with

587
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:12,080
any type of social engineering

588
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,120
it's not

589
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,880
uncommon for attackers to continue to

590
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,480
sink to these depths

591
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,000
and it's going to continue to happen

592
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
throughout the years

593
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,440
additionally i do think we should start

594
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,200
preparing for these attacks to continue

595
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,960
in different formats

596
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,559
this isn't going to be the last major

597
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:28,720
event that impacts many of us and like i

598
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:31,520
said attackers are quick to capitalize

599
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:34,559
even if it's extremely unethical

600
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:35,679
i do think that these are going to

601
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:38,240
continue for the remainder of covid19 so

602
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,919
student loan extensions is going to be a

603
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:40,880
big one

604
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,039
additionally coveted variants

605
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:45,919
throughout testing i saw ups and downs

606
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:49,120
with the success of my pretexts

607
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,559
especially

608
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:51,280
so

609
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,640
around the time that the different

610
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,960
variants were announced um i would see

611
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,720
things to start or i'd start to see my

612
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,799
interaction rates decline

613
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:01,520
as uh covet kind of quieted down and

614
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,679
then as you know delta variant popped up

615
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:05,520
the interaction rates would soar back up

616
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:08,799
as people started to talk about it more

617
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:10,480
and then as i said really just preparing

618
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,840
for what's next

619
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,280
what's the next attack that's going to

620
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,960
take place how are attackers going to

621
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,280
tailor their pretexts while we don't

622
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,440
necessarily have to

623
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,520
perform these types of engagements on

624
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,440
our employees it's still important that

625
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,039
we educate them that attackers are

626
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:27,280
capable of this behavior and demonstrate

627
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,039
pretexts

628
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:30,640
one of the most common observations i've

629
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,640
had from social engineering engagements

630
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:35,120
in general phishing especially is just

631
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,840
that if an email is well written

632
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:40,000
if there aren't any typos if it follows

633
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,919
correct formatting

634
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:43,760
a lot of employees don't see this as a

635
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,760
phishing email to begin with a lot of

636
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,600
employees seem to think that

637
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,200
every phishing email is riddled with

638
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,440
typos it's got a giant image it comes

639
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:54,159
you know from a ridiculous email address

640
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:56,240
highly motivated attackers are going to

641
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,760
tailor their campaigns further

642
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:02,640
um so i did reference quite a few

643
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,120
articles um throughout i think there's

644
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,760
some really good discussions online

645
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,440
there's a lot of really good twitter

646
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,880
threads out there

647
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,720
of discussions like this where people

648
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,640
are for and against views

649
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,799
and like i said people like to cite data

650
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:19,760
breaches the twitter one being a big one

651
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,600
if this attack was effective why

652
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,720
shouldn't we perform this type of

653
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,000
testing

654
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,679
i don't think that these conversations

655
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:27,280
are over and i really encourage people

656
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,440
to continue having them because

657
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,679
i i love them personally

658
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:33,280
there's also some great papers that have

659
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,640
already come out written around the

660
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,799
analysis of covet 19 phishing emails

661
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:38,320
which i wasn't even made aware of

662
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,760
throughout the pandemic

663
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:40,880
so if this is something that you're

664
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,400
interested in i'd also recommend

665
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,840
checking those out

666
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:48,159
so thank you for coming to my talk

667
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:50,000
i do want to continue this conversation

668
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,679
so if anyone has questions or wants to

669
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:52,960
reach out to me on twitter throughout

670
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,320
this

671
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:58,159
happy to talk more about it

672
00:21:58,159 --> 00:21:59,670
thank you

673
00:21:59,670 --> 00:22:05,400
[Applause]

674
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,280
were there any questions

675
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:13,158
it's also okay if not

676
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:23,760
i think i'm supposed to throw this box

677
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:26,559
at you

678
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:28,799
yeah

679
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:30,720
nice

680
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:33,520
uh quick question so when you

681
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:37,280
targeted like a particular organization

682
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,799
how did you manage to get their email

683
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:40,799
addresses or the employee's email

684
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:43,360
addresses yeah sure um there's multiple

685
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,039
ways you can obtain email addresses of

686
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:47,520
employees so um i know one of the great

687
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,039
ways that i've used in the past is using

688
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:52,080
hunter.io to identify like the schema of

689
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,320
employee addresses so is it first name

690
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,640
last name is it first dot last name is

691
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,640
it first initial last name

692
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,240
you can use that to kind of figure that

693
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,840
out pretty quickly

694
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,760
if employees have posted their emails on

695
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,840
something like linkedin on the website

696
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,600
that's also a great way

697
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,159
i like to find emails off of linkedin so

698
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:12,799
oftentimes i'm not actually finding the

699
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:15,440
direct email of an employee i'm looking

700
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:18,480
at the kind of format or schema of the

701
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,039
organization email addresses and then

702
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:23,520
finding all the employee names on

703
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,200
linkedin and then creating a list based

704
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,559
off of this

705
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:28,400
also things like data breaches are a

706
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,159
great way to enumerate valid email

707
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:32,640
addresses

708
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,919
there's tons of other

709
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:35,840
sites too i know phone book cz is a

710
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,520
really good one

711
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,120
lots of ways but linkedin is one of my

712
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,520
favorites
