we're ready to roll

6
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,240
welcome to cactus content everybody

7
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:27,840
excited to be here

8
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,279
all right yeah

9
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:30,960
yeah i'm definitely excited to be here

10
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,479
i'd clap too but the clicker and the

11
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:34,239
microphone would go crazy there'd be

12
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:36,320
thunder it'd be awful

13
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:37,040
well

14
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,320
today we're here to talk about

15
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,320
disinformation or as i like to call it

16
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,920
malware of the mind

17
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,320
yeah and there's kind of a funny lead-in

18
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,399
story to this uh about

19
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:49,760
in uh late 2015 i was on a long flight

20
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,239
back from tel aviv drinking wine and of

21
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:54,079
course like a lot of folks in the room

22
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:55,520
was traveling around trying to help

23
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,120
people with strategies to deal with

24
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,879
malware and i just taught a class there

25
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:00,079
in tel aviv

26
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:02,320
so like i'd been on a long stretch of

27
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,760
trips and it was

28
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,519
everything on my mind was malware

29
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,280
prevention malware prevention malware

30
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,360
prevention and

31
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,640
who remembers that there might have been

32
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,320
a little bit of disinformation and it

33
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:15,280
might have been a hot topic back in 2015

34
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,479
uh a little bit um although i must say

35
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:19,600
back then

36
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,439
uh it it wasn't quite as much a

37
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:23,680
household word as it is now

38
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,600
but on that on that flight back from tel

39
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,960
aviv

40
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,439
um i get several glasses of wine in

41
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:30,880
because what else do you do on a flight

42
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,880
back from tel aviv watch movies drink

43
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,200
wine catch up on all the emails from

44
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,640
while you were traveling

45
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,880
i it occurred to me like are are the

46
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,520
phenomenon that different right the ways

47
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:45,280
that we misinform an information system

48
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,920
during the compromise cycle

49
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,479
versus the way that we actually

50
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:52,720
uh you know what we study all the time

51
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,840
of how to how compromise works on

52
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,840
information systems like it just began

53
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,119
to occur to me that there were some

54
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,880
parallels so back then

55
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,520
i did a horrible podcast don't watch it

56
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,520
my ideas were rambling and articulate

57
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,360
and it's an hour and a half long never

58
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,959
torture yourself with that thing maybe

59
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:10,800
it'll maybe it'll disappear one day and

60
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,440
just age off but but over the last few

61
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,560
years you know the thoughts kind of

62
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,480
grown and other people have collaborated

63
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,800
on it too and it's just been a growing

64
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,440
conversation like how how does

65
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,280
disinformation work

66
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,040
and what what are the parallels so

67
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,680
introduction i'm mike manrad i work for

68
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,360
grand canyon education the normal

69
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,680
disclaimer these are my ideas only they

70
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,800
in no way represent my employer um we've

71
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,640
got some i've got some good friends in

72
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,640
the room that i get to collaborate with

73
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,239
on some cool stuff

74
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:42,319
um so you know just basically by way of

75
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:44,160
an introduction at grand canyon we just

76
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,879
like to mess around do cool stuff have

77
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:48,480
fun and if it's ever worth sharing we

78
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,680
give a shot

79
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,360
a shot at either presenting it or

80
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,879
writing up a white paper

81
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:55,840
so

82
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,280
today we're going to take a look we're

83
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,080
going to kind of get on the

84
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,760
disinformation rabbit hole

85
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,280
systematically

86
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,599
first we're going to take a look at a

87
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:05,440
look at machines and then we're going to

88
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,280
take a look at people like a little bit

89
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,159
of cognitive psychology background about

90
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:12,319
why why it is we're so susceptible to

91
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:14,239
disinformation

92
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:15,680
and then we're going to look

93
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,440
a little closer at machines to

94
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,280
understand people

95
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,200
and then we're going to really look at

96
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,959
again zeroing back at how they come

97
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:25,120
together we're going to look at how

98
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,680
social platforms and the machines we we

99
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,640
live on

100
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,720
we rely on in our society our way of

101
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,360
life actually impact

102
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,319
um you know just you know make make our

103
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:39,280
society so ripe for disinformation how

104
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,720
it works and lastly we'll talk a little

105
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,920
bit about how to disrupt it

106
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:44,799
so

107
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:46,560
oops i think i hit the wrong button here

108
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,080
we go

109
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,680
so look at machines

110
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,200
obviously this is going to be a pretty

111
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,680
big review for everybody in the room but

112
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,680
obviously you have hardware

113
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,439
uh you have software running at

114
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:00,159
different levels you know from from you

115
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:02,159
know applications down through lower

116
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,799
level software down to operating systems

117
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:06,480
and obviously this is what we all eat

118
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,840
sleep and breathe so we don't need to

119
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,599
spend much time on that

120
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:11,920
but what is software really

121
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,239
um you know if we think back along the

122
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:16,000
history of computing

123
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,639
software is really just ideas right like

124
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:21,759
it's ideas that we express in a language

125
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:24,400
you know uh it the idea has been around

126
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,240
for much longer than computing if we

127
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,960
look at sheet music and a piano you have

128
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,520
ideas they're expressed in a universal

129
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,880
language and the language's job is to

130
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,040
facilitate the machine and then

131
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,639
in that case a person sitting at a

132
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:40,479
keyboard translating it

133
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:43,680
taking that that language that universal

134
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,800
language and actually producing results

135
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,320
in the world with it

136
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,120
so

137
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,840
you know if we begin to look at software

138
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,800
just as ideas an idea is expressed in a

139
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,040
rather specific language to carry out an

140
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,400
objective

141
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,960
all of a sudden the similarities you

142
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,840
know between how disinformation occurs

143
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,320
on machines and how disinformation

144
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,560
occurs with people you know the

145
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,720
similarity begins to become apparent

146
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,039
right

147
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,919
i'm going to have to stop doing that

148
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:18,080
uh the the those who brought rotten

149
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,240
tomatoes just beam them at my head every

150
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,160
time i hit the wrong button

151
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,520
so look at people yeah there you go i'll

152
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,199
bet that'll make a thundering noise when

153
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:28,880
it hits me if you throw that

154
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,720
he's got a mu you'll have you'll have to

155
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,880
like unmute it right before it hits says

156
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,199
there's this epic crashing

157
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:36,800
uh

158
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,639
yeah yeah if you have a question

159
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,199
and and those on those on the stream

160
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:43,280
definitely interrupt us over discord

161
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,520
throw those in i'll answer any questions

162
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,800
as we go along

163
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,039
so if we look at people

164
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:51,039
if we look at human information

165
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:53,360
processing let's start with the pros and

166
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,759
cons right human imp who thinks human

167
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:57,520
information processing is pretty cool

168
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,000
who likes it i'm pretty happy with it i

169
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,960
mean

170
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,919
uh i i it takes a lot of caffeine to get

171
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:05,440
it going in the morning but you know

172
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,360
once that happens i'm pretty happy with

173
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,160
it

174
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,080
but you know it's flexible it's

175
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,160
adaptable we're really really good as

176
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,479
humans at pattern recognition

177
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:17,039
anybody read any of the writings of ray

178
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:20,240
kurzweil he wrote he wrote he's written

179
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,840
a lot of articles in the blue brain

180
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,960
project he wrote how to create a mind

181
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,440
if you're curious about ai or

182
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:28,960
neurophysiology i definitely recommend

183
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,960
the book how to create a mind but

184
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,639
um in that book kurzweil talks about uh

185
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:37,360
hierarchical hidden markov models and

186
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,520
how we've got patterns you know patterns

187
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:43,120
of neurons working in a in a predefined

188
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,520
way and they lock in those patterns and

189
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,479
that it makes us very very flexible in

190
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:49,919
how we can learn

191
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:51,520
again it makes the brain a very very

192
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,639
powerful computing tool

193
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:55,919
and

194
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:58,160
we're adapted to recognize threats

195
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,639
against our survival who's ever faced

196
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:02,000
some sort of threat against your

197
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,520
survival

198
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,680
okay yeah pretty much everybody here

199
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,720
anybody who drove here or flew here had

200
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,039
a moment you know where you hit that air

201
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:12,560
pocket

202
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,880
everybody who drove here or flew here

203
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,400
probably had a threat against their

204
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,759
survival within the past you know days

205
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:22,240
right we we deal with this constantly

206
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,479
now who's ever been in a meeting

207
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:26,960
where a project scope changes and you

208
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,479
feel like it's a threat against your

209
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:30,240
survival

210
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,039
yeah

211
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:32,560
daniel and i are laughing because we've

212
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,240
been in a lot of those meetings together

213
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,720
over the years working together right

214
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,599
like it's our brain is not well adapted

215
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:42,319
to recognize that a conference room is

216
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:45,360
not like you know uh up the plains of

217
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,759
africa where there's a a tiger or a

218
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,879
cheetah after us so yeah that we react

219
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:53,440
like that project scope change or like

220
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,960
what you mean i have to run all those

221
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,479
scans at night

222
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:58,400
no i don't want to do that no that's not

223
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,599
going to work

224
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:02,080
so we react the same way as if we're

225
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,800
being chased by a pack of hyenas you

226
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,120
know with an open wound yeah

227
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,280
um and and we all deal with that within

228
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,120
ourselves we deal that with that within

229
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,720
our colleagues

230
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,000
as well

231
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,599
so when we look at this

232
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:17,280
what does this really mean it means it

233
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,240
leads us to some cons

234
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,639
one we're prone to error

235
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:25,919
we have systems that are set up to make

236
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:28,479
quick adaptive decision making

237
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:30,800
and very good decision making to keep us

238
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,159
alive like if if somebody faced a pack

239
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:35,919
of angry wolves and maybe you've got a

240
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:37,599
cut you're camping you're alone you're

241
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:38,559
cold

242
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,399
and maybe there's a couple ideas you

243
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:41,839
could come up with quick that would save

244
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:44,399
your life who would want to stop sit

245
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,240
down under a tree

246
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,399
and analyze this that's the time to

247
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,959
meditate and contemplate right

248
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:54,240
no not not at all not at all right we

249
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,480
have an amygdala hijack a whole bunch of

250
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,720
hormones are reduced and endorphins we

251
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,600
have

252
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,320
cortisol we have fight or flight we're

253
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,080
either either prepared to protect

254
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,839
ourselves as we huddle up and hope the

255
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:08,240
bear doesn't do too much damage or we're

256
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,640
equipped to climb a tree or run or bash

257
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,120
it with a rock or do something

258
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,600
well obviously we see that some of those

259
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,839
reactions are maladaptive at least some

260
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:18,959
of the time

261
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:20,240
um

262
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,320
so that leads to where those sys

263
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,880
especially that system one thinking

264
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,399
that's fast

265
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,320
um anybody read the works of daniel

266
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,160
kahneman at all like thinking fast and

267
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,440
slow

268
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,519
phenomenal book i highly recommend it

269
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:35,200
we'll get to kahneman a little bit more

270
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,640
in a few slides

271
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,760
but

272
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:38,880
um

273
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,080
basically

274
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,880
we're very prone to biases to heuristics

275
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,760
to mistakes in the ways we think

276
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,760
and we don't even realize it and we'll

277
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,120
get to some of the

278
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,160
the evolution of research along that but

279
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:55,360
we also evolve our thought process

280
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,160
pretty slowly like when's the last time

281
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,560
the human brain has had a major hardware

282
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:04,240
upgrade or wet wear upgrade if you will

283
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,440
yeah

284
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,200
not too recent right like it's pretty

285
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,680
much how it is so if we have things that

286
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,560
are wrong with it um you know obviously

287
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:15,920
i have the same brain i had in 1993.

288
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,399
could you imagine if i had the same

289
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:20,800
laptop running these slides that i had

290
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,519
in 1993 i don't think it was actually a

291
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:26,959
laptop but uh but yeah i mean it's a

292
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,800
good thing we can upgrade our computing

293
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,399
platforms or this would be running on a

294
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:33,040
286 sx16 with

295
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:33,920
you know

296
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,079
you know with a meg of ram or something

297
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:37,519
like that right

298
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:39,440
i uh oh that i just let everybody know

299
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,120
how old i am

300
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,200
but yeah there's there's some cons to

301
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,720
human information processing so

302
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,160
anybody familiar with any of these

303
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:51,279
gentlemen on the slides

304
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,120
here we go look at that see i didn't

305
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:57,360
dump the ice t on the electrical outlet

306
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,120
yeah oh see i put it on the i put it on

307
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,600
the ground i'm safer i'm safe now

308
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,000
um yeah i think if i dumped that on my

309
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,160
laptop i would have an amygdala hijack

310
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,160
and it would exemplify that fight or

311
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,000
flight i'd like run out the door before

312
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,560
the end point people could catch me be

313
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,399
the shortest talk ever

314
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:17,200
so

315
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,040
leon festinger

316
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,760
um you know near the like not long after

317
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,839
the turn of the last century

318
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:26,480
did some amazing research on what's

319
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,399
called cognitive dissonance

320
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:31,040
and also began a lot of research on

321
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,680
conformity um anybody heard that term

322
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,760
before

323
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,839
okay good so we'll we'll define it for

324
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:39,440
everybody so

325
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,600
have you ever had a friend anybody have

326
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,440
a friend in high school or college who

327
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,600
went down the wrong path like they were

328
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,959
great when you knew them when they were

329
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:49,040
15 or 18 but you look at them now you're

330
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,160
like oh

331
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,839
i don't even recognize this person how

332
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:53,600
did they get there

333
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,120
they may experience that yeah i think

334
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,720
we've all known that

335
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,760
so

336
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,680
festinger and explain this really well

337
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,519
with the idea of

338
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:03,440
any anybody

339
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,839
think about a time you've made

340
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:07,440
done something way outside of your

341
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,639
values maybe in grade school you're not

342
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:12,800
the bully but you you have a bad day and

343
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,560
you push another kid or something like

344
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,720
we can all come up with that example or

345
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,639
you're normally really polite in

346
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:20,399
meetings and you blow up at somebody i

347
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:22,079
mean everybody can connect with one of

348
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:24,880
those right well of course you feel bad

349
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,040
after right there's a couple answers to

350
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,440
feeling bad after uh festinger would

351
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,160
call that feeling bad after dissonance

352
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,160
so when you feel dissonance

353
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,560
you might revisit your life choices

354
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,639
change your behavior behavior and never

355
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:40,720
do that again that happens he found

356
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,519
about a good amount of the time but even

357
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:45,760
more of the time what we do is make up

358
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,639
justifications excuses

359
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:50,639
right so we go through and we're like

360
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:53,200
yeah i pushed him but he pushed me the

361
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,160
day before and now what happens is you

362
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,320
create an anchor that resets your

363
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,440
behavior

364
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,639
and then if you act again consistent

365
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:05,200
with that slightly adjusted value

366
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,959
there's more dissonance there's a new

367
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:08,880
anchor and that's where you look at

368
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,480
people like we deal with it in cyber

369
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,560
crime a lot like how could somebody do

370
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,800
that they just shut down a hospital

371
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,040
well festinger would say it was a

372
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:20,000
probably a result of new anchoring

373
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,800
points dissonance

374
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,920
justifications and then new anchoring

375
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,440
points till next thing you know like oh

376
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,279
yeah a few people die but come on it's

377
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:29,440
500 grand who cares

378
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,480
right so it's a journey

379
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,880
where those anchoring points change

380
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,440
solomon ash defined what we

381
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,000
what we loosely call peer pressure

382
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,360
anybody

383
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,360
relate to the time think about a time

384
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,680
you've maybe been sitting in a meeting

385
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,760
you see the correct answer

386
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,399
but everybody else sees it differently

387
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:52,240
maybe you're new on a job that

388
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,639
hesitation you have to speak out

389
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:56,800
well the good news is even in even in

390
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,560
solomon ash

391
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:02,240
in his experiments about 38 of the time

392
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,320
people do speak out

393
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,680
but that actually means about 62 63 of

394
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,560
the time they don't speak out right so

395
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,880
he showed that conformity and what he

396
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,880
did as a group of students

397
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,880
in in his classes he put them in a

398
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:17,920
circle

399
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,839
and had all of them in on the joke

400
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:21,199
except one

401
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:23,120
where they would look at two lines and

402
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,120
say whether it was longer or whether it

403
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,320
was shorter

404
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,680
and he would

405
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:31,279
about somewhere in the 60 to 63 percent

406
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:33,920
range and the number 62-ish is coming to

407
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,160
mind but i might be misquoting that

408
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,560
everybody can hit me up in discord later

409
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,399
if i am with the real number

410
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:41,120
but

411
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:44,000
it basically a a large majority of the

412
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,920
time when it would get time to that

413
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,519
student who wasn't in on the joke who'd

414
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:49,760
look at which line was longer they would

415
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,399
knowingly give the wrong answer

416
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:54,800
because clearly eight people in a row

417
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,880
just looked at it like my eyes must be

418
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,440
really bad today i can't contradict that

419
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,600
whole table of other people they can't

420
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,680
all be wrong i must be wrong

421
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:04,959
and then

422
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:07,120
um everybody her everybody has heard of

423
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,680
pavlov's dogs right we all experience

424
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:12,000
hey it's lunchtime i heard the bell i'm

425
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,839
salivating right everybody's heard of

426
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:16,320
pavlov's dogs right so their

427
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,880
conditioning is also a thing so you know

428
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,800
again we can begin to think of how do

429
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,639
our social platforms how does our

430
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:26,639
technology begin to condition us but my

431
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:29,199
two personal favorites and you can begin

432
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:31,199
to get into their work two ways the

433
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:33,839
serious way or the fun casual novelish

434
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:34,639
way

435
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:38,000
um two brilliant cognitive psychologists

436
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,440
one of them is

437
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,320
won the nobel prize daniel kahneman amos

438
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,720
taversky would have won the nobel prize

439
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,759
with him but he unfortunately died first

440
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:50,399
kahneman and tversky

441
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:52,880
in in israel

442
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,279
were university professors who had a

443
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:57,440
great relationship and bounced ideas off

444
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,680
each other for many years but they

445
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:02,720
really blew this science of heuristics

446
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,360
and biases within cognitive psychology

447
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,959
wide open

448
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:09,199
and you know as opposed to just showing

449
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:11,440
like hey in really weird edge case

450
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,360
conditions humans can behave a little

451
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,639
peculiar

452
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:18,240
they began to define very very specific

453
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,600
heuristics

454
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,320
and decision-making patterns we exhibit

455
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,639
to be able to navigate the world where

456
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:26,800
we're adapted and suited to

457
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,040
without without having major problems

458
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,639
right

459
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:31,519
so

460
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:33,199
anybody in the room want to take a stab

461
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:35,199
at defining what a heuristic is as it

462
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:37,120
relates to cognitive psychology i mean

463
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,839
we we work with the concept in computing

464
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:40,639
too

465
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:42,079
maybe they want to put themselves in the

466
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:44,800
spot for fun

467
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:47,279
i'll loosely define

468
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:49,440
a heuristic

469
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:52,800
as a predefined set of decision-making

470
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,759
criteria that can be rapidly applied

471
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:58,320
without significant thought

472
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,399
so we see this in computing all the time

473
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:02,560
right like it's a shortcut that's built

474
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,880
into our information processing as

475
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,000
people

476
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:06,880
so

477
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,959
um you know some examples they came up

478
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:12,240
with like the availability heuristic

479
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,359
so

480
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:16,400
who who's anybody afraid of plane flight

481
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,919
more so than cars um i think i was at

482
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:22,559
one time you know afraid of heights like

483
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:25,359
you go near a height that's me i i oddly

484
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:27,599
i used to be on a deep void rescue team

485
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:29,360
in the navy but i'm terrified of heights

486
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,160
i was then too but now like my kids go

487
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,679
near the glass at the shopping mall i'm

488
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:36,000
like no don't get too close like let's

489
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,360
pull you back here

490
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,280
you're within three feet of that glass

491
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,200
and that's like 50 feet

492
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,679
so that's an irrational fear

493
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:44,720
right

494
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,480
and if we go back to

495
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:49,120
uh everybody knows that flying is safer

496
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,200
than driving particularly commercial air

497
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,480
flight right all the math is clear but

498
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,480
we're still more afraid of flying

499
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,559
sometimes some people than driving even

500
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:00,720
those who know it's irrational

501
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,520
well it comes down to availability in

502
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:06,080
general people are more afraid going

503
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,160
through a bad neighborhood of being shot

504
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,080
than they are of heart disease when they

505
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,000
eat bacon for breakfast like i did this

506
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,160
morning right the bacon is a lot more

507
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,400
likely to kill me than walking through a

508
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,799
bad neighborhood if you do the math but

509
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:20,640
we don't do the math the availability

510
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,400
heuristic for example

511
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,520
tells us

512
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,760
that that we see

513
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:26,640
more

514
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,200
of the information about people shot and

515
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,919
people in plane crashes then then you

516
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:34,160
know people in mass droves dying of

517
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,760
heart disease because they eat too much

518
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,000
bacon and drink too much caffeine and

519
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,520
sleep too little and have too much

520
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,000
stress right so that's an example of the

521
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,400
availability heuristic there's

522
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,880
substitution heuristics

523
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,720
we kind of touched on anchoring but they

524
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,720
defined it much better

525
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,360
and basically if you want the basic

526
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,320
intro

527
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,559
to

528
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:59,280
kahneman and taversky's work you can

529
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,679
read a fun easy book called the undoing

530
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:04,320
project that basically is a biographical

531
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:07,039
fun story that unpacks a lot of this if

532
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:09,440
you really want the deeper concepts i

533
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,840
recommend uh kahneman's book thinking

534
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,480
fast and slow which is a phenomenal and

535
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,880
complete work on the topic

536
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,080
but

537
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,080
you can kind of begin to see how this is

538
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,320
beginning to take shape right you know

539
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,960
our thinking is flawed we have biases

540
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,960
and those biases are even more

541
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,039
repeatable and predictable than the

542
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:31,360
biases we have in computing you know

543
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,720
we've already seen

544
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,960
you know if there if there's a flaw in a

545
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,120
software product at least we know how to

546
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:40,000
fix it it's it's it's sometimes

547
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,559
difficult it's often easy but there's a

548
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:44,400
fix

549
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,799
it's much it's much more difficult to

550
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:48,400
fix our mind in the way we think if

551
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,960
that's off

552
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:53,600
there we go another successful drink

553
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,840
without spilling it now i just have to

554
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,440
hit the right clicker button and we're

555
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,720
set

556
00:19:58,720 --> 00:19:59,520
so

557
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,080
one last factor and then we'll then

558
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,840
we'll move beyond some of the the

559
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:06,159
cognitive psychology overview that sets

560
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:08,000
the foundation for this

561
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,919
dunbar's number

562
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:10,960
so

563
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,200
i think we can probably all identify

564
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,880
with the experience

565
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,440
of if you have thousands of followers

566
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,559
online

567
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:20,720
lots of connections maybe you work for a

568
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,480
company with thousands and thousands of

569
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,440
people

570
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,120
do you feel connected with all those

571
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,960
people it gets difficult to feel

572
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,480
connected

573
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,240
and then maybe if you've been a part of

574
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,039
a

575
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:33,760
a small a small graduating class a

576
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:36,080
sports team smaller groups you feel very

577
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,320
connected right you know

578
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,240
even your boot camp division might be

579
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,159
small enough to feel connected with the

580
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:44,000
group and you see photos online years

581
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,600
later oh that's so and so that's what

582
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,520
they're doing but you get a big group

583
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,120
you can't connect with it

584
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,919
so dunbar came up with the idea that

585
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:53,919
it's about a tribe size and the number

586
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,039
the numbers

587
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:56,799
people have varying opinions on the

588
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:58,640
exact number but it seems to land around

589
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:02,400
150 is the acceptable tribe size right

590
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,080
if you have a company

591
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:07,679
of 130 people it's going to be a pretty

592
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:10,559
intimate culture possibly you go to 300

593
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:13,280
people um and and aspects of this were

594
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,880
touched on a great business book called

595
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,480
crossing the chasm

596
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,880
you get to a much larger group companies

597
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,159
struggle because they're like wait a

598
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:21,919
minute we used to just trust everybody

599
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:24,080
now we have to have hr manuals well yeah

600
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,840
everybody doesn't know everybody anymore

601
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:26,960
they're not intimate they're not

602
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,200
connected you're above the tribe size

603
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,480
number

604
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,720
so i mean we think about that

605
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,880
what's the tribe size of facebook or

606
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,919
instagram you know can we possibly feel

607
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:39,679
connected and of course this leads to

608
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:42,799
other topics that are very very

609
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:44,880
you know hot topics these days such as

610
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,440
cyber bullying you know we see a lot of

611
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,960
phenomenon

612
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,919
yeah that come out of having tribe sizes

613
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:54,559
much larger than dunbar's number right

614
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:56,640
and we can't keep track of thousands of

615
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,799
people in our mind and we don't feel

616
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:01,440
empathy the same way right like if

617
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,760
you're if you're in a company of 10

618
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,840
and somebody dies it's like you're

619
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,440
mourning it for months

620
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,320
if you're in a company of 80 000 and you

621
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,720
hear there was a death in the european

622
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,760
division

623
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,000
yes you may feel bad you may have even

624
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,480
emailed with them once but then your

625
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,480
mind moves on and

626
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:23,039
yes we feel bad about not feeling bad

627
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:25,039
but we're fundamentally wired to work

628
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:27,760
this way it's hard to overcome

629
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,679
so

630
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:32,000
we're now now we'll take like let's now

631
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,679
that we understand some of the flaws of

632
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:34,720
people

633
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,520
um

634
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,679
all of us in this room for the most part

635
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:38,799
are here

636
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:40,960
because we've spent a whole lot of time

637
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,080
and effort

638
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,480
studying ways that information systems

639
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,919
are compromised

640
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:48,320
right and this will be oversimplified i

641
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,320
i a few of you in this room are giving

642
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,320
talks on just the slide and

643
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,000
obviously you could make a lifetime

644
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,080
study of single boxes on this slide but

645
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:58,640
for the that's not our purpose here but

646
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,720
essentially

647
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,960
you know exploitation exists because we

648
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,200
have vulnerabilities on house

649
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,799
we have somebody who wants to exploit

650
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:08,400
those vulnerabilities with intent

651
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,880
obviously

652
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:14,159
malicious ideas exploit vulnerabilities

653
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:15,280
right like

654
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,360
if we look at software

655
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,679
software and communication protocols as

656
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:22,720
ideas designed to carry out our

657
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:25,039
our will on the machines and thus in the

658
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:26,159
real world

659
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:29,440
you know it's it's ideas and then the

660
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:32,240
attacker will obviously expand escalate

661
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,840
privileges on the host

662
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,600
expand reach

663
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,280
carry out their objectives you know the

664
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,360
typical kill chain right

665
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,279
so i mean if we look at it malware is

666
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:43,360
really just a bad idea

667
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,039
it's a bad idea

668
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:48,640
that that is expressed in a way that our

669
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,640
information systems can translate and

670
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,000
process

671
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
so for the purpose of disinformation

672
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,159
it's valuable to think of malware as bad

673
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:57,279
ideas

674
00:23:57,279 --> 00:23:59,440
because that also brings into realm all

675
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:02,159
the things we do to deal with malware

676
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:04,080
some of them may translate back and give

677
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:06,000
us insights and how to deal

678
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,400
with uh with disinformation

679
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,720
yeah it's also useful to think of

680
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,799
malware as bad ideas and combating

681
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:14,240
malware too

682
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,919
um you know personally i've gotten

683
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:17,919
insights in some of our strategy from a

684
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:19,520
whole lot of thought experiments that

685
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,039
outcropped from this

686
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:22,080
as well

687
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,520
but

688
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,760
malware's just just a bad idea in a

689
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,440
particular format to exploit

690
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:30,240
vulnerabilities to you know to give an

691
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,320
attacker the ability to run their code

692
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,400
or their ideas they want their ideas to

693
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,720
run on your host not your ideas

694
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,480
and then they want a little more power

695
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,480
on that host they want to expand their

696
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,880
reach both on that host and to other

697
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,799
hosts

698
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:46,640
and i think you can see where the gossip

699
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,159
train is going to come in here pretty

700
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:51,360
quickly on the disinformation side

701
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,080
so

702
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,720
we can begin to kind of overlay

703
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:58,799
how how this fits with disinformation

704
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:01,520
you know what vulnerabilities do we have

705
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,520
yeah name some vulnerabilities just

706
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,600
somebody throw out some that we have as

707
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,760
human beings

708
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,520
there's

709
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,440
trust yeah sometimes trust as a

710
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,440
vulnerability yeah especially if it's

711
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,840
like unchecked and there's no data like

712
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:18,000
i'm just going to trust because daniel

713
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,840
said it and i like daniel

714
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:22,400
yep trust what else

715
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,640
conditioning yeah we can be the fact

716
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,640
that we can be conditioned is itself a

717
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:30,320
vulnerability absolutely what else

718
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,799
lethargy yeah absolutely lethargy is

719
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:34,559
definitely a vulnerability are we

720
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:36,720
getting any on the discord

721
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:39,279
okay any others

722
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:41,120
what's that

723
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:44,000
yeah mental anchor points what else

724
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,120
biases yeah well and i love biases

725
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,559
because often

726
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:50,480
the exploitable vulnerabilities you know

727
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:53,120
that that critical rc e flaw that we

728
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,400
have as humans

729
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,679
are usually

730
00:25:55,679 --> 00:26:00,080
deeply rooted prejudice hate fear

731
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,600
right like those are those are really

732
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:04,159
the the things right if you if somebody

733
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:06,880
already has a sliver of fear

734
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:09,840
and you can introduce a bad idea or a

735
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:12,000
component of mental malware that

736
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,159
amplifies that fear

737
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:16,240
like gosh the the effects can be

738
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,440
explosive

739
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,240
and

740
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,080
now this is for bonus points it's too

741
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,760
bad i don't have t-shirts to give away

742
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:22,880
maybe i should do that one of these

743
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,640
times who

744
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,159
who could guess like what's the

745
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:29,279
privilege escalation on a human host on

746
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:32,720
a human endpoint

747
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:35,120
what's that

748
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,799
trust

749
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:38,320
let's think about where's the point

750
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,799
where it stops just being software and

751
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:43,520
it begins to be your hardware biological

752
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,360
go ahead

753
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,600
fear yeah fear triggering like an

754
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,360
amygdala hijack

755
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:52,400
cortisol cortisones you know it

756
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,000
basically it's that point where you

757
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,760
don't think anymore we've all

758
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,919
experienced that like somebody went and

759
00:26:57,919 --> 00:26:59,679
pushed down your little sibling on the

760
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:01,760
playground now i'm not thinking yeah i

761
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,760
got i've got some scars from getting

762
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:06,720
attacked by a dog uh earlier this year

763
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:09,039
like definitely amygdala hijacked i

764
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:11,440
wasn't let's sit down and contemplate

765
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,919
this dog's intentions no it's you you

766
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:15,679
put it that you put it down and put an

767
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:17,279
arm across its throat and protect

768
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:18,559
yourself right

769
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:19,440
um

770
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:22,159
it's an amygdala hijack

771
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:24,960
that escalates privileges on the host

772
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,880
and as soon as you're dealing in stress

773
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:29,039
hormones and you're not dealing in

774
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:31,360
mental thought as soon as you're dealing

775
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,760
in rapid heuristics especially designed

776
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,480
for

777
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,960
protecting oneself protecting the things

778
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,399
that you care about

779
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:40,399
so if you have malware if you have

780
00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:43,840
mental malware if you have bad ideas

781
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:48,000
that will invoke an almost immediate

782
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,919
amygdala hijack

783
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:52,880
and that then introduces other ideas

784
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:55,120
that don't have to be true

785
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:57,440
right if you're if you're extremely

786
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,600
patriotic that gives you one disposition

787
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,279
you know being you know prior navy

788
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:03,360
obviously i'm very consider myself

789
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:06,000
patriotic if you're afraid of people who

790
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,320
look different than you in other ways

791
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,799
that could be it if you're afraid of big

792
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:12,320
government that could be it if you're

793
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,919
afraid of government falling apart like

794
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:16,720
you can use your imagination to the ends

795
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,960
of anything you could think of and just

796
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,600
like hosts you might have malware that

797
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,120
that will

798
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,960
run on one host that won't run on my

799
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:28,559
macbook and vice versa go ahead

800
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,840
yes social norms are phenomenal i should

801
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,840
have put that on the slide great great

802
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,360
insight yeah

803
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:37,360
social norms are huge

804
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,440
so we can begin to think think of just

805
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,840
like on our on our enterprise

806
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,039
environments

807
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:45,279
not every remote code execution flaw

808
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:47,279
applies to every host or every piece of

809
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:48,559
software

810
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:51,760
but you can begin to profile like oh

811
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,760
well i'm going to go after web farms

812
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,440
that are running apache so i'm going to

813
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,520
use this package of exploits i'm going

814
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:59,440
to go after windows web farms running

815
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,679
iis and net i'm going to use this

816
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:04,080
package i'm going to send malware you

817
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,640
know via macro viruses to end users

818
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,399
where i'm going to capture credentials

819
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:12,080
and do you know do uh you know mfa

820
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,760
social engineering and get in that way

821
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:16,320
or uh you know i'm gonna do oauth

822
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,159
phishing and get permissions into a

823
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:20,720
cloud environment right similarly

824
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,320
when putting together

825
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,120
you know a cognitive malware a

826
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:26,640
disinformation campaign

827
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,480
very very similarly

828
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:32,080
we you can begin to identify well i

829
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,840
can't control that this idea will just

830
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:36,159
give me get my ideas to execute on

831
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:38,559
everybody but it'll hit five percent

832
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:39,440
here

833
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,120
well i can't like this will hit a

834
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,720
different five percent over here and

835
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:43,840
they're kind of like the opposite

836
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,799
demographic you can begin to see how you

837
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:50,399
can see quite a bit of chaos right

838
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:51,840
um

839
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,600
any additional thoughts or questions

840
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,600
before we move on

841
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:58,000
go ahead

842
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:03,520
it is yes excellent point yeah it's

843
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,120
related to the sympathetic nervous

844
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:08,080
system fight or flight it's basically

845
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:10,480
that that protective mechanism that

846
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,159
makes it so we don't sit down and

847
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:14,000
contemplate how to get away from a pack

848
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,120
of angry wolves it saves us there but it

849
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:19,039
really works against us if we're doomed

850
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:21,360
scrolling through social media if we're

851
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,279
sitting in a in a meeting

852
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:25,520
and project scope changes all these

853
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:28,480
other all these other scenarios

854
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,320
so

855
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,919
you know

856
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:33,679
traditionally the reach

857
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:37,360
of bad ideas is limited right

858
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:38,720
so

859
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:41,039
i think everybody knows disinformation

860
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:43,200
is not a new phenomenon how long has it

861
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,880
been with us like let's just guess

862
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,840
yeah to the beginning of time millennia

863
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,120
and millennia

864
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:53,760
and probably like you probably literally

865
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:56,080
couldn't find a time where this wasn't a

866
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,200
relevant

867
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,760
and highly important phenomenon

868
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:02,240
but what's the impact of a bad idea

869
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,399
without social media without connected

870
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:07,360
platforms where my ideas can't reach any

871
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,679
further than the local pub like when i

872
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:12,000
was a kid if i would have somebody had a

873
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,399
bad idea they go to the local pub they

874
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:16,399
say that bad idea and somebody says

875
00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:18,320
knock it off norm you're an idiot oh

876
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:19,279
okay

877
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:21,200
then that's the end of that bad idea

878
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,480
possibly

879
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,640
um

880
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,000
what's that

881
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,399
if only right i mean there was a time

882
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:30,640
you know back to dunbar's number if your

883
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,880
tribe size is 150 and your tribes are

884
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:35,360
relatively isolated how long does it

885
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,200
take a bad idea to spread throughout the

886
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,600
world how many bad ideas have an

887
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,519
opportunity become worldwide well

888
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:43,600
throughout history many do

889
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:46,159
but but the ratio of them the speed at

890
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:48,000
which they take hold the speed at which

891
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,559
they spread and the number of things you

892
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:52,960
could do to mitigate them yeah are very

893
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,159
very different

894
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:56,080
and uh you know there have been a lot of

895
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,679
great talks about you know the meme

896
00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:00,960
factor you know super salient ideas that

897
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,880
connect with a particular emotional

898
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:05,679
response that spread like wildfire

899
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:07,840
and you know sometimes

900
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,600
often these ideas are harmless they're

901
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,080
even beneficial if i didn't have all the

902
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:13,919
jokes and memes and funny things that

903
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:16,159
people send me every monday morning i'm

904
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:18,000
not sure i would get through mondays i'd

905
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,559
probably just go back to bed curl up and

906
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:22,080
that would be the end of it daniel would

907
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,399
be stuck doing everything that week

908
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:25,279
so

909
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:27,039
i mean when we look at it

910
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:28,960
not all the thing not all of the things

911
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,880
that we get from social platforms are

912
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:33,440
bad connectedness and our connected way

913
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:35,600
of life is something i'm not sure i'd

914
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,919
trade for anything just personally

915
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:39,760
but it brings with a different level of

916
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:42,159
responsibility just as having a

917
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:45,360
connected world brings a security burden

918
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,120
for what we need to do to protect that

919
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:49,919
connected world and the importance of

920
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:52,159
losing information systems back in my

921
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:54,000
286 sx

922
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,440
16 days when i had like two games on it

923
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:59,120
now it's a little more important than

924
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:03,200
then and uh compromise it can really

925
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,279
impact our society our way of life it

926
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:07,760
can be devastating well it's similar

927
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:10,399
with disinformation now

928
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:13,440
so social media can take bad ideas and

929
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:15,440
literally make them wormable

930
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:17,919
right once i carefully craft

931
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:21,360
a disinformation campaign a bad idea a

932
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:24,240
bad message and deliver it out into the

933
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,360
world

934
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:27,600
i need a certain amount to get it going

935
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,679
go ahead

936
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:32,480
yeah definitely it's the amplification

937
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:35,039
and you know in martial arts any martial

938
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:37,679
artists in the room besides me yeah okay

939
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:39,360
cool a few yeah

940
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:40,559
uh so

941
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:42,640
you you talk about things like force

942
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:45,760
multipliers right there there's single

943
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,600
points where you have leverage to

944
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,600
control a lot of force with a little

945
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:52,559
force or obviously edged weapons or

946
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:54,960
things that amplify force over a small

947
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:57,360
surface area they're force multipliers

948
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:00,080
well our technology performs it's a

949
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:04,000
force multiplier multiplier it performs

950
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,480
amplification of our ideas

951
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:09,199
and who are the most likely people to

952
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:10,719
know people with a particular

953
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:13,439
vulnerability

954
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:18,000
yeah friends family relatives all the

955
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,119
people in their circle of influence like

956
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:23,918
if we if we did a network map of human

957
00:34:23,918 --> 00:34:26,879
nodes you know those next couple layers

958
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:29,359
out would be the people so

959
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:31,199
that amplification

960
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:32,159
point

961
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:33,520
comes back to

962
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:35,520
you know if there's one some sort of

963
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,119
legitimate trigger event which could

964
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:38,960
even be induced right or it could be

965
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:41,199
made up often the trigger event is

966
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:43,918
literally a fake story that resonates

967
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:46,800
with a particular response

968
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:49,918
a carefully constructed narrative

969
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:51,760
that's delivered

970
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:54,320
with you know custom tailored supporting

971
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,879
information because it's it's just like

972
00:34:56,879 --> 00:34:58,960
maintaining compromise in an enterprise

973
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:01,040
environment you have to have command and

974
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:03,040
control i mean you don't want to just

975
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:05,200
hook a system because you want to carry

976
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,680
out an objective and it's almost never

977
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,680
just one system and the system you get

978
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:12,000
first is almost never the system you

979
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
want right so it's the same with

980
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,400
disinformation

981
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,480
except there's more of a bot element

982
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:21,280
because it really is effective when done

983
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,839
through masses

984
00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:25,520
and then what do you end up with as an

985
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:27,040
output of it

986
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:29,280
you end up with polarization

987
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,440
you end up with you know

988
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,520
i i feel like we we

989
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:35,520
prior to social

990
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,599
media networking disinformation

991
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:39,040
campaigns

992
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,720
it it seemed like we were a little

993
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:43,200
closer across the world right like there

994
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,200
were the extremes that were recognized

995
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,920
as extremes general viewpoints sat a lot

996
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,680
closer to a midline

997
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:50,480
and

998
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,320
you know as i talk to people and travel

999
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:55,760
around and have you know discussions

1000
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:58,000
it seems like the distance from that

1001
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,280
midpoint

1002
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:01,839
is further the standard deviation if you

1003
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:04,480
will is greater and the concentration at

1004
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:07,440
the extremes are causing a very abnormal

1005
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:10,720
distribution of people along ideas

1006
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,720
right but that's a natural output you

1007
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:15,280
would expect from disinformation did you

1008
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:19,400
have another question from the discord

1009
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,280
yeah

1010
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:35,119
definitely right it's the reach of

1011
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:36,400
information

1012
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:39,119
it's the quantity of information and i

1013
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:40,560
excuse me i love what you brought up

1014
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,720
about the quantity of information

1015
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,560
because

1016
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:47,680
it's hard to validate it's very easy and

1017
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:50,240
cheap to put information out

1018
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:52,960
and it's very difficult to validate the

1019
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:55,359
integrity of information you know i'm

1020
00:36:55,359 --> 00:36:57,040
sure i'm not the only one working in our

1021
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:58,800
line of work who gets emails from people

1022
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,440
all the time text messages from friends

1023
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:03,839
is this true can you validate this is

1024
00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:05,760
this legit anybody else get tired of

1025
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,040
those

1026
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,880
i've had to apologize to a couple people

1027
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,160
because i have one off on them and i'm

1028
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,920
like look i apologize you're like the

1029
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:13,599
80th this week

1030
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:15,920
um and i'm not no i'm not going to spend

1031
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,680
100 100

1032
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:20,000
hours researching this to disprove it

1033
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,119
it's ridiculous like let's just move on

1034
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:26,000
yeah so but but the

1035
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,480
the the amount of effort it takes to

1036
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:29,920
integrity check the amount of

1037
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:31,680
information we take in

1038
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:35,119
is such a high processing burden on us

1039
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:36,880
as individuals

1040
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:39,440
that that people have often just given

1041
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:42,079
up on checking things they just take for

1042
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:44,000
granted what they see they'll maybe

1043
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,160
check a source once but again they'll

1044
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:48,079
check that source not based upon a

1045
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:50,480
rigorous scientific analysis of the

1046
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,560
truth of things it puts out they'll

1047
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:54,720
check that source by how well the biased

1048
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:57,200
stuff it says lines up with the biases

1049
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,880
they are they already have and i say

1050
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,960
they i really mean we right we all do

1051
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:03,520
this i do this too it's just natural

1052
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:06,160
innate human nature

1053
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:07,119
so

1054
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:10,320
you know how do we defend against this

1055
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:11,200
um

1056
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,560
you know we'll get we'll get a little

1057
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:13,839
deeper and then we'll kind of take

1058
00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:15,280
questions on that

1059
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:17,440
um in cyber we all love kill chains

1060
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:20,000
right yeah and in military too kill

1061
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,760
chains are a lot of fun

1062
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,359
so we're going to look at kind of like a

1063
00:38:23,359 --> 00:38:25,359
disinformation kill chain that's been

1064
00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:26,960
like one of the thought experiments of

1065
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:29,680
this is like what would it look like

1066
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:31,440
to set up a kill chain for

1067
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:33,680
disinformation and how could we leverage

1068
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:34,720
that

1069
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:37,040
to pro to better protect ourselves our

1070
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:39,280
society our way of life

1071
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:41,280
because you know as we've seen like the

1072
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:43,520
impact is not zero of this phenomenon

1073
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:46,880
it's it's very very high impact

1074
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,960
so obviously you know credit goes to

1075
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:51,520
lockheed martin for their cyber kill

1076
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:53,040
chain don't need to dwell on that

1077
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,640
everybody knows that pretty well here

1078
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:56,880
probably if not you know if if you're

1079
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,880
just starting off definitely google that

1080
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:01,520
it's good but then go to miter attack

1081
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:03,200
because in my opinion it's much more

1082
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:04,160
useful

1083
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:06,960
but but it's a good salient example of a

1084
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:09,280
simple kill chain we can reference and

1085
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,640
then there's the old military one

1086
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:13,440
everybody anybody recognize the the

1087
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:17,839
fixed target track target engage assess

1088
00:39:17,839 --> 00:39:19,920
i like when i was researching this i

1089
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:22,079
sort of had like a brief flashback to

1090
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:24,640
either boot camp or some slide i ignored

1091
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:26,800
20 years ago or something like that but

1092
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:30,079
it it it resonated but the military put

1093
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:31,760
this together a lot longer before

1094
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,520
lockheed did and they kind of pioneered

1095
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:35,440
the idea of kill chain of course they

1096
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:36,800
mean something a little different by

1097
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:37,760
kill

1098
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,040
um

1099
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:40,160
so

1100
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:42,000
like what would a disinformation kill

1101
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,440
chain look like

1102
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:45,680
well if we were going to launch like if

1103
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:48,000
we here decided all right that's it

1104
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,760
we're gonna we're gonna turn evil today

1105
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,359
all of us we're gonna go out to one big

1106
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:53,119
happy hour we're gonna pull up a

1107
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:54,720
whiteboard we're gonna drink a bunch and

1108
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:56,160
we're gonna figure out how to just wreck

1109
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,280
the world

1110
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:59,760
so the like the thought experiment is

1111
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,920
what steps would we follow well first

1112
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,440
we'd have to define

1113
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,839
campaign objectives we'd have to figure

1114
00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:08,160
out like what do we want to accomplish

1115
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:10,800
do we want to sow division do we want to

1116
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,880
create such overwhelming support of one

1117
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:15,440
idea that it you know overcomes another

1118
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:18,240
idea causing some sort of disruption are

1119
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:19,839
we doing it from a nation-state

1120
00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:22,480
perspective are we a disgruntled

1121
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:24,400
disheveled faction with

1122
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,640
of society that feels you know

1123
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:28,720
unappreciated like who are we what do we

1124
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:31,040
want to do you have to like any attack

1125
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:33,599
you have to define your objectives now

1126
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:35,200
once you have your objectives i think it

1127
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:38,480
bifurcates into a couple tracks

1128
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:41,040
we've all seen it you know if you if you

1129
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:42,720
want to do something that involves a

1130
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:44,880
botnet you either need to rent

1131
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:47,599
buy or cultivate a botnet so in this

1132
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:48,400
case

1133
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,079
let's just assume that you need to

1134
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:52,560
cultivate it to pull it off so you have

1135
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,319
a parallel track of

1136
00:40:54,319 --> 00:40:57,040
you know creating accounts setting up

1137
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:59,040
chat bots setting up all the

1138
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,800
infrastructure you need

1139
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:03,440
um you know the the rough outer shell

1140
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:05,520
that will deliver your malicious

1141
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:08,240
communication and remember it's got to

1142
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:10,800
be multi-layer multi-channel

1143
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:13,760
and complex enough to to really resonate

1144
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,680
with people over and over again in

1145
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:18,560
multiple ways to build and expand upon

1146
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:20,800
the viewpoint you want to cultivate

1147
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:21,920
right

1148
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,520
but in parallel you're going to map and

1149
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:25,839
organize your your target culture this

1150
00:41:25,839 --> 00:41:28,079
is like the disinformation campaign

1151
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:29,920
equivalent of your vulnerability scans

1152
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:32,400
right what hosts do they have what ocean

1153
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,480
can i find out and actually some of

1154
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:36,480
that's even the same ocean

1155
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:37,920
what uh you know

1156
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:40,240
what's what ports are open what services

1157
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:42,240
are running are you running the service

1158
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:44,160
called i hate this kind of person or i

1159
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:46,480
dislike that kind of person oh no but

1160
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:47,839
you're running the service called i'm

1161
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:50,560
terrified of xyz i'm terrified of

1162
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:52,720
heights well we'll say that this group

1163
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:54,560
over here wants you to stand on top of

1164
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:57,680
tall things oh terrified okay

1165
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:59,599
what am i supposed to hate again like

1166
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:01,520
obviously i'm making fun of the process

1167
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:04,400
but you can kind of get the idea

1168
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:05,200
then

1169
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:07,520
once you have those fears and biases to

1170
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:09,040
target once you know your target

1171
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:10,400
demographic

1172
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:12,800
what you want to accomplish and you have

1173
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,560
all those mapped out

1174
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:16,960
um it's creating and delivering the

1175
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:18,079
content

1176
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:19,200
right and

1177
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:20,960
a lot of folks in in the room and

1178
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:23,119
probably on the the stream do content

1179
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:25,440
creation so we know what all this is

1180
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:27,440
about and at that time uh if you're

1181
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:29,280
running a disinformation platform

1182
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:30,720
hopefully you've got all the accounts

1183
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:33,599
created you've got everything set up and

1184
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:35,440
you know your your technical track has

1185
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:37,040
aligned with your human track and you're

1186
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:39,280
just ready to cause chaos

1187
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:41,119
and then you know of course you maintain

1188
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:44,400
and control your cognitive foothold and

1189
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:46,240
then what do you do you evaluate the

1190
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:48,960
effectiveness calibrate ongoingly like

1191
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:51,119
whoa i think some disinformation

1192
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:52,560
campaigns have probably done this like

1193
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:54,400
whoa that was way more effective than

1194
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:56,240
they thought what do we do now

1195
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:59,599
yeah i mean again it's it's sinister but

1196
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:01,280
i'm sure people are literally having

1197
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:03,920
these conversations right now right

1198
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:04,720
so

1199
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:06,400
you know what's valuable about kill

1200
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:08,160
chains anybody want to throw something

1201
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:10,000
out there

1202
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,079
like what's valuable about the the kill

1203
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:14,079
chain idea as it relates to information

1204
00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:16,560
systems

1205
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:21,040
yeah exactly it offers a point to

1206
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:22,079
disrupt

1207
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:23,200
um

1208
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:24,560
what's that

1209
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:27,599
or control right to disrupt to control

1210
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:29,599
to to alter

1211
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:30,560
um

1212
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:33,359
and uh you know i i have a friend who

1213
00:43:33,359 --> 00:43:36,000
once described it as like a chain of

1214
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
pearls you know as you have connected

1215
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,480
ideas or process steps if you break it

1216
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:42,640
all the pearls just go everywhere

1217
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:44,880
so if we disrupt creating the

1218
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:46,240
infrastructure

1219
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:48,240
then the campaign's probably not very

1220
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:49,920
effective that's where we've seen lots

1221
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:52,319
of pressure on social media companies

1222
00:43:52,319 --> 00:43:53,599
and counter intelligence and

1223
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:55,200
three-letter agencies and that kind of

1224
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:57,280
thing obviously

1225
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:59,440
um if people

1226
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:02,400
have a greater awareness of uh

1227
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:04,960
that disinformation is even a thing like

1228
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:06,880
when i first started talking about this

1229
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:08,960
you know six seven years ago or whatever

1230
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:11,359
people like this what huh

1231
00:44:11,359 --> 00:44:14,400
yeah like i i got the weirdest responses

1232
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:16,960
from from most people obviously uh

1233
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:18,880
probably not from people in this room i

1234
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:20,160
think it was probably some of the folks

1235
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:22,000
in this room are like oh yeah this is a

1236
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,319
real problem but the world in general if

1237
00:44:24,319 --> 00:44:26,240
you just went to a random bar and

1238
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:29,119
started talking disinformation in 2015

1239
00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:33,520
2016 you'd get this really weird look

1240
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:35,680
so what can we do

1241
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:37,280
you know what are the things we've

1242
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:38,240
learned

1243
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:40,720
from protecting information systems that

1244
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:42,319
we could apply

1245
00:44:42,319 --> 00:44:44,800
to protecting you know our most

1246
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:47,119
important information processing unit to

1247
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:48,960
each of us individually

1248
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:50,560
and to collective groups you know

1249
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:52,400
because there's nothing more frustrating

1250
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:54,400
even in our social units

1251
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:56,800
uh to to have people go off the deep end

1252
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:58,160
and just go nuts because they're

1253
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:00,240
believing every crazy thing put out

1254
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:02,079
there anybody else have friends that

1255
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:03,760
you're like just trying to reel back in

1256
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:04,800
like

1257
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:06,720
because the effects are real like when

1258
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:09,119
you go for a disinformation campaign

1259
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:11,520
that's negative and malicious hook line

1260
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:13,760
and sinker the effects i've seen in a

1261
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:15,200
lot of people that i've interviewed and

1262
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:16,720
talked to about this

1263
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:17,599
are

1264
00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:19,599
true disillusionment

1265
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:22,560
true deep deep depression like if you

1266
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:24,720
create a false narrative that's a very

1267
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:27,119
very dark picture of the world and

1268
00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:29,359
somebody reaches the full point of

1269
00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:31,119
believing that all the way

1270
00:45:31,119 --> 00:45:32,720
it's sort of like if somebody's running

1271
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:35,280
a crypto miner and just trying to eke

1272
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:37,119
out every bit of juice they can from

1273
00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:39,119
your laptop like it's not a great

1274
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:41,040
experience for your laptop forgetting

1275
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:42,960
about the broader you know the broader

1276
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:45,040
implications like it just sucks for the

1277
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:47,680
it sucks for the controlled node right

1278
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:49,440
uh even if they don't know it sucks at

1279
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:51,040
the time it sucks

1280
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:51,920
so

1281
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:53,599
what are the things we can learn from

1282
00:45:53,599 --> 00:45:55,359
from our line of work that might apply

1283
00:45:55,359 --> 00:45:59,799
to this let's throw out some ideas

1284
00:46:05,839 --> 00:46:07,359
everybody is like we're at that point

1285
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:09,119
where we need more caffeine i i

1286
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:11,200
recognize that i'm there too

1287
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:12,160
so

1288
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:13,920
you know obviously this could go a lot

1289
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:16,079
further and we could have a long deep

1290
00:46:16,079 --> 00:46:18,720
conversation just about what to do but

1291
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:20,560
to fit it into a two-minute slide and

1292
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:22,800
leave room for some q a

1293
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:24,400
you know threat intelligence and

1294
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:26,000
information sharing has been really

1295
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,160
valuable to us in cyber right like

1296
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:29,760
knowing what people are doing what

1297
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:32,240
campaigns are emerging what trends

1298
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:33,760
you know kind of staying on the cutting

1299
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:35,119
edge and trying to think of how to

1300
00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:37,200
protect ourselves against things it's

1301
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:39,680
really valuable so know who's attacking

1302
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:41,359
and guard against them again anchoring

1303
00:46:41,359 --> 00:46:43,200
back to that kill chain like you can

1304
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:45,839
analyze the different steps yeah maybe

1305
00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:48,560
maybe as technology companies we can

1306
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:51,200
guard against people on our platforms

1307
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:53,280
cultivating these campaigns creating

1308
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:55,119
fake accounts putting in the

1309
00:46:55,119 --> 00:46:57,520
infrastructure they need to distribute

1310
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:59,599
you know their mental malware

1311
00:46:59,599 --> 00:47:01,280
and and you could go all along the kill

1312
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:02,640
chain and i'm sure come up with a

1313
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:04,560
hundred disruptive measures i've never

1314
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:06,800
thought of but you can begin to think of

1315
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:07,920
them

1316
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:08,720
um

1317
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:11,040
the other is set aside personal agendas

1318
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:12,480
and look at facts

1319
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:14,160
right like no matter what we think no

1320
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:15,839
matter what our bias is

1321
00:47:15,839 --> 00:47:19,200
we can get better at integrity checking

1322
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:21,359
you know a lot of the software we put on

1323
00:47:21,359 --> 00:47:24,400
our systems to protect against attack

1324
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:25,359
is

1325
00:47:25,359 --> 00:47:27,520
software that looks like hey you could

1326
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:29,599
do things like file integrity monitoring

1327
00:47:29,599 --> 00:47:31,520
like whoa that's not what the hash is

1328
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:33,599
supposed to be on that file you can do

1329
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:35,839
things like behavioral monitoring whoa

1330
00:47:35,839 --> 00:47:37,599
that's not how my system is supposed to

1331
00:47:37,599 --> 00:47:39,280
behave like one thing i've tried to do

1332
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:41,520
is i've been studying this and i do an

1333
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:43,839
imperfect job at it right like everybody

1334
00:47:43,839 --> 00:47:45,839
else but there are moments like when my

1335
00:47:45,839 --> 00:47:47,599
blood pressure is up when there's that

1336
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:49,200
pounding in the head when i feel the

1337
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:51,680
cortisol rushing through my veins a good

1338
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:54,000
question to do is just stop and ask like

1339
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,800
okay what am i upset about what did i

1340
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:59,520
just read what did i just see

1341
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:01,599
you know what what truly is going on

1342
00:48:01,599 --> 00:48:03,839
here what made me react that way is this

1343
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:05,680
thing i read even true

1344
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:06,640
like

1345
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:08,559
so we can we can disrupt the kill chain

1346
00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:11,520
as individuals and then again if we put

1347
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:14,640
if we put cognitive malware antivirus on

1348
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:17,040
humanity it'll be a lot harder to

1349
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:19,040
exploit humans right

1350
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:20,400
so

1351
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:22,240
there's there's firewalling right which

1352
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:23,520
we talked about

1353
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:25,839
ideas coming in maybe we filter out some

1354
00:48:25,839 --> 00:48:28,640
of our sources right like maybe i just

1355
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:31,200
don't read those cool tabloids with all

1356
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:33,200
the fun stories about jerry springer and

1357
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:35,119
aliens and what they're planning

1358
00:48:35,119 --> 00:48:36,880
together right like i could actually

1359
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:39,760
just disconnect myself or block out

1360
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:41,520
certain information sources that are

1361
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:44,160
likely to be not wonderful for me

1362
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:44,960
um

1363
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:46,880
we already covered if a new idea fills

1364
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:48,640
you with anger and hate be very very

1365
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:49,839
suspicious

1366
00:48:49,839 --> 00:48:51,839
you know same same deal if you see

1367
00:48:51,839 --> 00:48:53,440
something weird on the host if you see

1368
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:55,200
something weird on yourself

1369
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:57,040
you guard against that

1370
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:58,720
and then patching and vulnerability

1371
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:00,319
management like

1372
00:49:00,319 --> 00:49:03,760
if we deal with the underlying

1373
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:06,240
things like if we're just a little less

1374
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:08,720
fearful of each other if we clean up

1375
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:10,400
some of the vulnerabilities within

1376
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:13,200
ourselves within our society

1377
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:16,800
and have fewer points to where

1378
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:18,720
somebody can just introduce an idea and

1379
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:21,040
make us angry hateful whatever caused

1380
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:23,359
that privilege escalation it's going to

1381
00:49:23,359 --> 00:49:25,040
go a long way

1382
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:27,040
so with that i'll open it up to

1383
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:31,079
questions thoughts ideas

1384
00:49:31,839 --> 00:49:35,680
both both on the stream and in the room

1385
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:41,280
well cool i'm i put it on the first

1386
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:43,680
slide my twitter's

1387
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:45,839
at crude solutions let's see i'll go

1388
00:49:45,839 --> 00:49:46,800
rapid

1389
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:49,440
back to put on the intro slide for that

1390
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:52,079
um so if you're interested in this or if

1391
00:49:52,079 --> 00:49:54,079
you contemplate it later

1392
00:49:54,079 --> 00:49:56,480
apologize for the fast rewind you can

1393
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:59,839
follow me on linkedin mike manrod or

1394
00:49:59,839 --> 00:50:02,880
twitter crude solutions and um

1395
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:05,119
yeah just happy to engage in dialogue

1396
00:50:05,119 --> 00:50:07,440
and you know my hope with this is that

1397
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:09,520
it gets legs and that people think of

1398
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:11,119
ideas for how to deal with this

1399
00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:12,880
hopefully a hundred better hundred times

1400
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:15,040
better than any i've thought of

1401
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:16,559
and just like

1402
00:50:16,559 --> 00:50:19,359
uh mental malware spreads through

1403
00:50:19,359 --> 00:50:21,520
you know networks of people the solution

1404
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:23,760
also arises in the collaboration and

1405
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:26,000
ingenuity of networks of people just

1406
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,480
like all of you here all of us here

1407
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:30,240
so thank you very much have a wonderful

1408
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:33,720
