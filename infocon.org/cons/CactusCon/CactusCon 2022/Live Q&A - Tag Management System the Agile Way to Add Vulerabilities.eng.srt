for your talk thank you very much to for

4
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:13,920
letting me come to cactus con was a

5
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,519
great time yeah absolutely where are you

6
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:16,720
coming in from

7
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:19,840
i'm actually in japan right now it's

8
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,720
eight in the morning

9
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:28,320
[Laughter]

10
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,480
um awesome great so thank you so much

11
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,558
for your chat you know it's that there's

12
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:34,399
there's so many uh

13
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:36,640
insecurity especially like

14
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,719
it it's hard to think of all the blind

15
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:41,040
spots until you've actually encountered

16
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,360
some or had a problem or an issue with

17
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,680
them so i'm a little curious if if this

18
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,879
was you cleaning up a mess or or or how

19
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:51,760
did the content for this talk come about

20
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:52,640
yeah

21
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,239
yeah it's quite

22
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:56,160
a bit of both actually

23
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,640
so when i was a web marketer at the

24
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,920
company my previous job i was uh

25
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,799
responsible for the google tag manager

26
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:06,159
and

27
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:08,320
everything related to web marketing on

28
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:11,040
the website and

29
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,320
uh as i show on the talk i had a lot of

30
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,720
responsibility and i could actually add

31
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,759
and remove everything i wanted directly

32
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:21,600
on the the front end

33
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,840
which is when you think about it

34
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:24,880
uh

35
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,720
well it's great for marketing of course

36
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,759
but it's all it also opens uh you know

37
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:32,960
doors to security vulnerabilities so

38
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,960
i think that's uh something

39
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,320
i

40
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,320
really wanted to share with everybody to

41
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,600
you know let

42
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,680
everybody know that it's something they

43
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,240
have to think about

44
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:47,119
yeah and uh i i like that your your talk

45
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:49,119
included this sort of like

46
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:52,000
how to talk to people to get it fixed

47
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,920
because you don't want to just be like

48
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,759
i'm shutting it down

49
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:57,600
um you know sometimes it's difficult to

50
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,040
balance that sort of like the business

51
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,640
needs to do the business but security

52
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,600
needs to do security yes exactly

53
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,079
uh i think as a security person you want

54
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:07,520
to you know check everything before

55
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:11,038
going live uh i think it's well quite

56
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:13,120
normal to do in a lot of places but in

57
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,959
marketing you know it's

58
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:15,680
uh

59
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,680
it's very difficult because you have

60
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,680
time constrained for a lot of things

61
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,480
like if you have an event that just is

62
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,879
going to be live in one day or something

63
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:26,720
you have to be ready and you don't have

64
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,200
to you cannot wait for you know security

65
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,599
to do the assessment and every

66
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:34,319
uh single tools you want to use on the

67
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:36,319
the front end so you have to you know

68
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:38,319
strike a good balance between

69
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:40,160
what can i

70
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,800
check beforehand and what can i uh you

71
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,599
know rolls on the development side and i

72
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:51,839
mean production side and check live

73
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:54,640
sure sorry i i saw that you mentioned uh

74
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,040
like possibility of shifting left which

75
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:57,920
you know

76
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,680
i normally think of in sort of like code

77
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,120
development cycles

78
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,959
it also makes sense to think of other

79
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:06,000
aspects of the organization that have

80
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,239
places to shift left that security could

81
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:09,760
participate in

82
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,360
yes exactly

83
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,959
uh

84
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:13,680
i

85
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,800
myself

86
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,959
thought about you know shifting left

87
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:19,440
only about the the development side but

88
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,080
thinking about it i i think it's uh you

89
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,239
can use it for not only development but

90
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:29,200
also other aspects such as web marketing

91
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,680
yeah i'm curious uh

92
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,840
if i'm not sure if you you know exactly

93
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,200
i feel like there's a zillion ways to

94
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,640
slice every security cat but um

95
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,159
what would you say are some of the like

96
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:41,680
the the

97
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,680
primary mitigations you could put in

98
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,519
place like to me it's like

99
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:47,760
monitoring of that account that they use

100
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,159
for changes or

101
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:52,560
or or the scripts themselves moderate

102
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,640
like a code base or a github for the

103
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,040
code that is going into the tag managers

104
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,760
or what do you think

105
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,239
a very good question uh well the first

106
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:05,599
thing i think you should do is uh

107
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:06,799
uh

108
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:08,080
first check

109
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:08,879
uh

110
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:10,879
how the the management of the google tag

111
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:13,360
manager i mean google tag manager or

112
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,920
another tag management tool

113
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,720
check if the the account is secure

114
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,839
one thing

115
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:22,079
i didn't include in the slides is you

116
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:25,759
can delegate some of the

117
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:28,800
of the permission to another company

118
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,720
for example if you don't do

119
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,120
all of the web marketing inside i mean

120
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,759
in-house maybe you are sharing some of

121
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:37,600
it with another company

122
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,090
and

123
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:39,360
[Music]

124
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,680
do you have an overview of everybody

125
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,160
who's using your google tag management

126
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,560
that's something you should i think

127
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,919
check first

128
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:50,320
then the second thing to check is what's

129
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,840
on your website

130
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,280
and

131
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,880
as i thought in the the talk it's very

132
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,280
difficult to you know check everything

133
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,520
so there will be some checks that will

134
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,240
have to happen uh

135
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,240
in the user's browsers so directly

136
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,720
using another script to check what

137
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,440
resources are

138
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,039
what can i say

139
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:15,039
used in the

140
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:17,600
user phrasing browser application

141
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,120
and

142
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,240
that

143
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,039
that's some uh how can i say that's a

144
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:24,320
that's something that is not as

145
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,479
developed as you know what we find on

146
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:27,680
the

147
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,050
um

148
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:29,680
[Music]

149
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,520
uh supply chain in the

150
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,039
in the server side

151
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:34,560
so

152
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,400
yeah i would start with the with these

153
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,039
three first steps

154
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:41,039
did i make myself clear

155
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:43,600
yeah i was thinking uh like in my head

156
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,360
it's it's sort of like uh like

157
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,199
javascript fingerprinting almost and

158
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:48,960
sort of like monitoring what is

159
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,880
happening on the machine to make sure

160
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,400
that it's not

161
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,080
going somewhere it shouldn't

162
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,720
exactly yes

163
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,199
okay great well uh

164
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:00,800
is there anything else you sort of want

165
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,120
to uh leave any viewers with to keep in

166
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,960
mind uh that you weren't able to fit in

167
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,759
there uh

168
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:11,120
yes i would like uh people to uh i think

169
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,280
in the security committee community we

170
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,800
are

171
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:19,680
not very kind with our marketers peer so

172
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,080
and i can't understand why but uh i

173
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,199
would like people to um

174
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:28,240
try to know more about their job and

175
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,440
be you know not the adversaries but the

176
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:35,520
friends to try to you know make

177
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,520
your application secure i think it's the

178
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40,479
the goal of everybody so

179
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:42,560
try to make friends with web marketings

180
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,880
and work with them to

181
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,319
learn a little bit more about tag

182
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:49,520
management system and

183
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,599
make it secure

184
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:54,000
yeah i think it's the uh the adage

185
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,360
there's a

186
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,120
what is it you get more flies with sugar

187
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,919
than vinegar or or bees or something

188
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,880
i don't know about this one but the idea

189
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,720
is you know if you're sweet you don't

190
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,199
get what you wanted originally anyway so

191
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:09,039
it's it's much easier to start with that

192
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:12,479
approach yes exactly you know security i

193
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:14,720
i think is all about curiosity so you

194
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,319
know the different

195
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:18,319
learn about so that we can do our job

196
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:20,560
better those people are going to tell us

197
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,880
the pieces we need to know to secure it

198
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,240
yes

199
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,400
