1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:01,520
hi

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:03,360
thanks for coming to the

3
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,440
ransomware kill chain why companies

4
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:08,559
needed talk uh i'm curtis minder i'm ceo

5
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:11,200
group sense i'm here with bryce webster

6
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,360
jacobson who's one of our intel analyst

7
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:15,360
leads who works with me on a lot of the

8
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,039
ransomware cases

9
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:19,520
uh many of you probably just saw bryce

10
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,080
on the screen uh in the floating head uh

11
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,519
scenario so since zoom won't let us do

12
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:26,960
two floating heads

13
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,080
uh or my head is too big to fit prices

14
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,000
on the screen also you will just hear

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,239
bryce's voice you won't get to see bryce

16
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:36,239
you get to see plenty of me

17
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:37,840
through the whole thing and i can like

18
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,760
resize myself and stuff like that it's

19
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,600
super cool okay so

20
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:42,559
um

21
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:44,399
just a little bit of background uh i

22
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:45,600
need to know how to advance the slides

23
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:46,559
there we go so a little bit of

24
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:47,360
background i'm not going to do the

25
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,719
credibility slides where we talk about

26
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:50,399
ourselves um i'm sure you guys will get

27
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:51,600
copies of these slides you can read

28
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,120
about us you can google us things like

29
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,920
that um but i did want to say uh you

30
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,680
know a little bit about the company real

31
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,760
quick group sense is a digital risk

32
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,840
protection company uh we've been around

33
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,879
for about eight years uh focused on uh

34
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:06,400
cyber reconnaissance digital risk use

35
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,720
cases for our clients it's a

36
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,400
subscription service

37
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,479
looking for attack vectors and risk

38
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:15,119
affecting enterprises and governments um

39
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:16,720
about a coup about two years ago we got

40
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,960
involved in some of the ransomware cases

41
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,320
just as a derivative of what we were

42
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,240
doing in the digital risk space where we

43
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,920
were finding things like initial access

44
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,880
brokers and things like that um

45
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,240
that quickly snowballed as you know

46
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,560
ransomware has been uh has been prolific

47
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,759
in the last couple of years for a number

48
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:34,000
of reasons we'll talk about that but um

49
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,560
as that snowballed we became uh

50
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,439
quite

51
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:39,439
in demand around the ransomware response

52
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:41,040
side of things and

53
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,960
we developed a practice over the last

54
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,680
couple years focused on that discipline

55
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,439
this talk originally well it was

56
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:49,680
actually developed by and thought of by

57
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,840
one of our top threat intel analysts

58
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,240
nicole hoffman nicole hoffman also known

59
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,360
as at threat hunter girl on twitter

60
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,040
came up with this concept based on some

61
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,960
of our real world experiences

62
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,719
unfortunately nicole had a family

63
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:03,840
emergency

64
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,920
and she couldn't make this so you have

65
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,399
to put up with uh with bryce and i

66
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,720
instead um

67
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,480
and there's the uh

68
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,080
i don't know why we decided me and black

69
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,239
and white and bryce in color but yeah

70
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:18,239
i'm not sure either but uh i i need to

71
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:20,319
get the black and white headshot i think

72
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:22,000
right on it i don't know like you look

73
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,680
more pensive i look like

74
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,920
i'm high on something but um so a little

75
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,680
bit about uh the ransomware market

76
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,280
obviously everyone that's attending the

77
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,959
conference is very aware of this this

78
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:32,480
problem i don't want to

79
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,879
talk about the the marketing things i i

80
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:37,440
will say that um you know the the

81
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,400
proliferation of ransomware

82
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,480
is is really uh affected by a number of

83
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,319
things in my opinion keep in mind that

84
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:47,120
ransomware as as a practice is not new

85
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,760
there's been some version of this in uh

86
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,360
in cyber for

87
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,040
well before we could use the word cyber

88
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,280
for example we went back even to the 80s

89
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,040
where people were sending floppy disks

90
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,159
that would lock people's computer and

91
00:02:58,159 --> 00:02:59,599
ask for money orders sent to panama and

92
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:01,200
things like that now the cool thing

93
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,720
about back then is it was really hard to

94
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,879
do this at scale and it also is very

95
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:06,319
difficult to transfer large sums of

96
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:09,120
money what's changed is uh you know the

97
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,120
advent of cryptocurrency and the dark

98
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,120
web that that combination has really

99
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,040
made it easy for folks to

100
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,800
both create marketplaces where access is

101
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,239
bought and sold uh create a

102
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:21,840
an anonymous environment where you can

103
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,080
sell platforms to deliver the service

104
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,599
and then of course cryptocurrencies

105
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:26,959
allowed us to

106
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:28,239
uh we had we don't have to send money

107
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:30,000
orders anymore we can transfer very

108
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,680
large sums of capital across

109
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,360
international borders virtually

110
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,480
undetected or at least anonymously um

111
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,159
there's also certain marketplaces that

112
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:41,040
have popped up around this and um you

113
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,799
know so you'll hear things like initial

114
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:44,560
access brokers if you aren't familiar

115
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,720
with that concept that is basically a

116
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,000
marketplace where threat actors are just

117
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
simply selling the access uh persistent

118
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,840
uh stolen access to networks typically

119
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,480
the buyers of that access are ransomware

120
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,080
attackers now the thing that's really

121
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,720
interesting is um a lot of people uh who

122
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,640
aren't in the space i'm sure the

123
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,080
audience here is aware but a lot of

124
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,200
people who are in the space assume that

125
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,439
these bad guys are super sophisticated

126
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:07,360
hackers and the fact is is they're

127
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,720
really not using a lot of the the

128
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,400
sophisticated attacks they're not

129
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,319
they're not writing custom malware

130
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:15,439
they're not buying zero days um

131
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:17,279
this last bullet in the lower right hand

132
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:20,320
corner um is uh basically illustrates

133
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,680
that they're using some pretty low

134
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,440
hanging fruit attacks a lot of those

135
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,840
attacks are largely preventable but

136
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,680
they've been precipitated by in the last

137
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,240
few years the work from home environment

138
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,600
i know bryce if you want to add anything

139
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,199
to this at all or did i just steal all

140
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:35,360
of the thunder on this slide

141
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,280
no you covered it pretty well and i

142
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,600
think one one area that we also talk

143
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,680
about is the as the current state of

144
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,080
ransomware is what threat actors are

145
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,080
actually doing when they uh are hitting

146
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,800
targets with ransomware so we've seen

147
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,600
the

148
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,320
proliferation of shame sites or blogs

149
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,240
that ransomware operators

150
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,880
are using to publicize their attacks and

151
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,600
share samples or tranches of data that

152
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,759
have been exfiltrated uh from the

153
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:03,919
victims so we're not seeing simply an

154
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:06,320
encryption of a

155
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,680
victim's network we're seeing the

156
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,240
exfiltration of data and extortion as an

157
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,080
element of the ransom demand so uh an

158
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,440
evolving set of threats that

159
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,919
each create an additional layer of

160
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:22,240
complication when trying to respond to a

161
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,639
ransomware attack right and it's it's

162
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:26,720
iterative it's it's continuing to to

163
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,800
evolve

164
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,400
so the the i mentioned where these

165
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,759
things come from um they come from

166
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:35,759
the the dark web and underground

167
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:37,680
marketplaces they come from the

168
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,840
anonymity that cryptocurrency affords

169
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,919
threat actors the transfer currency

170
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:43,840
and then the pandemic

171
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,479
has sort of facilitated a

172
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:48,080
an environment with an increased attack

173
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,800
surface for the victim companies

174
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,400
many of the cases that we've worked kind

175
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,840
of boil down to some very simple things

176
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,360
and that is unsecured remote access

177
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,600
whether that's vpn or rdp um where

178
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,759
in if you think of in the case of a of a

179
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:03,360
larger small business you've got an

180
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,479
executive

181
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:06,639
they call the it department they're very

182
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:08,400
angry they're like hey i need access to

183
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,280
blah blah immediately you open up an rdp

184
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,400
port to get them access because you

185
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,080
don't want to make the executive mad and

186
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,240
then you forget about it

187
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,520
and that cop

188
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,520
coupled with perhaps a poor password

189
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,600
policy a poor credential policy and lack

190
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,080
of multi-factor authentication means

191
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,680
there's a lot of these out there that

192
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,400
the bad guys are are attacking um and a

193
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,240
lot of it is fully automated for the bad

194
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,840
guys so it's not like they're they're

195
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,440
manually scanning your network right

196
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,800
they've got tools to do that

197
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,319
automatically they have tools to try the

198
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:37,840
rdp ports automatically they have tools

199
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:38,960
to try their stolen credentials

200
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,120
automatically so it's it's a push of a

201
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,919
button for them uh and uh you know say

202
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:45,840
the pandemic has really opened up a lot

203
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,800
of attack service for them um

204
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,720
so that you know the idea of having a

205
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,520
ransomware kill chain is um and i love

206
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,800
how this is like making my hair look

207
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,199
funny um so the the ransomware kill

208
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:59,280
chain is really you know obviously we're

209
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,520
we're staying on the shoulders of giants

210
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,199
there's been a lucky martin kill chain

211
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:06,560
for a very long time uh that really

212
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,160
takes a simple model of looking how

213
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,440
threat actors gained access in a

214
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,440
traditional cyber attack i don't have to

215
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,880
tell the community about this this has

216
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,400
been around for a very long time and we

217
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,039
all understand uh the logic behind how

218
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:18,800
these things happen

219
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,639
ransomware does follow much of this

220
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:22,319
almost identically it's just got some

221
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:26,639
nuances that make it slightly different

222
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:27,919
you know

223
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:29,520
the unified kill chain was really the

224
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,360
next step where we took things like

225
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,039
attack and and you know miter's attack

226
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:35,120
and we took uh the the kill chain in the

227
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,280
previous slide and we we added some meat

228
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:40,560
to it right so um paul puls uh decided

229
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,319
hey look that that the original kill

230
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:44,639
chain was great but uh there's a little

231
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,319
bit more there's a little more detail

232
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:48,879
required here um around how these things

233
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:50,560
occur um

234
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,879
again most of these things are are

235
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:54,400
pretty much in parallel to what we see

236
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,160
in a ransomware attack

237
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,319
but what we've learned firsthand working

238
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:00,560
with the clients is uh there are some

239
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,400
nuances that make it a little bit

240
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,639
different um on how the bad guys are

241
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:06,400
operating uh bryce anything you want to

242
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,639
add to this

243
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:10,960
uh no i i think i will save my thoughts

244
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:14,160
for the ransomware kill chain

245
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,759
right on um so

246
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:18,000
the the idea is in the case of of of

247
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,759
ransomware we need to look at it from a

248
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:20,800
little bit different lens than we

249
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,479
traditionally looked at other attack

250
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:24,560
frameworks um and let me just tell you

251
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,400
like from a real world scenario how this

252
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,639
often plays out where

253
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:30,720
most uh tools that we've developed

254
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,200
around response incident response uh

255
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,599
incident response plans and tools all of

256
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:36,719
those things

257
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:38,559
had some assumptions about the cyber

258
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:41,919
attack uh and even if you zoom out even

259
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,440
outside of the technical and tactical

260
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,040
components of this the way the business

261
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,880
viewed cyber attacks was quite a bit

262
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,720
different in that the

263
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,480
cyber attacks were sometimes an

264
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,959
embarrassment um often an annoyance and

265
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:54,320
sometimes you had to pay some fines

266
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,839
right because data left the building

267
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:59,360
what's what's changed here uh is that

268
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,160
um one the the motivation behind the

269
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,560
attack is much more lucrative right so

270
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,760
the bad guys are not

271
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,600
monetizing stolen credentials which go

272
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,320
for pennies a piece on the dark web

273
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,560
they're they're they're getting paid

274
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,080
huge sums of ransom so that the

275
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,240
motivation is a little bit stronger and

276
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,680
two um

277
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,040
these other cyber attacks while they

278
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,480
were annoying sometimes embarrassing

279
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,399
like i said occasionally you paid a fine

280
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:25,040
um they did not disrupt the operation of

281
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,040
the business and so this is where it

282
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,200
starts to change a lot um in a

283
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,800
ransomware attack it's not just that

284
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,240
they've stolen your data and they have

285
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,240
um and bryce will talk about that but

286
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,519
they they have

287
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:38,080
stopped your ability to operate uh and

288
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,720
that has um one one of my friends uh is

289
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,800
a marketing executive at another uh tech

290
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,800
company and he coined this phrase the

291
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,800
ransomware blast radius so if you think

292
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,560
about where the missile hits that's the

293
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,640
that's the encryption the rings of

294
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,360
damage around that um are massive and a

295
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,480
lot of people don't think about that

296
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,000
price

297
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,040
yeah so as curtis mentioned we we built

298
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,800
this ransomware kill chain kind of on

299
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,040
the shoulders of of giants shoulders of

300
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:08,399
other uh well understood uh

301
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:11,120
theories and and frameworks that help

302
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,279
the cyber security community understand

303
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:16,800
a cyber attack and the reason that we

304
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,959
designed or codified the cyber kill

305
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:21,760
chain is not to replace any uh theories

306
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,360
or say that we're you know we're doing

307
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,360
it correctly our framework is is more

308
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,880
accurate it's to it's to map our uh

309
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,240
collective understanding of frameworks

310
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:30,959
to

311
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:33,760
the evolving threat of ransomware and

312
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:37,200
and to update the frameworks that exist

313
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,839
from a cyber attack perspective uh

314
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:41,680
to match the the current state of

315
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:45,040
ransomware as it is here in 2022 in late

316
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:48,880
2021 when we were working on this so

317
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,959
this is not meant to to replace any

318
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:52,000
existing

319
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,360
theories but to help us have a

320
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,600
a common understanding a common

321
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,240
framework to not only disrupt ransomware

322
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,320
attacks but also work with

323
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:05,200
victims as they respond to the complex

324
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,320
nature of

325
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,200
of ransomware attacks as they are today

326
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,320
and this is going to be an iterative

327
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,240
process and curtis and i have talked

328
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,519
about

329
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:15,440
elements of the of the ransomware kill

330
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,720
chain that we're presenting today that

331
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,120
maybe we would already want to update um

332
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,640
and we will continue to see as

333
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,760
ransomware operators update and iterate

334
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,720
on their uh ttps that our frameworks are

335
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,600
going to need to be updated as well to

336
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,120
match that so

337
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,120
uh we're presenting the kill chain here

338
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,760
uh in its complete form and we'll dive

339
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,680
into each of these rings uh acts as x

340
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,920
fill and encryption on on later slides

341
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,120
but uh

342
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,800
presenting kind of the whole picture of

343
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,959
the kill chain to one show the

344
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:47,279
relationship between the different

345
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:50,800
actors involved in uh more sophisticated

346
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,480
uh ransomware attacks or even some of

347
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,680
the less sophisticated ransomware

348
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:54,800
attacks

349
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,200
we understand that ransomware groups or

350
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,440
affiliate programs are pretty

351
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,480
sophisticated operations uh in in 2022

352
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,360
so

353
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,959
being able to represent the

354
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:06,480
specialization or the specialized

355
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,079
functions of individual actors in the

356
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:11,120
kill chain was important and also

357
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,560
making sure that we have targets

358
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:15,120
represented on this uh kill chain as

359
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,160
well so

360
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,399
bringing in the targets to the

361
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:20,160
uh the framework so that we can

362
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,959
understand that there are motivations um

363
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:25,680
behind attacks that

364
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,600
ransomware operators are conducting but

365
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,600
also reasons that they're not targeting

366
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,320
individual individual groups so uh chris

367
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,200
if you want to go to the next slide we

368
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,680
can talk some more on targets um so we

369
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,839
have restricted specified targets and

370
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:39,680
targets of opportunity

371
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,320
i want to talk about restricted first

372
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,800
we've seen publications or public

373
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,800
statements from ransomware operators

374
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,040
that claim they will not attack certain

375
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,560
targets based on their geographic

376
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,480
location or their industry

377
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,560
we saw some ransomware operators

378
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,079
claim they will not attack healthcare

379
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:58,320
organizations or hospitals during the

380
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,240
coven 19 pandemic

381
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,760
how true that was

382
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,760
is not really up for debate because

383
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:07,360
we've seen a large amount of attacks on

384
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,959
on healthcare organizations and

385
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:10,160
hospitals

386
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,160
but more often we're seeing ransomware

387
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,200
operators

388
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,800
restrict their targets based on

389
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,279
geographic location so not attacking any

390
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:19,120
companies in

391
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,880
cis or former

392
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,839
former soviet union states

393
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:26,399
specified targets being targets that are

394
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,320
in a specific geographic location so

395
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,560
maybe they're in the uk or the us or

396
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,839
another western

397
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:34,079
country or they're in a certain industry

398
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,920
or they have a certain revenue

399
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,839
when we curtis was talking a little bit

400
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:40,000
about network access brokers

401
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,720
you'll see some offers or requests from

402
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,959
ransomware operators looking for

403
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:46,959
initial access to

404
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:49,839
companies of a certain revenue above 500

405
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:51,680
million or above a billion dollars in

406
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:52,959
annual revenue

407
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:54,399
to try to again

408
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:56,480
uh go after a more lucrative target that

409
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,040
can result in a larger

410
00:13:59,040 --> 00:13:59,920
payday

411
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,440
and then lastly targets of opportunity

412
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,040
these are you know successful social

413
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,680
engineering attacks maybe a company that

414
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:09,440
had a vulnerability in a certain rdp uh

415
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,399
software or program that the threat

416
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:15,440
actor is scanning for open ports or

417
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,120
scanning for a common vulnerability and

418
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,199
then that's the access that they are

419
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:21,519
then selling or using to conduct a

420
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:23,760
ransomware attack um and and the last

421
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:24,800
bullet point on their exposed

422
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,240
credentials we've talked about the role

423
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,560
that uh

424
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,639
password lack of password hygiene or

425
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:32,800
good password hygiene can play in in the

426
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,360
simplest of ransomware attacks um you

427
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,360
know these are not necessarily the most

428
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,959
sophisticated attacks but they still

429
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:41,360
result in the same damage and uh it can

430
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,279
result in the same amount of damage as a

431
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:45,760
super sophisticated hack

432
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,920
and i wanted to add to that um bryce

433
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,839
that uh

434
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:51,760
we believe there's a trend where threat

435
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,920
actors will draft off of other successes

436
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,639
so for example if a threat actor group

437
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:59,120
attacks i don't know um like a trucking

438
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,160
and logistics uh software company

439
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,320
we would see then over the next six to

440
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,440
eight months

441
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,880
a bunch of attacks on trucking and

442
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,040
logistics companies if a company if a

443
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,839
threat actor is successful in

444
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:13,199
penetrating a finance company the same

445
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:15,040
in the finance vertical so while they're

446
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,720
not necessarily targeting finance if

447
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,160
they get lucky enough to hit a service

448
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,399
provider in that space they often draft

449
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:22,160
off the service provider and hit either

450
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,480
their clients or constituents

451
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:29,440
whose data is inside um that platform

452
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,279
perfect so let's talk about

453
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:36,399
access the first uh first phase of our

454
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:38,079
ransomware kill chain and again this

455
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:40,639
maps similarly to uh the cyber kill

456
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:42,639
chain or the unified kill chain that we

457
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:44,720
we've seen earlier where threat actors

458
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,279
are performing reconnaissance on targets

459
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:50,800
they are uh weaponizing their access

460
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,040
curtis is moving around the snow fields

461
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,680
of this mountain

462
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:59,519
uh they they are are um weaponizing uh

463
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:02,000
their access and delivering it to uh the

464
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,040
client and and then um exploiting that

465
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:08,480
access uh and and often then in in the

466
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,040
case of a ransomware attack that that

467
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,279
access that an initial access broker was

468
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:14,480
able to

469
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:17,440
uh able to gain is then sold or passed

470
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:20,000
along or used to uh

471
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,160
to start a ransomware attack so that's

472
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,320
this particular phase of the of the

473
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,079
ransomware life cycle that we're

474
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:27,839
uh or the

475
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:29,680
ransomware kill chain that we're seeing

476
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,759
um is often done

477
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:35,360
by you know specialized um

478
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,040
individual specialized actors that are

479
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,120
that are focused on uh generating the

480
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,199
initial access that can then be used so

481
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:43,600
this uh portion of our kill chain maps

482
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,920
pretty closely with the uh other

483
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,240
existing kill chains that we mentioned

484
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,639
earlier

485
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:52,000
yeah just among

486
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,040
one of the things that you need to think

487
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,880
about about where the best places to

488
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,399
disrupt this this is one of the best

489
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:58,399
places to disrupt it right where using

490
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:00,800
digital risk data you can determine uh

491
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,320
when these access brokers are selling

492
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,519
that access

493
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:04,880
and whether that's impacting your

494
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,640
company or one of your partners or even

495
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,760
one of your suppliers like i mentioned

496
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,079
in the previous slide so getting getting

497
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:12,240
in early getting the intelligence data

498
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,400
early about the attack is important

499
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,679
we've actually

500
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:17,919
disrupted actual attacks and impacts

501
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:19,839
from actual attacks uh ransomware

502
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:23,280
attacks by uh detecting the access sail

503
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,520
before the ransomware actors were

504
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:29,280
successful in executing the attack

505
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:31,120
correct yeah and that's that's a great

506
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,120
point i think when we get to the end of

507
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,520
each of these circles is often where we

508
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,000
see from group senses perspective we see

509
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,320
uh the greatest opportunity for uh

510
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:43,360
digital risk protection uh to uh

511
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,840
interrupt an attack so um you know as

512
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,240
we're on the uh on the x-fil part of the

513
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,799
kill chain uh that initial access has

514
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:53,600
been um exploited and and persistence

515
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,080
has been maintained the threat actor is

516
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,120
able to

517
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,280
escalate privileges inside the network

518
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,919
to you know instead of just exfiltrating

519
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:04,320
data from one machine or one system

520
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,080
maybe they're escalating those

521
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,840
privileges to

522
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,919
get across your entire network across

523
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:11,919
servers even sometimes into

524
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:13,280
backups which we'll talk about a little

525
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,039
bit later

526
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:17,919
and discovering files or data that is of

527
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:19,600
importance to them there's been some

528
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,760
really great research in publication on

529
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,200
some of the

530
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,720
queries that threat actors and

531
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,720
ransomware groups are using to search

532
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,039
for files or information

533
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:30,799
they're searching for

534
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:32,400
hr information they're searching for

535
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,080
financial information they're searching

536
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,760
for

537
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,640
tax information legal documents

538
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,160
that can be used

539
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,120
in conversations or uh

540
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,880
in extortion attempts they're searching

541
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,440
for uh trade secrets intellectual

542
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,840
property uh so there's some really great

543
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:50,720
uh

544
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,320
and we can link those in the discord i

545
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:55,360
guess uh so we have that tool uh really

546
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,039
great research done on on some of the

547
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:58,880
queries that ransomware operators have

548
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,120
used to um

549
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,039
to discover files and then

550
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:04,799
uh we have lateral movement obviously

551
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:06,480
within the network and then data

552
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,720
exfiltration so an important part of the

553
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,760
current uh current ransomware operators

554
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:12,720
uh

555
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,799
attacks is to to exfiltrate that data

556
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:17,280
before they encrypt um encrypt your

557
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,799
network

558
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:19,760
yeah

559
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,200
the thing i would add here is you know

560
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,679
the discovery phase is where the threat

561
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:25,039
actors typically gain most of their

562
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:27,120
leverage on the back end of this process

563
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,360
so uh over the years over the last

564
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,799
couple years we've seen them be very

565
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:32,400
deliberate about the kind of data

566
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,840
they're looking for like bryce said you

567
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,160
can see some of these sample queries but

568
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,000
they are looking for if they can get a

569
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,600
copy of your financials if they can get

570
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,679
a copy of your cyber insurance policy

571
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:43,440
it's really hard for you to to bluff

572
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,280
them on how much money you have to spend

573
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,280
uh because they they have those records

574
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,360
right um and then you know on the data

575
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,039
exfil side

576
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:53,440
you know keep in mind that that uh

577
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,520
they're they're attempting to get all of

578
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:56,880
this data someplace where they can use

579
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,000
it against you from an extortion

580
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,440
perspective etc um part of the discovery

581
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,880
process in addition to the financial

582
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,039
documents and the data the exfol data

583
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:07,120
exfol part are to grab things that would

584
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,360
be potentially used as leverage against

585
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,919
you from a from an hr perspective from a

586
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:14,799
from a hipaa perspective um and we've

587
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:16,799
even seen threat actors focus on for

588
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:19,679
example executives uh personal machines

589
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:20,640
to see if they could get something

590
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,360
personal about the executive outside the

591
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,640
network where they can use it as

592
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,720
leverage in the negotiations uh for

593
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,039
payment

594
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,840
and then the last phase of our

595
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,159
ransomware kill chain is the encryption

596
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:38,480
so after the um

597
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,799
data has been exfiltrated

598
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:42,000
the

599
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,080
and the threat actors have established

600
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,320
command and control with

601
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,360
with their access they will

602
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,400
basically

603
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,919
install the malware that encrypts

604
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:54,159
everything that they have access to uh

605
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:57,200
stopping your services and uh preventing

606
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,799
you from from

607
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:01,679
operating normally so we've seen this on

608
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:04,000
we've seen this affect

609
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,880
our clients or victims ability to

610
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,720
pay their employees if it's hitting

611
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,240
their hr systems

612
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,559
we've seen it affect a client's

613
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:15,200
abilities to collect payment from their

614
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,520
point of service machines so

615
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,760
really this is this is kind of the final

616
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:20,960
stage where

617
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,280
often ransomware attacks are the

618
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,559
successful ransomware attacks are

619
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:25,919
noticed because

620
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:27,840
you come into work one

621
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,919
monday morning or late friday afternoon

622
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:31,760
or late friday evening and

623
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,600
none of uh none of your machines are

624
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,039
working

625
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:37,360
and there's either a note or some other

626
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,280
notification from a

627
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,880
from the ransomware

628
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,799
actor that's claiming responsibility and

629
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:44,320
giving you instructions on what to do

630
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,799
next uh based on their attack

631
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:48,000
yeah i think from a disruption

632
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
perspective this is another key point to

633
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,559
detect although often what we've learned

634
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:54,720
is at this point it's almost too late

635
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,919
because uh on the c2 com component

636
00:21:57,919 --> 00:22:01,120
there's a lot of edr xdr

637
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,480
you know detection systems that can pick

638
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,159
up c2 communications

639
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:05,200
although the threat actors are pretty

640
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,640
clever about how they do this and it's

641
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,159
pretty disguised so it's hard to catch

642
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:10,159
but when you do catch it sometimes you

643
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:12,240
can detect it and disrupt it the

644
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,520
challenge is

645
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,840
the c2 has a heartbeat typically and if

646
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,840
you disrupt the heartbeat um sometimes

647
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,120
they'll they'll start pulling the the

648
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:22,559
rip cord and executing the ransomware um

649
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:24,320
to try to do as much damage as they can

650
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:28,240
and we've seen that firsthand as well

651
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,919
perfect so and then you know

652
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:35,840
after uh

653
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,039
it's important to think about what

654
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:39,120
happens kind of beyond the ransomware

655
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:42,320
kill chain all the implications of the

656
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,240
data that's been exfiltrated and the

657
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,720
considerations that a

658
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,880
uh the the stakeholders at a

659
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,720
victim organization will have to

660
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:53,120
consider when uh

661
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,919
choosing to or making the decision to

662
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:58,000
either conduct negotiations or respond

663
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,240
to uh how they're going to respond to

664
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:03,600
the ransomware attack uh so it's simply

665
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,000
you know not just looking at um

666
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,760
the incident response plans as it

667
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,919
pertains to backups but the pr

668
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:12,480
implications uh marketing implications

669
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:15,039
and uh the cyber insurance implications

670
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:17,679
legal uh legal notifications uh so

671
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:19,120
there's much

672
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,120
uh many more uh considerations that

673
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,039
happen after uh the ransomware skill

674
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:25,760
train has been uh successfully uh from a

675
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:28,159
threat actor perspective uh successfully

676
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:30,159
leveraged so occurs yeah and i think

677
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:31,200
this is where we talk about that

678
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:34,000
ransomware blast radius metaphor where a

679
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,280
lot of companies recognize that

680
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:38,000
typically in a ransomware attack it's

681
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,520
disruptive to the business like we all

682
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:42,960
get that like we nothing works right um

683
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,720
it's becoming pretty well and commonly

684
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,480
known that they took some of our data

685
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,960
and they're going to threaten to dump it

686
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,520
um but what's often sort of the soft

687
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,600
effects that are often lost in that is

688
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,159
employee morale customer confidence uh

689
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:58,080
public relations all these things that

690
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,320
bryce mentioned all those do have a cost

691
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:03,279
and an impact on the business

692
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:05,679
um so let me you may take this one bryce

693
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:07,039
for a minute

694
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:08,799
yeah go ahead i'm gonna put my head

695
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:11,360
between look at that

696
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,520
so um so we just a few things that we

697
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,360
learned the do's and do nots in a case

698
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:18,480
uh like this um obviously

699
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,720
there is a process and a known response

700
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,799
process now on how to deal with these

701
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:25,919
cases uh don't panic um

702
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:27,520
one of the things i will also say is you

703
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:30,559
know do do not just google

704
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:33,039
help me decrypt

705
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:35,440
you know ragnar locker or help you know

706
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,200
how to respond to

707
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,559
you know um

708
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:40,080
our evil uh don't do that because

709
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,520
there's there's a number of scammers who

710
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:42,880
pay for the google adwords for those

711
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,640
searches and i won't get into the

712
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,960
details of those scams but uh the types

713
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,159
of results results you're going to get

714
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:49,679
in your first search for trying to

715
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:51,679
resolve this is not going to be in your

716
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:54,159
favor um you also don't want to engage

717
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:55,360
the threat actor until you absolutely

718
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,840
have to right so don't the ransomware

719
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,200
note is going to be very compelling it's

720
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,200
going to try to get you uh to talk to

721
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,400
the bad guys who suppose they might even

722
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,760
offer you a discount if you talk to them

723
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,279
within the first 24 hours or something

724
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:07,679
like that the issue is with that is is

725
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:09,200
often when you're you're engaging with

726
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,200
the threat actors the ransom note will

727
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,960
send you to a dark website where you'll

728
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,159
either interact with the threat actors

729
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:16,159
that dark website typically has a clock

730
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:18,480
you go to that ransomware site and clock

731
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,240
starts ticking down and that that they

732
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,919
they attach a bunch of threats to the to

733
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:24,000
the sort of the the culmination of that

734
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,679
clock which is things like we'll double

735
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:27,600
the ransom amount uh we'll start dumping

736
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,520
data etc so

737
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,440
our recommendation would be don't don't

738
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,440
engage until you're absolutely ready um

739
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,200
and there's a process around getting

740
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,000
ready um also uh we just went through a

741
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,799
case where the the unfortunately the the

742
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:42,640
it department didn't really recognize

743
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,640
what was going on um that it was a

744
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,240
ransomware attack and they started

745
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,679
rebooting machines now we all know the

746
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:49,039
joke right like if it's not working what

747
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:50,000
do you do you turn it off turn it back

748
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,840
on right don't do that don't do that

749
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:54,880
here because what happens is often um

750
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,960
the ransomware's encryption software is

751
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,279
is usually pretty buggy and if you start

752
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:00,799
rebooting machines renaming files

753
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:02,799
anything like that it'll cause

754
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:04,880
issues um i'm gonna leave a couple of

755
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,000
them for bryce to talk about but i'm

756
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,919
gonna hammer through these quickly

757
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:09,360
we always recommend engaging legal

758
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:10,880
counsel that ransomware blast radius

759
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,799
also has some potential legal components

760
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:14,480
to it where if depending on where you're

761
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,080
located you may have breach notification

762
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,520
laws and things like that to come into

763
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:18,960
effect those usually have timelines

764
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,919
associated with them um so know that

765
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:25,320
pr support

766
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,440
the biggest mistakes that we've seen

767
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,760
made on that back end of these by by

768
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,080
companies is miscommunicating

769
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:34,240
the the breach information or the the

770
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,400
attack information um and we've seen

771
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,720
that play out in in lawsuits and so on

772
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,880
so having when someone both legal and pr

773
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,559
advise you on what to say to your

774
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:44,320
employees what to say to your partners

775
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:45,840
um what you have to share what you

776
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:48,960
shouldn't share etc um ir obviously

777
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,799
having an ir team is important and an ir

778
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:52,400
plan is important

779
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,880
practicing the plan is also important i

780
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,240
will say like i'll just give you an

781
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,559
anecdote where this is another scenario

782
00:26:58,559 --> 00:26:59,760
where

783
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,120
the ransomware

784
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,919
case is quite different we've seen time

785
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:05,120
after time where the traditional

786
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:08,240
ransomware or the traditional uh ir plan

787
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,919
sort of falls apart in a ransomware

788
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:10,960
scenario because it was written for

789
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,320
traditional cyber attacks which haven't

790
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:14,000
disrupted business my favorite anecdote

791
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,960
is and this has happened where

792
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,640
you were in the boardroom and

793
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,799
everybody's like my first few questions

794
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:23,039
i asked when we're in on on a case is

795
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:25,760
you know um i asked the legal

796
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,840
question i asked the pr question i asked

797
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,679
uh have you engaged to ir where are you

798
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:31,120
on your plan when we get to that

799
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,640
question the executives will say

800
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,480
something along the lines of

801
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:37,039
yeah about the plan well the plan

802
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:39,840
is a file in the file it's on a server

803
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:42,480
the server is encrypted

804
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,840
we don't have a copy of the plan it's

805
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,760
200 pages and we don't have it memorized

806
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:46,799
so we're winging this thing well you

807
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:47,760
don't want to be winging this thing

808
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,200
right so it's like little nuanced things

809
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,120
like that to think about in a in a

810
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,840
ransomware case um obviously if you have

811
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:56,720
cyber insurance the one thing people um

812
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,480
when they have cyber insurance they they

813
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:59,600
feel a little bit confident that this is

814
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,279
going to get taken care of but read the

815
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:02,880
fine print and read the fine print in

816
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,159
the in the

817
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:06,320
cyber insurance before the incident

818
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:07,279
because

819
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:09,279
in the cyber insurance policy typically

820
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:10,640
they're going to tell you which order to

821
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,000
contact all the people that i talked

822
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
about before and when they'll have

823
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,200
timelines associated with that you

824
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,880
deviate too far off those timelines or

825
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:17,919
you don't contact people in the right

826
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:20,000
order you don't contact people at all

827
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
they may not pay they may not pay out um

828
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,679
so something to keep in mind a

829
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:26,159
professional responder obviously uh you

830
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:27,600
know we've been doing this for a while

831
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:28,640
we consider ourselves professional

832
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,120
responders all i can say is anybody can

833
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:33,120
read a negotiation book and say i know

834
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:35,679
how to do negotiations um and and at one

835
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:37,039
point that was us right but we learned a

836
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:38,799
lot yeah over the last few years and

837
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:40,159
there's a lot of nuances to this

838
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:42,960
particular discipline one in typical

839
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:45,039
negotiation strategy whether you're

840
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:46,320
reading the harvard business review

841
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,760
chris voss has never split the

842
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,039
difference whatever they assume things

843
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:50,559
like you can see the person you can hear

844
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:52,399
the tone of their voice eye contact body

845
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:54,720
language none of that stuff exists here

846
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:57,039
also they assume that maybe the leverage

847
00:28:57,039 --> 00:28:58,799
is somewhat symmetric it's not bad guys

848
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:00,480
have all the leverage right and then the

849
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,799
other one is often or at least most of

850
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:04,320
the time you're assuming they speak your

851
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,399
language and quite frankly on large

852
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:07,919
groups like our evil for example the

853
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:09,600
first person you deal with probably

854
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,360
doesn't speak english at all

855
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,039
that means that when you type something

856
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:14,559
to them so first of all they're pasting

857
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:16,880
an english script into the window at you

858
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,559
and when you respond they're taking what

859
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:19,760
you say and they're putting it in

860
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:22,799
babelfish or or uh google translate

861
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:24,960
right and why that's an important nuance

862
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,640
is that you better understand the words

863
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,240
you just chose and how they translate

864
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,000
not just literally from word to word but

865
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,880
also in tone and context in ukrainian or

866
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:35,360
russian because doing that incorrectly

867
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:38,240
can cost you money so there's it is very

868
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,480
nuanced discipline

869
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:44,000
from a ransomware response perspective

870
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,840
obviously we recommend to every victim

871
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:48,399
that they notify law enforcement

872
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:50,480
it is not illegal to pay a ransom with

873
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,760
some exceptions and bryce will talk

874
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,520
about those exceptions

875
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:56,240
i was i met with a an fbi uh

876
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,399
representative cyber representative over

877
00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:00,159
the weekend and we talked about this and

878
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:01,360
you know their official stance the

879
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:02,720
justice department's official stance

880
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,399
still is you should not pay the ransom

881
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:05,760
and they will tell you that but they

882
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:08,080
understand it's not illegal they just

883
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:10,480
have to recommend that you don't um and

884
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,159
if you're in a scenario where you're

885
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:13,679
going to either lose your business or

886
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:16,000
lay off most of your staff

887
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,520
or you have to pay a ransom often you're

888
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,520
going to pay something so engage a

889
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:20,880
professional responder and make sure

890
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:23,039
that you pay as little as possible and

891
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:24,720
then of course um

892
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,240
you know on the back end of a case you

893
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,520
really want to you just made a deal with

894
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:28,799
a bad guy

895
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:30,000
and that deal is hey they're going to

896
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,279
give you some decrypters they're going

897
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:32,640
to tell you how they broke in we always

898
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:35,039
ask for that sometimes we get it um and

899
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:36,720
they're also going to promise that they

900
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,480
deleted your data

901
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,080
there's no way even if sometimes they'll

902
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,520
send you videos to try to prove it

903
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:42,880
things like that but

904
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,640
storage is cheap they probably still

905
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,640
have a copy you want to make sure that

906
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,399
they have no honor accountability by the

907
00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:49,279
way so

908
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:50,640
you want to make sure that the data that

909
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,760
they've taken you

910
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,679
from you does not start surfacing um on

911
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:55,360
the dark web later on or something like

912
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,120
that and this is a good uh thing to from

913
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,320
a pr perspective to tell your

914
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:00,000
constituents like look we made this deal

915
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,840
with this person but just in case we've

916
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,519
hired a company to help us make sure

917
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:05,679
that that data doesn't surface someplace

918
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:07,519
bryce do you want to touch on a couple

919
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:09,039
yeah i want to touch on sanctions

920
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:11,360
specifically um so

921
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,799
one thing that

922
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:13,840
is important to do throughout the

923
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,600
process and it is can be a very

924
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,440
important

925
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:20,080
layer or complicating factor to

926
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:22,080
ransomware attacks is understanding the

927
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,640
sanctions implications of sanctions uh

928
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,159
in the u.s and then there are you know

929
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:28,960
sanctioned regimes in the eu in japan

930
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:31,840
and other countries so understanding the

931
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,840
potential sanctions implications and

932
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:36,080
that there are ransomware groups um

933
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:38,000
ransomware operators that are sanctioned

934
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,399
entities or offshoots of previously

935
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:42,640
sanctioned entities um and and that's

936
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:43,760
often one of the big questions that

937
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,600
insurers are asking throughout the

938
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:48,080
process and looking for documentation uh

939
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:50,000
that this payment is not going to a

940
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,240
sanctioned entity so um

941
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,760
using any of the indicators that you can

942
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:56,159
get throughout the um ransomware attack

943
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:59,200
whether that be the bitcoin wallet or or

944
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,799
other cryptocurrency wallets that the

945
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:03,120
threat actors provide or

946
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:05,440
ip addresses uh

947
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,919
and such that you can get through your

948
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:10,880
forensics when investigating the attack

949
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,159
so

950
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:13,600
making sure you're thinking of sanctions

951
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:16,159
from the beginning of the attack uh and

952
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:19,120
at every stage of the response uh to a

953
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:20,559
ransomware attack because you'll need to

954
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:22,480
have those questions answered

955
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,320
for your insurance company uh law

956
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,840
enforcement law often ask about it and

957
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,760
maybe law enforcement may even

958
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,360
be able to help you provide or help

959
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:31,600
provide you some resources to conduct

960
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:34,399
the sanction check and lastly is the

961
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:36,159
point in the top right don't bury your

962
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:38,000
head in the sand having backups and

963
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,760
restoring from the backups doesn't mean

964
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,679
the problem is going to go away

965
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:43,519
the threat actors

966
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:46,159
have we've seen ransomware operators

967
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:47,600
publish

968
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,519
gigabytes hundreds of gigabytes in some

969
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:51,760
cases terabytes of data that they've

970
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:54,080
exfiltrated from victim organizations

971
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:54,960
because

972
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,880
the victim organizations either have not

973
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:59,279
negotiated or not engaged

974
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:01,200
we've also seen

975
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,200
ransomware operators who will hit a

976
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,519
victim a second time because you know

977
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:06,799
they've restored from backup but they

978
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:08,320
haven't

979
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,960
completely removed the initial access or

980
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,480
interrupted the initial access that was

981
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,720
used to conduct the attack um and so

982
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:17,600
there is still an important uh set of

983
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,279
considerations that you have to make

984
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:21,360
even if you have the ability to restore

985
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:22,480
from backups

986
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:24,880
we have seen some of the

987
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,320
better

988
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,880
or largest reductions of an initial

989
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,080
demand in negotiations that we're

990
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,679
conducting are often related to

991
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:33,200
organizations that have the ability to

992
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,760
restore from backup but even if you're

993
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:38,799
able to restore 90 or 95 of your data

994
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:41,360
from backups there still can be some

995
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,519
some critical systems that maybe

996
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:46,159
uh haven't been backed up recently or uh

997
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:47,840
some some data that you've lost in the

998
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:48,960
process so

999
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,640
just because you have backups um that

1000
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:51,760
that does mean you're in a more

1001
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,440
favorable position but it doesn't mean

1002
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,600
that the situation is over and that you

1003
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:58,639
can just move on from

1004
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,080
well we're still recording i think i

1005
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:08,159
think we lost bryce and not me hopefully

1006
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:10,480
they can edit that out

1007
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:13,119
um but what bryce was getting at was was

1008
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:14,000
uh

1009
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,719
to be to be um aware of the fact that

1010
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:18,239
backups aren't going to necessarily save

1011
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:20,159
you in the scenario the other thing i

1012
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:22,719
will add to that is that backups uh

1013
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:24,399
i've seen overconfidence with backups

1014
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:26,320
where companies say hey we've got

1015
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,639
backups um

1016
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:31,119
uh we tell these guys to get lost we got

1017
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:33,280
this and we're we'll take it on the chin

1018
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,599
on the on the uh on the exfiltration

1019
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:37,599
component like don't worry about that

1020
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:38,719
and

1021
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:40,639
they so we say hey that's great we don't

1022
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:43,040
want to pay bad guys either good for you

1023
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:45,760
and then they go away and they come back

1024
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:48,879
and they say hey guess what it turns out

1025
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:50,639
uh it's going to take six months to

1026
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:52,879
restore these backups and

1027
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:54,480
we haven't really tested it so there's a

1028
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,399
there's a there's a case there for also

1029
00:34:56,399 --> 00:34:58,640
going back and both testing your ir plan

1030
00:34:58,640 --> 00:34:59,680
but also testing your business

1031
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,599
continuity plan to understand the

1032
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:04,160
mechanics of potentially restoring

1033
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:06,480
everything in your network from backup

1034
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:09,520
it's not it's non-trivial right

1035
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:12,240
uh bryce are you back with us

1036
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,640
i am back with you can you hear me yes

1037
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:15,760
excellent i didn't know if it was you or

1038
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,280
me so i like i made hopefully they'll

1039
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,880
edit a little bit maybe but uh i

1040
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:19,839
probably looked silly while i was trying

1041
00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:22,079
to figure out what happened

1042
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:25,280
but uh but yeah so welcome back um so

1043
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:28,320
i i closed out your your your backup

1044
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,880
discussion added a little context and

1045
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,640
we're at the final slide here

1046
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,400
yeah so

1047
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,920
you know the most important takeaway is

1048
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:38,400
to apply what you've learned

1049
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:41,280
in reviewing your organization's

1050
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,440
ir plans and determine

1051
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:46,560
how prepared you are to

1052
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,960
interrupt and respond to a ransomware

1053
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,160
attack

1054
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:51,599
but also

1055
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:53,040
assessing the exposure that you have

1056
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,160
from a

1057
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:55,839
in your digital footprint and determine

1058
00:35:55,839 --> 00:35:57,040
the number of exposures you have to

1059
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,960
potential attacks

1060
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,640
particularly those that can be exploited

1061
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,240
by the initial access brokers at the

1062
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:04,720
beginning of the ransomware kill chain

1063
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:07,280
um we we think that again

1064
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:09,680
ransomware as it is today a ransomware

1065
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:10,800
the

1066
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:13,440
kind of widespread

1067
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,200
proliferation of ransomware and the

1068
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,359
complexities that are now introduced in

1069
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:19,440
contemporary ransomware attacks

1070
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,359
move beyond some of the more traditional

1071
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:23,359
cyber attacks that we've seen previously

1072
00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:25,280
and add layers of complexity that need

1073
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,480
to be considered

1074
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:28,400
across the c-suite

1075
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,160
as you're as you're responding to a

1076
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:32,079
ransomware attack so understanding the

1077
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:34,480
stakeholders that you need to pull in uh

1078
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:36,079
from a corporate communications

1079
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:38,480
perspective or a legal perspective or a

1080
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:41,040
pr perspective that are traditionally

1081
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:44,079
maybe not brought in uh in in your ir

1082
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:46,000
preparedness plans or in some of the

1083
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,800
other uh incident responses that you may

1084
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:51,680
uh you may conduct um and implementing a

1085
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:53,839
blank break class in case of emergency

1086
00:36:53,839 --> 00:36:56,240
version of your of a ransomware response

1087
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:58,960
plan um a physical copy as curtis has

1088
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,800
mentioned before

1089
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,400
it does you no good when it's on an

1090
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,000
encrypted machine

1091
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,160
but a physical copy that can

1092
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:08,000
takes in these complexities and takes in

1093
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,079
the considerations that

1094
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:13,040
you must have when trying to uh respond

1095
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:14,720
to an attack that not only encrypts your

1096
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:16,480
network but also has an extortion

1097
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,079
element um

1098
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:22,000
and an exfiltration element as well

1099
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,359
that really brings us to the end i think

1100
00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:24,880
we might have run a little over on time

1101
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,640
i just want to say um you know thanks

1102
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:29,119
for allowing me to be the floaty head uh

1103
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:31,040
and thanks to bryce for

1104
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:33,839
um being the uh ethereal voice from the

1105
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:36,800
sky and also wanted to say special

1106

family uh and sorry she couldn't be here

1108
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:43,520
um we're going to

1109
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:46,000
duck out to do the q a section session

1110
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,760
looking forward to discussing this more

1111
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:49,599
detail there

1112
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:51,040
so thanks everyone for coming thanks for

1113
