hello cactus khan and welcome to our

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:05,279
talk called ready set secure all the

3
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:07,120
code vaccines where we're going to talk

4
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:08,639
about all the cyber security work that

5
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:10,639
went on behind the scenes protecting the

6
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:12,960
kova 19 vaccines from research to

7
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,960
development to production and all the

8
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:17,199
way into everyone's arms

9
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:19,520
so my name is daniel bardenstein i'm the

10
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,680
technology strategy lead at the cyber

11
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,439
security and infrastructure security

12
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:26,800
agency also known as sizza and for quick

13
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:31,199
clarification that's sizza azin theriza

14
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:34,559
so just quick quick but important note

15
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:36,239
in addition i'm also a fellow at the

16
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:38,640
aspen institute's tech policy hub and

17
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,239
during much of my work on the kobe 19

18
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:42,480
vaccines cyber security team i was at

19
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:43,920
the defense digital service with my

20
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,920
co-presenter lance here

21
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,800
my background uh mostly in the private

22
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,480
sector as a product manager building

23
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,399
enterprise cyber security and national

24
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:54,640
security tools uh and have since made

25
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,480
the transition into government to try to

26
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,039
make a difference

27
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:01,280
so a little bit about sizza the cyber

28
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,800
security and infrastructure security

29
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,640
agency which can be a little bit of a

30
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,920
mouthful

31
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,479
we are the us's cyber risk reduction

32
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:10,799
agency so we sit under under the

33
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:12,720
department of homeland security because

34
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,320
our responsibility is to protect the

35
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:17,119
homeland and we have a pretty wide range

36
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:18,479
of

37
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:20,240
activities and responsibilities within

38
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,240
the federal government and beyond so

39
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,920
we're responsible for helping protect

40
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:24,960
and secure

41
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,400
not only the federal government

42
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,560
but state local territorial and tribal

43
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,439
entities critical infrastructure such as

44
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:33,840
the power grid or water or

45
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,040
other similar

46
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,759
utilities and other large national

47
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:41,840
critical functions such as elections

48
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,399
yeah hey everybody uh so my name is

49
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:47,200
lance and uh i do engineering work for

50
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,360
the defense digital service i like to

51
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,360
say that i mostly focus on information

52
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,759
security and networking projects but a

53
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:55,920
lot of my interests rely on

54
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,439
vulnerability research applied

55
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:59,200
information security and then teaching

56
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,399
those things to people who might be

57
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:02,640
interested in them but also noteworthy

58
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,399
is that during the pandemic i had my

59
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:06,079
first child so i also like to say that i

60
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:08,560
am a new dad at home because i think

61
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,080
you know what we do outside of work is

62
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,160
just as important as what we do at work

63
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,160
um and definitely had a big impact on

64
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,040
sort of our work in this uh you know in

65
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,520
this project itself

66
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,560
but

67
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,959
as far as the defense digital service um

68
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:25,040
we were founded in 2015 by then

69
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,120
secretary ash carter uh who was really

70
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,520
looking for a solution to to do like a

71
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,519
rapid response or

72
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:33,599
like how do we get after projects that

73
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:35,760
that traditional government bureaucracy

74
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,319
makes really difficult um so

75
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:39,599
we we have people that come from

76
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:41,519
industry to do sort of like a nerd tour

77
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:43,680
of duty um and we focus really heavily

78
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,760
on how do we build buy and deploy

79
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,239
technology better but we rely heavily on

80
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:49,760
on sort of our folks coming in for both

81
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,400
the military detail uh civilian career

82
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,239
career folks and then uh people coming

83
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:55,760
in from the private sector with maybe

84
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,760
pre-existing relationships to uh you

85
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,280
know big tech areas within the united

86
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,159
states and globally

87
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,200
um so sort of like for our agenda today

88
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,400
for the talk we were thinking that we

89
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,840
would start by by giving you just a

90
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,840
general overview of what operation war

91
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,080
speed is um and and how we came to be

92
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,920
working on it um and then talk about

93
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,680
some of the challenges that we faced uh

94
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,480
you know

95
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,800
tackling this this massive uh you know

96
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,959
thing that was going on globally um

97
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:22,640
specifically get into like what we did

98
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,480
for vaccine security like securing the

99
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,599
information security around uh vaccines

100
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:29,280
um and then specifically what we did

101
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,120
around like the actions and and how we

102
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,879
engage like the hacker community or the

103
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,040
crowd uh to get them involved in this

104
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,879
and then lastly we'll wrap up and talk

105
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:38,640
about some of the lessons we learned and

106
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,159
how we think we can take this kind of

107
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:42,319
model forward and what we can apply to

108
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:44,080
like you know general projects outside

109
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,840
of a global pandemic crisis

110
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,599
yeah so to kick it off um we'll just

111
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:53,280
talk about like what operation war speed

112
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,439
is

113
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,200
so about two minutes ago then president

114
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,480
donald trump announced that we were

115
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,000
going to do this thing called operation

116
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,720
warp speed um and essentially the idea

117
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,879
was to uh you know to get a vaccine out

118
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:08,879
as quickly as possible so the white

119
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:10,640
house reached out to the secretary of

120
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,560
defense and said hey what kind of role

121
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,920
is the military going to play in this

122
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,519
like how can the pentagon bring to bear

123
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:18,160
like all of our military strategy um and

124
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,600
you know specifically around like you

125
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,040
know how we secure things and how we

126
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,919
deploy things uh to to this specific

127
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:25,840
problem um and the secretary of defense

128
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,919
reached out to uh the nerds that do

129
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:29,440
things really quickly over the defense

130
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,680
digital service um and our director

131
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,360
pulled in uh both daniel and i to work

132
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,440
on this and i think you know both daniel

133
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,960
and i have really got a real sense of

134
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,800
gravity about this problem knowing that

135
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,240
like you know the time we've been

136
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,680
several months into the pandemic it was

137
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,600
just starting to get really bad and i

138
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,120
think everyone like understood the

139
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,919
gravity but especially so uh you know

140
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:49,199
knowing that my wife had just become

141
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:51,520
pregnant and and being really nervous

142
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,759
about like how the vaccine uh would get

143
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:55,040
out and you know would it be safe for

144
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,880
her to take um and so really being a

145
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,960
part of this process was was was really

146
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,639
both exciting but also kind of like

147
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:02,720
humbling i think but i know daniel also

148
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,840
has like a really interesting story so

149
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,759
i'd love for him to tell like sort of

150
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:08,160
like how he got ripped into this as well

151
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,720
yeah also everyone has a crazy pandemic

152
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,800
uh story yeah we were my wife and i were

153
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,680
in the middle of moving coasts and got

154
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,280
stuck because of the pandemic uh

155
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,520
pandemic living with my parents in ohio

156
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,039
when i got the call from our former

157
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:22,800
director and uh

158
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,120
asked me if we could take on this work

159
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,880
and jump in and then very soon after we

160
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,280
finally made it to dc i remember showing

161
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,160
up to uh hhs health and human services

162
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,080
thinking that it was just gonna be a you

163
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,160
know initial conversation see where

164
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,160
things uh were going meet the folks and

165
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,080
they said here's your laptop and phone

166
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,080
and there's your desk and that's where i

167
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,320
lived for the next about year um so i

168
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,440
had this very weird experience where i

169
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:48,000
was going into the office uh every day

170
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,440
for about a year in the middle of a

171
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,600
pandemic trying to

172
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,120
figure out what we were going to do and

173
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,919
we really started from from nothing uh

174
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:59,198
for this operation frankly

175
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,600
yeah and so like sort of dilute back

176
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,440
around and define like what was our

177
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,600
actual objective so so the group that

178
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,120
ended up forming operation warp speed

179
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,639
was tasked with getting about 300

180
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:11,199
million vaccines uh in into the american

181
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:13,520
population within about six months like

182
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,360
six to seven months um and prior to

183
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,800
operation warp speed the shortest time

184
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,639
that a vaccine had been deployed was was

185
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:21,120
uh was four years so it was you know

186
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,800
quite the undertaking to cut that time

187
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,919
in like an eighth um and so at dds we

188
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:27,039
were sort of given the mission of

189
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:28,800
working with with uh you know everyone

190
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,280
involved from the commercial sector um

191
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,560
all the way through like the the

192
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,800
government agencies to figure out um you

193
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,800
know what can we do to provide really

194
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,600
great like information security um and

195
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,120
so sort of like when we came back to

196
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,960
talk to our director and figure out like

197
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,560
exactly how we were going to fit in with

198
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,680
this team and how we were going to

199
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,080
provide value we came up with this like

200
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,080
this mission statement of secure all the

201
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,639
things um and that's kind of a joke but

202
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:54,479
but now realistically like

203
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:56,240
essentially we were asked to provide as

204
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,960
much security information um to the the

205
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,400
private sector organizations and the

206
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,880
government partners as possible and help

207
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,000
them like

208
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,440
you know guide towards improving and

209
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,759
maturing uh cyber security models that

210
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:09,840
they were working with um and where we

211
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,440
could provide the most value in terms of

212
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,680
like low drag sort of like high efficacy

213
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,639
uh information security deployments um

214
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:19,199
but we we ended up redefining that into

215
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:21,120
ensure this the delivery of safe and

216
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,720
viable cover 19 vaccines and

217
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,560
therapeutics um

218
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,919
and that's what we ended up sticking

219
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:27,520
with for the for the duration of the

220
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,520
project and how we ended up plugging in

221
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,319
from like a government side at dds um to

222
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:34,400
to specifically improve the project and

223
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,960
the results

224
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,160
great so next let's dive a little bit

225
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,639
into the challenges i will say uh from

226
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:45,759
the dds and now sis aside um you know

227
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:48,319
early on um one of the things which was

228
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:50,560
a good help but also we'll come back to

229
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,120
play uh a little bit in the section was

230
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,800
all of the government agencies that uh

231
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,319
came together as we say a whole

232
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:59,039
government approach so not only were dds

233
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:00,319
and other

234
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:02,319
partners there but sizza came involved

235
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:04,400
uh became involved very early because of

236
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,280
our experience not only um with physical

237
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,440
and cyber security

238
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,440
measures and engagement with the private

239
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,680
sector but also ability to scale across

240
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,680
the country uh you know having regional

241
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,199
offices everywhere

242
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:18,720
so back into the challenges that we

243
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,000
faced

244
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,120
so the first

245
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,280
simply put was just scope

246
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,599
the word unprecedented is tossed around

247
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:26,879
a lot when

248
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:29,599
we talk about uh operation warp speed

249
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:31,599
and it's kind of fair we were told

250
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:34,240
secure everything and that was um just

251
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,919
by some numbers over a hundred

252
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:38,240
organizations uh so

253
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,679
i remember on one of the first couple

254
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:42,000
weeks we had a continually growing excel

255
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,720
spreadsheet of every single company that

256
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,640
had anything to do with the supply

257
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,279
chains of the the seven primary vaccine

258
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:50,640
candidates that the us government was

259
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,720
investing in and i think at the max

260
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,760
there were like seven to eight hundred

261
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,600
companies and that's total so obviously

262
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,880
we weren't going to go through all 800

263
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,880
of them but hundreds and hundreds of

264
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,399
really critical organizations all the

265
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:02,080
way up to the chain

266
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,640
that and the core of those organizations

267
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,720
again not just industry but also the key

268
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,279
government agencies so that's hhs and

269
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:13,600
fda and the cdc etc um it comprises at

270
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,040
least conservatively 300 000 users right

271
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,720
and you think about the role that each

272
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,920
of these companies or government

273
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,680
agencies or you know academic

274
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,080
institutions have and the impact that

275
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,240
you know again one user in one of these

276
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,000
agencies clicks a link

277
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,320
and how does that impact the process you

278
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,399
really have a huge user footprint that

279
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:34,399
we had to you know be careful of and

280
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:35,920
also these are users that are used to

281
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:36,959
sending

282
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:38,480
unencrypted emails back and forth with

283
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,160
all their powerpoints and pdfs with all

284
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:43,120
their sensitive information and data

285
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,560
uh overall again

286
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,920
not for the seven or eight hundred orgs

287
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,279
but for like the core organizations

288
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:48,720
we're looking at this is also

289
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,560
represented about half a million assets

290
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,120
again that's very conservative um

291
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,800
same sorts of problems just massive

292
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,080
massive attack surface um some internal

293
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,600
some on the public internet that we just

294
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,480
really needed to get our arms around

295
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,880
and of course we had our vips um the

296
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,120
folks who ran operation warp speed were

297
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,760
appointed by the president um and they

298
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,720
were in front of the media uh and

299
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,399
they had very predictable email

300
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,320
addresses and we needed to make sure

301
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,200
that they were safe and you know that uh

302
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,279
you know various adversaries couldn't

303
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:23,360
easily target them and get important

304
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,800
information so

305
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,200
um overall just the the scope was

306
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,720
massive and just to

307
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,880
make this a little bit more visual

308
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,200
this was a mock-up very early on mock-up

309
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,519
of the clinical trial process and just

310
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:37,920
all of the data and business flows uh

311
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,000
between all the entities here so i'm not

312
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,120
going to walk through this because it's

313
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,079
very detailed but if we look

314
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:45,120
kind of over here in the middle of the

315
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,480
vx developer those are pfizer moderna

316
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,839
jsjs

317
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:51,040
and they have relationship with

318
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:54,000
government agencies like fda and hhs

319
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
they have contractual and data

320
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,480
connections with other contractors

321
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,560
between the manufacturers the fill

322
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,399
finish organizations that actually you

323
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:03,680
know put the

324
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,000
vaccine in the

325
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,240
vial and package everything up

326
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,920
now there's the cro the contract

327
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,240
research organization that just runs the

328
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,000
clinical trials and they might contract

329
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,760
out to a different company that runs the

330
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:16,640
data

331
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,320
all the data has to be sent back to the

332
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,560
government and to a bunch of independent

333
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,320
auditors to make sure that the clinical

334
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,680
trial data uh you know has integrity and

335
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,320
uh you know there's there's no um

336
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,040
adverse events during testing so again

337
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,079
without going through the whole native

338
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:33,440
process we learned a lot about clinical

339
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,240
trials say um but just the sheer number

340
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,240
of connections between government and

341
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,560
industry and academic entities and again

342
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,120
this is just for one organization for a

343
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,560
pfizer and then you multiply this whole

344
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,240
thing for for each of the

345
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,200
companies that were involved

346
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,440
another big spaghetti-like chart that we

347
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,120
had to develop here so this one before

348
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,200
it was uh or this one in front of us was

349
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,279
for the distribution

350
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:58,959
of vaccines so starting up from the

351
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:01,120
manufacturers in the top left once they

352
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,040
were kind of mass produced

353
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,040
all where how the vaccines went from

354
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,639
these warehouses

355
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:08,399
all the way across the country and into

356
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:10,399
your local pharmacies and then

357
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:12,320
eventually into our arms it's not only

358
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,600
the movement of the vaccines we had to

359
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,440
track but all the data that we needed to

360
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,680
track as those vaccines moved around so

361
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:20,079
that was everything from the rates of

362
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:23,200
manufacture and the inventory of vaccine

363
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,880
at each particular location and where it

364
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,360
could be moved next um it was where

365
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,519
vaccines were at any given time how many

366
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:31,839
people had been vaccinated where

367
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:33,600
adverse events everything we needed all

368
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,200
this data back into central system so

369
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,200
that leadership could have a real-time

370
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,519
view of how the vaccine was being rolled

371
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:41,600
out which seemed like a pretty herculean

372
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,480
task especially considering the existing

373
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47,760
system that we built upon that cdc

374
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,079
manages had only been used for doing

375
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:52,079
this for child vaccine so the scale of

376
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:53,680
like two to three million or something

377
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,600
like that loaded single digit millions

378
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,240
of of people and now we're gonna try to

379
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,560
augment this brand new system to support

380
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,480
300 million people

381
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,839
and and even down here on the bottom

382
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:05,680
right there are a bunch of custom apps

383
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:09,120
that were built mobile cloud-based apps

384
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,040
you know

385
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,800
you know with contractors government

386
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,560
developed apps that were helping people

387
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,800
find vaccines set up registrations

388
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:17,920
appointments

389
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,760
share if they had any side effects that

390
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,600
all were part of this equation and again

391
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,839
we just needed to quickly get our arms

392
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:25,519
around you know the entirety of this

393
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:27,839
scope

394
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:29,920
uh so just to show you again a little

395
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,680
bit of the craziness craziness of the

396
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,160
contract of the contractor relationships

397
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,519
again we think traditionally when we're

398
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:37,600
in infosec roles you know we're employed

399
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,760
by our company our organization and our

400
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,480
job is just to protect you know the the

401
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,480
you know our boss right our protect our

402
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,800
employer um but it was a little bit

403
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,360
crazy uh with what we had to deal with

404
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,720
here so let's just take for example a

405
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,040
vaccine developer this could be pfizer

406
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,399
or moderna

407
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:55,199
so

408
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:56,880
first uh there has to be business and

409
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,440
data flows between your pfizer moderna

410
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,519
and like i said independent researchers

411
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:03,519
and regulators so this is sending email

412
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:05,440
back and forth with data uh

413
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,880
communications intent uh etc

414
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,199
uh during clinical trials again the

415
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:14,079
vaccine developer contracts with a cro

416
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:15,440
to actually run the clinical trials you

417
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,360
might further subcontract to run the

418
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,600
data all that data also needs to go back

419
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,600
to the regulators and the researchers to

420
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,440
make sure that the clinical trial data

421
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,839
is accurate and safe and you know making

422
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:27,440
sure that we're making good decisions

423
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,639
when we're picking clinical trial

424
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:30,320
candidates

425
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,160
once we get the thumbs up on clinical

426
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,360
trials

427
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,360
manufacturing starts so

428
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,920
vaccines also have many uh sorry the

429
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,760
vaccine developers can have contractual

430
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:40,880
relationships with one or more

431
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,279
manufacturers whose job it is to get the

432
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:44,720
production from

433
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,480
you know think of it like micro brewery

434
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,800
to your anhyzer bush that's kind of how

435
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,079
we like to think about it right that

436
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:52,000
operation is where the manufacturers fit

437
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:52,720
in

438
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,720
the manufacturers then contract out to

439
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,959
fill finish which are the

440
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:58,000
companies like i mentioned before

441
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,120
responsible actually putting all

442
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,240
together

443
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,399
once all the finished vaccines are ready

444
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,079
to go they go to distributor and then

445
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:05,920
they get shipped all across the country

446
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,839
so this is just one uh mapping of all

447
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:10,079
the contractual flows and then multiply

448
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:12,560
that by seven for each of the companies

449
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,720
that the us government invested in and

450
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,040
then consider that some of the various

451
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,880
companies in this chain

452
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,639
were shared in common and had to make

453
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:22,880
sure that they were keeping um you know

454
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:26,399
each company's products and ip in lane

455
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:27,360
so

456
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,279
this is just crazy and it was very

457
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:30,880
different from your normal infosec

458
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,320
experience

459
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,320
so the tldr here

460
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,759
massive scope

461
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:37,920
very complex data flows not only have to

462
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,680
secure not only meaning to secure the

463
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:42,000
data at rest and in transit identify the

464
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,399
right systems the most important systems

465
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:46,399
and make sure those are secured and make

466
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:47,680
sure that again the entities around

467
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:51,120
those systems are secured as well

468
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:54,000
so another challenge we focus we

469
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,880
encountered uh was politics and you know

470
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,480
we hear that there's some politics in

471
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,040
government or something like that but um

472
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,440
you know we were told uh up front that

473
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,040
this is going to be you know all whole

474
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,880
of government approach everyone's coming

475
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,399
together like the avengers we're going

476
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:10,880
to save the day and save the country um

477
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,480
but in reality

478
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,680
up front there's a little bit more

479
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,519
finger pointing and everyone was very

480
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:17,920
excited and wanted to come and help

481
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,759
contribute their various offerings but

482
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:21,360
just the differences of authorities and

483
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,480
capabilities

484
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,880
and who is responsible for you know for

485
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,519
example having dod and cisa involved dod

486
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:28,800
doesn't normally have relationships with

487
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,480
the private sector where cisa does so

488
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,920
navigating some of those things so

489
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,839
fortunately we're able to work through

490
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:35,360
this early on but this is something that

491
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:38,320
we did have to work through quite a bit

492
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,959
in the beginning

493
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:42,959
and also really interestingly we had the

494
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:45,199
challenge of authorities so again for

495
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:46,639
those who

496
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:48,639
read about operation warp speed at home

497
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:51,199
the government essentially gave hundreds

498
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:52,240
of million i think it's actually in the

499
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,839
low billions of dollars it wasn't the

500
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:56,000
low billions of dollars um to a lot of

501
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,399
these companies to help expedite the

502
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:00,000
creation and development of vaccines and

503
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,920
help help reduce the risk

504
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,680
and you'd think the government could say

505
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,119
hey if we're going to give you

506
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:07,199
600 million dollars

507
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:09,599
you better make sure that mfa is enabled

508
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:10,799
on all your

509
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:12,240
any accounts that you know have remote

510
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,520
access uh authorities um and that's not

511
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,199
the case both both because of our

512
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:18,720
authorities and how the contracts were

513
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,319
structured everything we had to do was

514
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:22,720
voluntary it despite all the money we

515
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,079
were giving and the contracts that were

516
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:26,559
signed we could not force anyone to do

517
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:28,319
anything which is maybe not a bad thing

518
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:32,000
because you know people have uh

519
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,440
some people welcomed the government

520
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,360
coming in more than others shall we say

521
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,760
um but it also made our job a lot more

522
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,520
difficult and uh we had to be a bit more

523
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,799
creative and how we actually got these

524
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:43,280
companies to listen to us and to

525
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,960
put in best practices

526
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,880
uh lance i know you had some thoughts on

527
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,160
the kind of your experience with

528
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,679
authorities as well

529
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:51,120
yeah and i think you know sort of like

530
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,320
you said it ended up being like a little

531
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,000
bit of a mixed bag right like i think

532
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,520
there was there was organizations that

533
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:58,320
were very you know open and and glad to

534
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,160
have the extra help uh you know sort of

535
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,679
glad to have the extra set of eyes and

536
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:03,440
the experiences that we had

537
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,559
you know working within the department

538
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:06,400
of defense to bring those over and sort

539
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,400
of assist um but then we did

540
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,240
occasionally get companies like that

541
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,240
that were very i don't know like like

542
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,000
hesitant is probably the right word and

543
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,679
i think what we usually saw with those

544
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:17,760
companies is that they had uh very large

545
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,679
ties over skis and i think there was

546
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:21,440
there was this want to like avoid the

547
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,039
perception that that the department of

548
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:24,960
defense or the pentagon was getting too

549
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,280
involved with uh with their business i

550
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,640
mean so we really understood that but

551
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,320
but by and large i think you know even

552
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,320
without the authority you know i really

553
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,080
want to make the point that that

554
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,679
you know these companies are really like

555
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:37,360
i think not necessarily out of like a

556
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,039
sense of patriotic duty but like it's

557
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:40,799
just a sort of like recognition that

558
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:43,200
this was you know such a great like

559
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,520
global pandemic crisis uh everyone was

560
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,440
really willing to like you know take the

561
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,039
helping hand wherever it was where it

562
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:50,960
was like offered right and i think that

563
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,240
ended up being like one of the really

564
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,160
cool experiences that that i had taking

565
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,000
away from this is just you know working

566
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,520
as like a large team to solve the

567
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,918
problem

568
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,760
and so i'll sort of follow on here and

569
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,760
just uh like hit a little bit on the the

570
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,080
vaccine supply chain and where it is

571
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,080
exactly that we inserted sort of like

572
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,240
our information security or or cyber

573
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:15,039
security uh chops into the process to

574
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:16,880
try and make this better but i also sort

575
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:17,840
of want to highlight you know like

576
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,679
dana's done a really good job so far on

577
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:21,600
just how like complicated this process

578
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,160
is um and so help you sort of again get

579
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,520
the the gravity of the scope of the

580
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,200
situation and where we felt like we were

581
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,880
actually able to provide value

582
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,640
um so a couple of like the real big

583
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,160
problem areas that we focused on the

584
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,240
first one really being like program

585
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,320
maturity so you'd think like you know

586
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,240
when you hear companies like uh you know

587
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:43,120
moderna and and johnson and johnson um

588
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,640
and pfizer like you think of these very

589
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,360
large uh you know drug companies and and

590
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,480
you would think like oh their

591
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,000
cybersecurity programs are probably

592
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
pretty mature and you'd be right but

593
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,600
what we were really fascinated to find

594
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,840
is that you know in this entire process

595
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,160
there were so many smaller mom and pop

596
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,640
shops um you know little widget makers

597
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,400
of a specific thing or a specific

598
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,520
component

599
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,799
and typically these people had never

600
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:06,799
really been in the limelight before or

601
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:08,000
never really been under this much

602
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,760
scrutiny from a cyber security

603
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,240
perspective um and so the program

604
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,600
maturity was a big thing that we dealt

605
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,440
with just with organizations that had

606
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,280
you know almost no cyber security

607
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,280
program um and then working all the way

608
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,120
up to organizations you know like like

609
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,600
the big names that did have quite a a

610
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,400
sophisticated cyber security uh offering

611
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,559
and program um the second really big

612
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:30,159
area that we focused in on was attack

613
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:32,640
surface and helping to max map the

614
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,720
attack surface with tools that we had

615
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:37,200
i'm specifically focusing on uh like

616
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,200
cloud services and shadow i.t and how

617
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,360
that might interrelate to the key

618
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,280
processes that they had identified for

619
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,919
vaccine development um and then the last

620
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:48,000
like major area that we sort of like

621
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,679
jumped in on or that we noticed was was

622
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:51,679
of significant issue was the idea of

623
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:54,000
like industrial control systems the

624
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,679
internet of things and operational

625
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:57,679
technology we ended up in a lot of

626
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:00,240
discussions and a lot of recommendations

627
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:03,120
or conversations about uh you know these

628
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,120
specific types of technologies and how

629
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,440
they would converge or interrelate with

630
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,919
their traditional i.t network um and so

631
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:10,960
we'll talk a little bit about that but

632
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,400
but overall i think we came away with

633
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,559
the uh sort of the impression of like

634
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:17,280
this is fine um and then apart from

635
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,200
these three areas we had a lot of like

636
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,559
consultative services i would say um

637
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:24,799
we would get called in you know very

638
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:26,960
very frequently um you know almost like

639
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,520
daily or or bi-weekly on

640
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,120
sort of like really one-off weird

641
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,039
scenarios uh one that sort of pops to

642
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:34,960
mind that i think everyone would be you

643
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,880
know entertained or interested by

644
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,120
is we had we had an organization contact

645
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,400
us and they said hey

646
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,240
when people come to our website because

647
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,200
you know i think they ended up in the

648
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,720
news about something they were they were

649
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,120
making for the code vaccine um they were

650
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,320
like when people come to our website and

651
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,000
they google us like they end up on

652
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,880
erectile dysfunction medication website

653
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,320
and uh you know at first blush we were

654
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:55,679
like that's that's really strange like

655
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:58,080
how how is this happening um so we did a

656
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,600
little bit of like uh you know

657
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,120
conversation with them and we dug into

658
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,960
it and what we found was that uh they

659
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,880
ran a wordpress site and essentially a

660
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,960
year or so prior uh they had been popped

661
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,200
by some really like run-of-the-mill uh

662
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,280
wordpress exploit and they had like some

663
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,039
malware running that essentially when

664
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:14,880
you came from a referrer like you know

665
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,559
if you googled the site and google or

666
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:18,960
bing um when you came with a referrer

667
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,559
you ended up at this erectile

668
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:22,960
dysfunction medication website uh but

669
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,720
when you like access the webpage

670
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,039
directly by typing it into a browser or

671
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:28,640
by like you know pulling off of a

672
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,400
bookmarks for example

673
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,159
the website would load fine so to people

674
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:34,159
inside the company they would never run

675
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:36,559
across this but customers or people

676
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:38,559
external to the organization

677
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:39,600
this is what they would land on when

678
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,440
they go to look for the for the website

679
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,200
um so it was really interesting sort of

680
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,000
a

681
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,600
problem and we had a lot of those i'd

682
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,120
say like you know pretty frequently we

683
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,640
had these sort of strange one-off

684
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:51,200
scenarios happen um and so we sort of

685
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,440
became like instant responders and and

686
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,919
malware researchers um and and you know

687
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:57,360
along with sort of our goals of like

688
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,799
identifying and remediating

689
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:00,159
vulnerabilities

690
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:01,120
um

691
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,559
yeah and even just on the program

692
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:04,720
maturity part like uh

693
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,960
sizza and some other agencies help some

694
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,640
of these these mom and pop shops like

695
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:11,679
hire their first security hire like a

696
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:12,880
you know some sort of manager of

697
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,720
security that they did not have before

698
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,000
and these are companies that behind the

699
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,840
scenes are pumping out all the vaccines

700
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,039
that we normally take for all of our

701
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:22,080
other things um so just the the bar was

702
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,720
set very low and we had a lot of um

703
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,440
we learned a lot shall we learned a lot

704
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,520
yeah the organizations definitely ran

705
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:32,000
the gamut between like uh you know

706
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,240
no maturity at all to like you know

707
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:37,280
fairly sophisticated um but yet bumping

708
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,120
over to the next slide um

709
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,320
these are a couple of tweets that were

710
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,320
sent out by moderna and and one of their

711
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,559
manufacturing partners lonzo i mean it

712
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:46,000
just goes to show sort of like the the

713
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,320
diversity of systems and like how unique

714
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,159
some of these systems are what we found

715
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:51,679
is a lot of their like operational

716
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:54,799
technology or ics stuff was specifically

717
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:57,200
unique to like the the manufacturing and

718
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,159
studying of vaccines um and so one of

719
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:02,080
the ways that we sort of like dug in and

720
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,640
really you know found to be of interest

721
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,720
is uh you know understanding exactly how

722
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,960
these types of systems interact with

723
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,120
with a traditional it network or with an

724
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,760
existing it network um and then on the

725
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,400
next slide i think we have a uh a

726
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,559
diagram of that that modern again

727
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:20,400
tweeted out and it really shows like

728
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,919
sort of how these things plug in right

729
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:24,080
like so um they show here in this

730
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,919
diagram their aws services so their

731
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:28,240
cloud provider services the on-site

732
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,000
technologies that they were using uh you

733
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,400
know to include the the ics and sort of

734
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,400
operational technology uh things from

735
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,080
the previous slide um but then also

736
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,360
they're like software as a service

737
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,600
things that they used every day and so

738
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:40,960
you know i think modern really feels

739
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,960
like this is and i think industry

740
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,559
generally agrees that this is sort of

741
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:46,880
the future right like we will ultimately

742
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,960
see convergence between like operational

743
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,960
technology and their traditional it

744
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,200
network um but you can also see in this

745
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,640
in this diagram here that there's a lot

746
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,640
of interconnection and each one of those

747
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,000
interconnections is sort of like a

748
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,400
potential point of you know you know

749
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:03,520
infection or exploitation um and so

750
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:04,640
even though some of these larger

751
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,080
companies were able to converge really

752
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:08,000
quickly uh it was definitely more of

753
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,440
like a a case-by-case basis because of

754
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,880
just how interrelated these things

755
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,480
became and the kind of risks of those

756
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,960
introduced

757
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,919
and so uh we wanted to include this this

758
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:21,600
quote because it was one of the one of

759
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,360
the things that brought us uh you know

760
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,600
great joy and great sadness at the same

761
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,760
time right um so one one of the people

762
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,760
that we were talking to uh in the midst

763
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,279
of interviewing people said said this

764
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:32,559
quote right like we protect our

765
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:34,240
operational technology network with two

766
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,919
firewalls you know so it's it's very

767
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:38,240
secure um and you know that sort of

768
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,760
harkens back to this like three-legged

769
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:42,240
dmz idea that's that's quite antiquated

770
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,840
but you can imagine people probably

771
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,600
learned at one point as being like the

772
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:48,559
pinnacle of security um and at dds we

773
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:50,480
had worked through testing ics and ot

774
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,720
networks uh in the past and so we knew

775
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,640
that like like anything else in cyber

776
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:57,120
security like doing something properly

777
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,760
uh is far more key than doing like what

778
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,279
the correct thing is according to

779
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:02,960
industry or the correct buzzword at the

780
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,600
time um and and you know sort of like i

781
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,600
was saying already like converging ot

782
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,919
and ics prior to being ready to actually

783
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:12,320
do that spells disaster you know from

784
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,640
our experience we saw a lot of cases

785
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,799
where air gapping or continuing to

786
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:18,400
segment these types of

787
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,400
of technologies while it might seem

788
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,080
antithetical to what the general

789
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,080
industry is doing it's really dependent

790
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,080
on your particular situation

791
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,360
so i think one of the things we would

792
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:28,799
definitely recommend coming out of this

793
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:31,039
is you know don't rush to converge these

794
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:33,440
kind of things until you're fully ready

795
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,880
and you've really done the assessment on

796
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,159
like how it's going to impact your

797
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:38,000
network and where you might be newly

798
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,559
vulnerable

799
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:42,960
awesome

800
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,799
so now let's turn once we've talked a

801
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:46,400
lot about the scope of the problem on

802
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,240
the problems we saw so let's talk about

803
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,400
what we did about it keep in mind a lot

804
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,480
of the things you're going to see

805
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,240
may seem more commonplace to many of

806
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,919
those in the private sector but a lot of

807
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:57,360
this is fairly

808
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,120
new or less common in government

809
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,679
especially the idea of embracing the

810
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:03,360
hacker and infosec communities depending

811
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,600
on how you define each of those um and

812
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,960
really leaning forward with a lot of

813
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,760
kind of open source common tech tooling

814
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,600
to not just go through our you know very

815
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,279
antiquated slow

816
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:16,720
processes or you know our response plans

817
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:19,200
so the first thing we did um you know

818
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,520
once we all you know had assembled and

819
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:23,679
we're starting to get our heads around

820
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:25,919
how a vaccine was created is like any

821
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:27,279
good security team we created a threat

822
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:28,320
model

823
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,520
and so just wanted to walk through a

824
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,760
little bit of that process and and how

825
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:34,399
we saw the threats to the vaccine um

826
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:35,840
kind of the end-to-end process from the

827
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:38,240
very beginning so walking through our

828
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,640
traditional cia triad

829
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:43,279
we gave that availability was likely the

830
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:45,279
mo the the biggest threat

831
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:46,720
and that would be any adversary's

832
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:49,760
ability to delay degrade or destroy any

833
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:52,000
infrastructure involved with um getting

834
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,399
the vaccine out again um there are a lot

835
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:56,799
of geopolitics involved with this about

836
00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:59,440
who could be first to market um

837
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,200
that in addition to just the sooner the

838
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,720
vaccine came out the more lives would be

839
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,880
saved and that's the most important part

840
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:07,039
so like any delays literally means

841
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:09,120
thousands or or tens of thousands of

842
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:12,159
lives um but again they're

843
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:14,320
especially when we're thinking about

844
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:15,840
cyber adversaries you know there are a

845
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,279
lot you don't necessarily have to blow

846
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:20,799
up a plant right to stop someone from uh

847
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:23,760
you know being successful or uh getting

848
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,120
your vaccine out in time so this is

849
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,399
something we're very very concerned

850
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:28,080
about

851
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,840
next up the list was integrity and this

852
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,120
is more focused like i mentioned on the

853
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:33,279
clinical trials and the overall concern

854
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:35,679
here was could an adversary make us make

855
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:37,840
a bad decision whether you know by

856
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,919
messing with the clinical trial data and

857
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:42,320
that could be in the form of um you know

858
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,000
ignoring a vaccine candidate that was

859
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,440
actually promising because the data

860
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,520
looked bad or there's allegedly like

861
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,919
fake planted adverse events uh or the

862
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:51,520
opposite you know pursuing something

863
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:52,960
that actually wasn't as effective as it

864
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,240
looked because the numbers had been

865
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,559
cooked to make it look more promising

866
00:28:56,559 --> 00:28:58,960
so and especially like lance mentioned

867
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,480
how much shorter this process was

868
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,159
there's already going to be a lot of

869
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:04,159
skepticism around the vaccine when it

870
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:07,120
came out so data integrity was super

871
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,440
super important and really interestingly

872
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,039
even though we we worked a lot to secure

873
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:13,200
it one of the the most beneficial things

874
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,039
that helped us secure it and made it not

875
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:17,679
its own project were how many copies of

876
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:20,159
this data existed because like all those

877
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:22,559
those early charts there were

878
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:24,159
you know five to ten different

879
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:26,080
independent entities all reviewing the

880
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,120
data

881
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,520
it almost gave an additional layer of

882
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,440
validation because even if somebody was

883
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:34,399
able to tamper with one set right there

884
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:36,159
were still many other sets of copies of

885
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:37,279
that data that

886
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:39,200
kind of retained the initial integrity

887
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,159
so i thought that was kind of

888
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:41,279
interesting originally it seems like

889
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:43,120
bureaucracy but there's actually some

890
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,640
some value to it from an integrity

891
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,000
perspective

892
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,720
and lastly with confidentiality um

893
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,559
when it comes to the actual secret sauce

894
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:52,559
of what's in the vaccine coming from the

895
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:53,919
academic world where a lot of this stuff

896
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:56,480
starts uh we were told a lot of it's you

897
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,320
know the academic world is a lot of it's

898
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,159
more open there's a lot more sharing

899
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:01,760
people publish the results a lot of

900
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,120
collaboration between academic

901
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:06,799
institutions even across countries um so

902
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:08,000
we're less worried about kind of

903
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,159
protecting the secret sauce so to speak

904
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:11,039
um

905
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:12,720
uh and obviously you know that's become

906
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:15,120
more on the private sector uh companies

907
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:18,480
themselves but what was uh really unique

908
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,320
was the manufacturing scale up and again

909
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,960
that's that microbrewery to

910
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:26,000
amherst bush bud light uh whatever type

911
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,320
of transition where that there's a lot

912
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,840
of intellectual property a lot of

913
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:31,600
technological processes around that and

914
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,679
that's really unique and that's stuff

915
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:35,360
where um

916
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:36,480
that can make or break the difference

917
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:37,760
between being able to find a good

918
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,279
vaccine candidate being able to mass

919
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:43,200
produce enough to vaccinate a population

920
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,679
another thing we did was we created a

921
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:48,640
prioritized maturity model um again

922
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,399
coming from government uh the

923
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:52,159
inclination is always to pull out one of

924
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:55,679
these old very long check lists lots of

925
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:57,360
check boxes

926
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,039
that checks it's robust but not

927
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:01,120
prioritized right of you know do you

928
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,640
have this is this enabled do you have

929
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,640
this we didn't have the time to do that

930
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,880
nor the luxury of time to do that so we

931
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,399
actually created from scratch an

932
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:10,399
incredibly tailored maturity model

933
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:12,240
basically a very simple questionnaire

934
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,320
that we walked through all of the uh we

935
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:15,760
walked through with all the companies we

936
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,919
talked to and government agencies to get

937
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:20,159
a sense of the relative level of risk so

938
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:22,159
it could be common practices around

939
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:24,720
authentication a lot of it was what

940
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,559
really critical data and systems do you

941
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:28,559
have right are you responsible for like

942
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:30,480
do you just approve stuff or do you

943
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:33,200
generate new data um you know and who

944
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:36,320
owns the system etc uh we do look into

945
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,159
kind of product inventory again we'll

946
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:39,840
talk about a lot of the zero days that

947
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,679
hit that year in terms of getting ahead

948
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:43,200
of what remote access tools people were

949
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,679
using so we had a sense of that um like

950
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:47,440
lance mentioned we really tried to get a

951
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,760
sense of how familiar they were with

952
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,760
their attack surface and vulnerability

953
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:55,039
management especially in the times of um

954
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:56,960
kovit everyone's working from home

955
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:59,279
more of a priority from an adversary

956
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:02,000
adversary perspective on um just going

957
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,760
after volumes and remote access tools

958
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,679
versus maybe more traditional phishing

959
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:08,480
uh looking at ir plans comsec like a lot

960
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:09,679
of you know power unencrypted

961
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:11,440
powerpoints of important data going back

962
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,039
and forth the email all that types of

963
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:15,679
fun stuff even getting a security for

964
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:18,880
webinars or not webinars um um you know

965
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,799
video conferences right everyone was new

966
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:22,320
to teams or new to webex or zoom

967
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,159
whatever everyone was using making sure

968
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:26,159
that even just those processes of hey

969
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:27,919
before we go over where we stand as an

970
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:29,679
operation let's validate every single

971
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:31,679
unknown phone number on the call-in list

972
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:34,159
or force people to to use their account

973
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:35,360
right so things that you don't normally

974
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:37,600
think about in your your normal model so

975
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:40,000
to speak

976
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,080
we also and again going back to our our

977
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:44,080
lack of authorities here but a great way

978
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:46,000
to to provide help is to offer it for

979
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,279
free uh and so cesa uh has uh

980
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:50,480
we've been doing this for a long time we

981
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:51,360
have a

982
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:54,080
big catalog of free services that are

983
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,679
available both physical services and

984
00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:57,919
cybersecurity services to

985
00:32:57,919 --> 00:32:59,120
government agencies and critical

986
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:01,039
infrastructure partners if you're not

987
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:02,320
familiar with these you can just go to

988
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,919
this is this website and there's a big

989
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:05,840
list and this is everything from

990
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,840
architecture reviews remote penetration

991
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:11,279
tests vulnerability scanning um

992
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:13,120
there's a lot of you know plugging in

993
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:15,600
with other government agencies um and so

994
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,600
it says it came kind of ready with the

995
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,919
whole menu of different items that folks

996
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:21,919
could choose from to help augment their

997
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:24,399
current security practices and we also

998
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:26,799
had a couple of uh cool uh kind of tag

999
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:29,279
teams with dds uh in terms of shepard

1000
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:30,799
and crossfeed and i'll pass that over to

1001
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:32,080
lance

1002
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:34,080
yeah so so the shepard program for us

1003
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,279
was essentially providing like

1004
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:38,080
protective dns support um and enabling

1005
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:40,320
organizations related to uh to operation

1006
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:42,159
warp speed to be able to tag into

1007
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:44,480
protective dns um and and really what we

1008
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,240
found is it was one of those like

1009
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,880
very low effort very high yield like you

1010
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:51,200
know change changes your dns resolver

1011
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,960
and and get this level of protection

1012
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,720
right i fit really nicely in with the

1013
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,640
malware kill chain um and it

1014
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,399
supplemented existing like endpoint

1015
00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:01,519
protection technologies really well and

1016
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:03,679
especially worked well for systems that

1017
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:06,240
can't run an agent something like an

1018
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,840
appliance or like we talked about

1019
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:10,239
embedded systems so we found pdns to be

1020
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:11,359
like one of the really great ways that

1021
00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:12,960
we could we could provide a lot of value

1022
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:15,199
to folks uh with very little effort you

1023
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:16,719
know working with sort of like a more of

1024
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:18,719
a skeleton crew on some of these things

1025
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:20,639
um and then crossfeed was sort of like a

1026
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:22,159
really great uh sort of

1027
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:24,639
cross-collaboration between uh dds and

1028
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:26,719
then cisa crossfit is an application

1029
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:28,560
developed originally by uh jack cable

1030
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,320
you might be familiar with uh while he

1031
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,599
was working for the defense digital

1032
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:33,199
service and then he took the development

1033
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:35,040
of crossfeed sort of the next level when

1034
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:37,599
he went over to work with cizza on uh on

1035
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:39,760
election security so you can currently

1036
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,839
find crossfeed it's open source on this

1037
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:43,839
as a github i highly recommend checking

1038
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:45,119
that out if you haven't had a chance

1039
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:47,119
it's essentially used for

1040
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:48,879
mapping the attack surface of public

1041
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:50,800
resources and it's what we use a lot

1042
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,879
with organizations to help them discover

1043
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:55,199
shadow i.t or where they might be

1044
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:57,520
you know referenced or being used by

1045
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:58,960
subcontractors

1046
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,720
and where that might present risk so

1047
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,640
really cool opportunity to tag together

1048
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:06,560
with says there uh on crossfeed

1049
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:10,000
awesome next let's talk about some

1050
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,240
weaknesses in the supply chain that were

1051
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:15,200
new and interesting and and you know

1052
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:18,560
complicated the picture even further

1053
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:19,359
so

1054
00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:20,720
looking on the left if we think about

1055
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,960
the actual vaccine and the vial that you

1056
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:25,119
know is jabbed into many of our arms um

1057
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:26,720
there are actually a lot of pieces that

1058
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:29,200
go into creating that uh there's the

1059
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,440
vial itself there's the syringe at the

1060
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:34,160
end there are labels there's the stopper

1061
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:35,920
that goes on top of it

1062
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:38,480
and each one of these components has its

1063
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,000
own supply chain

1064
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,359
or may be developed by a small number of

1065
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:46,640
companies in the u.s um and so

1066
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:48,720
even when we're thinking about again

1067
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,320
what we'd consider like the the normal

1068
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,640
or traditional parts of um the vaccine

1069
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,960
supply chain or any supply chain

1070
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,240
it was really interesting and

1071
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:58,240
fascinating to go down to these

1072
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:00,800
seemingly very smaller trivial um

1073
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,079
components

1074
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:04,960
that each magnify the the risk surface

1075
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:07,520
so to speak uh significantly um and

1076
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:09,119
again made to certain companies that

1077
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:11,040
otherwise didn't play a huge role very

1078
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:13,040
very important uh because if something

1079
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,400
bad would happen to those companies that

1080
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,839
could take out

1081
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:18,240
all of the stoppers for example for you

1082
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:19,119
know

1083
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:20,960
a significant amount of time

1084
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,640
or uh on the right here this is just a

1085
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:23,760
picture

1086
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:26,480
a very rough picture of a cold storage

1087
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:28,480
box and cool i had never heard of the

1088
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,920
phrase cold storage and i don't think

1089
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,280
most people had

1090
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:33,359
uh until uh warp speed there wasn't

1091
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:35,119
really much reason for it to be in the

1092
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:38,240
common lexicon but if everyone remembers

1093
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:40,320
when the first pfizer vaccine shipped

1094
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,560
they needed to be stored at negative 80

1095
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:44,480
degrees fahrenheit uh which means they

1096
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:47,040
needed to be uh you know shipped cold

1097
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:49,440
stored coal very cold

1098
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,359
all the way through so need to find the

1099
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:53,359
right boxes the right refrigerators the

1100
00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:55,520
right trucks uh that could handle all

1101
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:57,920
this stuff we took a lot of talk about

1102
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,920
ice and liquid nitrogen

1103
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,839
and even there are little iot remote

1104
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:05,119
sensors uh in the box for tracking um

1105
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:07,119
and there was one thing that happened to

1106
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:10,880
make um you know news in larger circles

1107
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:13,040
uh where there's a there was a potential

1108
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:16,560
risk of one of the uh uh pieces of iot

1109
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,320
one of the sensors in the boxes

1110
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,160
potentially being uh remotely

1111
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:22,079
exploitable such that you could change

1112
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:24,480
the uh temperature

1113
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,400
of the box and you know theoretically

1114
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,320
spoil the whole lot

1115
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,160
i remember that happened that was a bit

1116
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:32,800
of a three to five alarm drill

1117
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,160
fortunately

1118
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:36,000
all was okay or in the clear but it's

1119
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,440
just all these little things you don't

1120
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,280
think to think about especially brand

1121
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:42,079
new concepts like cold storage um this

1122
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:43,760
is really just you know the vaccine

1123
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,920
supply chain just kind of exponentiates

1124
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,680
like a i feel like it's like a fractal

1125
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:51,640
kind of over and over again

1126
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,200
so another way that we really uh plugged

1127
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,880
in and sort of like help take action

1128
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,880
with organizations is on the attack

1129
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,720
surface and vulnerability management we

1130
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:01,920
took sort of like a three-pronged

1131
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:04,640
approach to this using showdown intrigue

1132
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,800
dot io and then and then crossfeed which

1133
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,800
i mentioned earlier um and essentially

1134
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:11,119
what we did was was help organizations

1135
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:13,839
map their public-facing assets along

1136
00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:15,599
with things like i mentioned earlier

1137
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:16,880
sort of like in a subcontractor

1138
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,400
relationship or like tangentially

1139
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,480
related to their organization that might

1140
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:22,400
also present risk to them

1141
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,480
and what we found is that in almost

1142
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,240
every organization that we helped out in

1143
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:27,440
this regard

1144
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:29,440
there was a lot of shadow i.t and it's

1145
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,560
not something that i've heard talked

1146
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:33,359
about recently in a big way but uh

1147
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:36,000
especially with cloud services and and

1148
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,839
you know in this case with so many sort

1149
00:38:37,839 --> 00:38:40,079
of subcontractors like daniel mapped out

1150
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:42,960
earlier uh we saw a ton of shadow i.t

1151
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:45,920
that like cios ctos and like even the

1152
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,920
the entire like chief security folks or

1153
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,599
their cyber security team we're

1154
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:51,119
completely unaware that like in some

1155
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:53,200
cases hey we'd spun up uh you know this

1156
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,200
cloud services architecture specifically

1157
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,280
for you know development testing you

1158
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,920
know this new piece of software or

1159
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:02,079
yeah you know somebody over in the hr

1160
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:04,079
department definitely stood something up

1161
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:06,640
uh you know in in like google commercial

1162
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:08,320
cloud or something right like so we saw

1163
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,560
a lot of this and with uh with crossfeed

1164
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,400
and these other products we were able to

1165
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,800
sort of identify where shadow i.t might

1166
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,720
live for them and then also like help

1167
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:18,400
identify where things weren't getting

1168
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:19,920
patched which is also a really good

1169
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,680
indicator that it was probably shadow

1170
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:24,400
i.t um and one of around one of those we

1171
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,560
were working with an organization um and

1172
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:28,000
and i can remember one of the big

1173
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,599
services that we provided is like sort

1174
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:32,240
of vulnerability exploitation proof um

1175
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:34,160
so saying like yeah i've got the cve

1176
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:35,839
that i keep keep showing up on like a

1177
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:38,400
nesa scan or like yeah it shows up in in

1178
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,480
crossfeed or showdown but like it's not

1179
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,400
exploitable um so one of the things we

1180
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,839
did was sort of like walk through and

1181
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:44,800
actually exploit some of these

1182
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,400
vulnerabilities and show

1183
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:47,920
the exact severity and i can remember a

1184
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,599
specific organization

1185
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:51,280
where they had like a really outdated

1186
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:53,359
like uh web app and we started looking

1187
00:39:53,359 --> 00:39:55,520
at it um and what we ended up finding

1188
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:57,520
was that part of the web app had like a

1189
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,599
uh a location service where you could

1190
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:02,160
figure out like uh where where your

1191
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:04,640
specific delivery from this organization

1192
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:06,480
was and it was usually some kind of like

1193
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:08,480
medication that this this organization

1194
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:10,960
ship um and what we found is that

1195
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,720
behind the scenes there was an api and

1196
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:15,760
that api gave a a very large amount of

1197
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:18,400
information back so if you iterated on

1198
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:20,079
order number which was just a simple

1199
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:22,720
number that iterated by one each time

1200
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:24,000
you could actually dump you know

1201
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,079
someone's entire social security number

1202
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:27,760
uh their the specific medication that

1203
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,760
they were ordering their name address

1204
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,599
lots and lots of details uh and then the

1205
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:33,119
web page would only display of course

1206
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:35,200
you know where your where your

1207
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:38,400
your medicine currently is um so it was

1208
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,240
really helpful i think for us to take

1209
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:41,599
that next step and actually show

1210
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:43,599
exploitation and it really got people to

1211
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:45,359
sort of like sit up and take notice you

1212
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:46,480
know much like i can say at the

1213
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:48,079
beginning of the slide we mapped attack

1214
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:49,599
surface and found shadow i.t but then

1215
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:51,200
when i tell you like oh i found people's

1216
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,800
social security numbers like you sort of

1217
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,400
sit up and take a little bit more notice

1218
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:55,839
and i think it worked the exact same way

1219
00:40:55,839 --> 00:40:57,680
for for a lot of these organizations

1220
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:59,119
proving out some of these exploits was

1221
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:01,839
really important

1222
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:04,800
another

1223
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,400
more interesting and more normal way

1224
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,280
that

1225
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:09,520
we were able to kind of leverage the

1226
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:11,599
broader security community for this

1227
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:13,359
effort was by tapping into the cti

1228
00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:15,440
league uh cyber threat intelligence

1229
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:17,599
league which was stood up by a couple

1230
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:19,520
folks and for those who aren't familiar

1231
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:21,520
with it do i imagine some cti leaguers

1232
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,440
are in the audience uh this is basically

1233
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:26,400
a slack community of volunteer folks

1234
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,400
from literally around the world private

1235
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:31,359
sector government health care etc who

1236
00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:33,839
came together not specifically

1237
00:41:33,839 --> 00:41:36,160
for the vaccine but to help combat the

1238
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:38,240
rise of cyber crime cyber crime in the

1239
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:40,240
age of covet right as everyone was

1240
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:42,079
working from home adversaries were

1241
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:43,920
leveraging uh

1242
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:45,359
every you know doing things from you

1243
00:41:45,359 --> 00:41:47,839
know disinformation leveraging fears of

1244
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:50,000
covet for phishing campaigns attacking

1245
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,400
remote access tools and this was this

1246
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:55,040
really powerful community where there

1247
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:57,200
was real-time communications and a lot

1248
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:59,839
of sharing and kudos to the folks that

1249
00:41:59,839 --> 00:42:00,800
ran

1250
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:03,920
the cti league uh super organized had

1251
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,760
processes for everything granular access

1252
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:06,880
controls

1253
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:08,720
but they're sharing of intelligence and

1254
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:10,960
indicators incidents and contacts at

1255
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:13,200
various uh companies or governments or

1256
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:14,960
agencies around the world

1257
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:16,800
even as governments i had really great

1258
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:19,200
connections with folks in industry who

1259
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:21,440
we found out about certain incidents

1260
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:22,319
before

1261
00:42:22,319 --> 00:42:23,920
they came through the official channels

1262
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:25,599
in government uh because folks are able

1263
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:26,880
to reach out hey we think something's

1264
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:28,800
happening can someone help take a look

1265
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,720
we're able to connect quickly with folks

1266
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:32,640
who worked at particular companies or

1267
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:34,720
hospitals because they had a security

1268
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:36,880
team member who was part of this league

1269
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:37,599
so

1270
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:39,440
usually collaborating in a real-time

1271
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:41,440
chat tool with the industry in academia

1272
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:43,040
it's not something government does and

1273
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:45,520
this was um something really unique that

1274
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:48,160
both sizza and dds tapped into and i

1275
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:49,680
think was a really good win and and to

1276
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:51,440
be honest sizza is looking at trying to

1277
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:52,400
bring

1278
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:53,760
this sort of functionality and

1279
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:56,240
relationship into our modern operations

1280
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:59,119
when we're collaborating with industry

1281
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:01,680
both in support of um you know new

1282
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:03,200
incidents but also

1283
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:06,480
for potential victims

1284
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:09,760
and probably one of the last ways that i

1285
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:11,040
think we should really highlight on like

1286
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:12,960
how exactly we took action was was sort

1287
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:15,040
of bringing our bug bounty model into

1288
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:17,760
into this entire process uh so in a

1289
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:20,480
normal week like uh you know pre-pre uh

1290
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:22,560
operation warp speed uh daniel and i

1291
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:25,040
worked uh pretty much exclusively on the

1292
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:27,599
dds hacked the pentagon project which if

1293
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:28,880
you're not familiar is essentially

1294
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:30,880
bringing crowdsource penetration testing

1295
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:33,599
to the department of defense um and so

1296
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:35,119
we we brought the same model and brought

1297
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:37,200
in our like our hack the pentagon team

1298
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:38,480
uh to sort of

1299
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:41,119
tag into some of these like high profile

1300
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:44,000
uh applications and websites and and and

1301
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,720
databases uh to test them using like our

1302
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:48,240
already proven methodology of

1303
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:50,000
crowdsource penetration testing through

1304
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,240
through bug bounties um and to give like

1305
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:53,839
you know credit where credit is due with

1306
00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:56,079
hhs they were already really far along

1307
00:43:56,079 --> 00:43:57,440
in this process they had already you

1308
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:59,440
know had a contract vehicle and had sort

1309
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:01,119
of beta tested boundaries but we were

1310
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:03,440
able to uh tag in and sort of go and

1311
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:05,520
tell the story of hack the pentagon and

1312
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:07,920
uh a lot of it is i think getting you

1313
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:09,839
know leadership folks comfortable with

1314
00:44:09,839 --> 00:44:11,760
the idea that we're going to bring 50 or

1315
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:14,160
100 hackers to actually like compromise

1316
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:15,599
your website but it's going to be for a

1317
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:16,800
good reason and there's going to be

1318
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:18,640
really great results um so we really

1319
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:20,160
helped out a lot and just sort of like

1320
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:22,240
evangelizing and advocating for for the

1321
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:24,720
use of bug bounties in this and what i

1322
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:26,640
think probably the coolest uh

1323
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:28,480
experiences that i had was that we would

1324
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:30,480
we would set up and run these bounties

1325
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:32,800
um on like something like vaccine finder

1326
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:35,440
or vsaf and then like the next week it

1327
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:37,119
was it was everywhere in the news right

1328
00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:38,400
as it got rolled out and so it was

1329
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:40,560
really awesome i think to to see like

1330
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:41,920
how we were able to plug in and really

1331
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:44,319
provide additional security just before

1332
00:44:44,319 --> 00:44:46,240
something went live as like a last line

1333
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:49,520
of of checks um and it was it was really

1334
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:51,359
like i think a cool process overall to

1335
00:44:51,359 --> 00:44:53,359
see the crowd again being brought to

1336
00:44:53,359 --> 00:44:55,440
bear on a problem set and and really

1337
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:58,480
knocking it out of the park

1338
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:02,000
and then lastly to sort of bring it home

1339
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,119
i think one of the things that people

1340
00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:04,560
are always really interested in is like

1341
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:06,720
what kind of adversary activity did we

1342
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:08,480
see um and

1343
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:09,920
you know we'll try and dig into it as

1344
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:12,160
much as like we're legally allowed to um

1345
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:13,760
there's a lot of this you know don't

1346
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:15,599
confirm or deny a kind of thing with

1347
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:17,520
with some adversary activity we can

1348
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:19,200
definitely talk generally about uh sort

1349
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:23,200
of what we saw and what the impacts were

1350
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:25,920
so to start with uh you know ever since

1351
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:27,599
sort of the the pandemic has started

1352
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:28,800
we've seen this really interesting

1353
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:30,240
pendulum swing

1354
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:31,839
from like spear phishing and drive by

1355
00:45:31,839 --> 00:45:34,160
downloading um all the way back to like

1356
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:36,240
early days of information security where

1357
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:37,599
people are trying to crack the perimeter

1358
00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:39,680
again and this is really like sort of i

1359
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:41,280
think brought about by people moving

1360
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:42,640
outside their traditional network

1361
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:45,119
boundaries and really like congregating

1362
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:46,720
at these remote access or remote

1363
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:49,599
services um so we saw a ton of zero days

1364
00:45:49,599 --> 00:45:51,440
come out and be leveraged by by

1365
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:53,280
attackers uh specifically around like

1366
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:56,160
exchange pulse secure vpns f5 network

1367
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:58,160
load balancers and then sap which

1368
00:45:58,160 --> 00:45:59,599
actually had like a really interesting

1369
00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:02,000
tie-in um with some of the key processes

1370
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,400
going on for operation warp speed and so

1371
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:06,000
daniel and i spent a lot of time like

1372
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,359
you know finding these vulnerabilities

1373
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:09,040
every time they were announced uh

1374
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:10,400
calling people up and saying like hey

1375
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:11,839
you've got this real serious issue and

1376
00:46:11,839 --> 00:46:13,839
you need to patch it right now

1377
00:46:13,839 --> 00:46:15,359
and so it was it was definitely like

1378
00:46:15,359 --> 00:46:17,680
there was a lot of sort of five alarm

1379
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:20,319
fires going on of of you know something

1380
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:22,079
new and big has come out and it seemed

1381
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:23,680
like it was happening like every other

1382
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:25,599
week we saw these major zero days come

1383
00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:27,440
out and adversaries like immediately

1384
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:30,720
pick up and begin using them

1385
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:34,880
so when it comes to what specifically we

1386
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:36,960
saw uh in terms of what the adversaries

1387
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:39,359
were doing um here are a couple of

1388
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:40,640
headlines have all been published in

1389
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:42,960
major publications

1390
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:44,560
what i'd like to say is

1391
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:47,040
the usual suspects were using their

1392
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:48,720
usual ttps

1393
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:49,680
on

1394
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:53,118
covert related activity

1395
00:46:53,359 --> 00:46:55,440
not too much more we can dig into there

1396
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:57,040
we definitely saw things there were

1397
00:46:57,040 --> 00:47:00,319
definitely some uh late nights at times

1398
00:47:00,319 --> 00:47:01,280
um

1399
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:04,720
but uh overall uh again i i think uh

1400
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:06,400
we're able you know judging by the fact

1401
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:07,440
that we're able to get out the other

1402
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:10,000
side and get the the vaccines out safely

1403
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,240
or any any things that we saw were able

1404
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:15,599
to be dealt with in in due course um but

1405
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:17,680
they were that being said was definitely

1406
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:20,799
not a walk in the park

1407
00:47:22,319 --> 00:47:24,640
uh and then i don't know if people uh

1408
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:26,559
heard but there was a couple of attacks

1409
00:47:26,559 --> 00:47:28,960
around them something called solar winds

1410
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:30,880
or something like that a lot of people

1411
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:33,280
heard about that one um but yeah that

1412
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:35,040
happened solarwinds happened during

1413
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:37,119
operational warp speed and again can't

1414
00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:39,200
go into too many details about

1415
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:40,880
specifically what happened on the inside

1416
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:43,839
but there was a huge rush and it was a

1417
00:47:43,839 --> 00:47:45,359
critical um

1418
00:47:45,359 --> 00:47:48,000
goal for us to figure out uh amid all

1419
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,559
this carnage what is impacting the

1420
00:47:50,559 --> 00:47:52,400
vaccine right and it was this kind of

1421
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:54,160
weird thing to be like we don't care if

1422
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:56,160
this agency is popular this agency is

1423
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:58,160
pop this agency is popped or this comp

1424
00:47:58,160 --> 00:47:59,280
whatever it is

1425
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:00,800
how does it impact the vaccine because

1426
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:02,319
at least on our little team that's all

1427
00:48:02,319 --> 00:48:04,640
we were that's all we had to care about

1428
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:07,440
um and so that took a while to process

1429
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:09,920
and as folks know like just the scope of

1430
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:12,000
solar winds it took a while to figure

1431
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
out how far-reaching it was

1432
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,280
and um

1433
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:16,800
again all i can say is you know we're

1434
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:18,240
able to get through it on the other side

1435
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:20,559
and get the vaccine out um and then

1436
00:48:20,559 --> 00:48:22,720
another fun scare too again this was

1437
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:25,119
taken from a joint uh alert that was put

1438
00:48:25,119 --> 00:48:27,520
out by sizza and fbi and some others

1439
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:28,960
about i think the language was an

1440
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:31,599
impending ransomware attack on hundreds

1441
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:35,359
of u.s hospitals um there were which

1442
00:48:35,359 --> 00:48:37,520
fortunately didn't come to fruition but

1443
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:39,680
there were some serious um

1444
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:41,440
incidents and threats of incidents out

1445
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:43,680
there that we had to deal with

1446
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:45,440
try to get ahead of mitigate or just

1447
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:47,040
figure out where it intersected with the

1448
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:48,720
vaccine and

1449
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:50,720
if there was any uh

1450
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:53,119
interaction i had to mitigate that as

1451
00:48:53,119 --> 00:48:54,480
quickly as possible and figure out how

1452
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:56,480
to move forward

1453
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:57,520
yeah i think one of the really

1454
00:48:57,520 --> 00:48:59,040
interesting things you know as it

1455
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:00,559
relates to adversary activity here was

1456
00:49:00,559 --> 00:49:02,400
this is really the first time uh with

1457
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:04,079
solarwinds and then ultimately like

1458
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:05,920
again with cassaya towards the the end

1459
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:08,400
of operation workspeed's tenure um this

1460
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:09,680
is really the first time we've seen like

1461
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:12,079
supply chain attacks hit the united

1462
00:49:12,079 --> 00:49:13,920
states and united states interest in

1463
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:15,520
like a really big way like we know

1464
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:16,960
supply chain attacks have been happening

1465
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:19,200
overseas for quite some time but this is

1466
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:20,559
the first time they've been used super

1467
00:49:20,559 --> 00:49:22,800
effectively in the united states um and

1468
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:24,720
that along with you know what we talked

1469
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:26,640
about earlier with with you know folks

1470
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:27,839
moving outside of the traditional

1471
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:30,079
network perimeter really led us to a lot

1472
00:49:30,079 --> 00:49:31,839
of you know recommendations around like

1473
00:49:31,839 --> 00:49:34,000
xero trust and i hate buzzwords as much

1474
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,319
as as most any other engineer but but

1475
00:49:36,319 --> 00:49:38,160
you know really starting to see that

1476
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:40,559
that we can't rely on like the software

1477
00:49:40,559 --> 00:49:42,319
ecosystem or the trusted software

1478
00:49:42,319 --> 00:49:45,280
ecosystem uh became a big thing

1479
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:46,800
and this was sort of exemplified it

1480
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:48,559
right the the solarwinds issue and then

1481
00:49:48,559 --> 00:49:50,559
ultimately cassaya

1482
00:49:50,559 --> 00:49:52,800
really drove home the idea that we can't

1483
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:54,720
trust software products inherently

1484
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:56,559
anymore we have to really be aware of

1485
00:49:56,559 --> 00:49:58,640
the supply chain and the impacts of

1486
00:49:58,640 --> 00:49:59,760
trusting software within our

1487
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:02,480
organizations

1488
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:06,240
so wrapping up let's talk about lessons

1489
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:08,240
learned and you know what we wanted to

1490
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:09,760
share with folks from

1491
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:13,119
our experiences on this crazy project

1492
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:13,839
so

1493
00:50:13,839 --> 00:50:16,640
first i i think we can say that we you

1494
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:18,400
know job i don't say job well done but i

1495
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:19,440
think we can say we accomplished the

1496
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:21,920
mission right we hit this crazy goal

1497
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:23,119
again that wasn't just thanks for the

1498
00:50:23,119 --> 00:50:24,559
security team there were you know

1499
00:50:24,559 --> 00:50:26,160
hundreds of unsung heroes behind the

1500
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:27,599
scenes were actually pushing this stuff

1501
00:50:27,599 --> 00:50:29,920
out um both in government and private

1502
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:33,040
sector but all in all um despite all the

1503
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:35,520
o days and adversaries and all this

1504
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:37,200
shadow i.t and the new apps are coming

1505
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:37,920
up

1506
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:40,000
things got delivered nothing was popped

1507
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,720
uh data integrity was in check so i i

1508
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:45,119
think i think we can say that we we did

1509
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:47,680
it and that's a nice story it's not

1510
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:49,599
something that we hear a lot very often

1511
00:50:49,599 --> 00:50:52,000
where um you know i don't know if this

1512
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,760
is a fair comparison but we think about

1513
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:56,319
the rollout of healthcare.gov once upon

1514
00:50:56,319 --> 00:50:57,920
a time and what happened there just

1515
00:50:57,920 --> 00:50:59,920
rolling out a website to know the

1516
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:02,160
government's leading an effort to deploy

1517
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:04,079
brand new infrastructure to support the

1518
00:51:04,079 --> 00:51:05,839
rollout of a new vaccine across the

1519
00:51:05,839 --> 00:51:07,200
country

1520
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:08,960
i think i think we did pretty well and

1521
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:10,559
again not just our agencies but the

1522
00:51:10,559 --> 00:51:12,000
government as a whole and i think it

1523
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,480
speaks a lot to the um the trust and

1524
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:16,240
collaboration that's been built between

1525
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:18,640
government and private sector um because

1526
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:20,000
you know neither group could have done

1527
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:23,119
it alone um and so i i i personally wish

1528
00:51:23,119 --> 00:51:24,800
that was something that uh we kind of

1529
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:26,079
celebrate a little bit more this was

1530
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:28,400
like a great victory for

1531
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:30,240
public private partnerships and

1532
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:32,000
especially specifically in technology

1533
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:35,720
and cyber security

1534
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:38,079
and i think if there's like one

1535
00:51:38,079 --> 00:51:39,520
overarching message that we could give

1536
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:41,119
to our audience here um you know it

1537
00:51:41,119 --> 00:51:42,480
would be in this slide and the next one

1538
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:43,839
right like if you're if you're in the

1539
00:51:43,839 --> 00:51:45,920
government currently or you're in

1540
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:48,400
a decision-making role within within

1541
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:50,800
your organization um please consider

1542
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:52,800
engaging the crowd right um there are so

1543
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:54,960
many great opportunities to bring in

1544
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:56,800
folks who are just passionate and really

1545
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:59,440
capable uh to assist in cyber security

1546
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:00,720
and whether that's from like just

1547
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:02,160
running a vulnerability disclosure

1548
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:04,480
program or crowdsourcing a pen test

1549
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:06,480
through a bug bounty or just getting

1550
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:07,839
feedback from the cyber security

1551
00:52:07,839 --> 00:52:09,920
community it's it's such a big thing to

1552
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:12,480
engage the crowd um and there's so many

1553
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:15,359
like willing and and expert people uh

1554
00:52:15,359 --> 00:52:16,800
sort of like waiting in the wings to

1555
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,640
assist so so if there's one message we

1556
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:20,480
could give i think specifically to

1557
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:24,640
decision makers is engage the crowd

1558
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:26,559
moving down the list roles and

1559
00:52:26,559 --> 00:52:28,640
authorities was also uh like is like we

1560
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:31,839
said a bit of a obstacle up front so for

1561
00:52:31,839 --> 00:52:33,680
folks in government understanding what

1562
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:36,319
can be done what can't be done uh is

1563
00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:38,079
really important up front and even from

1564
00:52:38,079 --> 00:52:39,599
industry where i'm guessing most folks

1565
00:52:39,599 --> 00:52:41,119
in the audience are from

1566
00:52:41,119 --> 00:52:43,200
know who your contact is at your local

1567
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:45,520
local government agency right fbi and

1568
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:48,400
cisa can't provide a lot of support um

1569
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:49,920
in the case of a major incident and

1570
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:51,040
there are a lot of like i said free

1571
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:53,920
services out there um so

1572
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:56,240
it doesn't hurt to try to engage and

1573
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:57,520
again

1574
00:52:57,520 --> 00:52:59,040
with hopefully there's been a lot of

1575
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:01,520
trust built out but we can be a resource

1576
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:03,599
when things go wrong uh so knowing who

1577
00:53:03,599 --> 00:53:06,319
to call when uh things hit the fan is a

1578
00:53:06,319 --> 00:53:08,720
very valuable um piece of knowledge to

1579
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:09,599
have

1580
00:53:09,599 --> 00:53:12,000
um also what we found taking away is

1581
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,920
it's good to have a rapid infosec plan i

1582
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:15,839
feel like at least maybe in the case of

1583
00:53:15,839 --> 00:53:18,000
of um warp speed you have your

1584
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,720
traditional ir plan uh and then there's

1585
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:22,240
what happens when

1586
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:23,440
there's this

1587
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:25,680
crazy unprecedented catastrophe or

1588
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:27,680
something terrible has gone wrong and so

1589
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:29,520
whether it's just having a rapid plan or

1590
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:31,680
just making sure that your plan is well

1591
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:34,640
practiced and very concise and you know

1592
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:36,400
doesn't make assumptions about who's

1593
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:37,920
there and the constraints like if you

1594
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:39,200
can't actually send people physically

1595
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:41,040
because there's a pandemic

1596
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:43,040
and flights are getting cancelled um you

1597
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:43,839
know i

1598
00:53:43,839 --> 00:53:45,280
prepare for the worst and make sure that

1599
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:47,200
if you need to go on a shoestring budget

1600
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:49,200
uh or a small number of people

1601
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:51,200
you know where you know where to hit

1602
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:52,640
first in terms of you know defending

1603
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:54,839
your your perimeter from your

1604
00:53:54,839 --> 00:53:57,440
organization and lastly

1605
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:59,440
hopefully the next time around the next

1606
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:02,079
big catastrophe we love to see the bar

1607
00:54:02,079 --> 00:54:03,680
raise in terms of you know the security

1608
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:05,599
of a lot of these or we keep calling mom

1609
00:54:05,599 --> 00:54:07,760
and pop shops kind of smaller

1610
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:10,559
entities that don't have the capacity or

1611
00:54:10,559 --> 00:54:12,640
the budget um to necessarily have you

1612
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:14,000
know the same robust cybersecurity

1613
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,079
program as some of these big um

1614
00:54:16,079 --> 00:54:18,319
international you know pharma companies

1615
00:54:18,319 --> 00:54:19,839
so you know we'd love for government and

1616
00:54:19,839 --> 00:54:21,760
even internal internally in the private

1617
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:25,200
sector to help push policy uh to help

1618
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:27,520
kind of raise the tide uh a tie that

1619
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:29,839
raises all boats um

1620
00:54:29,839 --> 00:54:30,960
so that everyone's a little bit more

1621
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:33,200
secure uh the next time around so you

1622
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:35,040
know we saw lots of companies that

1623
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:37,200
weren't using mfa no surprise there's

1624
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:39,520
not lots of people passwords no surprise

1625
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:40,799
all of your like

1626
00:54:40,799 --> 00:54:43,280
you know ten commandments do not do saw

1627
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:46,960
lots of that um all across so love to

1628
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:48,319
reduce that a little bit the next time

1629
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:51,558
this happens

1630
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:54,480
and conversely to the last slide uh you

1631
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:56,079
know if you're not in a decision-making

1632
00:54:56,079 --> 00:54:58,000
role currently or you're you know you're

1633
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,200
not sitting in one of those places where

1634
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:01,119
you can really engage the crowd uh be

1635
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:03,359
the crowd right um so constantly one of

1636
00:55:03,359 --> 00:55:05,040
the things that that we try and

1637
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:07,520
evangelize in our positions is that uh

1638
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:09,440
sort of no matter what your interest is

1639
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:11,200
or or what your skill level is there's a

1640
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:12,960
way that you can contribute you know if

1641
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:15,119
you're like just learning or a senior

1642
00:55:15,119 --> 00:55:18,000
developer uh consider likes you know

1643
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,920
working with open source software and

1644
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:21,280
improving the things that are that are

1645
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:23,760
being published um you know specifically

1646
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:25,520
around these kinds of issues

1647
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:27,119
if you're into information security or

1648
00:55:27,119 --> 00:55:28,720
penetration testing or bug bounty

1649
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:31,200
hunting like uh you know join vdps

1650
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:33,920
contribute to those be a bug a bug

1651
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:36,400
bounty hunter like uh you know there's

1652
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:38,319
so many different ways to get involved

1653
00:55:38,319 --> 00:55:40,160
with this and one of the big things that

1654
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:42,319
we love to harp on is that the greater

1655
00:55:42,319 --> 00:55:43,839
the diversity of the crowd the better

1656
00:55:43,839 --> 00:55:46,079
the results uh you know having someone

1657
00:55:46,079 --> 00:55:47,839
that learned their information security

1658
00:55:47,839 --> 00:55:49,599
knowledge uh you know from a small

1659
00:55:49,599 --> 00:55:51,680
village in like let's say india for

1660
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:53,839
example versus like you know someone

1661
00:55:53,839 --> 00:55:55,839
that went to like a a top five ivy

1662
00:55:55,839 --> 00:55:58,240
league school and got like the best in

1663
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:00,640
class uh you know degree will always

1664
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:02,880
find two different things right

1665
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:05,280
these kinds of people both bring value

1666
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:06,960
in big and major ways and their

1667
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:08,960
contributions are equal if not like you

1668
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:10,799
know leaning more towards like the more

1669
00:56:10,799 --> 00:56:13,119
unique ways of thinking so if you can be

1670
00:56:13,119 --> 00:56:15,280
the crowd

1671
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:17,520
and there are a ton of ways to

1672
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:19,760
get involved in government as well um

1673
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:20,960
you know i speak personally as someone

1674
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:22,799
who came from the private sector into

1675
00:56:22,799 --> 00:56:25,359
government i try to make a big impact

1676
00:56:25,359 --> 00:56:27,920
you know there are ways to join dds this

1677
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:29,839
is another like-minded uh you know

1678
00:56:29,839 --> 00:56:32,400
infosec organizations uh for those who

1679
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:35,119
aren't as inclined to um to join

1680
00:56:35,119 --> 00:56:36,960
government uh there's a lot of

1681
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:38,000
interesting research out there

1682
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:39,839
especially in vaccines

1683
00:56:39,839 --> 00:56:42,240
all the medical ot that we talked about

1684
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:44,480
just in healthcare generally in medical

1685
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:46,319
devices there's tons of stuff that could

1686
00:56:46,319 --> 00:56:49,440
use a lot of um security expertise to

1687
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:52,640
help um the the various uh

1688
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:55,200
both the developers but also on the the

1689
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:56,480
healthcare side just understand the

1690
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:58,160
inherent risks how of how these things

1691
00:56:58,160 --> 00:57:00,000
can be abused and make sure that we're

1692
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:03,119
not selling you know uh

1693
00:57:03,119 --> 00:57:06,000
increasingly uh vulnerable part monitors

1694
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,680
or pacemakers or whatnot because we

1695
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:09,839
still see a lot of that

1696
00:57:09,839 --> 00:57:11,599
and just in any other way in lansdowne a

1697
00:57:11,599 --> 00:57:13,359
bunch of these things um you know just

1698
00:57:13,359 --> 00:57:15,280
just get involved in government you know

1699
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:17,520
there's uh cis on dds or growing there's

1700
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:19,760
a lot of uh good movement in the current

1701
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:21,680
administration around you know getting

1702
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:23,200
our cyber security house in order a

1703
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:25,119
little bit and and i will make one more

1704
00:57:25,119 --> 00:57:27,359
plug for those who weren't aware dhs

1705
00:57:27,359 --> 00:57:29,760
recently announced the cyber talent

1706
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:31,680
talent management system

1707
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:33,839
which is a way by which if you're a

1708
00:57:33,839 --> 00:57:35,839
skilled security practitioner you can

1709
00:57:35,839 --> 00:57:38,480
get a job for example at sizza and the

1710
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:41,200
max pay now is up to 250 000 which is

1711
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:43,680
pretty absurd for a government employee

1712
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:46,319
um you know traditionally speaking um

1713
00:57:46,319 --> 00:57:47,520
but finally you know government's

1714
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:49,280
realizing that you know if we want the

1715
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:51,280
best and brightest to ditch their their

1716
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:53,520
private sector jobs to come you know

1717

help serve their country we have to you

1718
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:57,119
know treat them and compensate them all

1719
