1
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:07,440
hello cactus khan everyone hear me okay

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:08,960
perfect

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:10,880
uh thank you for having me and giving me

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:13,200
the opportunity to speak here today i

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,280
almost didn't make it here i live in one

6
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,279
of the square states up north

7
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:19,439
and flights got cancelled and i was on

8
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:21,039
standby and then i had a co-worker pick

9
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:22,320
me up at the airport so it's been a

10
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,680
journey

11
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,519
but i made it so i'm really excited to

12
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:26,880
speak i've seen some really great

13
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,679
presentations today both in the uh

14
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:32,558
no talks and in the tracks here

15
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:33,680
okay

16
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,399
so today i want to talk about some of

17
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:38,239
the things i learned

18
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:39,680
during my first year working as a

19
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,480
security analyst and generally how to

20
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,320
survive and thrive in a sock or a

21
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,520
security operations center

22
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,680
i wanted to do this talk because while

23
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,000
i've seen a number of amazing resources

24
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,800
and talks about getting into infosec and

25
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,559
starting out in security

26
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:59,440
i haven't really seen as many resources

27
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,120
about what to do once you actually get

28
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,480
there

29
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,479
and the truth is a lot of us are going

30
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:06,479
to get our start working as an analyst

31
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:08,000
in a sock

32
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
and i think it's a really great jumping

33
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,439
off point actually

34
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:14,080
because you get to see defense in depth

35
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,159
and how that works you get visibility

36
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,320
into a number of different systems and

37
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,960
get to see how they work you learn what

38
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,000
an attack and a threat can look like

39
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,240
so it's my hope that with this talk it

40
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,600
will at least provide a little bit of

41
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,680
insight for people who are considering

42
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,240
the same path

43
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,560
all right so my name is walland

44
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,520
i sometimes go by aaron as well

45
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,000
um when i was a kid and teenager i was

46
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,600
very interested in the public switch

47
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,079
telephone network uh to the point where

48
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:49,439
i you know

49
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:50,960
explored some things and create a little

50
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,479
bit of mischief

51
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:55,040
uh funny enough that ended up

52
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,560
i ended up starting a career as an

53
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,079
investigative journalist and foreign

54
00:01:58,079 --> 00:01:59,840
correspondent

55
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,159
but i've also done some other stints

56
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:03,840
as a network engineer

57
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,479
a nightclub manager and working in the

58
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:10,318
sock and then currently i will be

59
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:12,000
currently i'm actually just starting uh

60
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,360
pin testing so

61
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,640
looking forward to that imposter

62
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,959
syndrome all over again

63
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:18,800
uh i do want to give the perfunctory

64
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,239
disclosure

65
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:21,760
all the thoughts expressed today are my

66
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,400
own they are not my employers and i

67
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,680
don't speak for anyone else either

68
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,080
okay and a little caveat before we get

69
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,879
to the meat of the talk um

70
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:37,599
yes i know every sock is different not

71
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:39,360
every sock will function the same way

72
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,120
socks have different goals

73
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,519
socks have different resources

74
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:45,680
not everything i say here today is going

75
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,599
to apply to every sock but what i'm

76
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:49,200
trying to do is just highlight some

77
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,839
general concepts

78
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,480
okay so i remember when i was looking at

79
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,239
analyst job postings which are always

80
00:02:58,239 --> 00:02:59,920
fun to read aren't they

81
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,560
and reading the job requirements

82
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,080
and i would read them and i'd walk away

83
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,400
and say in my mind okay that's all well

84
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,000
and good but what does

85
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,959
an analyst actually do

86
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:13,440
and to put it as simple as possible

87
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,680
you're basically taking you're taking

88
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,519
input right you're taking logs and

89
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:18,720
artifacts

90
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,599
usually logs from a system or network

91
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:22,959
you're investigating them you're

92
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:24,799
processing that information

93
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:26,720
and you are ultimately determining if

94
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,519
there is a threat

95
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,799
and then

96
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:32,720
what you do what your course of action

97
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,799
will be is usually based on policies or

98
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:38,000
triage in your organization

99
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,280
um

100
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,959
and that's just really

101
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:42,560
that's the simplest definition i could

102
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,319
put it to

103
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:46,959
depending on where you work uh those log

104
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:49,519
events can be programmed to turn into

105
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:52,560
alarms or events based on specific

106
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,920
behavior like if you're working with a

107
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,000
sim seam however you want to pronounce

108
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
it

109
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,040
so when i was thinking of some skills

110
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,760
that really make a great analyst uh one

111
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:08,720
of the

112
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,400
things that first stood out in my mind

113
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,720
was having uh some basics in net

114
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,959
networking and security

115
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:16,959
i'm not saying you have to go to you

116
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,399
have to have a specif

117
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:19,600
sorry not saying you have to have a

118
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,440
specific degree i'm not saying you need

119
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,280
a specific certification

120
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,600
i'm not here to tell you that but you

121
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,919
will set yourself up for success if you

122
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:29,840
have some foundational knowledge in how

123
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,400
networks talk to each other and how in

124
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,400
some cyber security fundamentals and it

125
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,080
will make reading logs and running

126
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:40,000
investigations so much more easier

127
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,759
on top of that uh the other thing i

128
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:43,840
thought of was having some really solid

129
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,400
verbal and communication skills

130
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,840
i hate to break it to you but your

131
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,040
analysis

132
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,880
your analysis is going to be useless if

133
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,560
you cannot effectively communicate

134
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,240
what's going on

135
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,440
i think that's where the journalism

136
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,720
background kind of helped me a little

137
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,320
bit

138
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,720
uh third would be having a really great

139
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,160
attention to detail that's going to be

140
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,560
crucial

141
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,600
you know

142
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,720
attackers can create domains that at

143
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,600
first glance look very legitimate in i.t

144
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,000
there are naming conventions that where

145
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,560
posts and devices tend to look the same

146
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,160
so you always want to be vigilant to

147
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,520
make sure you're providing accurate

148
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,120
information during your investigations

149
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,880
right

150
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,560
and then the fourth really is just kind

151
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,039
of the mentality of a hacker uh being

152
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:28,880
curious wanting to use that

153
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,520
investigative uh process

154
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,960
uh because that's really what's gonna

155
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:37,239
keep the work interesting for you

156
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,280
all right so i see this a lot

157
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,039
when people are starting out they tend

158
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:46,159
to get very overwhelmed

159
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,880
and i want to caution against that

160
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,639
uh yes you will be drinking from the

161
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:53,120
fire hose you will be

162
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,960
you know processing a ton of new

163
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,680
information and using different tools

164
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,759
and it's okay to feel like there's no

165
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,840
possible way you will learn it all it's

166
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,240
okay to have imposter syndrome

167
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,160
i i kind of get nervous of people who

168
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,080
don't actually have impostor syndrome

169
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:11,599
more than i do people who do have it

170
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,360
uh but if you're looking you know if

171
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,479
you're feeling nervous just remember

172
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:16,240
that the organization hired you and they

173
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,560
hired you for a reason and as one of my

174
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,440
uh

175
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,280
mentors used to say it's a marathon it's

176
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,720
not a sprint and that kind of goes for

177
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,600
security in general

178
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:29,520
all right

179
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,199
so one of the things that helped me the

180
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:34,080
most when doing invest when i was doing

181
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,919
investigations was learning to read that

182
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:37,360
raw log data

183
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,039
uh it's something mary actually alluded

184
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:41,039
to a little bit earlier in her keynote

185
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:42,319
um

186
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:43,840
as an analyst

187
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,600
you could be reading tons of different

188
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,759
logs every day it could be virtual

189
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:49,840
machine logs os logs

190
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,720
cloud logs uh endpoint security logs

191
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,039
firewall logs it really depends on your

192
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:56,720
environment

193
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,639
and sometimes those logs just aren't

194
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:00,639
going to get parsed right sometimes the

195
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:02,400
correct data isn't going to be pulled

196
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,599
out

197
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:04,560
and

198
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,400
sometimes host names and ip addresses

199
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,240
can be switched

200
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,000
and the best way to really find out

201
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,319
what's going on is to go to the source

202
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:16,039
and read that raw data

203
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,080
it's going to provide you a lot of

204
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,039
knowledge

205
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,800
into your systems and how they actually

206
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,400
work and it's possible you might find

207
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,840
artifacts in there that you didn't even

208
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,199
know about that could aid your

209
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:28,199
investigation

210
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:34,560
okay so threat intelligence is its own

211
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,440
industry and profession in its own right

212
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,800
uh but if you're an analyst you are

213
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,960
definitely going to want to become uh

214
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,880
familiar with threat intelligence

215
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,639
analysts use tools that are based off of

216
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,759
threat and tell all the time

217
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,160
you can't really protect yourself if you

218
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,560
don't know how an attacker works or how

219
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,840
they operate

220
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,759
you can't protect yourself against known

221
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:57,199
attacks if you don't know what

222
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:59,039
indicators of compromise are

223
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:01,680
or what they are

224
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:03,759
so uh sometimes there could be a major

225
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:05,759
event that comes up the most recent uh

226
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:07,840
for me was log4j where you have to

227
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:08,800
quickly

228
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,560
educate yourself as

229
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,400
about as much as you can about a

230
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,000
specific vulnerability to protect

231
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,280
yourself

232
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,440
and uh that was a huge event and it

233
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:20,080
ruined a lot of people's holidays

234
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,680
uh but no being familiar with threat

235
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:26,360
intelligence is going to help you

236
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:32,479
okay so bad news if you are working as

237
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:33,919
an analyst there are going to be

238
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:35,519
multiple times where you get something

239
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:38,080
wrong and where you make a mistake

240
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,320
you can only look at so much data before

241
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,559
it's just inevitable

242
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,399
and if you are working at a place that's

243
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,880
worth staying at the this these mistakes

244
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,240
will be treated as a learning

245
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,279
opportunity and not as a

246
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:55,440
punishment um that being said there is a

247
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,839
big difference between making an error

248
00:08:57,839 --> 00:08:59,680
and then negligence for instance if you

249
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,279
were to lie about the investigative

250
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:02,640
steps that you took

251
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,160
or if you're just going to completely

252
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,760
ignore your organization's policies

253
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,399
that's not good uh don't do that

254
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:10,160
but in general everyone's human everyone

255
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,160
makes mistakes the best we can really do

256
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,880
is learn from them

257
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,160
i remember the first time i thought i

258
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,720
found something suspicious i was like

259
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,200
yeah they're busted and i'm going to get

260
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,600
them i'm going to escalate this and then

261
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,880
it's going to be fixed this problem

262
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:34,480
and that doesn't necessarily happen in a

263
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,440
sock

264
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,600
sometimes things do get fixed

265
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,760
sometimes they don't

266
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,200
and it's just one of the realities of

267
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,000
being an analyst

268
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,640
and unfortunately

269
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,320
you don't really get to choose the

270
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,080
response there is no guarantee that

271
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,760
anything you escalate will ever be fixed

272
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,920
mitigated or acknowledged

273
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,920
and this is especially true if you work

274
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,839
on behalf of other clients or multiple

275
00:09:57,839 --> 00:09:58,720
clients

276
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,320
if someone

277
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,160
makes the choice to

278
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,880
immediately reformat an infected host

279
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,120
without investigating the true scope of

280
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,519
the compromise while at the same time

281
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:12,560
destroying valuable forensic data

282
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,079
that's out of your hands

283
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:17,120
it's just not something you get to pick

284
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,959
that being said though it is an amazing

285
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:20,720
feeling when you can stop ransomware or

286
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,560
stop something else back from happening

287
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,000
and while those times are few and far

288
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,440
between it's a great feeling and it's

289
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,720
very rewarding in my opinion

290
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,440
all right so long visibility

291
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,360
oh

292
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,320
so much to my chagrin uh and it took me

293
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,640
a long time to learn this

294
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,480
you are not always going to be able to

295
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,839
find the cause for an event

296
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:48,240
uh sometimes the logs just don't exist

297
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,079
sometimes you can't determine what

298
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:52,079
happened and that's okay

299
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:54,000
uh maybe oftentimes logs aren't even

300
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,200
turned on like maybe on a dc or domain

301
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,800
controller like powershell execution

302
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,600
logs aren't enabled maybe logon debug

303
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,360
logs aren't enabled maybe on a linux

304
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,279
host for both logs aren't enabled if the

305
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:07,200
logs don't exist there's really not that

306
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,959
much you can do for an investigation

307
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:13,680
all you can really do is provide as many

308
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,680
facts as you possibly can

309
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,200
but yeah don't be frustrated don't go

310
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,440
chasing waterfalls sometimes you just

311
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,320
can't find out why

312
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,519
alrighty so night shift it is a rite of

313
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:29,600
passage for many analysts working in a

314
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,959
24-hour sock especially new analysts

315
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:34,640
some people handle it way better than

316
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,720
others i was not one of those people

317
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,279
unfortunately uh and i was really

318
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:41,040
confused by it because i've always been

319
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,399
a night owl

320
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:44,399
and what i discovered was there's a

321
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:46,000
really big difference

322
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,240
from going to bed at 4am

323
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,519
or 5am as opposed to going to bed at 9am

324
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:52,639
or 10am

325
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:54,160
and one is that the sunlight's out so

326
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,079
your circadian rhythm gets punched in

327
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:57,839
the groin basically

328
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:00,000
um

329
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,920
but i i'm not a medical professional

330
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,519
just obviously

331
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:06,240
but what i did read

332
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,000
from medical professionals and doctors

333
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,839
what they usually would recommend is

334
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:11,680
don't change your sleep schedule make

335
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,519
sure it's always consistent don't change

336
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:14,880
it each day

337
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,639
that's one of the biggest pieces of

338
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:18,639
advice they gave

339
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:20,240
but yeah i mean general things that

340
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,279
helped me i live in a loud noisy

341
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:25,519
uh urban environment

342
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:27,120
uh blackout curtains were important for

343
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,720
me i'm a light sleeper a white noise

344
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,639
machine really helped a sleep aids

345
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:32,639
non-habit for informing

346
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,760
not sleep aids that are going to make

347
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,279
you say like racist racist things on

348
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:36,800
twitter or

349
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,200
or whatever um i mean if so that's up to

350
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,240
your doctor if you want to talk

351
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,760
prescriptions but that's not i'm not

352
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,480
going to recommend them

353
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:48,079
but uh in general um i've also uh would

354
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:49,839
really recommend noise cancelling

355
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:51,440
headphones those can be really awesome i

356
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,079
know that another company makes like

357
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:55,120
small

358
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,399
headphones you can sleep in that will

359
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:58,240
play white noise and play music as well

360
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,320
so that's also another option

361
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,160
i do remember one time i was on night

362
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:05,279
shift and i the landlord decided to redo

363
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:07,440
the roof and which was a two-week

364
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,120
process and i was on the top floor of

365
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,240
the building

366
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,079
and it was you know these these roofers

367
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:13,680
are working from 8 am to 8 pm and it was

368
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:14,399
just

369
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:16,480
miserable so it's just something to

370
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,639
consider i wish i was in a quiet place

371
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:22,079
in the country when i was on night shift

372
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:26,720
all right so every sock has a weakness

373
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,800
everything has a weakness so of course

374
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,120
every sock has a weakness it is not

375
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,560
impossible to bypass a sock

376
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,279
maybe a signed binary executed something

377
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:39,680
malicious and it just wasn't seen

378
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,000
maybe there's an insider threat who

379
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,519
works in the sock

380
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:44,399
maybe

381
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:45,519
people

382
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:47,600
bribed a trash

383
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,360
valet service to get your garbage and

384
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,120
now they have some sensitive information

385
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,800
that about the stock

386
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:56,160
anything can really happen right

387
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,079
and it's really just

388
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:00,560
one tool adam mini and defensive

389
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:01,920
operations and i think it's important

390
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,160
that people understand that

391
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,639
i do truly believe that the strength of

392
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:08,880
any sock ultimately at the end of the

393
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,920
day comes down to analysts well it comes

394
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,680
down to the

395
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,600
variety of rules the strength of the

396
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,279
rules that are enabled and the strength

397
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:20,000
of the analyst understanding of them

398
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,440
if you don't

399
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,279
have excellent visibility into your

400
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,040
environment or a keen understanding of

401
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:25,920
it

402
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,760
it's really hard to fight against

403
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,760
threats

404
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,240
oh yeah and as always i mean this seems

405
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,160
obvious but uh practiced and prepared

406
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,560
responses are key for any compromise

407
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:42,518
when it happens and it will

408
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,920
all righty so another harsh reality of

409
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,079
sock life is some socks are better to

410
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:52,320
work for than others

411
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:55,040
i got really lucky in that i worked at

412
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,560
one where i had a fair amount of

413
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:59,680
autonomy and they did invest in me with

414
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,839
training

415
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:03,600
but some is real some really do want

416
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,600
warm bodies

417
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:09,440
and if you're miserable if you're bored

418
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,760
if there is no indication they will

419
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,360
invest in you to make you better if

420
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,519
you're not learning anything new

421
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:17,279
get the hell out of there

422
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:18,959
there are plenty of places especially

423
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:20,959
after covid that are hiring remote stock

424
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:22,880
analysts where you don't even need to be

425
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,279
confined to your own area where you live

426
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:27,040
but yeah you will burn out on this work

427
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:30,480
fast if you are miserable

428
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:35,839
so i did want to provide some resources

429
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:37,759
to people who are thinking about getting

430
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:41,920
into this side of a defense

431
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,360
one of the

432
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,199
coolest things you can do if you want

433
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:46,240
you don't have to wait for anyone's

434
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,920
permission to start doing analyst work

435
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,079
or start looking at logs you can start

436
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:51,759
your own log management software there

437
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:53,199
are themes out there that you can use

438
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:54,880
their free products to collect logs on

439
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,199
your own home network

440
00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:00,079
qradar and splunk are some of the

441
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:01,680
options that offer trial or free

442
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,839
editions i'm not trying to

443
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,600
endorse any specific vendor but those

444
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:09,199
are the ones that i know are for free

445
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:11,759
uh graylog and cabana those are i was

446
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:13,839
able to start a greylock server

447
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:15,440
relatively quick on a virtual machine

448
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,360
it's not too difficult

449
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,040
you might be asking yourself okay well i

450
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,279
can have the software but it's my dinky

451
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:23,279
home network and you know i'm not really

452
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:24,639
going to collect that many logs from my

453
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:26,959
devices probably it depends maybe your

454
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:29,279
home network does have a lot of activity

455
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:31,680
uh one of the best data sets i've seen

456
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,000
was from splunk's boss the sock

457
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,680
competition so that's basically a bunch

458
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,360
of logs that you can

459
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,040
put into your sim and you can kind of

460
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,639
look through them and practice a little

461
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:42,399
bit and they do release those three on

462
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:44,240
github just you can google it i didn't

463
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,600
provide a link because i didn't see a

464
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,279
point

465
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:49,519
uh oh and then open sock this is a

466
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:51,839
competition put on by recon infosec at

467
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:54,079
defcon each year they do it virtually

468
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:56,639
and they do it in person you can work on

469
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:58,800
a team or you can work by yourself at

470
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,240
your own pace so if you don't feel

471
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,920
competitive it's a great option but

472
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,600
basically mimics a sock and threat

473
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,079
hunting and it's a really really fun ctf

474
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:07,520
and i actually remember putting that on

475
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,359
my resume before i even worked as an

476
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:10,319
analyst

477
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:14,319
so some it's it's another fun option

478
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,400
but in summary

479
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,520
uh

480
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,039
i really would encourage people to get

481
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:22,959
into this field like i said i think it's

482
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:25,119
a great jumping off point uh obviously

483
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:26,880
to me the natural progression is more of

484
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,720
a deeper thing like you know digital

485
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,240
forensics and incident response seems

486
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,600
like it'd be the natural progression

487
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,679
it's kind of like analysts on steroids a

488
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:34,880
little bit

489
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,000
but you could go anywhere with this you

490
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,200
could manage a sock you could do

491
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,960
operations

492
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,720
uh you could you know go into pen

493
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,400
testing like i have do more offensive

494
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,280
stuff the sky's really the limit and

495
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,120
i think as i said there if you generally

496
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,520
if you actually care and you do truly

497
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,559
want to learn you have the hacker

498
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:53,918
mindset i think you'll be just fine

499
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,000
and with that i have five minutes left

500
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,919
and that is my presentation that was my

501
00:17:57,919 --> 00:17:59,490
first presentation

502
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:08,400
[Applause]

503
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,240
um yeah i mean if i don't know if anyone

504
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,679
has any questions but feel free i can

505
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:14,000
throw the

506
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,120
inanimate object at you

507
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:23,199
or if there are any online questions

508
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,080
you in the back sir

509
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,559
yep

510
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:36,080
so alarm fatigue is a real thing and i'm

511
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,919
not going to lie there is a small amount

512
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:39,600
of repetition

513
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,280
a small too large amount of repetition

514
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,640
with this job

515
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:45,520
um alarm fatigue i would argue isn't

516
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,360
necessarily

517
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,360
up on up to the analysts

518
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,960
it's up to the operations of the sock

519
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,320
and that means things aren't being tuned

520
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,760
properly

521
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,000
uh you know in general you shouldn't you

522
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,320
know be waiting waiting through too much

523
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:01,280
garbage every day you know ideally

524
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,880
um and that's really more of an ops

525
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,720
thing but i would say on the alice end

526
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,400
if you want to be really proactive about

527
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,000
submitting requests for tuning and when

528
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,440
i say tuning basically you're tuning out

529
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,520
false positives things that aren't are

530
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:14,080
determined not to be a threat by either

531
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,679
you know someone who makes that decision

532
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:17,760
or you just you already know

533
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,520
that it's noise so to make tuning out

534
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,600
the noise is the best way to go about

535
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,600
that but yeah i mean it should

536
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,679
ideally if things are being managed

537
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:27,760
correctly uh it shouldn't be

538
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,360
too terrible of an issue and you

539
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,720
shouldn't be subjecting your analyst to

540
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,360
alert fatigue

541
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:39,200
yeah i can hear you like oh i'll i'll

542
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:43,400
repeat your question too um

543
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,480
sure

544
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,919
um i would look at the list of

545
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:55,520
responsibilities and see what they have

546
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:56,960
you do

547
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:00,160
um i'd also see if you can you know if

548
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,600
you have some friends who work in the

549
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,360
industry you want to check in on them

550
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,720
because there are whisper networks about

551
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,799
the bad socks out there and word does

552
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:08,320
tend to get around or if you wanted to

553
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,320
ask like for advice on discord like some

554
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,440
might someone probably wouldn't say

555
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,720
something publicly but they'll message

556
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,000
you

557
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:14,880
uh

558
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,280
as far as looking for jobs i mean i i

559
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,840
used you know the standard search tools

560
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:22,640
like indeed and you know and actually

561
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,400
discord can be great you know and

562
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,840
networking at conferences can be a

563
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,520
really great way as well

564
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,720
uh

565
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:29,840
in general

566
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,520
you do want to be wary of some big

567
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:34,159
companies especially maybe isps or cable

568
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:37,760
companies um i've heard some pretty bad

569
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,039
horror stories i'm not going to name any

570
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:40,480
names but

571
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,480
i i think it was really beneficial to me

572
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,559
to start out

573
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:46,880
at an mss which means i saw

574
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,240
you know action from a variety of

575
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,240
clients but even if you you're not if

576
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,320
you're not doing that uh

577
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,679
i would suggest something a little bit

578
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:55,840
more medium-sized or boutique but that's

579
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,840
just my personal taste

580
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,120
everyone has to start somewhere it might

581
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,039
not be your dream job but like i said if

582
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:02,559
those if you're miserable and it's

583
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:04,240
boring and it's just terrible didn't

584
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,760
just get out it's not worth your time

585
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,280
you're not you're more you're worth more

586
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:11,039
than a warm body uh pushing buttons

587
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,400
do you have any uh

588
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,240
recommendations for

589
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,919
networking groups or community groups i

590
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:21,039
don't know if you're in a valley but

591
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:22,720
anything here that would be more geared

592
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:25,360
towards analysts

593
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:28,000
i'm not in the valley unfortunately i am

594
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,679
from denver um

595
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:35,120
i know there are

596
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,760
yeah there's one that's based in europe

597
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,360
and the u.s i'm forgetting the name of

598
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,360
it right now but there is a big job

599
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,280
server

600
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,960
i definitely have seen some job postings

601
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,720
in cactus kong i know there are some

602
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,320
slacks out there

603
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,520
the ones that were actually the best

604
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,600
resources for me in denver anyway were

605
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,000
local podcasts and they had tended to

606
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,840
have like social media and slacks and

607
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,360
that was really kind of more of what i

608
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,600
followed

609
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:00,960
yeah sorry for arizona i can't

610
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,080
necessarily

611
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,440
speak but

612
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:06,480
