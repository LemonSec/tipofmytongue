1
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:05,200
hello cactus khan um i spoke at uh

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:06,799
cactus khan

3
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:09,280
was that eight or nine and i was so

4
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:10,559
excited to

5
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:12,559
finally this year be able to make it in

6
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:15,360
person and sadly as i think for so many

7
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,320
of us uh omicron derailed that so

8
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,119
uh look forward to seeing you in arizona

9
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:23,199
next year when we get through this

10
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:24,560
um so

11
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,920
my talk is called throwing the elephant

12
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,400
my name is bryson bort i am the founder

13
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,719
and current ceo of scythe it's an

14
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:35,360
adversary emulation platform um that is

15
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:36,960
a spin out from a consulting company

16
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,559
that i founded nine years ago called

17
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:39,440
grim

18
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,320
um which is still going on strong and

19
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,360
hacks everything from cyber physical to

20
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,680
traditional enterprise i.t

21
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,200
and then i'm the co-founder of a

22
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,399
non-profit it's a 501c3 called the ics

23
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:54,800
village with the education and awareness

24
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,039
of industrial control system security

25
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:59,440
and as you can see i do a lot of

26
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,039
different costumes and things to help

27
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:03,680
keep it fun

28
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:04,640
so

29
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,240
where you work

30
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,640
oh well apologies for the same reason

31
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,640
that i can't be in arizona for cactus

32
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,280
con this is where you used to work

33
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,799
where you work now

34
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:16,799
at home

35
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:17,680
so

36
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,920
in every business where you work

37
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,119
there's the room right that's where

38
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:25,759
leadership comes together and makes the

39
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:28,320
decisions that drive what the business

40
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,320
is going to do

41
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,720
so the way it works in the room

42
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,000
first of all

43
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,640
powerpoint powerpoint is everything that

44
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,799
drives vision um it's where we decide

45
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:42,399
what pretty colors are going to tell us

46
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:44,000
what we're going to do next year

47
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,119
and then where everything actually

48
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:46,880
happens in the trenches

49
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,159
excel

50
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:49,040
and i'm sure a lot of you have

51
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,720
experienced this where information

52
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,479
security at the end of the day when you

53
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:54,880
get down through all of the technology

54
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,040
the bottom of it all

55
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:00,240
excel is what's driving it

56
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,479
all right so let's talk about the

57
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:04,719
elephant and the room so this is our

58
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:06,880
first exercise so i want you to close

59
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,080
your eyes just think for a few seconds

60
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,520
all right you picture it you're

61
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,840
picturing the elephant now

62
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,440
what are the adjectives you would use to

63
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,959
describe this elephant is it it's big

64
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:20,840
lumbers

65
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,280
heavy what if you tried to move it would

66
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,280
you be able to just move the elephant

67
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,480
all right so

68
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,480
that's our thinking exercise to set for

69
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,520
this

70
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,440
all of those words and all those ways

71
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,120
that you just thought of that elephant

72
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,040
in your head

73
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,840
that's your boss

74
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,519
so of course how the boss sees

75
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:44,720
themselves is different

76
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:46,560
all right so let's go through the

77
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,720
hierarchy of the herd

78
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,840
so your boss is presumably not you know

79
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,959
as bad

80
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:55,519
and so they're they're this awesome nerd

81
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:56,319
but

82
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:59,840
where did they fit in the hierarchy so

83
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:00,959
security

84
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:02,560
uh we already have the foreshadowing

85
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,200
securities at the bottom of the slide

86
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,680
security is there to assure information

87
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,400
technology no modern business can

88
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,080
function in scale without information

89
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,280
technology to make it happen

90
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,879
of course that supports the business and

91
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:19,840
then at the top is leadership so why is

92
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,159
this important why do we have this here

93
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:24,159
besides being silly with all the

94
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:26,080
different parts outside of security the

95
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,760
key here is this is the inviolable

96
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,840
hierarchy of business

97
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,159
everywhere the largest

98
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:35,840
budget

99
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,680
in the business is for the business

100
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,640
itself

101
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,200
if this is a company that makes cookies

102
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,840
then most of the money goes to making

103
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,519
cookies that's what drives revenue

104
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:49,040
that's why the business is in effect

105
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,560
some percentage of that budget goes to

106
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,000
i.t and then some percentage of that sub

107
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,480
budget goes to security

108
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,319
why does this matter one we've

109
00:03:58,319 --> 00:03:59,599
established the priorities of the

110
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:02,000
business two we understand how the money

111
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,239
flows from that and it ties back to

112
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:05,920
where the leadership rests and the way

113
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,360
that they're looking at the priorities

114
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,040
of the business because that's what we

115
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,040
need to focus on

116
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,239
all right so second exercise what

117
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:16,720
percentage of boards have a dedicated

118
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,079
committee for cyber security uh this

119
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:23,680
statistic is from a gartner survey from

120
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,000
2020 so i don't think it's going to

121
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,600
change very much

122
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,520
the answer is a

123
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,880
9

124
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,040
of boards have a dedicated committee for

125
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,560
cyber security

126
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,560
this is backing up what we just talked

127
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,560
about in terms of the priorities for the

128
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,960
business when you think about the

129
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,320
business view of risk cyber security is

130
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,479
not the top thing depending on the

131
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:48,160
industry it could be something different

132
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,800
like in finance maybe it's inflation

133
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,639
maybe it's cryptocurrency

134
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:55,919
um and so cyber security is tends to be

135
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:58,400
down lower on the list on average cyber

136
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,639
security is ranked anywhere from three

137
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:03,440
to five in terms of the overall risks

138
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,680
that a business sees for itself

139
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,400
that's been increasing

140
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,320
so what does the serengeti look like

141
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,759
well let's start

142
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:13,600
how many businesses are there in the

143
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,400
united states

144
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,759
a little bit more than 30 million

145
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:20,880
businesses

146
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,039
and then how many of them have security

147
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:26,479
and this is a self-reported so

148
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:29,919
about 13. so little less than 40 of

149
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:31,759
businesses have

150
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:34,080
their own security or have security as

151
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,320
they define it and then how many of them

152
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:39,840
have a rent team

153
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,120
a significantly less percentage now the

154
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,520
intent of this slide is not that having

155
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,120
a red team

156
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,520
is a necessity

157
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,680
it's really again a reflection of those

158
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,680
priorities that we were establishing as

159
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,600
well as the purpose of red team is

160
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,520
quality assurance

161
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,639
i.t is there security assures it red

162
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:05,120
team is the quality assurance that that

163
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,600
assurance actually is there to deliver

164
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,400
the i.t service um and so the point here

165
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,039
is just that we're reinforcing what the

166
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,880
lay of the land actually looks like in

167
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,880
those priorities as we see them in real

168
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:17,919
business

169
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:21,039
so the rules of the serengeti um there's

170
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:23,280
the off-quoted aphorism that there are

171
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,840
two kinds of companies those that have

172
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,000
been hacked and those that have been

173
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,240
hacked but don't know it well i think

174
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,560
that there is another one that really

175
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,440
speaks to our challenge in security and

176
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,960
that's that there are two kinds of

177
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,360
village chiefs so two kinds of

178
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,440
leadership the first

179
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,759
believes in security the second

180
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:46,479
doesn't and doesn't prioritize it and no

181
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:49,120
amount of individual heroics can

182
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,680
overcome that issue if you're in an

183
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,120
organization where you find yourself

184
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,120
having to do a lot of last-minute

185
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,840
heroics to overcome what is essentially

186
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,400
a systemic failure that most likely

187
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,560
speaks to the priorities of leadership

188
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,400
with not properly investing and

189
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,120
prioritizing what you need to do you can

190
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,360
either accept that work on how to change

191
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,319
it

192
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:12,639
or get another job

193
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:15,440
going even further maslow's hierarchy so

194
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,280
maslow's hierarchy is the fact that

195
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,440
there are certain things we biologically

196
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,440
need before we can build up to higher

197
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,840
things so without water i'm not going to

198
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,000
go for very far without food i'm not

199
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,400
going to go much further shelter and

200
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,520
then

201
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,560
in this case security now

202
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,080
in security the foundation is regulation

203
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,160
right governance regulatory and

204
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:42,000
compliance without those basics a

205
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,240
business can't function the reason i

206
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,080
have to mention these is that there are

207
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,960
some areas where we get carried away in

208
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,280
looking down on compliance compliance

209
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,440
from a business perspective is the

210
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,319
absolute beginning but keep in mind that

211
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:59,120
compliance does not necessarily mean

212
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,199
that that's actually security right it's

213
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:03,199
a checklist that allows the business to

214
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:05,599
operate from a security perspective and

215
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:07,360
then our investments and priorities on

216
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,160
top of that lead to the

217
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,240
you know the real implementation of

218
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,639
realistic security that we need because

219
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:16,160
a checklist is only going to get you so

220
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,240
far

221
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,319
point being here

222
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:23,599
security is a cost center

223
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:24,319
at

224
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,960
the average business we do not generate

225
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,440
revenue we are not directly into the

226
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:33,519
business we are a support to revenue

227
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:35,679
so convincing the elephant well the

228
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:37,279
first kind of management we're all used

229
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:40,399
to there's a boss a boss manager's down

230
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:42,000
and we're used to that right i tell you

231
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
what to do you do it that's the

232
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,320
traditional way of managing

233
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,720
but there are actually two other kinds

234
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,200
managing up and managing sideways

235
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:56,000
managing up is how do i manage my boss

236
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,760
deciding what to tell them deciding how

237
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,680
i tell them what kind of relationship i

238
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,240
have with them are all factors in my

239
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,760
direct one-to-one relationship with

240
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,920
managing up and that boss

241
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,640
the other is what about influencing in

242
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,200
the herd around that boss so managing

243
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,279
sideways there's two elements to this

244
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:16,080
one are the direct peers on your team

245
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,080
your boss manages more than just you

246
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:21,040
they manage other folks as well

247
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,680
having them bought in and agreeing to a

248
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,720
way to manage that elephant is going to

249
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,519
help the other is a security champion

250
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:31,360
program which is going beyond your

251
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,440
immediate peer group into other

252
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,279
functional areas and getting their

253
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:38,000
buy-in to help influence as a part of

254
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,440
that management

255
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,720
and we're going to go into more detail

256
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,240
on the security champion program later

257
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,120
okay

258
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,160
so how do we convince the elephant

259
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:51,360
well begins with their starting point in

260
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,720
their language

261
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,959
they also have a boss so there's

262
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:57,040
somebody that they're also trying to

263
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,320
manage up

264
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,600
and what is their win well so if these

265
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,519
are the things that i want

266
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:06,000
how do i get them how do i know how do i

267
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,399
know for sure how do i find out

268
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:11,360
well it's easy

269
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,519
ask them

270
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:15,760
people like to talk about themselves and

271
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,920
your boss is not trying well hopefully

272
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,200
it's not trying to have some sort of

273
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,600
covert plan here on how they're going to

274
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,839
accomplish their performance goals

275
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:25,279
they're going to tell you they're going

276
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:26,560
to tell you about what their boss

277
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,320
expects they're going to tell you about

278
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,680
what they understand about where the

279
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,399
business is trying to go these are all

280
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,640
good ways to understand

281
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,800
so that you can speak and align to what

282
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,640
they need

283
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,279
so what does your village do right your

284
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,600
elephant is inside a village with other

285
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,920
elephants that where you are so first of

286
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,920
all walk the village

287
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,800
don't just stay inside your own

288
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,320
proverbial hut inside your own

289
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,680
functional area

290
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,600
what does the village actually do what

291
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,680
do you produce if you're a manufacturing

292
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,560
plant go and talk to the engineers see

293
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,760
what about getting a tour of the

294
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,680
manufacturing line

295
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,839
establish a relationship and understand

296
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:07,839
directly from folks that work on the

297
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:09,600
business operations side what's

298
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,480
happening what's going on

299
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,920
being introverts of course we don't

300
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,920
always want to go and talk to folks some

301
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,120
of the other things we can do is we can

302
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,760
read your company if it's public is

303
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,240
required to publish

304
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,399
findings or filings every single year

305
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:25,839
and they will tell you back to that

306
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:27,839
earlier point about risk they will tell

307
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:29,519
you how and what they prioritize the

308
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:31,680
risk in those filings

309
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,040
there might be investor briefings that

310
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,399
do that those are typically going to be

311
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:36,399
on a quarterly basis and you can hear

312
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:38,560
the ceo of the organization answer

313
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,720
questions from the investors around

314
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,880
different aspects of risk and how they

315
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,120
see the business going news articles on

316
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,519
it and then this is a hat tip to maura

317
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:49,839
jake uh jake um

318
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:52,959
williams where uh

319
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:53,920
most

320
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,160
leaders uh as a part of bettering

321
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:59,519
themselves have an mba reading list of

322
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:02,079
books that they're learning to

323
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:04,560
how to how to be better managers what a

324
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,959
great way to learn the language of the

325
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:08,959
elephant read the books where they're

326
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:11,360
learning their own languages and ideas

327
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,360
and being able to use that language to

328
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,200
speak to them with is going to go a lot

329
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,639
further

330
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:17,680
so

331
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,760
get the right equipment

332
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,720
so this is the cyber defense matrix it

333
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,839
was uh released at rsa a few years ago

334
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:26,720
by

335
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,320
um by sunil yu the book is either just

336
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,839
published or is about to be published so

337
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:33,360
you can also see it in

338
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,360
the book and then there's uh the web

339
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,680
link where you can also read about it on

340
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,040
on his website

341
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,279
and in short when we're looking at what

342
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:43,200
kinds of assets we already have in the

343
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,839
environment the left side is

344
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:47,680
the the categories of those assets

345
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,880
devices applications networks data and

346
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,760
users and then it goes through the five

347
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:57,519
phases of security for those assets so

348
00:12:57,519 --> 00:12:59,920
identify configuration management what

349
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,720
do i have what's the state of it

350
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,519
then we get into active phases protect

351
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:08,079
my ability to prevent unauthorized

352
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:09,040
access

353
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,519
and then in a post breach scenario

354
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:13,760
my ability to detect it my ability to

355
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,760
respond and then my ability to recover

356
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,680
and complete

357
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,079
the closing out the breach at the bottom

358
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:21,200
we can see

359
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,000
how people and technology have different

360
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,480
dependencies from those but the idea

361
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,560
here is by looking at the different

362
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,639
tools and processes that you already

363
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:32,880
have in your environment mapping them

364
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,440
against this will help you understand

365
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,800
what your strengths are what you're

366
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,800
capable of doing and then also

367
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,320
highlighting the gaps that maybe that

368
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,160
you need to invest in

369
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,800
to be able to move forward

370
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:45,839
so

371
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:48,240
i always like to simplify everything and

372
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,839
one of the best ways to get an elephant

373
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:52,720
to move is to create fire

374
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,920
uh so fire in our

375
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,360
instance is

376
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,480
an attack

377
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:01,040
security is defined by the threat being

378
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,560
able to create a threat gives us real

379
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,600
intel

380
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,880
fire on where we stand and so i break

381
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,440
this down into three simple phases

382
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,839
reconnaissance this is where somebody

383
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:16,240
would be casing our company open system

384
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,440
intelligent

385
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,680
intelligence putting together the who

386
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,040
the network

387
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:24,480
details of the technical network uh and

388
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,480
you know what what might be of interest

389
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,639
initial access is

390
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:31,600
when they first breach into your network

391
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,279
that first shell

392
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:35,519
now a lot of folks get focused on this

393
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,600
because this is what we're used to to

394
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,040
dealing with this is the protection

395
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,320
phase

396
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:43,360
um but the reality is

397
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,600
while having shell

398
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,240
means the potential for something bad

399
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,279
in short of a denial of service attack

400
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:53,600
nothing has actually happened yet what

401
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,639
happens next is in the post access

402
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:59,519
phases where the attacker

403
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:01,519
iterates through the network to

404
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:03,040
accomplish their goals whatever those

405
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,560
might be

406
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,760
and so

407
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,600
we see an increase in the greatest

408
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,680
amount of business value in the post

409
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,440
access phase which in terms of

410
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,760
generating fire to create change aligned

411
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,440
to the business

412
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,120
that's where we want to focus in this

413
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,880
case all right so

414
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,720
what is fire

415
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,760
it is

416
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,320
data-driven insights for risk analysis

417
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,920
so that of course we can mitigate those

418
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,519
risks not

419
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:30,639
hey here's a problem we have to do this

420
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:33,040
because elephants don't respond well to

421
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:36,000
being wined at or told what to do i mean

422
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,440
going back to that beginning where we

423
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,279
thought of the elephant we're trying to

424
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:41,680
figure out ways that we can get

425
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,160
our leadership to move where they need

426
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,959
to go to go to make our lives easier and

427
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:49,680
to assure the business

428
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,120
so

429
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,040
one of the things that i get a little

430
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,600
frustrated when i see a lot of talks is

431
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,040
there's lots of great ideas that are

432
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,320
thrown out

433
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,320
and it's like well how do i actually do

434
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,839
that right what's my takeaway what's

435
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:04,720
something i can actually go back into my

436
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,959
day job and easily do it and one of the

437
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:08,399
hard ones is

438
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:10,880
threat modeling now keep in mind threat

439
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,839
modeling is a process not just a

440
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:15,600
specific goal or collateral and you've

441
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,959
said like here's our threat model we're

442
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:19,199
done right the process and the

443
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:22,399
continuing process of that conversation

444
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:23,279
is

445
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:26,160
most of the value but one of the easiest

446
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,839
ways to get started in terms of like

447
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:30,399
well i need something to generate fire

448
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:32,880
it needs to be real because i need to be

449
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,519
using a threat that is applicable to my

450
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:36,480
company

451
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,639
otherwise who cares right it's not

452
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:40,560
realistic i'm not it doesn't do me any

453
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,199
good and so my recommendation for doing

454
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:46,000
this easily is if you go to the mitre

455
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,040
attack website and their groups page

456
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:53,199
they list all of the documented threat

457
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:56,240
groups and activities and by simply

458
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,360
doing a text search on your industry

459
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,920
it'll automatically

460
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,120
text match

461
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,439
against that group and you can click on

462
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:07,919
that group and go and get more intricate

463
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:11,359
detail on exactly the techniques and the

464
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:14,559
tools that it uses so you've already got

465
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:16,799
a really simple way of saying hey this

466
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:19,439
does apply to us we are in this industry

467
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:21,919
and here is a starting place to begin

468
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:24,559
with it didn't take more than a minute

469
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:27,760
of time to be able to do that

470
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,280
um so

471
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:32,000
doing this as we talked about earlier we

472
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,520
don't want to just manage up on our own

473
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,919
we want to manage up with others and one

474
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:37,679
of the easiest ways to do that is

475
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:40,000
through a purple team process how i

476
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,280
define a purple team is a collaborative

477
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,280
together people

478
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:48,640
milestone-driven process for security so

479
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:52,080
teamwork plus very specific specific

480
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:55,600
objectives to improve our security to

481
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,120
our goal is of course we want insight

482
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,039
into ourselves we want to be able to

483
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:00,880
improve and at the same time we want to

484
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,280
make sure we're aligned to the business

485
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,559
because otherwise

486
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:06,720
we're we're not going to get the

487
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,240
additional buy-in

488
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,320
and support that we need

489
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,200
so

490
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,520
the process for a purple team is simple

491
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,679
start with threat intelligence or

492
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:18,720
techniques tactics and procedures that

493
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,360
are relevant to the threat

494
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,200
i gave an example there with how to

495
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,640
easily be able to go to the mitre

496
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,520
website and pull those down

497
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:28,480
but

498
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,640
and maybe you have a threat intelligence

499
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,919
function maybe you have a threat

500
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:34,080
intelligence feed maybe there are just

501
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,160
elements of

502
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,679
particular tactics and we're going to

503
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:39,280
talk about some examples to think about

504
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:42,080
later um that you want to run with so

505
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,000
whatever those are those are going to be

506
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,360
our milestones

507
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,039
tied to the specific controls that

508
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:48,559
they're going to test so we're going to

509
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:50,400
analyze and organize those and then

510
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,520
we're going to come together with our

511
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,919
collaborative discussion on what do we

512
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:56,160
think would happen if we did these if

513
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,760
this was ransomware

514
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,120
what do you think would happen what

515
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,280
would we see how quickly would we see it

516
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,200
what would the response be like

517
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,039
would backups be a part of this strategy

518
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:06,640
and this is our chance to also test our

519
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:09,200
backups um and then we're going to get

520
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:13,120
into the actual execution so we run the

521
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,559
first technique

522
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,640
and the detection engineering of what

523
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,400
did we see where did we see it how

524
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,640
quickly did we see it um

525
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,960
and iterating back and forth with

526
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,720
improving what we can see on that

527
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,880
visibility with the detections

528
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,360
as we go through the process so instead

529
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:32,080
of showing up the end with here is the

530
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,679
book of what went wrong

531
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:35,760
we have improvement as we went through

532
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,080
it together and keep in mind the scope

533
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,640
of this can be as large or particularly

534
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,400
if you're starting out as small as you

535
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,880
want there's no need to

536
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,039
try to do the entire company or to try

537
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:49,600
to do something very sophisticated begin

538
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,160
simply part of it is just building your

539
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,160
own confidence and again when you're

540
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,160
working with other folks the strength of

541
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,480
the collaboration and the process itself

542
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,160
so that eventually this can become

543
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:03,919
something that is uh even stronger

544
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:04,880
um

545
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,480
i always like to say the best price is

546
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:10,000
free uh a few years ago in collaboration

547
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,159
with uh george or chias and adam

548
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:14,720
mashinchi uh we put together what we

549
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,360
call the c2 matrix and the idea here is

550
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,280
going back to tools that we need to be

551
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:22,480
able to create fire to emulate a threat

552
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,720
we cataloged

553
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,760
currently over 90 frameworks most of

554
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:28,960
them are free some of them are

555
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,000
commercial

556
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,240
and the best part to help you here is if

557
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,720
you go to the website there's a wizard

558
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:37,360
where you can type in i want to be able

559
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,520
to conduct this kind of attack and the

560
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,039
wizard will walk you through and tell

561
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:44,320
you exactly which tools can be used to

562
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,840
be able to do that so you don't have to

563
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,919
do the guesswork it's there for you and

564
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:50,080
then to make things even easier we did a

565
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,480
collaboration with sans and created a

566
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,280
linux distro called sans slingshot where

567
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,840
a lot of these tools and some of the

568
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,799
tools to run the process

569
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:01,760
are

570
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,520
already loaded for you so you don't have

571
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,960
to worry with all the install in the

572
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,520
documentation you can go right into

573
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:10,000
using them

574
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,480
so

575
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:15,679
what are the most difficult

576
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:19,679
threats to emulate is ransomware how do

577
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:20,480
i

578
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,080
encrypt some you know use something

579
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,840
that's doing encryption which is

580
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,240
fundamentally destructive or disruptive

581
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:29,120
to operations right i

582
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,360
don't want to affect actual operations

583
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,039
because that's going to get the business

584
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:35,520
upset so in terms of being realistic how

585
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:38,400
do i do this well there's two ways

586
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,640
one is creating dummy data

587
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,200
and i can have a script as a part of my

588
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,440
test that's going to generate hidden

589
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,440
dummy data and then use local encryption

590
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,080
to do that so i've got host activity i

591
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,559
can tie that to c2 for network activity

592
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:55,840
and that would be you know a very simple

593
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,559
but effective ransomware campaign

594
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:00,080
if i want to be more realistic and this

595
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,679
ties more on the network side and

596
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:03,679
potentially looking at data loss

597
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:04,720
prevention

598
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,280
there's a website that i found called

599
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:09,120
macaroo.com and you can go in and have

600
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,200
it

601
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,600
uh procedurally generate

602
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,760
data based on like names

603
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:18,480
uh social security date of birth credit

604
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,679
card

605
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:21,120
because a lot of folks aren't

606
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,960
comfortable with exfiltrating the real

607
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,840
thing and that can need more buy-in but

608
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:29,840
doing the fake thing well there we go

609
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,640
um so we talked about starting simple so

610
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,640
here is an example of what i would say

611
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,799
is some considerations for starting

612
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:39,679
really simple first is getting user

613
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:42,799
execution through run dll32 so i'm using

614
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:45,520
a living off the lan binary and script

615
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:48,159
law bas so those are binaries and

616
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:49,919
scripts that are already in your

617
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:51,520
environment because they're a part of

618
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:54,240
say like the microsoft operating system

619
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,760
i want to be able to establish command

620
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,280
and control because i want to do two

621
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:00,080
things here one i want to get used uh

622
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,760
used to looking at not just host

623
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,840
activity or network activity but looking

624
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,440
at them both together because that's a

625
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,520
key maturity level for

626
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,679
detection and response and i want to be

627
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:12,240
able to specifically look at the tools

628
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,840
at the network level because that's

629
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,200
where the attacker can drive what's

630
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,440
happening as well as whereas well

631
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:20,480
exfiltration is happening

632
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,480
running a very simple command also like

633
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,360
a law base of who am i um from command

634
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,520
line this is a standard procedure that

635
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:28,640
you would see

636
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,480
as and it and something that's really

637
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,640
simple but it's great because it's all

638
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,200
about context uh

639
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,520
who am i it's already there it's not

640
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,840
malicious by itself but it's the kind of

641
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:42,640
thing that the average user would not

642
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:45,039
run and so it's a really good way of

643
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:47,279
something that's simple to be able to

644
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:49,520
start to focus on building from and then

645
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,440
of course um powershell because

646
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,440
powershell is just such a powerful tool

647
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,520
set part of what we're trying to do here

648
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:58,240
is by focusing on powershell this is

649
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,320
like the more powerful version of like

650
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,000
who am i is doing this thing powershell

651
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,440
has this much flexibility and um it's

652
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,320
it's just such a natural target for uh

653
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,440
attackers

654
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,039
and it's also something very simple

655
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:13,480
where the minimum taking away

656
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:15,919
powershell.exe and then starting to get

657
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:17,840
into the more sophisticated obfuscation

658
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,440
techniques

659
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,960
that's where we want to push them where

660
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:24,000
it's a moral costly maneuver for the

661
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,640
attacker over time

662
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,799
um catching it is really simple for that

663
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:30,400
exercise

664
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:33,520
in this case running uh sysmond sysmon

665
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:36,799
is a free driver that microsoft offers

666
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:39,360
so it works natively with uh microsoft

667
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,919
windows uh they now just released a

668
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:44,000
version a couple of months ago for linux

669
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,760
and in this instance right from a

670
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,520
detection engineering the very simple

671
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:50,400
baseline of visibility um

672
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:53,120
event id1 process creation looking for

673
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:56,640
executables with run dll32 who am i and

674
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,720
then starting to tailor that down to

675
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,760
make sure that uh you know it's working

676
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,600
in our environment the way we want it to

677
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,080
so that we're not just driving uh false

678
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:08,000
positives because any time that run

679
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,799
dll32 gets caught um gets run would be

680
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:12,960
too much for example

681
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,880
all right uh we talked about living off

682
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,039
the land binaries and scripts uh this is

683
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:19,440
a great consideration to also uh think

684
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:23,039
about uh this research is from olaf in

685
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:26,080
uh november and talking just about what

686
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:29,679
he saw from ransomware campaigns and uh

687
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:31,440
the percentages of lol bass that was

688
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,520
used in those so a great consideration

689
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,279
as well

690
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:37,760
so back to working with other zookeepers

691
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,840
right we talked about security champions

692
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:42,080
as a part of managing sideways security

693
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:45,520
champions are folks outside of security

694
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,760
in different functional areas like human

695
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,640
resources like finance like a business

696
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,760
operation

697
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:54,240
and the idea here is that having folks

698
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:58,400
that are organic to those areas that are

699
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,919
a little more trained have a little more

700
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:01,679
access that you've established a race

701
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:04,000
relationship with is a win-win for both

702
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,919
sides right from that functional area's

703
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:07,440
perspective they're going to get better

704
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,039
support they're going to have somebody

705
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:10,559
that's there that just knows a little

706
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:12,240
bit more they can answer some of those

707
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:15,120
questions without having to go up to

708
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,919
a help desk and from yours you now have

709
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:20,400
somebody who is advancing the issues of

710
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:23,360
security and training on their own

711
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,200
so it's like working with different

712
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,640
animals but

713
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,799
right so this is following the the

714
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:32,640
zookeeper the village um metaphor

715
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:35,440
they can speak that language to their

716
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,520
own folks and bring those different

717
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:40,960
kinds of animals to your herd

718
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,400
the link for this one for a lot more

719
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:46,000
detail is she hacked purple tanya jenka

720
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,720
who has a lot of information on building

721
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:52,159
out security champion programs

722
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:54,720
but how do we recruit these folks well

723
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:57,039
starts with engagement we don't just

724
00:26:57,039 --> 00:26:58,799
want to tell somebody hey you're a

725
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:01,120
champion we want folks to volunteer for

726
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,039
this and so the way to do this is

727
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:04,880
setting up you know maybe lunch and

728
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,720
learns or different kinds of training

729
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,960
and inviting these folks and seeing who

730
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,200
participates seeing who's engaged and

731
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,240
interested

732
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,320
and approaching them and offering them

733
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,000
this opportunity and that's the key

734
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,080
right this is an opportunity this is not

735
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:20,159
just another duty that's going to drag

736
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:22,480
them down but a lot of folks this is a

737
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,399
chance to learn something that they

738
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:27,760
wouldn't normally get exposed to

739
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:30,159
and so part of that now is with this

740
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:32,320
program we have to set expectations what

741
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,480
are the expectations for both sides and

742
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:38,399
how do we make it worthwhile for them

743
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:40,880
all right so we've got all these plans

744
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,799
together how do we make the trump

745
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:44,960
putting noises right we learned how to

746
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,720
make fire we learned how to make change

747
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:49,760
aligns with business now how do we like

748
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:52,480
celebrate this well i think the biggest

749
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,559
key is for that initial adversary

750
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:57,360
emulation plan consider the crown jewel

751
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,840
assets and yes i made that up the idea

752
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:02,880
is what are the most important parts

753
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,640
from the businesses perspective and

754
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,320
let's start there

755
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:07,760
everything else might be on fire but

756
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:10,000
we've circled the wagons here we know

757
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,320
what this part looks like and by the way

758
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,760
that's the part the business cares the

759
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:16,240
most about so our threat model is

760
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,720
aligned to that as well as what we're

761
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,080
going to be testing

762
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:23,600
make sure to celebrate the wins

763
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,760
for a purple team what the red did what

764
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,679
the blue did all the different

765
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:28,960
participants

766
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:31,360
celebrate what was accomplished and show

767
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,520
the improvement over time

768
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,600
of the process

769
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,279
part of the output of the purple team

770
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:39,679
will be specific improvements showing

771
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:41,919
how those improvements are increasing

772
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:43,440
your detection your response your

773
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,600
remediation over time and make sure to

774
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:48,320
put those results in business terms that

775
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:50,399
make sense to the business the output

776
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:53,840
should not be a list of user ids of

777
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:56,880
asset ids it should be what were the

778
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:59,360
business impacts that were improved from

779
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,600
this

780
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:04,080
so what do execs

781
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:07,200
sorry elephants love more than anything

782
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,880
metrics so what kind of metrics do we

783
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,640
care about well in the beginning we're

784
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:13,600
going to be focused on visibility tied

785
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,399
to

786
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:17,200
business impact so what can i see at the

787
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,320
host level

788
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:20,799
what is getting aggregated at a

789
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:23,120
centralized logging like a sim

790
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:26,000
what kind of alerts are generated and

791
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,799
the improvement in the fidelity of those

792
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:32,159
alerts and then starting to measure time

793
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:34,559
into that process so the first part is

794
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:35,919
what can i see

795
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:37,679
the second then is going to be what's my

796
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:39,919
ability to respond sure the tools are

797
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:42,640
capturing this but how quickly are we

798
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,159
able to

799
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:46,000
respond to them right how fast is the

800
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,559
sock able to identify something that's a

801
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:51,840
problem understand the scope and then

802
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:54,159
get it out because that is the ability

803
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:55,600
to over time

804
00:29:55,600 --> 00:30:00,320
reduce the impact of a breach

805
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:01,840
so

806
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,520
how do we go on an expedition together

807
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:06,640
well the easiest is of course

808
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:09,440
i'm short of doing all that through full

809
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,520
technical execution is we can do a

810
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:14,159
tabletop exercise

811
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:16,159
and that's us right we get some folks

812
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:18,480
around the table or some pizza and talk

813
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,799
through it um some

814
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:22,559
considerations are

815
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:25,360
bringing in other cross-functional areas

816
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:27,360
um and making sure you have the

817
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:30,240
executive sponsorship that can get you a

818
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,000
broader reach of people taking it

819
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,480
seriously um it could be simple things

820
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,480
like just a lunch and learn talking

821
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,159
through a latest attack that you read

822
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:40,000
about and describing about what those

823
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,760
impacts might be

824
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,919
choose your own adventure is an idea i

825
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:46,080
came up with a couple of years ago where

826
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,039
i

827
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:47,919
built

828
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:50,080
a custom choose your own adventure of an

829
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:52,880
incident and so this has been really

830
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,880
good to generate conversation not just

831
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:58,240
for experts but also for the lay person

832
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,840
if you think about it

833
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,840
it's intimidating to come into this

834
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,919
field if you don't really know much

835
00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:06,240
about it and that is a barrier to us

836
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,519
being able to communicate and bring

837
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:08,720
these folks in

838
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:11,840
a choose your own adventure is a in you

839
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,200
know put your hands inside the roller

840
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,880
coaster and there you know there are no

841
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,559
real wrong answers you don't have to

842
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:19,039
really guess um and so driving that

843
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:21,919
conversation through very specific

844
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:24,399
choices makes it easy um and then this

845
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:26,080
other idea if you're doing the full

846
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:28,240
purple team that i thought of is purple

847
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,360
team plus

848
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:31,279
so traditional purple team we're just

849
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:33,840
bringing folks inside security blue and

850
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:36,159
red together to do this well why not

851
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:38,000
bring other folks why not have folks

852
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,159
from i.t why not have folks from the

853
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:41,919
particular business operation that

854
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:42,880
you're

855
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:46,480
assessing what the impacts might be um

856
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,480
yeah they might not be full-fledged

857
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,720
participants but even just getting to

858
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:53,120
spectate could be a really interesting

859
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:53,919
and

860
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:57,279
good learning exercise for them

861
00:31:57,279 --> 00:31:58,240
so

862
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:00,559
the end of the day security is a fight

863
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:02,000
against the juggle

864
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,480
um always looking for more money right

865
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,320
trying to influence those priorities and

866
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:07,519
making sure that we're getting the

867
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:09,600
investments that we need to be able to

868
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,799
continue this program to ensure that the

869
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:16,399
business aka the herd stays safe

870
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:19,039
uh the inspiration for this talk uh came

871
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:22,399
from a book a number of years ago where

872
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:24,559
i was having challenges with my boss and

873
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:26,840
it's called throwing the

874
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:30,320
elephant um some resources i think my

875
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:31,600
slides will be shared so you'll be able

876
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,919
to get some more detail from these

877
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:34,880
and

878
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:39,880
i'll be here for any questions thank you

879
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,519
you
