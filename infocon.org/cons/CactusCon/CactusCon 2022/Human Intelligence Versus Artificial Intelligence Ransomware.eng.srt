1
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:07,279
hello happy saturday uh welcome to

2
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:09,120
human intelligence versus artificial

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,280
intelligence uh as it relates to

4
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,519
ransomware i hope you're enjoying cactus

5
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:16,560
con 2022 thus far and i really

6
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,240
appreciate you taking the time to join

7
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,119
my presentation today

8
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:23,279
let's get started with the agenda so i'm

9
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:24,560
going to start with a quick introduction

10
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,800
who i am why i'm in front of you and why

11
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,519
why i do this uh

12
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:31,920
and involved with uh ransomware

13
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,280
negotiations and cyber threat

14
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,200
intelligence i want to get a little bit

15
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,840
into the conversation about artificial

16
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,120
intelligence

17
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,680
versus human intelligence but really

18
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:44,160
expand that into our understanding of

19
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,680
artificial intelligence and human

20
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,360
intelligence how they both

21
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,160
can disrupt ransomware attacks

22
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,160
i want to get into the ransomware

23
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,680
incident cycle discuss a little bit

24
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,079
about the individual phases

25
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:58,879
relevant phases of the ransomware

26
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:01,440
incident site lifecycle as it pertains

27
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,960
to this conversation of artificial

28
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,360
intelligence and human intelligence and

29
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,040
then really dive in the meat of the

30
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,080
conversation on negotiations how they

31
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:10,880
work

32
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,040
why human intelligence is important in

33
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,439
those discussions

34
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:17,439
and in the different ways that humans

35
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:19,600
are involved and the the

36
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,680
beneficial sides of having a

37
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,600
professional negotiator experienced

38
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,600
negotiator at the table

39
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,880
as victims are having these

40
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,600
conversations

41
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,040
so again thanks for joining today uh my

42
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,960
name is bryce webster jacobson i'm the

43
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,040
director of intelligence operations at

44
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,159
group sense uh cyber threat intelligence

45
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:41,280
company

46
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,680
based out of arlington virginia

47
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,960
um

48
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,040
my background is actually in psychology

49
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,320
sociology and transnational threats i

50
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,280
was

51
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,399
long interested in the role of non-state

52
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:56,159
actors as it pertains to national

53
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:00,079
security but also more broadly diplomacy

54
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:02,640
and international relations

55
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,799
i've been really interested

56
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:05,840
since

57
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,399
the early days of my education in why

58
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:11,280
groups form how groups form motivations

59
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,400
of groups

60
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,160
and the roles that individuals play in

61
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,360
those larger

62
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,080
larger organizations and groups

63
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,280
prior to working in cyber thought

64
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,200
intelligence i actually worked in higher

65
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,720
education in international higher

66
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,400
education

67
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,760
so i've transitioned uh slowly from

68
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,920
education and working in

69
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,080
roles in international higher education

70
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,080
into cyber threat intelligence

71
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,760
and there are a lot of there's a lot of

72
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,920
overlap between those two industries i'm

73
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,760
happy to happy to answer questions about

74
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,920
that later and my transition into my

75
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,920
current role um

76
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,480
but uh we're very fortunate to be given

77
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,360
a chance at group sense to to lead our

78
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,120
managed security intelligence center and

79
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,959
work with our research team and our

80
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:54,959
analyst team to produce to finish uh

81
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:57,760
finnish cyber threat intelligence

82
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,720
deliverables for our clients um at group

83
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,519
sense in addition to leading our managed

84
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:05,120
security intelligence center i am also

85
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,360
one of our lead negotiators

86
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,720
i've taken on

87
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,519
many ransomware negotiation cases

88
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:14,000
worked with victims

89
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,599
ranging from

90
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,920
small family businesses of less than 10

91
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,200
employees

92
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:23,440
to big multinational corporations

93
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,640
have

94
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,720
demands initial ransom demands in the

95
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,319
tens of thousands

96
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:30,560
up to tens of millions

97
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,120
so happy to talk again during the q a

98
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:38,000
process about uh the the range of of um

99
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,440
of the initial demands that we've seen

100
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,599
but also kind of the range of victims

101
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:43,519
and and uh different negotiations that

102
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:45,599
i've uh that i've worked on and i will

103
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:47,280
be peppering in some of those stories

104
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,120
throughout the conversation today

105
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,560
all right so let's get started with the

106
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,080
short conversation uh about

107
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,720
the intersections between artificial

108
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,480
intelligence and human intelligence i

109
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:06,480
think there's often the conversation uh

110
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,640
about artificial intelligence versus

111
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,959
human intelligence and why

112
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,959
uh one is better than the other but they

113
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:15,360
really both play a role in effective

114
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,918
cyber threat intelligence um

115
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:20,639
and and really as as we think more

116
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,960
more specifically in addressing

117
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,880
ransomware both the attacks and the

118
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,400
prevention of attacks the recovery from

119
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,440
an attack and the prevention of attack

120
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,880
each of each

121
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,680
each artificial intelligence and human

122
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,759
intelligence have their own pros and

123
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:39,520
cons at various phases of the uh attack

124
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,240
life cycle and and in in the prevention

125
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,000
of an attack so i'll try to get into a

126
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,800
little bit of that here uh as we as we

127
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,759
talk

128
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:49,360
um

129
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,240
human and artificial intelligence is the

130
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,840
most powerful combination to combat

131
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,479
ransomware

132
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:59,600
you can combine the automated uh

133
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,360
automated threat detection and

134
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,840
mitigation with uh

135
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:04,720
with

136
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,960
smart effective humans who are there to

137
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,280
bookend each end of the

138
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,479
intelligence life cycle so um it's it's

139
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:15,360
it's been proven that uh ai has a very

140
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,960
important role in

141
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,280
mitigating threats or detecting threats

142
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,280
on uh on a network potential potential

143
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,960
indicators of compromise or the

144
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:27,759
command and control servers that are

145
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:30,639
being pinged off of a network or

146
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:34,320
suspicious amounts of traffic

147
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,400
that can be done much quicker but

148
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,720
through artificial intelligence than um

149
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,360
then maybe a human could but there's

150
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,440
still an important role that humans play

151
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,960
in

152
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:49,599
feeding those the automated tools and

153
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:51,600
training the and tuning the automated

154
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,199
tools but also evaluating the

155
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:54,560
information and the effectiveness of

156
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,160
those tools

157
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,000
and one reason particularly as we talk

158
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,720
about ransomware that we

159
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,880
it's important to

160
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,880
it's important to use both human and

161
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,280
artificial intelligence is that human

162
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,360
behavior plays an important role on both

163
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,720
ends of the ransomware attack and what i

164
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,160
mean by both ends of the ransomware

165
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,400
attack both the

166
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,360
um

167
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,360
the individual conducting a ransomware

168
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,400
attack

169
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,400
you know a cyber threat actor who

170
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,240
is part of a

171
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,479
ransomware operation maybe it's a cyber

172
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:26,400
threat actor that has purchased a

173
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,120
ransomware kit and is operating um kind

174
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,160
of this

175
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:34,160
low dollar low low sophistication

176
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,960
malware kit that they're able to

177
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,479
hit a few targets with and make a few

178
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:41,039
dollars but also if we think about some

179
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:42,639
of the

180
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:44,560
most common entry vectors for ransomware

181
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,240
attacks being phishing campaigns and

182
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,240
credential reuse and

183
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,319
these are behaviors that

184
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:53,599
unfortunately

185
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:56,560
humans within our organization um have

186
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,759
have a role in uh in allowing to happen

187
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:02,319
so if that's a somebody who's more

188
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:04,080
susceptible to social engineering or

189
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,280
somebody who

190
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,039
hasn't maybe followed their fishing

191
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:08,960
training um

192
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,919
you know we we do we can't

193
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:14,800
completely separate humans from uh from

194
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,880
the uh from ransomware attacks

195
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:22,240
so i wanted to dive into the life cycle

196
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,880
of a ransomware incident a little bit um

197
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,639
so this is a really

198
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:27,840
great

199
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,280
infographic

200
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,000
from new zealand cert

201
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,840
and so i've credited them them they're

202
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,919
down below but i'll also throw the link

203
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:36,800
to this

204
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,800
they have a longer form blog piece on

205
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,759
this

206
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:42,160
on this infographic i'll throw that link

207
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:42,960
in the

208
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,400
the discord chat

209
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:48,000
um but we we start with initial access

210
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,240
and you can see a few different types of

211
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,800
initial access here um and and the flow

212
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,680
through so uh obviously there's

213
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,639
phishing campaigns and um

214
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:00,400
and password guessing or credential

215
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,680
reuse those are some of the

216
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,479
more commonly understood uh

217
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:09,280
entry vectors for a ransomware attack

218
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,199
but i want to point your attention to

219
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,599
exploit vulnerabilities the third circle

220
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:15,919
on the left side third circle down on

221
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:19,039
the left side so um oftentimes what we

222
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:21,440
see in dark web marketplaces is

223
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,160
threat actors who are selling access to

224
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,319
a company

225
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:29,520
whether that be admin access or

226
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,080
or standard user access to a certain

227
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,760
system where they either ex

228
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,240
gain those gain that access using stolen

229
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,399
credentials or they've exploited a

230
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:42,640
vulnerability and then that initial

231
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,839
access is uh purchased by a ransomware

232
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:47,360
operator

233
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,760
or given to a ransomware operator

234
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,320
to for that ransomware operator then

235
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,040
conduct a ransomware attack against a

236
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,040
business so i want you to hold on to the

237
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,680
thought about initial access

238
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,360
because it will it'll come up in a

239
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,640
little bit

240
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,959
and then i want to move to the the end

241
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:07,519
of the

242
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:09,440
the other side of this infographic the

243
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,200
impact on the target data exfiltration

244
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,720
and destroying backups and encrypting

245
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,800
data those are often kind of the the end

246
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,800
goal or what we see some combination of

247
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,000
those three

248
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,920
uh activities is what we see ransomware

249
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,760
operators uh do

250
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:22,560
so

251
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,160
um

252
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,800
human intelligence plays a role in on

253
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,480
both ends of this of this life cycle but

254
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,200
it's impossible to ignore the benefits

255
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,360
of artificial intelligence in detecting

256
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,399
some of the uh activities in the middle

257
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:41,760
of the uh of the

258
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,920
of the chart that we're seeing here the

259
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,480
consolidation and preparation phases so

260
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,160
detecting lateral movement detecting

261
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,600
privileged

262
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,519
escalation detecting the command and

263
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:53,680
control uh servers that are used by

264
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,200
those groups so

265
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,120
again this is not supposed to be an

266
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,120
argument on

267
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,720
artificial intelligence versus human

268
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,800
intelligence rather focusing on the role

269
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,040
that human intelligence plays in this

270
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,800
in the in the entire life cycle of a

271
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,560
ransomware incident

272
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,120
what this chart doesn't

273
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:14,800
cover is what happens after uh data x

274
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,480
filtration backups are destroyed in

275
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,200
encrypted data once the ransomware

276
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,360
operator drops the ransom note on the

277
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,240
victims network what happens next often

278
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,240
that's when somebody like myself or

279
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,560
other ransomware negotiators will get

280
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,600
pulled into the conversations with uh

281
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,959
the stakeholders at the victim site

282
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:38,560
to figure out what are the options

283
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,480
what would be the best course of action

284
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,440
to

285
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:45,120
recover that data or decrypt that data

286
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,680
and prevent the release of any data that

287
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,160
was that was exfiltrated

288
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:53,120
and that's one element and often kind of

289
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,640
the biggest element of the ransomware

290
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,480
incident life cycle

291
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,200
that is most difficult to automate

292
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,720
so we'll talk about a few strategies for

293
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,760
that

294
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,279
in a minute

295
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:06,079
but i want to talk about initial access

296
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:08,000
the benefits of artificial intelligence

297
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,399
and human intelligence in addressing

298
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:13,680
this phase of a ransomware attack

299
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,839
it is possible using ai to automate

300
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,680
detection of dark web offers that could

301
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,920
be affecting your organization

302
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,240
or organizations that you're

303
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,000
responsible for

304
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,480
whether that be keyword searches whether

305
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,880
that be

306
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,560
detections of

307
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,640
automated detection of pocs available in

308
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,480
the dark web uh

309
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,560
related to specific exploits that you

310
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,200
you may or may not be vulnerable to

311
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,880
there are a few different ways that you

312
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,040
can use artificial intelligence to

313
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,200
detect those offers on the dark web and

314
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,680
then be alerted to them and

315
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,320
within your environment and go through a

316
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,880
process of either remediating that that

317
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,600
access or um

318
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,920
or or checking to see if it's a part of

319
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,399
uh or if it's actually you know relevant

320
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:02,800
to your number there are even some ways

321
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:06,800
that when cyber threat actors are

322
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,959
trying to conceal the victim that they

323
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:11,839
are offering initial access to maybe

324
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:13,360
they don't want to name the victim maybe

325
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,519
they're not going to say

326
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:17,920
i have access to walmart and i'm not

327
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,760
using walmart in any particular reason

328
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,399
just first large

329
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,320
say i have organizat to a

330
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,760
large national retail uh big box store

331
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,399
worth x number of billions of dollars

332
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:35,279
headquartered in arkansas um and and

333
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:37,760
often they're using descriptions and

334
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,000
revenue figures or employee accounts to

335
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,399
describe the scope of the victim

336
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:44,480
the scale of the victim that they have

337
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,920
to entice a buyer to purchase that

338
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,680
initial access

339
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,600
they're using tools that are common

340
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,600
business intelligence tools that we you

341
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,279
know that you or

342
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:55,680
or i or our sales teams may have access

343
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,920
to uh when they're when they're reaching

344
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,279
out to uh

345
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,920
to prospective uh customers

346
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,600
and there are ways that you can even use

347
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,360
artificial intelligence to automate some

348
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,000
element elements of investigating those

349
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,120
uh more concealed initial offers

350
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,920
comparing data points on like zoom info

351
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,320
person for example with data points that

352
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,399
are offered by a threat actor and i've

353
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:20,639
seen some pretty sophisticated um

354
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:23,519
sophisticated tools and uh individuals

355
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:27,120
who are doing that um but you still need

356
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,519
the human element to actually

357
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:31,440
engage with those offers engage with the

358
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,760
threat actors that are offering those uh

359
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,000
that access to determine that

360
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,360
you're

361
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,560
that you are narrowing down the initial

362
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,399
access to the right victim and that it

363
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:44,959
is representing your company um

364
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:46,079
and that

365
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:48,000
the ability to engage with a threat

366
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,279
actor

367
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:53,120
is is pretty difficult it requires a

368
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,519
a solid set of skills in um

369
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:57,040
understanding the language that the

370
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,880
threat actors are using both

371
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,560
whether that be you know russian

372
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,480
language but also

373
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,160
some of the slang that is

374
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,399
that is used commonly on the forums

375
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:08,160
it involves having accounts that have a

376
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:11,120
reputation that would not be suspicious

377
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,959
to the threat actor

378
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:15,519
it also is necessary to vet the access

379
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:18,320
that the threat hacker claims they have

380
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,000
it's not uncommon for threat actors to

381
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,480
scam other potential threat actors

382
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,079
and claim they have access to a network

383
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:26,320
that they don't truly have access to

384
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,839
or

385
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:29,600
to you know claim they have a data set

386
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,600
that is publicly available or something

387
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,800
like this so

388
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,480
it does take again

389
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,079
at the other end of that conversation

390
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:38,000
another another um some human

391
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,199
intelligence to be able to vet the um

392
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:42,560
the claims that the threat actor is

393
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:45,120
making but also to

394
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,480
convince a threat actor to to

395
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,240
to engage with you so

396
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,320
there is that human element in assessing

397
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:56,000
the initial access as well

398
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,680
so let's let's move on to to ransom

399
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,120
negotiations

400
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,600
the meat of the conversation so

401
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,959
again we've talked a little bit about

402
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:05,680
the first phase of the uh ransomware

403
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,519
incident life cycle

404
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:10,160
the initial access as you were if you

405
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,519
recall the diagram of the

406
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:14,880
ransomware incident life cycle that i

407
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:18,959
shared earlier from new zealand sir was

408
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:21,279
three outcomes of a ransomware attack

409
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:22,880
data exfiltration

410
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,120
encryption of data and destruction of

411
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,839
backups

412
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:29,680
ransomware groups will or the ransomware

413
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,320
operator will then drop a note on the uh

414
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,000
the victims network

415
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,199
and that spins up obviously a massive

416
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:39,199
incident response

417
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:41,680
effort that can involve

418
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:45,199
cso's director of its ceos boards

419
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:48,320
outside council privacy lawyers

420
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,560
insurance companies incident response

421
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,519
folks

422
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:53,839
there can be many many individuals

423
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:56,079
involved in each process of it and we

424
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:58,000
have specialized roles in

425
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,279
specialized individuals that come out

426
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:02,240
and help with their individual

427
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,399
their individual area of responsibility

428
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:06,880
in responding to a ransomware incident

429
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,959
same goes for the actual conducting the

430
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:12,160
actual negotiation itself

431
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,800
and this is really where uh human

432
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,600
outshines artificial intelligence

433
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,680
now again i'm not saying there's no role

434
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,000
for artificial intelligence in the

435
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,800
actual conducting of negotiations

436
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,240
or developing a strategy around

437
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,680
negotiations

438
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:30,480
but the primary focus should be on

439
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:34,160
bringing in outside experts to

440
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,399
to lead that negotiation and advise on

441
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:40,240
negotiations uh to to assist the victim

442
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,000
with achieving the best outcomes that

443
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,800
they possibly can uh in this uh

444
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,759
in this through this difficult incident

445
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:48,639
so

446
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,480
uh the benefits of

447
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:54,000
of human in a ransom negotiation are are

448
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
varied um and there are numerous

449
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,800
benefits but uh it it really depends on

450
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,800
each on the specific negotiation the

451
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,320
specific circumstances around a

452
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,119
negotiation

453
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:07,760
no two negotiations have been the same

454
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,000
in the in the dozens and dozens that

455
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,880
i've worked on um even when negotiating

456
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,799
with the same ransom group that we've

457
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:16,720
negotiated i've negotiated with in the

458
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,319
past

459
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:20,480
the circumstances change and those

460
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,720
circumstances or variables are

461
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,000
everything from

462
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:24,959
the

463
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:27,599
size of the organization that you're

464
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:29,520
representing so again as i mentioned

465
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,120
before i've represented very small

466
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,720
companies very small family businesses

467
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:36,000
to large multinational organizations

468
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,200
the

469
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,880
another major variable is insurance

470
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,760
coverage if the victim has insurance

471
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,440
cyber threat insurance or

472
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,360
cyber incident insurance

473
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,520
that is often one pool of money that can

474
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,080
be used to pay a ransom um

475
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:50,799
the

476
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:52,880
even the um

477
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,039
the the disposition of the ransomware

478
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:57,360
group you catch somebody on a bad day

479
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,600
and we'll talk a little bit about that

480
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,559
a little bit later

481
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,200
but so each each random negotiation does

482
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,880
have its own set of variables that need

483
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,559
to be considered when involved or when

484
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,640
creating the strategy and moving through

485
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:15,440
the the actual negotiation itself

486
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,440
unfortunately one misconception that we

487
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,520
run into all the time when onboarding

488
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,480
victims

489
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,039
for ransomware negotiation

490
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:25,679
is a

491
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,919
misconception about how long a

492
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:31,120
negotiation actually will take um it's

493
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,679
not like the movies it's not like some

494
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:36,240
uh simulations we've seen

495
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,520
you know where it's going to be settled

496
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:40,480
in 24 to 48 hours often times when we're

497
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,679
working with all of the different

498
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:43,360
stakeholders that need to be involved in

499
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:46,080
a complex negotiation we aren't even

500
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,400
able to engage with the ransomware group

501
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,520
until you know 48 hours 72 hours

502
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,360
sometimes after the

503
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:56,160
initial detection of the incident

504
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,919
and that's because you know a lawyer's

505
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:59,840
got to come in or the ceo has got to

506
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,080
come in or you know we're investigating

507
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,559
who's actually behind it uh the incident

508
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:05,520
response

509
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,880
incident response folks are trying to

510
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,400
quickly assess the

511
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,039
the damage associated with the attack so

512
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:12,720
it can be many days before you even

513
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,280
start the negotiation um

514
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:19,039
we all often see our negotiations

515
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:22,320
conclude within seven to 14 days so this

516
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:25,360
can be an extended uh an extended

517
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,440
incident and

518
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:31,120
so it requires a a set of individuals

519
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,320
that are

520
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,679
willing to

521
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:36,880
adjust the strategy on the fly and um

522
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,840
assess at each moment what would be the

523
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,240
best next step forward to achieve the

524
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,720
desired outcomes

525
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,720
that's often what i spend most of my

526
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,559
time doing over those two weeks is

527
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:50,559
actually reevaluating outcomes or

528
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:52,400
reevaluating new information and

529
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,640
reassessing desired outcomes with the

530
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,720
victims so

531
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,240
um

532
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,240
again you know some of the benefits of

533
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,200
of

534
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,039
human human intelligence and ransomware

535
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:04,720
negotiations is that familiarity with

536
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,880
ransom groups ransomware groups are

537
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,760
evolving splitting uh

538
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,440
um

539
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:15,520
they're they're splitting they are uh

540
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:18,480
maybe they're rebranding um and so being

541
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,200
able to keep

542
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,039
keep a mental rolodex of the different

543
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:24,400
ransomware groups and and the

544
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,400
motivations that they they may have as

545
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,080
you're as you're negotiating with them

546
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,720
is is super important um

547
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,520
again we've we've negotiated dozens and

548
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:36,080
dozens of cases as a firm i've even been

549
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,159
in the position of negotiating

550
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:39,840
with the same group on behalf of two

551
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,919
different victims at the same time and

552
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:44,559
so having that familiarity with um

553
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:46,799
understanding the next step that this

554
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:49,360
ransom group is a lot is likely to take

555
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:52,799
um is invaluable to um invaluable to the

556
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:55,360
process um understanding the structures

557
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,200
of the organizations as i mentioned

558
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,559
before

559
00:20:58,559 --> 00:20:59,919
one of the reasons that i got into this

560
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:02,640
is a familiarity with and a desire to

561
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,480
study non-state groups some of these

562
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,919
ransomware operators particularly the

563
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:07,679
more sophisticated ones

564
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:09,520
run like a business operate like a

565
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:12,559
business and so having the ability to

566
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:13,840
having ability to understand the

567
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,039
structure of the group that you're

568
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:16,799
working with and communicate that back

569
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:20,080
to the victim can inform

570
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,760
can lead to a more informed

571
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:24,000
well-informed strategy when

572
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,159
conducting the negotiation

573
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:28,000
as i mentioned before understanding and

574
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,840
refining the negotiation principles and

575
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:32,240
strategy throughout the negotiation um

576
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,320
is uh is absolutely necessary to

577
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:37,280
achieving a a successful outcome

578
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,640
so

579
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,640
we at group sense

580
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,960
we've we've worked with

581
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,880
members from the harvard negotiation

582
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:48,240
program um and uh had some interactions

583
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:51,200
with uh with fbi negotiators on on some

584
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,960
of our ransom cases and tried to

585
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,039
try to leverage some of the best uh best

586
00:21:57,039 --> 00:21:59,039
practices and negotiation principles

587
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:00,880
from from other other cases but have

588
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,720
evolved them from

589
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,960
have evolved them to

590
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,960
the context of

591
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,559
cyber incidents

592
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:10,159
we we have

593
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:12,960
negotiated with um initial access

594
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:16,320
brokers so we do have some experience

595
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,960
some rich experience uh

596
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,960
communicating with cyber threat actors

597
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:23,200
and and that has carried over well to

598
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,640
our ability to conduct ransom

599
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,880
negotiations on behalf of

600
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,000
victims

601
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,600
but it's also important to evolve as i

602
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,880
mentioned before to

603
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,480
refine and evolve the strategy

604
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:35,360
throughout the complex negotiation

605
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,760
a victim's motivations may change

606
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,600
throughout the negotiation and that may

607
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,960
change because of a some some sort of

608
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,840
external pressure from clients uh it may

609
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:49,039
change because of a a win by the

610
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:50,080
um

611
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,360
by the ir

612
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,200
folks working on the incident that have

613
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,280
been able to actually recover or restore

614
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,360
vast majority of the data from from

615
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,640
backups

616
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:02,000
it may be a change in a change in part

617
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:02,960
on

618
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,440
willingness to pay a ransom we've worked

619
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,120
with victims that

620
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,280
from the first call said no way not

621
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:12,159
going to pay these guys a dollar

622
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:13,679
we still want to engage with them to try

623
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:16,559
to understand what they have assess the

624
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:18,240
assess what type of data they would be

625
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,840
willing to release

626
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:22,559
and then as it gets closer to

627
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:23,600
uh

628
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:26,640
the the the actual uh kind of countdown

629
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,640
clock that uh the negotiator or the

630
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:31,600
ransom operator has put on the incident

631
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,200
there may be a change of heart from from

632
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,960
leadership or the key stakeholders at

633
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:37,120
the organization as they realize you

634
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,360
know there's not another

635
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,799
in this circumstance there's no other

636
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:42,880
path forward without uh sending some

637
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,960
sort of payment to the ransomware

638
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,039
operators unfortunately so

639
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:49,039
being able to understand understand and

640
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:50,400
refine the strategy

641
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,000
throughout the life cycle of the

642
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,760
incident

643
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:57,279
is is absolutely necessary

644
00:23:57,279 --> 00:23:59,279
there's also

645
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:01,440
a lot of human intelligence that goes

646
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,240
into evaluating the risks associated

647
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,200
with the potential outcomes of the

648
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:08,240
negotiation so um

649
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,400
if there is a negotiation that's going

650
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,320
to break down uh that started

651
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,159
successfully but eventually breaks down

652
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:15,440
and

653
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,120
the ransomware operator and the victim

654
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,480
are not able to

655
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,320
uh

656
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,919
to find a

657
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:25,120
a shared desirable price then that can

658
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:26,880
have a different outcome than if a

659
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,400
ransomware victim

660
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,840
and potentially more negative outcome if

661
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,279
the ransomware victim just didn't engage

662
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:33,679
with the threat actor at all um you know

663
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:35,200
there there is

664
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,360
we've had experiences where

665
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,120
ransomware victims have chosen to walk

666
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,360
away from the table um

667
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:45,120
and the ransomware operator uh

668
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,360
lack of a better term get really pissed

669
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,880
uh because they thought they were going

670
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,799
to have a payday and now and now they're

671
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:52,880
they're not going to receive any payment

672
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,880
and so the

673
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,880
their reaction their their next step the

674
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,720
ransomware operators next step could be

675
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,960
more severe than if we had just not

676
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,960
engaged

677
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,760
there are other times where

678
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:08,159
it may be necessary to pay

679
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:10,640
some amount of money to prevent the data

680
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,559
that was exfiltrated from being released

681
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:14,960
or publicized but it's not worth paying

682
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,679
any money for the uh the decryption key

683
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:19,440
that the threat actors are also offering

684
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,840
so um being able to understand the

685
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:24,480
different outcomes that

686
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,440
the different outcomes of the

687
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,520
negotiation and clearly communicate

688
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:28,640
those to

689
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:31,120
the victim and help them evaluate their

690
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:34,159
options and still be able to clearly

691
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:36,400
understand the motivations of the

692
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,840
of the threat actors

693
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,200
and

694
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,840
and and get them to agree to the desired

695
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,760
outcome of the victim

696
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:46,720
is is takes takes a delicate balance in

697
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:49,279
a special set of skills

698
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:51,120
and lastly as we've discussed before

699
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,679
humans conduct ransomware attacks um

700
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:55,120
humans more effectively respond to

701
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,279
ransomware attacks

702
00:25:57,279 --> 00:25:58,400
we've

703
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,600
spent

704
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:03,039
many days nights weekends with

705
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:04,880
communicating with victims and we've

706
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:07,440
even spent many days nights weekends

707
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,760
talking to ransomware operators as we're

708
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:12,000
conducting these negotiations and there

709
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,799
are times where

710
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:18,320
you start to break through

711
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,080
both the virtual communication barriers

712
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:22,559
but you start to break through

713
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:24,960
the difficulties of the negotiation and

714
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,880
see the human side of the of the

715
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,360
ransomware operators and this is not a

716
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,200
is not an appeal to the sympathies of

717
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,279
the ransomware operators i you know they

718
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:35,679
are they are criminal elements um you

719
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:37,520
know i'm happy to see at any time that

720
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,039
there's law enforcement action against

721
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:41,760
these groups but sometimes you have to

722
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,919
convince them that you're a person that

723
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:47,919
you are representing a business that

724
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:50,000
has been severely affected and appealed

725
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:50,799
to the

726
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:52,720
sympathies of that of that ransomware

727
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,720
operator and and sometimes you can see

728
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:55,679
them

729
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:56,880
uh

730
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,640
trying to get you to do the same thing

731
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,720
to understand your perspective

732
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,200
and that's always the most

733
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,760
difficult element of these negotiation

734
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:08,240
of ransomware negotiations to navigate

735
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,360
um

736
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,679
so having somebody who who can who can

737
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:13,760
effectively navigate that uh on your

738
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:16,400
side when uh when a ransomware incident

739
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,919
uh happens is

740
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:20,559
uh is extremely beneficial one of the

741
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:22,559
last things i want to do is show you uh

742
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:24,960
just one example of a

743
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:28,000
of a ransomware uh negotiation how it's

744
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,520
conducted this is one of the victims

745
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,120
that we worked on

746
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,559
and i like this because it shows a few

747
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:34,399
different one this demonstrates some of

748
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:35,760
the sophistication of the ransomware

749
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,360
operators that we're working with they

750
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:38,799
set up

751
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:42,880
chat windows on um on tor

752
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,480
individual

753
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,440
links

754
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,520
onion links for each victim

755
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:50,159
that has instructions on

756
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:53,600
what to do next when you find the

757
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,360
ransomware note the short about us

758
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,760
section but also this integrated chat

759
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,039
feature which

760
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:02,080
allows you to chat in real time uh with

761
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,640
the ransomware operators as if you were

762
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,720
sending a direct message or a fake book

763
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,480
a facebook message or a support message

764
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:11,279
to uh to another provider what's not

765
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:15,120
shown here is uh the top of the screen

766
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,919
which included the uh the countdown

767
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:20,320
timer on the um

768
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:21,520
until the

769
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,360
whatever threat the ransomware operators

770
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:26,000
were making uh would happen and the

771
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,240
price the actual amount that they were

772
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,520
requesting

773
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,440
and so it's a pretty

774
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,919
pretty unique feature that that threat

775
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:35,360
actors have

776
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:37,440
and and shows how sophisticated some of

777
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,440
these organizations can be

778
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,039
if you look at the actual negotiation so

779
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:43,440
the blue window is is us the uh the

780
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:46,000
victim and in this case we were not

781
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,320
representing ourselves as negotiators we

782
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,440
were representing ourselves as the

783
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,440
victim um the green uh window on the

784
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,120
left would be the uh

785
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,960
the threat actors and and in this case

786
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:57,200
we were trying to

787
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,039
appeal to the

788
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:01,919
um the humanity of the threat actors we

789
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:03,039
were

790
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:04,880
you know this was a small organization

791
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:09,200
the the ransom demand i believe was um

792
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:11,520
roughly 10 times the amount that

793
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,919
uh we had originally asked for we are we

794
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:18,320
were proposing down there the 21 946 um

795
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:21,200
this was a small family business and uh

796
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:21,919
and

797
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:23,760
that did not have cyber insurance and so

798
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:26,240
we were appealing to the uh we were

799
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,760
appealing to the

800
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,440
the sympathies of the of the threat

801
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,760
actors um

802
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,600
you know trying to use factual

803
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,039
information

804
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:36,960
you know this was an organization that

805
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:40,320
billed monthly but wasn't able to

806
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,480
what it wasn't able to

807
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,000
to do any of their accounting or billing

808
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,679
because of the ransomware attack and so

809
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:47,520
they were not able to

810
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,760
bring in any additional funds we did

811
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:52,320
talk about notifying

812
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,640
notifying law enforcement um and that

813
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,080
there were potential lawsuits coming

814
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:58,480
down the uh the pipeline for this victim

815
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:01,919
so um you know it is it is uh

816
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:04,080
a delicate conversation and and there

817
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:06,720
are times where uh you have to treat

818
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,399
these negotiations like a business

819
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:10,159
discussion and many of the ransomware

820
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:11,600
operators do

821
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:12,720
but there are other times where you have

822
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,640
to appeal to the human human side and

823
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:17,039
say hey um you know we're a small

824
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:18,480
business and it doesn't always work

825
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,399
right and having the understanding of

826
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:23,760
the different threat actors

827
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,760
will allow us to try to best craft that

828
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:28,320
strategy on behalf of the victim but um

829
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,000
there is a side where you're conducting

830
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,480
this like a normal business transaction

831
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,399
and the other side of it is where you're

832
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:38,320
you're appealing on behalf of the victim

833
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:41,520
to to the sympathies of the threat actor

834
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,679
and trying to effectively uh manage that

835
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:45,919
relationship

836
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:47,679
so appreciate you taking the time to

837
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:50,159
listen to my chat a little bit about the

838
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:51,840
role of human intelligence and

839
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,760
artificial intelligence in in addressing

840
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,520
ransomware issues

841
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,880
would be glad to answer any further

842
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,480
questions that you have

843
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,880
provide further information um in the

844
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:03,440
discord channel and again happy saturday
