it annoys us quite frequently every

10

single day but what if there was a way

11
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:31,679
that we could combat that what if there

12
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:33,520
was a way that we could develop a plan

13
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,200
to gather actionable intelligence from

14
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,800
these scammers so that we could take

15
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,719
them down through various means

16
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:40,800

together with my colleagues from arizona

18
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:43,680
state university we're here to talk

19
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,520
about our capstone research project that

20
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,440
addresses this very topic

21
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,120
so thank you all for being here today

22
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:53,038
and welcome to hacking back scammers

23
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,559
all right so up on this screen we're

24
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:56,399
going to show some statistics from the

25
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:58,239
different types of scams and the

26
00:00:58,239 --> 00:00:59,680
financial impacts that it made in

27
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,320
australia last year now as we see phone

28
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,479
scams alone were responsible for a loss

29
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:06,799
of 100 million dollars which is a very

30
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:10,080
significant amount as students our role

31
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,920
extends beyond research and focuses on

32
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,320
creating methodologies that continuously

33
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,080
find actionable intelligence from these

34
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,119
scammers

35
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:18,400
with this research we're trying to

36
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,400
promote awareness in the community about

37
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,799
the current scams in circulation some of

38
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,799
the scams that we've been monitoring are

39
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:27,520
dating romance um tech support as well

40
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,880
as unexpected refunds in 2021 one in

41
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,400
three americans had reported to have

42
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,640
fallen a victim of a

43
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,240
scam call making that a total of

44
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:40,880
59.49 million individuals the total loss

45
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,840
reported was 29.8 billion us dollars

46
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,439
which is not a small amount for the

47
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:46,720
industry

48
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:47,680
um

49
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,360
there is a large range of individuals

50
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,119
who are unfortunately at a higher risk

51
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:53,920
of falling a victim of fraud and

52
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,920
one of the main factors that relates

53
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,920
these different types of scams with

54
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,560
individuals are is age

55
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,960
we gather that ages 55 and older are

56
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,119
falling victims of mainly romance dating

57
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:07,360
scams as well as tech support however on

58
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,598
the other side the younger people 18 to

59
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:13,599
55 are falling victim of maybe um

60
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:14,959
employment scams as well as

61
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:17,520
cryptocurrency online scams

62
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,720
jacob

63
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,440
so

64
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,959
just really quick before we really dig

65
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:23,280

66
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,040

scammers as we mentioned this is a

70
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:32,480
university capstone project so we

71
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,720

scambaiting call successful here

78
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,920
referring back to that being able to

79
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,920
consistently gather actionable

80
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,160
intelligence for reports so to do that

81
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,120
we're going to be walking you through

82
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,560
our scan bidding checklist consisting of

83
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,000
how we secure ourselves how to prepare

84
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,440
and plan for a call and then go about

85
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,800
actually making the call then we'll be

86
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,280
showing a little uh demonstration and

87
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,720
how it's and then explaining how

88
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,760
everything that we've been talking about

89
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,599
ties together

90
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:07,200
awesome

91
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,000
perfect so um building a same scan

92
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,920
meeting infrastructure is the main and

93
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,280
the first step because we want to make

94
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,120
sure we're safe the whole time while

95
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,599
interacting with the scammers the first

96
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:18,640
step

97
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,319
two of the main steps are

98
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:22,159
ensuring a secure and private

99
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:24,080
environment when it comes to

100
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,680
security the main thing is setting up or

101
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,080
creating a stealthy virtual machine and

102
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,080
that is with the benefit of isolation

103
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,879
and dynamic configurability the vm

104
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:37,840
achieves strong isolation by

105
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,599
running the processes or restricting the

106
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:41,360
processes so that if they're running

107
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,920
inside the vm even if they're

108
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,000
compromised by malware it will be hard

109
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,840
if not impossible to compromise the

110
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,319
systems running outside of the vm

111
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:52,000
so for this project we used two

112
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,519
different operating systems we used cali

113
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:55,360
linux where we did conducted a lot of

114
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,120
the research did some key logger

115
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,959
development but as well as clicking on

116
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:00,000
the links that we would get from the

117
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,319
scammers most of the time then we used a

118
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:04,159
windows operating system to interact

119
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:05,519
with the scammers most of the time they

120
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:07,360
would ask us to share the screen and so

121
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,280
we want to look um not suspicious by

122
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,680
using kali so we use windows just to

123
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,799
look as

124
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:15,599
a victim

125
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:18,478
next on the privacy section we used text

126
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:20,000
now which is the voip service that we

127
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,440
used to make the phone calls as well as

128
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,759
text back and forth with the scammers

129
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:25,120
as you can see as well from the

130
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,360
screenshot the whole time we were on a

131
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,440
vpn we connected to ib addresses

132
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,919
dynamically for each interaction just to

133
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:33,680
make sure that nothing will tie back to

134
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,520
us as individuals

135
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,320
last but not least we use protonmail as

136
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,840
the encrypted mail service to

137
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,240
communicate to the scammers but also we

138
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,800
went on scam or very suspicious websites

139
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,400
to sign up for their services so that we

140
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,960
can become a target for them shortly

141
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,560
after as you can see on the screenshot

142
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,919
we started getting flooded with

143
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:54,240
different emails that were

144
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,840
that included some very suspicious links

145
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,919
on the body

146
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:00,000
one of the things also that we did to

147
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,960
make sure that we mask our windows os

148
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,440
to look as a host operating system was

149
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,199
changing the configuration files

150
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:09,840
changing the registry as well as hiding

151
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,400
the vmware tools

152
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,000
okay

153
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,600
so now that we're secure before we can

154
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,880
get to the actual scan baiting we need

155
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,280
to do a little bit of goal setting and a

156
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,320
lot of everybody's going to have their

157
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,000
own independent goals but the main thing

158
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,039
to remember when it comes to scan

159
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:25,120
baiting is that the overall purpose is

160
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,280
to waste the scammers time and this is

161
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,720
important because scamming is really

162
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,639
just a game of statistics most people

163
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:32,000
aren't going to be falling for scams so

164
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,680
scammers need to call as many people as

165
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,000
frequently as possible in order to get

166
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,919
money meaning the more time of theirs

167
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,440
that we can waste the less time that

168
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,720
they're going to have

169
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,160
spending with actual victims and the

170
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,280
less money they're actually going to be

171
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,240
able to make

172
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,919
so aside from this main goal of

173
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:46,960
scambaiting everybody's going to have

174
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,240
their own independent goal for example

175
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,440
youtubers going to want to be making

176
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,360
entertaining and comedic content for us

177
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,880
we're going back to that ability to

178
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,240
consistently gather actionable

179
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,840
intelligence and to do this we need to

180
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,759
go about some basic steps first and

181
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:59,360
foremost we need to verify it is indeed

182
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,960
a scam when we're on the call for

183
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,880
example if someone reported a legitimate

184
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,319
business as a scam we want to make sure

185
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:06,080
that we're not going about investigating

186
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,400
them as they are a legitimate business

187
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,520
once we've done that though we can go

188
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,039
about investigating and gathering

189
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:12,720
intelligence we can do this through a

190
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,319
variety of social engineering techniques

191
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:15,919
and tools one of the ones that we prefer

192
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:17,840
is grabify iplogger for those of you who

193
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,600
don't know grabify is a website that

194
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,360
allows you to take any url that you want

195
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,039
and gives you a redirection link so that

196
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:24,400
when that link is clicked before going

197
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,000
to the intended url it'll first go to

198
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,240
grabify servers and grab any public

199
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,919
information about that user such as

200
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:31,680
their ip address location operating

201
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,600
system a whole lot of information that

202
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,600
can be used to identify and with proper

203
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,840
authority hack back a scammer then once

204
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,039
we've gathered all this information we

205
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:40,960
can go about actually making the report

206
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,199
so how do we actually figure out a scam

207
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,319
that we can go about calling in the

208
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:45,919
first place well there's a whole bunch

209
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:47,680
of resources that we can use and we like

210
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,800
to rank them based off of the

211
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,720
trustworthiness of how likely this is a

212
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,560
legitimate scam that's being posted as

213
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,840
well as the activity level of how

214
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,800
frequently these uh resources use new or

215
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,560
post new scams first and foremost we

216
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,080
have discord it's very good for

217
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,919
beginners and it has a really good sense

218
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:03,360
of community however due to the terms of

219
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,440
service and the fact that anybody can

220
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,280
join most of the time there can't be

221
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,720
actual numbers that are posted and when

222
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,919
they are they're not always the most

223
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:11,759
trustworthy so another resource that we

224
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:14,080
can use is the the scams that you all

225
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,919
received yourselves these tend to be the

226
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:17,120
most trustworthy because you're going to

227
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,479
be the best person to ask and know

228
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:19,759
whether or not your car warranty is

229
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:21,360
expired however

230
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,880
unless you're on some kind of list

231
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,080
likely you're only going to be getting a

232
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,840
couple or so a week which is not enough

233
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,759
for a research project of this scale so

234
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:29,919
another resource is the subreddit r scam

235
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:31,199
numbers this one's a step up from

236
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:32,880
discord because they have moderators

237
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,720
that increase that trustworthiness and

238
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,160
you can actually be posting numbers

239
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,639
however due to the how many people are

240
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,800
in the subreddit itself once a number is

241
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,560
posted 10 the scammers tend to be

242
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,840
flooded with a whole bunch of calls

243
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:44,879
realize that they're on a list and

244
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:46,560
change the number so we kind of act a

245
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,599
bit more fast if we're using something

246
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:49,680
from this this leads us to the resource

247
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,520
that we most commonly use uh

248
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,199
scammer.info this is our preferred

249
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:55,599
method it's a forum based website that

250
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:58,479
is entirely dedicated to scam baiters

251
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:00,400
and what it does is for every single

252
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,400
phone number it has its own forum post

253
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,919
where anybody can respond with any

254
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:05,440
information that they got from their

255
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,440
individual contact with that scammer any

256
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,199
other resources that they had links all

257
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:11,039
the info in one dedicated place that

258
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:13,919
makes research very very helpful

259
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:15,919
so aside from this that we prefer there

260
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:18,000
is another kind of like top tier

261
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,680
resource that we can use and we're

262
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,720
currently in the process of trying to

263
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,720
migrate our operations to it it's called

264
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,199
bob rtc it's really really cool and it

265
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:26,400
kind of automates a lot of these

266
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,520
previous things that we've been talking

267
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,039
about it gives you a randomized phone

268
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:30,720
number at the beginning of every call it

269
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,919
takes all that information from

270
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:34,320
scammer.info and condensing it to a nice

271
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,919
neat little dashboard per number to give

272
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:37,120
you all that information that you can be

273
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,479
recalling and there's a whole bunch of

274
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:39,839
other cool features that you can unlock

275
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:42,000
the more time that you are scandating so

276
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,399
now that we have a goal and a plan and

277
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,080
we know what scan we want to do the last

278
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,920
kind of big step is research and this

279
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,040
tends to be one of the most important

280
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,080
but also overlooked steps

281
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,920
these are kind of things of making sure

282
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,560
you know what the scam is actually about

283
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,560
is it a pop-up scam is it an email scam

284
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,760
is a phone number what kind of

285
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,200
information do you need to know to

286
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,959
actually be in the foots

287
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,720
to walk in the same path as a victim

288
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,640
would what kind of information are these

289
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,839
scammers going to be asking for so you

290
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,279
know how to prepare it in advance and

291
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:11,200
have it available and also just being

292
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,560
updated with the scam making sure that

293
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,080
this number isn't deactivated so you

294
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,519
don't waste your time trying to do all

295
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,440
this research and while it may seem a

296
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,120
lot of common sense it's very easy to

297
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,040
overlook some steps as we did when we

298
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,880
were working on this debt forgiveness

299
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,390
scam

300
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:28,320
[Music]

301
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,200
yeah the state

302
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:35,800
oh it's texas

303
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,920
so as you can see we said that we owed

304
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,000
taxes to the state of texas which if we

305
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:44,959
had done our research we would have

306
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,560
found out that in florida and texas you

307
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:51,640
can't actually owe debt to the states

308
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,279
but once you have all the research and

309
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:00,959
you're ready to make the call the final

310
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:02,640
step you want to do is prepare a fake

311
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,320
identity which in my opinion is the most

312
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,240
fun stuff of this entire process

313
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,680
there's a couple things that you have to

314
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,680
do that we did when we were preparing

315
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,120
for calls and so we'll walk through each

316
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,240
one of those

317
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,000
sub steps the first one as we just

318
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,079
mentioned is research the scammers mo

319
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:17,839
what are they expecting what type of

320
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:20,399
victim traditionally um falls prey to

321
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:22,959
these scams so for instance if it is a

322
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:24,640
relationship scam generally the victims

323
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,320
are going to be a little bit towards the

324
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,399
middle uh would be more towards their

325
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:30,399
middle age um if it's a cryptocurrency

326
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:32,000
scam generally these victims are going

327
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,920
to be a little bit younger uh once you

328
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,040
understand what this scammer is

329
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,160
expecting where they're expecting to

330
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,760
find it we set up honey pots across the

331
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,560
web we have linkedin pages um off like

332
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,880
fake individuals which we use to get on

333
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,480
lists and like we mentioned earlier we

334
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,880
have a couple um like we have emails

335
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,160
that we sign up for email lists just so

336
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,760
that we can play the part of a

337
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,360
traditional victim

338
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,279
once we have a scam in mind then we get

339
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:54,959
to decide the gender age and location of

340
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:56,959
the person we are trying to imitate

341
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:58,480
the most important part is making sure

342
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,720
that this is a persona that we can

343
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,600
actually imitate for like hours on end

344
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,519
so for instance in my case i can do a

345
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:07,040
relatively good

346
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,959
southern united states impression a

347
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:10,240
british impression or a french

348
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,360
impression

349
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,800
struggle a little bit with

350
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,600
anything from asia so making sure that

351
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,880
you're comfortable with impersonating

352
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,880
someone for that extended period of time

353
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,279
is very important for a scam call

354
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:22,800
the third thing which goes a little bit

355
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,720
into the psychology of a victim is

356
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,800
defining the background personality

357
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,959
motivation and interest for why a victim

358
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:30,480
would even fall prey to these scams so

359
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,320
take for instance a debt forgiveness

360
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,399
scam normally victims are in a little

361
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:36,399
bit of a tight financial situation and

362
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:37,680
so they're looking for something that

363
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,600
can give them pretty significant

364
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,680
financial relief we want to make sure

365
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,920
that we can enter that persona enter

366
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,000
that psychology so that way we can keep

367
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,839
the scammer engaged and really to them

368
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,600
feel like a victim that they can

369
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,440
probably pull money from

370
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,440
and then finally a very very important

371
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,200
part is ensuring all the data that we

372
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,200
generate is verifiable

373
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,360
most of the scammers that run large

374
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,959
operations are professionals they have

375
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:03,279
whole call centers dedicated to scamming

376
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:05,200
people day in and day out and so if you

377
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,560
just generate a random address that

378
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,639
doesn't actually show up if you have a

379
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:10,240
phone number where the area code doesn't

380
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,079
exist it's very easy for people to

381
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:13,360
recognize that you're just wasting your

382
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,040
time they'll hang up probably add you to

383
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,399
a list and it'll be hard to contact them

384
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:18,399
again so making sure that anything and

385
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:20,160
everything that you generate related to

386
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,160
your persona is verifiable at least

387
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,079
through initial checks is a pretty

388
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:25,839
important step in the process

389
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:27,519
and then finally anything that you do

390
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,440
put together for your fake persona it's

391
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,800
very important to make sure that you can

392
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,959
access those notes on the call

393
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:34,399
so what we do is since we're all

394
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:36,399
together making scam baiting calls we

395
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:38,480
have a discord channel that's open and

396
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,639
we have a google doc and so we can share

397
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:42,720
information as we're holding the call

398
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,560
sometimes the call goes incredibly well

399
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,040
everything that we had prepared is

400
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,240
requested and so everything moves

401
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,240
smoothly sometimes the scammer starts

402
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,600
getting suspicious or they just go down

403
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,880
a different track and they start asking

404
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,079
for information that we haven't

405
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:56,399
originally planned for um so if we have

406
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:58,160
something that's collaborative the other

407
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,360
team members can quickly put that

408
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,120
together so that persona stays

409
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,959
consistent for the couple hours that we

410
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:04,720
are on a call

411
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,399
over here you can actually see jacques

412
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:07,760
philippe who is a persona that we

413
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,399
created and used uh for a scam call uh

414
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:11,680
this person

415
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:14,720
um immigrated from texas uh from france

416
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,959
to texas just moved to texas recently so

417
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:18,240
we put together an address we put

418
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,240
together a birthday on the lower side of

419
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,560
this um chart you can even see we went

420
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,920
into his occupation and physical

421
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,519
attributes making sure that we could

422
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:26,880
really go into the persona about what

423
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,720
type of person this

424
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,639
victim would play and making sure that

425
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:32,959
we were sufficiently representing him

426
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:35,040
as best as we possibly could all the way

427
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,160
at the bottom you can see the browser

428
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,920
user agent which is what scammers saw

429
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,199
when they were trying to screen share

430
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,480
again it looks just like a windows

431
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,320
computer although it's windows with the

432
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,760
registry edited on a vm on cali

433
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:46,959
and then the most important part over

434
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:49,920
here is the ssn and the two bank numbers

435
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,680
the card numbers if you are generating

436
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:52,959
card numbers it's very important that

437
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:54,639
they pass the loon algorithm the loan

438
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:56,959
algorithm is a it's a straightforward

439
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:58,320
algorithm that banks users to make sure

440
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,000
that a card number is valid there's a

441
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,519
ton of free trackers on the internet and

442
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:02,800
free generators that you can use to

443
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,000
generate something that at least at

444
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,360
first glance

445
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,519
looks to be valid it's a great way to

446
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:09,120
get scammers engaged because they try

447
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,560
and plug this in

448
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,760
it doesn't work because there's no bank

449
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,839
account behind it and then you can use

450
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:15,440
you can use that for your own purposes

451
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,360
as you will see later on today

452
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,560
and then the other thing is your social

453
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,839
security

454
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:20,959
it's important to note that social

455
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:23,199
security numbers are modeled very

456
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:24,800
similar to phone numbers the first three

457
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,320
digits are

458
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,079
area codes so if we say that jacques

459
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:29,680
philippe is from texas you want to make

460
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,600
sure that the area code 452 is actually

461
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,040
an error code for a texas social

462
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,399
security number

463
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:35,600
and then there's a couple ways you can

464
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,120
verify this and make sure that it's not

465
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,120
actually active ssn vn is one great

466
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,199
service um a couple others that you can

467
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:42,240
use to make sure that you're not

468
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,880
actually using a real ssn one important

469
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,160
thing to note is depending on how

470
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,440
advanced these scammers are they can

471
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,040
probably check whether or not the person

472
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,880
is alive and so as you can see that

473
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,399
there's no death master following record

474
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:53,680
for this specific number which is

475
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:54,880
important because if you're trying to

476
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,720
play a person with a social security

477
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:57,600
number

478
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,760
who actually died a couple years ago it

479
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,680
it runs into a couple of issues with

480
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,959
your legitimacy so with that in mind if

481
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:06,399
you have all your data it's all verified

482
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:07,440
and you're ready to go with the scam

483
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,199
call then you can move on to the next

484
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:10,639
step

485
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:11,839
so we've gone through our whole

486
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:13,360
checklist and now we're actually ready

487
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,440
to make the call and

488
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,480
in our opinion there's kind of two

489
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,920
different types of people

490
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,760
a person who receives a phone call from

491
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:22,160
a scammer and just ignores it blocks the

492
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,839
number doesn't want to deal with it the

493
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:25,120
other class is someone who's either

494
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,360
receiving calls or making them and is

495
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,480
just trying to make the scammer angry um

496
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,880
insult them waste their time see if you

497
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:35,279
can make funny inappropriate jokes

498
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:37,360
we're not doing that what we want to do

499
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,880
is we want to keep them on the call as

500
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,560
long as possible

501
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,160
so what we actually do is when we call a

502
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,079
scammer we sit on the phone and the rest

503
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:45,839
of us are all in the room together we

504
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:47,680
all work together on calls so that we

505
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,839
make sure we get the best intelligence

506
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:52,320
out of the call and each person is doing

507
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,560
different things so one of the first

508
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,800
jobs is making sure that they are taking

509
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,199
notes and a transcript of the whole call

510
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:01,360
so that we can you know an hour and a

511
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,639
half long call we want to be able to

512
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:04,320
remember the first five 10 minutes of

513
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,720
the call we also want to a week later

514
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,000
remember what actually happened in the

515
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,399
call so we can learn from mistakes and

516
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:11,839
then you know don't repeat those

517
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:13,680
mistakes

518
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,600
the other thing that we're doing in the

519
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,120
background is making sure that we're

520
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,440
staying consistent to the scam so we do

521
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,360
research on the scam beforehand but we

522
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,639
want to make sure that we're actually

523
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:24,480
still staying consistent as an example

524
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,720
of this um we were talking about a scam

525
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,320
we were going to call and we told each

526
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,560
other that it was going to be an av scam

527
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:33,199
av can be either antivirus or audio

528
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:34,160
visual

529
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,920
and so the person making the call called

530
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,440
them and started talking about audio

531
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,519
visual when the scan was actually about

532
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:41,839
um anti-virus uh the scammer very

533
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:43,680
quickly hung up with us and was very

534
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:44,880
annoyed with us

535
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,399
um so we want to make sure that we're

536
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:48,399
staying consistent and we actually are

537
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:50,480
research so that's that person's job

538
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,480
and the last person is making sure that

539
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,959
our persona stays consistent so we do

540
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:56,399
all kinds of research and we prep our

541
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:59,440
persona beforehand um but once the call

542
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,600
starts maybe the scammer asks for some

543
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,880
more information that we didn't think

544
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,039
about or we don't have prepared so that

545
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:06,240
person needs to be in charge of

546
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,799
generating that information on the fly

547
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:11,119
but that information also needs to stay

548
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:12,480
consistent with the rest of our

549
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,079
information already generated otherwise

550
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:15,359
it's going to throw up some red flags

551
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:17,199
for the scammer

552
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:19,119
and kind of the last thing is keeping

553
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:20,959
that scammer on the call one thing that

554
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:24,559
we found is laughter um making them have

555
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:26,959
a good time you know if you're when when

556
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:28,079
you're on a call and you're laughing

557
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:29,919
you're not thinking about oh my god the

558
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:31,679
clock says an hour and a half right

559
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:32,960
they're not thinking about that so

560
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,039
that's what we're trying to do

561
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:37,120
so now we're going to play a quick case

562
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,760
study of us on a call with a scammer

563
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,840
in this call we're it's about an hour

564
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,840
and a half in and what we're doing that

565
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,480

566
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,080
them they're trying to set up amazon

567
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,240
video for us and ultimately we're going

568
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,000
to try and get them to click on a link

569
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,919

570

587
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,360

588
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,280
the car details you gave us

589
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,840
but somehow it's getting declined so did

590
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,840

592
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,919
the payment sir so what do you want from

593
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:34,400
my insider so

594
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,039
my bank portal gives me a link let me um

595
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:39,679
i can i can spell out the link for you

596
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:44,919
yeah it took me to dating it's uh http

597
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:57,360
actually even after he clicked on this

598
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,960
link and you know we gave him this bogus

599
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,480
link he stayed on the call with us for

600
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,799
another 30 minutes still trying to scam

601
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:05,120
us and so the key was you know being

602
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:08,240
enough of a honeypot that they wanted to

603
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,039
scam us but not being so gullible and so

604
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:14,960
innocent that it's kind of suspicious

605
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,200
and because we had that goal from the

606
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,039
very beginning and had a plan in place

607
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:20,880
to actually make it happen we were able

608
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,200
to like we said gather this information

609
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,720
that we can see right there

610
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,960
actionable intelligence that we can use

611
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,240
to make a report and submit to the

612
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,679
proper authorities

613
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:31,840
and as part of that plan since we had

614
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,039
that credit card number that we

615
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:34,320
generated that at least on first

616
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,679
inspection looks valid looks like a

617
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:37,600
normal visa card but when you plug it in

618
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,880
there's no bank account we were able to

619
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,240
get that scammer to ask us for a

620
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,200
verification link which redirected it to

621
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,360
a bad to a dating website i should say

622
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,880
i've watched that speech way too many

623
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:47,679
times

624
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:49,120
redirected to a dating website but in

625
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,640
the same process gave us all this

626
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,400
information like their ip address and

627
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,400
other details that we then followed up

628
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:58,080
with trying to access their systems

629
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,760
all right and also because of the

630
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,760
initial environment setup that we had we

631
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,679
were completely safe safe in terms of

632
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:06,640
privacy and security um staying on vpn

633
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,799
inside that virtual machine so by the

634
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:10,640
end of the phone call we could stay with

635
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,400
them as long as we wanted to or share

636
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,640
our screen with them if required to see

637
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,799
whether what they try to

638
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:18,720
get from our computers what they try to

639
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,480
execute or steal from them as well

640
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,080
without fearing that we're gonna get

641
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,200
exposed

642
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,360
and that is a wrap thank you everyone

643
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,960
for being here i hope you enjoyed our

644
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,799
talk if you have any questions we are

645
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:31,600
here to answer them

646
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:39,789
[Applause]

647
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,559
nice throw

648
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:50,880
that's awesome guys great job so how do

649
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,760
you report the scammers um what agencies

650
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,039
do you report to and how do you report

651
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:55,760
them

652
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,440
yeah so it all depends on the type of

653
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,200
scam and what specific information we

654
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,440
get so for example if we get a website

655
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,960
we try to do some reverse domain

656
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,640
searching try to get any information we

657
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,000
can out of that and one of the first

658
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,679
things we do there is report it to that

659
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:09,840
domain actual service to say hey someone

660
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,840
is abusing your product you need to deal

661
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,919
with it instagram ones will report the

662
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:16,159
to instagram that's a scam uh with

663
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:17,520
something like the information that we

664
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,799
gathered here that would be reporting

665
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:21,039
more to the fbi cyber crimes unit since

666
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:22,720
they have a division for scamming so it

667
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,919
all kind of depends on what specific

668
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:25,679
information we gather and who we think

669
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:26,799
is going to be the best person to

670
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:28,400
receive it and

671
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,400
thank you and then follow up how many

672
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,039
did you report throughout your project

673
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:34,559
yeah uh so we're still in the process of

674
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:36,559
reporting a lot of them um the biggest

675
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:39,520

676
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,760
instagram crypto ads that we've reported

677
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,360
and with those have actually stolen

678
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,640
other people's identities so we've also

679
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,480
reported it to those individuals

680
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,159
um and then we've gotten some domain

681
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:49,760
ones that we've submitted to the domains

682
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:52,320

grabify link is that right

691
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,559
during your time scam baiting are you

692
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:16,640
coming across scammers who are becoming

693
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:17,919
more aware

694
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:20,320
of methods like that like when you gave

695
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,880
them https you know collins slash

696
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,880
grabify dot whatever

697
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,559
are they seeing that and then knowing

698
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:28,799
that you have wasted three hours of

699
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:30,080
their life

700
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,320
we're definitely finding that there are

701
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,400
a lot of scammers who are realizing very

702
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,280
quick um especially as i was saying um

703
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,200
if we are too eager and we're like

704
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,960
here's my credit card um they

705
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,400
immediately are like

706
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,679
we didn't do any work and they're a

707
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:45,919
little suspicious of that um

708
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:48,240
ironically the the link did wasn't

709
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,320
suspicious for like anyone we talked to

710
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,520
which was really interesting i don't

711
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:52,559
think it's something that a lot of

712
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:55,440
people do is try and tell them a link um

713
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,640
and basically we spend a lot of time

714
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,880
telling them how our bank had two-factor

715
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,799
authorization that required them to

716
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:02,559
click on the link and they really wanted

717
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:04,640
our money so

718
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:07,039
thank you

719
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,840
hello as you were going through and

720
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,279
collecting data from these different

721
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:19,600
sources specifically through the phone

722
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,840
and then having them click the link

723
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,919
did you see any patterns with types of

724
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:28,000
scams to different world regions

725
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,799
yeah i

726
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:32,400
i'm gonna be fully honest uh we haven't

727
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,200
yet done a location analysis too much in

728
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,679
detail with ip addresses uh but what we

729
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:39,840
did find is a lot of scammers generally

730
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:42,000
have a very similar modus

731
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,240
mode of operation they generally first

732
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,720
want to make sure that you are an actual

733
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,159
victim which is why the persona becomes

734
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:49,360
so important

735
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,960
as we were just talking earlier there

736
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,400
are a lot of people who are scam baiting

737
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,240
these days and so trying to make sure

738
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,159
that you are as believable as possible

739
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:57,600
everything that they're asking for even

740
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,360
if it's a little bit out of the ordinary

741
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,279
is like instantly provided them and it

742
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:02,640
all matches up

743
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,320
that has been the most important part

744
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,159
that we've found to be what scammers are

745
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:07,679
looking for and then also just

746
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:08,960
throughout the process making sure that

747
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,400
if they have information about why we're

748
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,159
giving them a link it looks pretty

749
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:14,400
believable so for instance the in this

750
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,960
case study that we showed the link was

751
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:20,400
um rb dot g y slash a couple like uh

752
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,240
characters after that so we just said it

753
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:25,039
was from our bank royal bank dot gy and

754
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:25,919
so

755
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:28,080
just making it as believable as possible

756
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,559
has been the most effective thing but

757
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:32,480
locations looking at location will be

758
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,000
something that we can take a look at in

759
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,559
the future as well

760
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:43,279
you guys are all asu students um besides

761
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:45,440
wasting the time of the scan baiters

762
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,840
what was your ultimate goal

763
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:51,600
to um prove with this study

764
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,919
um so one of the main goals is

765
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:55,360
increasing awareness of the different

766
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,960
scam types that are going on and the

767
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,960
different trends that we're seeing so

768
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:02,000
before it was mainly the older people 55

769
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,240
and older being victims of

770
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,919
tech support scams because they're not

771
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:08,400
tech savvy enough but nowadays everybody

772
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,559
nobody's safe pretty much because we're

773
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:13,039
seeing younger people getting

774
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:14,799
getting phone scams

775
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:16,400
on different things like car extended

776
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,640
warranty or employment

777
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,880
or phishing emails so

778
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,880
it's basically just spreading awareness

779
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,559
as much as we can around not only in

780
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:26,320
communities like cactus con where

781
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,320
professionals like us can start doing

782
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,679
something like this and the more of us

783
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:32,320
there is the more we can achieve a goal

784
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,000
but also going to different audiences

785
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,760
and letting them know of what's going on

786
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,279
um yeah

787
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:40,080
that you plan on um releasing it out in

788
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:42,400
the papers your studies

789
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,240
we are it's definitely on the road map

790
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,760
as of right now we still haven't started

791
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,440
that but it's something that we plan on

792
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,760
doing

793
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,279
uh we also have a website where we're

794
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:53,919
going to keep writing blogs and updating

795
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:56,000
on more scam-baiting phone calls that we

796
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,159
do

797
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:04,760
we have time for like one quick question

798
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:08,640
i just wanted to ask um

799
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,159
how much are you seeing the scammers

800
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:12,080
trying to obfuscate their infrastructure

801
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,600
um are they

802
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,360
doing anything to cover their tracks you

803
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,400
know given that they're doing something

804
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,919
illegal you would think they'd be at

805
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:20,080
least making the attempt to not be easy

806
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:22,640
to catch so that last link and i'll

807
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,799
actually go back to it um

808
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:27,360
this particular scammer you can their ip

809
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,120
address was a

810
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,799
midwest ip address so they were

811
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:32,080
definitely using a vpn to hide

812
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,679
themselves but it's interesting you can

813
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:35,600
look at the time stamp and it shows

814
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,840
their time stamp is india time so they

815
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,360
are definitely in india and they just

816
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,200
didn't hide everything so they're

817
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,480
definitely trying but they're not

818
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,799
necessarily doing a good job

819
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:46,559
and that's all we have time for so thank

820
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:49,799
you very much

821
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,840
you
