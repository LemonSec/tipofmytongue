1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,560
hello hello and welcome to my talk tag

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:04,799
management system the agile way to add

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:07,759
vulnerabilities on a website

4
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:09,920
i want to start this talk with a small

5
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:10,880
question

6
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,240
do you know each and every script

7
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,400
present on your end use their facing

8
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,960
website or application

9
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,359
i'm just gonna assume that you don't

10
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:21,840
my name is alexander mercier on twitter

11
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,880
i'm known as cyber flamingo and i have a

12
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:27,119
background in sales and marketing so my

13
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:30,640
first career was in marketing

14
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,920
my second career is insecurity i work

15
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,800
for ub secure which is a japanese

16
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,840
company in tokyo which develops

17
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,120
pex das tool

18
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,360
so why this talk

19
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,280
well as i just told you i have a

20
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,200
background in web marketing and i'm now

21
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,879
a security engineer

22
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:52,559
therefore i want to talk about the

23
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:54,559
intersection of the two worlds and what

24
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:56,399
concerns and security issues we should

25
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:59,840
be aware of

26
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,000
let me talk about devsecops so as you

27
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,720
know devsecops is to integrate security

28
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,600
not as not after south but at each and

29
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,080
every step of your development pipeline

30
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,760
so that when your product reached the

31
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,560
production environment it is as secure

32
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,720
as it can be

33
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,159
the thing is

34
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:20,080
when marketing department most of the

35
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,560
time they are not part of these

36
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,320
devsecops

37
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,119
they

38
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:26,720
work directly on the production

39
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,360
environment

40
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,520
this means that they can add

41
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,680
vulnerabilities that you won't be able

42
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:38,159
to see before it's too late

43
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:40,240
the first question was actually tonkin

44
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:43,520
check because i already knew the answer

45
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,479
indeed

46
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:47,200
more than 90 of website decision makers

47
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,560
do not believe they have complete

48
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,560
insight into the third party client-side

49
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,240
script they are running on their website

50
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,159
i call this phenomenon the last my

51
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:57,280
problem

52
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,280
basically what's going on is on your

53
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,280
production environment web marketing

54
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,280
department will use so-called tag

55
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,640
manager in order to add scripts directly

56
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,038
under production environment

57
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:10,080
and

58
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,080
it is very difficult to have a big

59
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,239
overview of what's going on because each

60
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:16,800
script will have different targets will

61
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,520
be segmented to different users

62
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,120
which means between your users they

63
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,879
won't see the same things

64
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:24,879
they won't necessarily see the same

65
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:26,480
things

66
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,319
so this is something i will say again in

67
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:31,360
this talk but you have to remember that

68
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,360
what your developers

69
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,400
created

70
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,720
and shipped is not the same thing that

71
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:40,239
what your users see on their browsers

72
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:43,840
that this is a very important point

73
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:47,440
so what is a tag manager anyway so tag

74
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,680
manager systems allows you to quickly

75
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,760
and easily update tags or measurement

76
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,440
code and related code fragment on your

77
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,480
website

78
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,440
so you add it one time and then using

79
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,760
web-based user interface you can add as

80
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,799
many time as you want

81
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:05,280
so let's see an example

82
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,400
so here is google tag manager so to add

83
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,360
a new tag you just go here

84
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,280
and as you can see it's all pointer

85
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,120
click you don't have to

86
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,599
know about development

87
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:19,840
at least

88
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,080
not a lot

89
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,239
and you can just select the tag you want

90
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:25,440
to add

91
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:29,200
and save it and then you just have to

92
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,640
discard this

93
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,799
you can submit and it will be sent

94
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:34,640
directly on your website the only

95
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,519
configuration you have to do is add this

96
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:41,920
tag one time on your website somewhere

97
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,319
let's go back to the slides

98
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:48,799
so often use tags include web traffic

99
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:51,120
analysis ad traffic analysis social

100
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,280
media audience analysis a lot of

101
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,400
analysis

102
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,360
a b testing usability testing

103
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,200
heat map and

104
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,439
pop-ups and other email collection tool

105
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:04,879
wait i think you get the gist

106
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,360
let's see what can happen

107
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,720
a lot

108
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,400
but the good news is

109
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,159
it's nothing new

110
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:14,319
you can have security misconfiguration

111
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:16,478
unchecked vulnerabilities inclusion of

112
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:20,478
malicious scripts and domain hijacking

113
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,479
it is said that there is on average 12

114
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:26,720
scripts per website add to this that

115
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,280
there is probably a lot of targets a lot

116
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,280
of triggers and

117
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,199
before you know it oh my god we

118
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:35,040
collected our clients credit card

119
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,680
information so security misconfiguration

120
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,759
is i think one of the biggest concerns

121
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:43,840
regarding tag management system

122
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,479
unchecked vulnerabilities

123
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:48,800
i want to reiterate that what your

124
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,240
developers

125
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,120
created and what your end users see is

126
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,880
not always the same thing

127
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,440
so for example let's say your marketing

128
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,680
department added an email capture pop-up

129
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,400
that

130
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,120
fires after some condition let's say you

131
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,039
spend one minute on the website so the

132
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:07,120
first thing marketing

133
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,520
think about when they use this kind of

134
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,479
tool is

135
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:14,160
how many email can we harvest

136
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,680
that's their job

137
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,080
but the first thing that we think about

138
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,680
when we see this is

139
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:24,880
is it sanitized can we use xss

140
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,600
so before you know it your website is

141
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,440
vulnerable

142
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,639
inclusion of malicious scripts

143
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:34,479
so you should know tags are not

144
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:36,000
sandboxed

145
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,400
and as far as i know only google checks

146
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,199
for malware distribution

147
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:43,199
so you may be wondering why no

148
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:45,600
safeguards it's weird isn't it

149
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,639
well

150
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:48,000
you have to understand that from the

151
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,600
point of view of the tag manager there

152
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,440
is no way to know if a script is

153
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,360
malicious or at least it's very

154
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,720
difficult to know if a script is

155
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,039
malicious or not for example let's say

156
00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:58,800
you have a script that records

157
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,400
keystrokes

158
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,400
is it a kilogear is it for ux

159
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,440
improvement you don't know and

160
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,960
from the point of view of marketing

161
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,440
people you don't want tag managers that

162
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,960
will block the

163
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,440
firing of your scripts that's just

164
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:17,039
something that's not going to happen

165
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,280
following everything we just did i think

166
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,440
you will understand if i say that

167
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,919
marketing people web marketers with

168
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:26,479
access to google tag manager are a prime

169
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:30,080
target for social engineering

170
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,360
let me give you a quick example

171
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,960
so as you can see here i have a very

172
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:38,400
small website with uh cool pictures

173
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,520
and

174
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,000
i have google tag manager it is actually

175
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,080
blocked by eubark origin but it's set up

176
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,560
on my website so let's unblock it and

177
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,120
see what's going on oh wait what

178
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,560
happened to my cool picture it

179
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,000
disappeared

180
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,160
this is weird let's see google tag

181
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,240
manager

182
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,280
so

183
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,000
on this overview we have

184
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,639
the name of the tag that is actually in

185
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:05,440
place on my website and this one is

186
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,880
called easy script to reach all your

187
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,520
marketing kpi ah sounds like something

188
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,599
every marketer will want to add to their

189
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:14,479
website isn't it

190
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,360
so as you can see

191
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,400
we are using a custom html which is as

192
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,039
the name implies html so you can

193
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:26,240
actually add javascript directly

194
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,960
to tag manager so it's different to the

195
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,960
thing we saw before

196
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,319
where we used

197
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:34,880
template

198
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:36,639
there is some configuration that you can

199
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:37,840
do but

200
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:38,960
there is no

201
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:42,080
javascript involved

202
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:44,800
domain hijacking

203
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,440
so i think we all saw this news it was

204
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,520
quite funny at the time when news

205
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,800
newspaper

206
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,080
had a

207
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,240
problem with a third party that

208
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,160
started to stream

209
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,039
pornographic contents on their website

210
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:00,800
and that's something you should be aware

211
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,199
of when you install a lot of scripts on

212
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:04,479
your website

213
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:07,599
using a tag manager if you don't review

214
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:10,479
them often

215
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,960
so let's talk about how to work with

216
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,319
marketing

217
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:17,039
when it comes to marketing i know in our

218
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:19,280
industry we are

219
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,280
not so kind with them

220
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,800
to save the list

221
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,080
and

222
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,080
but we have to collaborate with them one

223
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,400
reason is they have a great influence on

224
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,919
the front end

225
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:31,599
marketers are not security conscious

226
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:33,360
enough and it's time to remedy to this

227
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,440
situation

228
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,039
so the point is you have to use

229
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:39,120
marketing jargon so that they will

230
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,958
listen to you you have to talk about

231
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:43,519
impact on boons rate the exit rate and

232
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:46,480
what effect it has on cvr i think it's a

233
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,640
good social engineering exercise for you

234
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,959
as well

235
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,839
let me give you some examples of how you

236
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:56,080
could approach talking with marketing

237
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,760
people

238
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,080
so of course you could always say well

239
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,240
this is insecure i'm not letting you do

240
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,120
this but i don't think you will get your

241
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,399
point across

242
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:08,320
on the other hand if you say well this

243
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,320
resource will show a not secure on our

244
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,160
client's brother this can have an impact

245
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,080
on our cvr as client may be surprised

246
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,240
and leave the website i think this way

247
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,720
of talking will get your point across

248
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,959
more easily

249
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,560
another example

250
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,880
so what is this script get rid of it

251
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,959
it's awful

252
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:31,040
or you could just say this clip makes

253
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,120
our website slower this must have an

254
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,360
impact on our bounce rate doesn't it

255
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:39,200
shall we replace it with a new version

256
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,000
of course you could say well if you

257
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,920
don't do what i say i'm just going to

258
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,080
block all your marketing toys with this

259
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,040
csp rule but this will just lead to more

260
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,120
shadow ideas so i don't think it's

261
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,240
something you want

262
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,800
all right let's see how we can work with

263
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,880
marketing

264
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,800
another good news

265
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,720
i think it's nothing you don't already

266
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,120
know how to do inventory of assets

267
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,959
analysis and risk assessment and risk

268
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:08,079
mitigation

269
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:10,640
so let's see how it applies to our

270
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,360
present problem

271
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,560
first we want to know

272
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,399
what are they collecting so you want to

273
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:20,160
know the information being collected and

274
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,240
you want to know the tools and script in

275
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,440
use by web marketing

276
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,040
fortunately thanks to gdpr marketing has

277
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:32,240
no reason not to collect things because

278
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,839
it used to be that they collected

279
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:37,040
everything but now gdpr put a stop on it

280
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,560
and it's not as easy to collect

281
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,720
everything so it makes your job easier

282
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,720
as well

283
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,279
and by the way use this opportunity to

284
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:46,560
talk about the reduction of data

285
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,079
collection with your web marketing

286
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:50,719
department

287
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,800
let's go back to tools and script

288
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,200
when it comes to tools and scripts

289
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,600
web marketing will have two main tool

290
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,160
sets let's say the core tool set and the

291
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,480
other tools so the core tool set is what

292
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:07,040
they use all the year round

293
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,800
so this is really the

294
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,880
the tool you want to shift left you want

295
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,440
to add to the ci cd as soon as possible

296
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,000
to be able to test them as well

297
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,079
the other tools on the other end there

298
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:20,560
is not one size fits all solution so you

299
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,720
will have to work with marketing to know

300
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:27,160
how you can make it more secure

301
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,360
a good tag manager will have a way to

302
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,160
versionize every tags and scripts you

303
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,760
put on your website

304
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:36,560
and

305
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,600
maybe as well as a way to do internal

306
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,839
tests and live

307
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:44,160
and this is good news because as

308
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,800
security people we want to put the sec

309
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,720
on devops so you will have to work with

310
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,440
marketing to know at which step

311
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,399
if there is any you can help them make

312
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:56,720
the integration of new tags and script

313
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,360
more secure

314
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,720
you should remember that marketing will

315
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,959
make several release per day

316
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:07,120
which means they can't afford to wait

317
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,680
for security assessment so some of the

318
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,600
checks will have to be done on

319
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,920
production

320
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,600
of course aiming for zero vulnerability

321
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,240
independences is impossible

322
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,519
so you have to consider risk and

323
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:21,600
benefits early on and focus on measures

324
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,519
that makes the most sense

325
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:25,440
and of course consider the speed

326
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,720
required by marketing

327
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:31,360
you may be aware that there are not a

328
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,680
lot of tool that checks user facing

329
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,600
front end at least there is not as many

330
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,600
tool as there is on the back end

331
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,000
what you want to focus your attention to

332
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,720
is tools that can perform detection of

333
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,760
an authorized collection of

334
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,680
configuration information detection of

335
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:48,800
the presence of new non-vulnerabilities

336
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,120
and the recording of connections to

337
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,399
unknown domains

338
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:54,800
it is said that website nowadays connect

339
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,680
to 10 new domains every week 10. that's

340
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,959
quite a big number isn't it

341
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:06,079
risk mitigation regarding web marketing

342
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:07,040
tools

343
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,360
are there safeguards to mask not record

344
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,320
pii i think thanks to gdpr a lot of

345
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,519
tools have

346
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:15,760
made a lot of effort in this regard are

347
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,040
they set up

348
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,399
is there a way to prevent

349
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:20,480
misconfiguration is there a possibility

350
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,720
of shift left strategy for some of the

351
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,000
tools

352
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,760
this is some of the things you have to

353
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,320
keep in mind

354
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:32,000
the custom html i showed you just before

355
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,600
you have to limit the use of it because

356
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,200
it's very dangerous actually google

357
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,200
knows it's dangerous because there is an

358
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,680
option to require two-step verification

359
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,719
in order to add it

360
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:46,240
as for the cultural aspects you have to

361
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,160
do vendor background checks of course

362
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,560
require security control from existing

363
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,760
vendors

364
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,160
the more you ask for security controls

365
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,079
the more they will know that their

366
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:57,920
clients are

367
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,760
interested in security and they will i

368
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:03,839
hope give us more controls

369
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,040
on the technical side some people

370
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,680
recommend to put your scripts in iframe

371
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,199
it makes sense but

372
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:13,199
on the other hand it will render the

373
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:14,560
script almost

374
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,959
useless so that's not something most

375
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:20,320
marketing people will let you do

376
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,920
on the other hand you can use server

377
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,240
resource integrity you should use it as

378
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,639
much as possible if condition permits

379
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:28,639
content security policy is always a safe

380
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:30,959
bet problem is it's sometimes very

381
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:33,199
difficult to use and

382
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:35,440
once you have a new script that connects

383
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,279
to new domains

384
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:39,440
it will block the scripts and

385
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,519
you will have probably a lot of setup to

386
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:43,360
do beforehand and a lot of talk to do

387
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,440
with marketing

388
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,519
if you're brave check out trusted types

389
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:49,839
as well

390
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:53,279
a respectable tag manager system should

391
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:55,920
supports gsp and the creation of non's

392
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,519
global attribute

393
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:59,600
if it's the case of your tag manager

394
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,760
system you should definitely help

395
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:05,680
marketing department to set it up

396
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,839
you should prepare a safety net

397
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:12,320
if you do this i think web marketing

398
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,480
people will thank you

399
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,880
so the reason why is tag manager

400
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,519
configuration is complex and confusing

401
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:21,920
as i show you just before during the

402
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:25,120
demonstration it's easy to use but once

403
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:28,959
you have 10 20 maybe more tags

404
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:31,440
and maybe as much or more triggers for

405
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,680
each and every one of them it's really

406
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,000
difficult to know what's going on

407
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:36,880
so

408
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,720
preparing a safety net is something you

409
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,959
should definitely think about and talk

410
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:43,519
with your marketing people

411
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:45,519
so one way to do it for google tag

412
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:48,079
manager is to use data layer which

413
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:50,399
permits programmatically restriction of

414
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:53,040
script deployment

415
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,120
let's see how it works

416
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,920
so let's say we have free page and

417
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,320
the second page let's say it's a

418
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:03,199
sensitive page so like a checkout card

419
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:05,279
where you have to put your credit card

420
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:07,040
information

421
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,199
so as you can see on all pages there is

422
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:11,839
an information collecting scripts but

423
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:13,759
the marketing knowing it's a sensitive

424
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:16,480
page they put a block list on the second

425
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,079
page to

426
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:20,320
not collect information

427
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,399
unfortunately before

428
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:24,000
the

429
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,399
block list kicks in some information

430
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:28,959
were collected so that's a problem but

431
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:30,959
if you had data layer restriction on

432
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:33,040
this page it would prevent the

433
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,279
the firing of every script on this page

434
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:38,480
so it should help them not make this

435
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,519
kind of a

436
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:41,759
mistake

437
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:44,480
remember that security is a team sport

438
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,839
we are all in it together

439
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,000
i believe i've given a lot of

440
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,320
information so i would like to summarize

441
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,240
in three points what i think is the most

442
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,560
important concern in this talk the first

443
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,720
is our work don't stop achieving to

444
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,199
protection we want to make sure our

445
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:04,559
client the end user is secure when they

446
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:07,199
use our products

447
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:08,799
the second point is

448
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:10,480
we shall be involved in the tag manager

449
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,880
system lifecycle it is not something we

450
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,480
can afford to not look at

451
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,959
and the third point is security is

452
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:21,119
everyone's business it includes

453
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:23,199
developers but it includes marketing as

454
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:25,439
well

455
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,400
so thank you for attention

456
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,760
if you have any questions feel free to

457
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,160
contact me during or after the event

458
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:35,640
thank you very much
