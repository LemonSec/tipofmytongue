1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,599
apparently i'm pretty good at doing that

2
00:00:01,599 --> 00:00:04,320
just by myself

3
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:08,480
we're live

4
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,120
i got a super big ring in my ear

5
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:13,678
is that coming

6
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:17,119
through do you want me to i don't think

7
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:20,240
i'm standing in front of a speaker but

8
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:23,680
it's right on top of you oh there you go

9
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,760
thank you you're welcome i won't stand

10
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:26,880
there anymore

11
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,880
i apologize anytime that i'm doing

12
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,320
something dumb just tell me i'm very

13
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,238
okay with it um

14
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:34,559
thank you so much for coming to uh my

15
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:36,160
talk on vulnerability management i'm

16
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,160
really bad at titles uh but i do like

17
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,239
adventures and so that's where uh

18
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:41,760
vulnerability management is one of these

19
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,680
lifelong things that i've done

20
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,160
for years now and so this is just the

21
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,079
specialization that i've really focused

22
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:50,320
on so

23
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,120
does button work

24
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,920
uh maybe

25
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,239
moving on

26
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,360
does this work

27
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,159
are you my mother

28
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,600
no we'll use the mouse

29
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,000
um audience background i want to get to

30
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,200
know you guys

31
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,600
um a little bit if i could so how many

32
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,680
people currently today have a dedicated

33
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,720
role in cyber security

34
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,479
most of us

35
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:29,360
okay um how many people have installed

36
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,119
managed or configured vulnerability

37
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:33,600
scanners

38
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:35,759
half little less

39
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:37,520
how many people have experienced can

40
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,079
experience configuring or integrating

41
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:42,960
source or security automation platforms

42
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,920
inside of cyber security

43
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,640
sweet uh same question for discord i'll

44
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,799
be it's a pop quiz we're definitely

45
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:52,560
gonna check that i really do want to

46
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,000
check that i'm not quite being so

47
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,280
sarcastic

48
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,799
a little sarcastic

49
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:00,320
um here's my background so why why am i

50
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,200
qualified to talk on this specific topic

51
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,880
i've got 15 years in cyber security

52
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,240
experience i've been doing this for a

53
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,399
long time the majority of it has been in

54
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:09,840
consulting

55
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,760
or in managed service providers so i've

56
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,319
seen a lot of different environments

57
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:16,000
i've got 10 years of that that has been

58
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,680
focused primarily on vulnerability

59
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,640
management programs within either

60
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,879
infrastructure and typical standard ones

61
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:24,720
or getting further into application

62
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,400
security programs and various other

63
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,160
pieces across the board

64
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,239
uh i don't think i'm under mike i'll

65
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:32,640
just take a step left um the largest

66
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,480
organization that i supported is a

67
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,440
global

68
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,080
manufacturing organization

69
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,400
it was a fortune 100 and they had over a

70
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,480
hundred thousand ip addresses and we ran

71
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,080
that program

72
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,400
it is and was massive

73
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,440
but it's one of these things that i've

74
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,440
seen it both large and small

75
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,080
i did start on new genesis solutions

76
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,800
which is my company it's i'm very

77
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,760
excited for it we've been very lucky

78
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,840
you know through everything so we grew

79
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,159
through kovid we've done really well

80
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:03,760
and it's through many relationships of

81
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,000
people that i have uh through here at

82
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,599
cactus con and other people that i've

83
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:11,040
known so i appreciate all of you guys um

84
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,280
i do have a number of clients you know

85
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,879
our average number of ips that i'm

86
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:16,959
seeing on a day-to-day basis is about 10

87
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:19,360
thousand devices somewhere between ten

88
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,879
and fifteen thousand across numerous

89
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:22,640
different customer environments health

90
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:26,080
care manufacturing some finance uh i i

91
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,959
do see it all across numerous industries

92
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:30,959
i'm also a vcso for two different

93
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:32,640
organizations and i started my own

94
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,599
company so that's maybe not as relevant

95
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:37,519
and i've presented at cactus con three

96
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:39,599
times so i really like this community

97
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:42,799
thank you all for being part of it

98
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:44,560
i will have one slide on new genesis

99
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,840
solutions because it's interesting the

100
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,400
rest of this is going to be naked slides

101
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,799
i started cyber i started new genesis

102
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:52,959
solutions because i wanted to help

103
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:55,599
identify the root causes of problems and

104
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:57,519
find the ways to help address that so it

105
00:03:57,519 --> 00:03:59,439
isn't so much that we're missing a patch

106
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,200
it's why did we miss that patch and

107
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,879
maybe it's not included in the tool or

108
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:04,480
product that we need to and so let's

109
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,000
back up and fix some of those root cause

110
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,920
problems and i really love doing that

111
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,400
and helping organizations i don't do a

112
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,840
lot of marketing you may never have

113
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,519
heard of me and i'm totally fine with

114
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:14,879
that because i really just want to

115
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:17,120
partner with organizations for and to

116
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,639
help transform

117
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:20,959
their environments

118
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,040
last one is is this is not a technology

119
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,360
problem i will have technology in here

120
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,800
but this is very much of a people

121
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,560
problem and then through people and

122
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,560
understanding those understand through

123
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,360
those mechanisms we will address process

124
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,120
and technology through that so i do

125
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,360
reverse that order a little bit uh from

126
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,280
some of the standards and

127
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,880
i've seen across a lot of different

128
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,479
industries

129
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:44,639
we'll move on i'm mostly mid-market but

130
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:46,639
i have no preference because it's a very

131
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:49,360
standard problem

132
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
back into this talk

133
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,320
i think that this is a very foundational

134
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,400
skill set that every single person

135
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,280
within cyber security should know

136
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,440
more specifically i think if you pick

137
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,800
this up you could get a job on monday

138
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,880
now there's a certain level of a mastery

139
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,039
here but everybody focuses on pen

140
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:10,800
testing and security operations and

141
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,960
monitoring response but vulnerability

142
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,440
management is just a pillar just as much

143
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,440
of a pillar in security operations as

144
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,280
every other activity through it and in

145
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,600
some ways maybe you know and i'm a

146
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,600
little passionate about this doesn't get

147
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,280
the recognition that it needs in terms

148
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,360
of some of these things so my hope is

149
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,199
through this talk you guys are going to

150
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:30,960
have a deeper understanding of

151
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,720
vulnerability management

152
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,360
and it will give you a more actionable

153
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,960
blueprint that you can use to start

154
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,800
running this through

155
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,400
so we're going to learn how to install a

156
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,080
vulnerability scanner we're going to

157
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,560
learn ways to enrich vulnerability

158
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,720
information with asset

159
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,479
information and then we're going to

160
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:50,639
understand when and how to automate the

161
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:52,800
process and there's some tricky pieces

162
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,400
in that because i'm sure many of us have

163
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,880
tried and then we kind of realize it's

164
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,319
bad idea and maybe we should just go

165
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:02,400
back to excel i'm very okay with excel

166
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,039
the other thing is a preface um some of

167
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:06,560
these slides like i've tried my best to

168
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,479
make them as big or as wide

169
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:10,960
as possible um but

170
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,720
yeah man i'm gonna have some tiny slides

171
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,560
i'll try and narrowly narrate through

172
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,319
those things when we get to it

173
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,479
but otherwise feel free to hop on

174
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:20,319
discord with no sound obviously no

175
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:21,840
feedback loops i won't stand under the

176
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,919
speaker if you don't either

177
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:25,840
and then contact me with the slides like

178
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,440
i have no problem with that it'll go on

179
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,440
youtube that's definitely there

180
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,360
but i'm okay with the slides or anything

181
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,520
else like that

182
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,400
so

183
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,639
setting the stage before we totally jump

184
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:38,160
in we do need to understand a little bit

185
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,400
of organizational structure for all of

186
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,800
this stuff like we just need to know how

187
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,199
organizations run in general we also

188
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:46,400
need to understand the background on

189
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,560
which we're coming so this is

190
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,720
the

191
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:52,160
nist.gov this is not my slide i didn't

192
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,680
create this this is what this tracks for

193
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,840
new vulnerabilities coming out there

194
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,240
it's not going well right we have more

195
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,680
and more vulnerabilities that are being

196
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,360
identified today

197
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,599
and they are high slash critical and

198
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:05,039
we're getting more and more that are

199
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:07,280
high slash critical and have an impact

200
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,840
to organizations um and certainly a lot

201
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,479
of things have changed since 2017

202
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:18,080
um and by reference uh we had our big um

203
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:22,000
experian no equifax equifac

204
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,680
moving on uh that big breach that

205
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,319
happened back in 2015 um and so it's

206
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:27,520
just like we can definitely see the

207
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,199
progression through all these things

208
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:30,960
through ransomware of his service

209
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,479
through all these other mechanisms it's

210
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:34,400
it's not pretty for us

211
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,800
what does the last year look like alone

212
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,199
like this is this is gross right like if

213
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:41,120
you were on a security operations team

214
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,120
you spent time in each one of these

215
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,199
environments significantly you probably

216
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:47,440
spent like a month worth of time looking

217
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,280
at each one of these things

218
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,720
and then of course because we all have

219
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,000
executives they looked at all these

220
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,080
headlines and said hey man what are we

221
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,160
what do we do about this of of water

222
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,080
treatment plants and other scada

223
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,919
environments what do we do about our

224
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:02,240
vendors and their ftp environments what

225
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,400
do we do about ransomware just in

226
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,400
general cassaya was there with more

227
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,720
vendor and of course chronos because who

228
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,120
wants to lose their payment processing

229
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,240
platform in the middle week of december

230
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,440
right before you close out your

231
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,560
financial year so well done for that

232
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,479
this was gross right this is the world

233
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,160
that we live in and here's a here's a

234
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,120
trick

235
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,960
next year's probably not looking so good

236
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,479
right like we already know it's going to

237
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:27,919
be there and eventually we're going to

238
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:29,919
have to investigate issues in

239
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:31,520
significant way so what is that

240
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,519
mechanism for us to get there we use a

241
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:35,120
lot of vulnerability scanners this is

242
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,519
okay this is very normal we need help in

243
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:39,360
some ways we use manual techniques but

244
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,760
you know let's be honest tools are great

245
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,599
a lot of us are very aware of network

246
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:45,680
scanners right we all start with that

247
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,680
but that's not all we don't stop the

248
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,760
program there we have web application

249
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,519
scanners and we also have application

250
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:53,680
security scanners in kind of a devops

251
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,560
space

252
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,320
and because there are tools here you

253
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,839
know the big three that we're all very

254
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:00,880
aware of tenable rapid seven qualis we

255
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,120
have open vos for all the cali fans out

256
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,959
there although i personally won't touch

257
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:07,279
green bone or open vos in a corporate

258
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:08,560
environment but

259
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,880
uh yolo to you too

260
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:14,959
um burp sweep acunetix zap and arachne

261
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:18,399
um i realized and so as one piece here

262
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:20,320
i'm never gonna give one vendor multiple

263
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,920
buckets so i realize tenable burp qualis

264
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,120
all these other vendors may have

265
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,440
multiple platforms but i'm just going to

266
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,519
gloss over some of those

267
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:32,399
we also have appscan netsparker probely

268
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:34,959
and sync hopefully i'm saying that

269
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:39,040
correctly i'm a little confused but um

270
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,800
you know these are all great tools that

271
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,640
we can use to help identify problems in

272
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,720
the space um the other thing is is

273
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,240
you'll get into this situation to say

274
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,240
like hey our organization just doesn't

275
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,600
have any money

276
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,080
that really isn't an excuse like we can

277
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,519
be creative about that problem there are

278
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:55,600
some open source solutions out there and

279
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,880
i tried to

280
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,200
i did draw that line out there between

281
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,560
you know where we have commercial where

282
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,959
we have some open source things so

283
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:05,839
before i get into this piece and because

284
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:08,240
i'm very much into relationships

285
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,640
how many people here are working for one

286
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,480
of these vendors or groups or anything

287
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,640
else like that

288
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,480
one two

289
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,320
perfect

290
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,000
yeah and i think it's great like these

291
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,360
these are these are amazing products um

292
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,200
and i think the more that we can build

293
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,720
relationships with the people working

294
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,399
here the more we're gonna get you know

295
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:30,079
that kind of equal partnership of

296
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:31,279
understanding all the way across the

297
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:33,279
board

298
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:34,480
um

299
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,720
why do vulnerabilities go unaddressed

300
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,200
right we've gone to enough conference a

301
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,320
lot of us have gone to enough

302
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,320
conferences i certainly have where it's

303
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,839
like you hear about the latest zero day

304
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:45,519
issue like oh my gosh this is the worst

305
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,600
and of course it's like well why don't

306
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,320
these issues be get addressed like

307
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,959
retell we demonstrate the severity of

308
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:55,839
these issues why don't they go anywhere

309
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:58,399
uh and and sometimes we don't know about

310
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:01,040
the problems which is fair

311
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,560
in many ways i think we've gotten a lot

312
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,240
better about disclosing these things i

313
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,320
think headlines are certainly there and

314
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,680
all these vulnerabilities have catchy

315
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:11,920
names unlike my title of my presentation

316
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,200
i think the next thing that's

317
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,560
challenging that we're starting to work

318
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,920
look into is we didn't know our vendors

319
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,839
were vulnerable like i think vendor

320
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:19,600
management is a is a fun one to start

321
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,079
playing in

322
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:25,279
but the example here is solar winds and

323
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:27,279
kronos

324
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:29,279
i apologize i like drinking water it's

325
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:31,279
also because i like talking fast so this

326
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:34,640
is a way to take care of both

327
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,519
the eye wasn't fast enough to patch

328
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:43,120
problem

329
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,760
so this is this is a fun one and this is

330
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,920
where equifax was as they were very

331
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,440
aware of the problems that they have

332
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,480
they just didn't have the right

333
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,880
remediation speed around solving some of

334
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,560
these critical problems

335
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:58,079
and the last one is a fun one in the hey

336
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:00,560
it's too complex um

337
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,639
i i we don't have the budget to do this

338
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:04,320
it takes regulation it takes

339
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,399
recertifying systems it takes all of

340
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:08,240
these other issues that are just like

341
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,120
it's it's super hard for us um i'll be

342
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,040
honest there's probably a lot of

343
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,279
companies that fit into this mark they

344
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:17,200
just don't make the news all that often

345
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,639
like very few times you raise your hand

346
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:20,160
and say like oh we just can't afford it

347
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,480
so haha for you like that's not really a

348
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,160
thing but i'm sure we all know of

349
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,079
companies that fit into this i've been a

350
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:28,320
part of a few i've had many executive

351
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,600
conversations around some of these

352
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,600
things to where we talk about risk

353
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,600
acceptance and everything else so i get

354
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,000
all this

355
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:40,240
so perhaps we get the right connection

356
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,160
with executives perhaps we say hey we

357
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:45,360
want to solve some of these problems um

358
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,040
but it still takes a while so what are

359
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,040
the reasons why it takes a while in some

360
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,120
ways you know first and foremost like

361
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,519
this is painful like asset inventory is

362
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:55,440
is generally the reason that we're going

363
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,720
to hear about you know some of this

364
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,560
stuff is it's like oh man i don't know

365
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,160
who to go to for this problem like they

366
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,079
own this system or i don't know who owns

367
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:04,160
the system or it's run by the business

368
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,480
and i don't know what's going on or hey

369
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,160
like it just lives in the cloud we're

370
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,480
fine right and so there's all these

371
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,200
types of individual situations out there

372
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,959
around asset inventory

373
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:17,200
at the end of today i don't want that to

374
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,880
be an excuse for us we have a lot of

375
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:22,000
tools reconfigured out we're

376
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,279
pretty smart

377
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:24,480
except for me

378
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,079
um

379
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:27,920
manual patching processes are the other

380
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,480
one this is this is the reality

381
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:35,120
as much as we have ws sccm chef puppet

382
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,519
automation platforms all of these other

383
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:39,680
components we are still worrying about

384
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,120
manual patching through these

385
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,639
environments and they could be for all

386
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:45,120
kinds of different reasons but this this

387
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,199
is a piece and sometimes it takes us a

388
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:49,760
while the the last one is a little bit

389
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,760
of the fun one and i think this kind of

390
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,519
chews into some politics and other

391
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:55,120
situations where we're working with

392
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,440
where it's like sometimes the it team

393
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,959
and the security team are not best

394
00:13:58,959 --> 00:13:59,839
friends

395
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,480
sometimes one tool doesn't agree with

396
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,680
the other tool in terms of a

397
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,279
vulnerability scanner doesn't agree with

398
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:07,199
the information coming out from a

399
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:08,720
patching report and so it's just like

400
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,800
how do you how do you work through those

401
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,279
specific problems

402
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:15,519
i like the joke it's funny

403
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:17,440
um so

404
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,120
what's our framework for addressing

405
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,440
vulnerabilities and i'm going to be

406
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,160
mostly very broad about this and say

407
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,880
that this is any vulnerability not just

408
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,880
an infrastructure thing to where hey we

409
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:32,480
just need to patch microsoft office

410
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,760
in general it starts with we have a

411
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,440
vulnerability scan we give it to the

412
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,600
support team they generally break it

413
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,920
down into a patch or a configuration

414
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,000
issue but it's not that simple either

415
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,560
because sometimes it's a os layer middle

416
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,480
layer or middleware

417
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,600
firmware update or something else

418
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,519
we have configuration issues sometimes

419
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:52,959
they're scriptable

420
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:54,800
sometimes it's just mainly logging into

421
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,720
a device sometimes it's getting rid of

422
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,240
the device and that's that would be an

423
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,399
amazing solution as well

424
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:01,760
and then of course we have security

425
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:04,000
exceptions um and other types of

426
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,760
components like hey instead of just

427
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,440
rolling out brand new systems that we

428
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,320
know

429
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,800
don't have the right security posture we

430
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,399
should fix our imaging right we should

431
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:14,000
get into configuration hardening and

432
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,360
everything else

433
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,680
we also have a development aspect to say

434
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:20,000
hey like we know what we need to do for

435
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,519
this like why don't we just update some

436
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:23,760
better scripts or packages to further

437
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:26,560
automate the patching process and and

438
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,800
then as we look at it like this is not

439
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,399
unique to a vulnerability scanner we

440
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:31,839
should be treating all things that we

441
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:34,079
discover in the same approach

442
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:36,480
um and and then working to trials all

443
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,959
that through and because you know really

444
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:40,160
we want to make this

445
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:43,600
a overarching programmatic view we

446
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,279
should be looking at what is what do we

447
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:47,519
have in metrics escalations and other

448
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:48,959
types of reports that need to go out

449
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:50,240
there

450
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,120
so

451
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,040
that's cool but what does it actually

452
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,199
look like so this is the life cycle if

453
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:57,040
you were to take it all the way from you

454
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:57,839
know

455
00:15:57,839 --> 00:15:59,440
from the very beginning all the way to

456
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,519
the very end of fixing things

457
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:03,120
um on the left you know we're going to

458
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,800
start with the big topics that we have

459
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,079
you know you're going to identify your

460
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:07,360
problems you're going to figure out how

461
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,759
do you put in remediation plans your

462
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:11,600
risk tracking reporting and then a

463
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,000
little bit of a tax surface or the

464
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,759
margins of some of these things that

465
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:17,920
we're aware of

466
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,440
so really in the top two we're going to

467
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,320
start with understanding our assets and

468
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,720
policies build out our tool to perform

469
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,120
the right scans and then security does a

470
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,920
fun thing by working to coordinate all

471
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:33,440
this we don't touch systems very often

472
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:36,000
you know we do but very rarely do we get

473
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,600
involved in the maintenance and

474
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,000
administration category and so in this

475
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,959
case once we drop off to a a service

476
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:44,320
request

477
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,959
we then move and let the business or it

478
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:49,040
work through the rest of those functions

479
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,800
and this sometimes becomes a black box

480
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,320
for a lot of us because we put in a

481
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,759
thing and then we just we have to wait

482
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,519
for something to come out

483
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:57,279
and so it's a weird game of plinko that

484
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:58,959
i understand but if we can map some of

485
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:00,399
those things out it's going to be a lot

486
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:01,839
better

487
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:03,440
and then that's where we try to play

488
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,520
that back into plinko through the risk

489
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,359
tracking and reporting

490
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:09,919
cool what is the it teams perspective

491
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:11,439
because quite honestly they don't

492
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:13,439
actually share the same one

493
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:16,640
so if you're in it this process is maybe

494
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,959
more familiar to you in terms of how you

495
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:20,480
approach they don't call it

496
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,160
vulnerability management they call it

497
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,400
patch management like and so it's very

498
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,919
it's a different world for them and how

499
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:27,599
they're approaching this and they look

500
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:30,080
at it as a monthly cycle and life cycle

501
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,840
that they need to manage these systems

502
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,679
and they started with inventory moving

503
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:36,080
into staging moving into deployment and

504
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:39,360
validation now i personally use this

505
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,520
during assessments with organizations

506
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,360
and i do and i put this in for different

507
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,280
technology segments so sometimes i'll

508
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,120
say how are we doing with windows how

509
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,799
are we doing with linux how are we doing

510
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:49,600
with

511
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,520
uh network devices and everything else

512
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,200
and this is how i apply this specific

513
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,280
one as a check mark to say how are we

514
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,440
doing in each one of these categories to

515
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,280
identify gaps in the process because if

516
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,799
they're doing all of this

517
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:02,240
we're doing pretty good in security

518
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,679
because ultimately they're bringing all

519
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:04,960
this in that we don't need to worry

520
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,240
about it

521
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,720
so what does that look like and this is

522
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,720
as i mentioned one of those slides that

523
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,080
it's going to be tiny to read so i'll

524
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,520
narrate a little bit in the case of

525
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:16,160
saying in that middle box is the staging

526
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,640
sorry middle boxes are patching process

527
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,200
first one is that staging testing

528
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,280
to where we'll download

529
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,200
the package to the tool we're going to

530
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,120
test the package configure settings

531
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,880
we're going to test against some systems

532
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,480
distribute packages

533
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,720
we will then work into scheduling that

534
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,840
with the business to make sure we have

535
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,080
the right down time we will then perform

536
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,440
the change

537
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,720
and then make sure that we have the

538
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,240
right up time

539
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,160
or validation on the stack after it

540
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,280
comes back

541
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,360
and then we will validate that the patch

542
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,679
has been successful um and work from

543
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:50,720
there that makes sense

544
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:52,320
two biggest problems that i find right

545
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,320
now are going to be in the in the first

546
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:57,120
and last section to where we're staging

547
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,280
and then we're validating in many cases

548
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,880
a lot of them are just like yeah we put

549
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,000
it through the system and then it

550
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,480
patched and they said we're 95

551
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,720
and it's fine this is this is great 95

552
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,160
is a really good number

553
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,160
um

554
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,120
i'll move on i'll come back to that

555
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,080
point

556
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,160
the asset inventory and other business

557
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,160
input processes are where they're going

558
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,320
to enrich their processes so

559
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,720
meaning they need asset inventory

560
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,600
application their os inventory all the

561
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,120
things in the cloud

562
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,200
reheard talks from the apis like all

563
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,039
those things are super important and i

564
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:32,720
think really valid in terms of how do we

565
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,240
make sure that we keep track of all that

566
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,160
stuff

567
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:39,520
the other one that someone asked in a uh

568
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,520
in a conference i don't remember which

569
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,600
one so i apologize for that but

570
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,679
we were talking about serverless

571
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:47,360
technology and the serverless code that

572
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,760
goes in there as a way of saying that's

573
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,440
that's an asset like you have serverless

574
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,799
code and how do you start tracking

575
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:54,960
serverless you know type of you know

576
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,559
infrastructure as code solutions to

577
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:58,160
where it's just there so because you

578
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,160
stand up structure and take it down so

579
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,080
all those situations that's you know you

580
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,760
need all those inputs to start tracking

581
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,679
them out

582
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:07,280
operational demand what do we have for

583
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:10,320
downtime itil processes

584
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,640
and then we have program governance as

585
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:15,200
we get in here security functions at the

586
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,240
back end of the process not the front so

587
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,919
i have seen some organizations where

588
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:21,120
they only start patching because the

589
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,039
security guy told them about a problem

590
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:24,880
and this is really where we don't want

591
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,640
to be and so in many ways this is where

592
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,559
we want to be working with it to

593
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:30,720
reinforce the processes that they

594
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,440
already have we're not trying to come in

595
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,799
there and rebuild their system we're not

596
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:36,480
coming there to say like you guys are

597
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,559
just so bad we're coming in there to

598
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:40,159
help validate where they have gaps in

599
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:42,000
their processes and we do that through

600
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,760
the detection the vulnerability analysis

601
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:46,240
and risk treatment as a way to to do it

602
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,760
so that way when we're always you know

603
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,120
many of us

604
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,320
being part of the vulnerability

605
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,480
management process or scanning

606
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,000
usually scan about a week after all the

607
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,159
patching pieces come in and and this is

608
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:57,760
that structure that we're seeing this is

609
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,760
why we do that so that way we can help

610
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:04,158
to reinforce or to identify gaps

611
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,840
so

612
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,640
installing and configuring the tool oh

613
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,679
we got it

614
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:10,960
so we've done this i'm just going to

615
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,799
cover basics a little bit on nessus a

616
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:13,760
little bit

617
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,760
i'm going to talk about

618
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:16,480
the

619
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,640
default configuration scan schedules and

620
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,640
then how i you know enrich them a little

621
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,840
bit so that way you get better

622
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,440
information we'll do a little bit of a

623
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,440
demo but before we do what is the

624
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,520
default as our baseline so this is what

625
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,880
you know pretty much all of us are doing

626
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:32,000
we'll install nessus pro or tenable io i

627
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,960
like tenable right that's my tool i'm in

628
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,720
no way is endorsing anything about it

629
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,480
but it is the tool that i personally

630
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,480
like please use the one that works best

631
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,880
for you

632
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,280
in general we'll do one of these four

633
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,440
things all the time and that's advanced

634
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,679
scans which is probably the biggest one

635
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:50,880
but sometimes we'll do some host

636
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,360
discovery basic network scans and then

637
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,360
some credentialed patch audits

638
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,720
in many ways we're going to need to make

639
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,480
sure it's authenticated so

640
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,720
as a note please make sure that you're

641
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,720
always doing authenticated scans i run

642
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,000
into that

643
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,080
and then regenerate the report you know

644
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,159
three steps super simple

645
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:10,480
the problem is it gets a little bit more

646
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,159
complicated as we dig through some of

647
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:13,440
these things so

648
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,760
i have to get over here

649
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:18,158
and do

650
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:21,039
do this thing

651
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:23,440
oh awesome

652
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,960
so this is a demo environment there's

653
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:27,520
nothing live so please you know

654
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,158
don't judge me

655
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:31,840
i installed it last night i'm going to

656
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:35,439
rebuild the system of course you do

657
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:40,039
demo gods blair

658
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:44,159
yeah of course but

659
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,280
yeah

660
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,760
super good

661
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,039
oh is that what the problem is

662
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:53,760
i can't actually see the screen

663
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:57,039
i'm not mirroring my screen

664
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:10,480
yay um i had it up but of course i was

665
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:13,520
yammering and everything else

666
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,880
i think that's an advanced scan right

667
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,400
okay

668
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,120
so

669
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,679
i i'm gonna probably drop off camera no

670
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:23,280
i could do it like this i was trying to

671
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,799
think i'm like the only place to put the

672
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:26,799
mouse was here so

673
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:28,320
usually when you click the advanced scan

674
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,640
you run through all of these things

675
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,799
we're going to dig in and spend about

676
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:34,000
three minutes going through some of the

677
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,679
scans and how i change certain

678
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:37,280
components

679
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,679
in general please try to make sure that

680
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:41,520
when we talk through authenticated scans

681
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,760
that you're trying to grab each of these

682
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:44,480
so

683
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,000
most of us will say we need to give it

684
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
domain admin credentials or some level

685
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,080
of highly privileged access it doesn't

686
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,240
exactly need to be domain admin and if

687
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,000
you do give a domain admin please make

688
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,159
sure it's not able to log in locally and

689
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:58,960
various other hardening techniques

690
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,600
but you'll need to use ssh

691
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,600
in order to get into linux environments

692
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,760
network devices and other components and

693
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,320
snmp 3 in terms of some of those

694
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,679
components as well these are all

695
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:11,679
credentialed scans and they're all very

696
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:13,440
different and in many ways organizations

697
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,279
are not fully exploring this and you're

698
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:16,880
losing some of the visibility because

699
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,400
you can't actually log into these

700
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,919
devices

701
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:21,440
and so you have vulnerabilities that

702
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,360
you're not seeing

703
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,520
from a generalized thing you're just

704
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,039
going to add in

705
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:29,200
i thought about logging in and joining

706
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,799
some random wireless network and

707
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:31,760
scanning right in the middle of the

708
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:35,039
conference i decided against that

709
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,760
grab a target run it through there the

710
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,520
schedule doesn't make much difference

711
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,200
the notification really doesn't make

712
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,039
much difference for us

713
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:45,279
and as we get into this piece is where

714
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:48,159
it starts becoming really interesting

715
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:49,840
in the generalized settings i'm okay

716
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:52,400
with it pinging but sometimes a ping

717
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,720
in this context will show up as dead and

718
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,480
then we'll choose to think the device is

719
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,760
dead

720
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:01,360
and this is what the there is a device

721
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,919
ping piece i apologize i can't see the

722
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:05,840
screen as well i believe

723
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:08,240
ping the remote host first

724
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,000
so sometimes you'll want to do this if

725
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,600
you know that you're turning off icmp in

726
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,600
the network but still want to want to

727
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,039
run that and so you can perform this

728
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:16,880
piece and make sure that you're running

729
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,799
it out that way

730
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:22,159
i'm okay with arp tcp and icmp from some

731
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:24,000
of those things

732
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,480
there it is assume the the if the ping

733
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,240
doesn't come back the gateway the host

734
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,559
is down

735
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,440
i don't leave that one you know let's

736
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,279
skip over that one

737
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:37,520
sometimes and this is your environment

738
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:40,159
we want to scan network devices

739
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:43,200
sometimes we want to scan novell and

740
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,679
operational technology this is really up

741
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:47,760
to your environment there are use cases

742
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,520
to run these especially because you

743
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,919
don't know what's actually existing and

744
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:53,679
i realize like why do we care about our

745
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:55,440
printers because sometimes that they are

746
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,360
vulnerable and they prove you know the

747
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,120
points that we're going to have a bad

748
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,439
time

749
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,120
the

750
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:06,000
ports here

751
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,960
there's a bunch in general the port scan

752
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:12,480
i think runs through all the

753
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:15,679
the one through 1099 i think is the

754
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:17,840
standard port list but you can

755
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,840
definitely specify this to all port

756
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,760
ranges even the ephemeral ports it will

757
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:24,159
take a little bit longer but i typically

758
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:25,919
leave this one as a default and run it

759
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:28,080
down from there

760
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:31,120
service discovery

761
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,120
i'm just going to try and see if i can

762
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,880
find any that i want to change i think

763
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,799
it's all in the assessment

764
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:39,840
override accuracy

765
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,120
general users provided by

766
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,760
i will f

767
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,440
no maybe

768
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:52,159
scada sorry there is a setting here that

769
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:54,880
i want to use

770
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:58,880
ah here we go so

771
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,320
one of the things i'll skip over some

772
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,679
other settings and follow back to it

773
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:02,880
because i'm taking a little bit longer

774
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,799
than i need to

775
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:06,720
some of these are interesting like how

776
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:09,360
fast do we want the scanner to run uh in

777
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,840
terms of hosts per scan and how many

778
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:14,240
checks do we want to do it on device

779
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,039
now

780
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:16,640
i will admit to you when i was doing

781
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,559
this i'm like yeah we're just going to

782
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:20,159
max this guy out and see how fast it

783
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:22,000
goes because you know we can crush out a

784
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,440
network and most of the time we have

785
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:26,159
really fast pieces so what happens if we

786
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:28,480
move it up to like 20 hosts in a scan

787
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:31,440
and we give it you know 80 simultaneous

788
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,559
checks per host that's going to go

789
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:34,399
through really fast right like but

790
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:36,880
what's what is that range that before we

791
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:39,039
start actually breaking the device right

792
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:41,120
that was my scientific thought of you

793
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,720
know hey let's actually see that and i

794
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,080
did build a lab i'll get into the

795
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,919
results for that to help run through

796
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:47,760
that

797
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:50,399
i didn't specifically build the lab

798
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:52,559
within new genesis the lab was built and

799
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:54,559
we ran through that analysis that would

800
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:56,080
be fair about the statement it was

801
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,720
definitely correct

802
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,640
so these are a bunch of things once

803
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,480
you're ready for it once you go through

804
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,320
a lot of these features i'll stop

805
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,159
clicking the button

806
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:08,080
you conduct a scan

807
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:11,600
and kind of run it through from there

808
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:12,960
there's a couple of things that i think

809
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,960
are super helpful

810
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,880
after you get into these

811
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,159
um

812
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:20,960
that i think are good so i did create a

813
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:23,120
slide to say like hey like what happens

814
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,200
if you forget a bunch of stuff this is

815
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,760
typically what we run uh the first one

816
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:30,880
is to understand that scanners need the

817
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,080
windows

818
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:34,799
rm service to connect because that's the

819
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:36,880
registry so even if you say i'm going to

820
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,880
give you domain admin credentials but it

821
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,880
doesn't have an ability to tap into the

822
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,480
registry it's going to have a very bad

823
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,240
time so you'll get a lot of really weird

824
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,520
scans to where it's like you're not

825
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,360
getting good information and this

826
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,799
becomes the piece that you need to start

827
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:51,120
chewing down on in order to make sure

828
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:54,000
that it connects correctly

829
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,520
we also want to make sure that we're

830
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,760
seeing the final updates if you're in

831
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,440
i.t you're tired of hearing about the

832
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,679
things that are superseded and so from

833
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:03,600
this aspect make sure that you're only

834
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,679
seeing whatever the latest version is

835
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:07,440
and so if it's superseded or there's a

836
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,200
roll-up or anything else you don't need

837
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,399
to look at that

838
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:11,760
in troubleshooting we want to look at

839
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:12,880
the logs

840
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:15,039
and then we have some specific use cases

841
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:16,880
here around

842
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:20,240
where we might need to look into these

843
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,360
there's a couple points like never send

844
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:29,279
credentials into clear right like you

845
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:31,360
would look at that and go like oh man

846
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:32,880
that sounds really risky i don't want

847
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,559
that on the network but at a certain

848
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:36,880
point some of these really old devices

849
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:39,279
can't handle this stuff like need to be

850
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:42,159
talking on ntlm version one uh some of

851
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:44,559
these ot devices can't you know read

852
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:46,240
want to know about them and so they're

853
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,919
very specific points where you may want

854
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:49,600
to be doing this i wouldn't do this

855
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:50,799
across the board but if there are

856
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:52,799
specific network segments that you know

857
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:55,200
are or do have a potential of having

858
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,520
some problems you know running these in

859
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,360
a specific scan won't hurt anything

860
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,399
especially when you know that there

861
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:02,080
isn't or they use a different set of

862
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,360
credentials

863
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:05,120
i don't advocate for this all the time

864
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,559
but it really does help to expand

865
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:08,799
visibility in certain cases

866
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:10,000
so

867
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,159
let's get into that that research piece

868
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:14,320
that i was talking through so re ran a

869
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,559
lab

870
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:17,760
and

871
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:20,880
reset this was all brand new um

872
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,880
basically said hey we want to make sure

873
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:25,679
that this is you know we ran it from the

874
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:27,600
simultaneous checks per host and we said

875
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:30,399
we wanted to run five scans uh per host

876
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:33,840
or 10 20 40 and 80. right we wanted to

877
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,520
see what that impact was and we looked

878
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,919
at cpu we looked at memory we looked at

879
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:39,360
network utilization we looked at all

880
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,720
those things to figure out like what is

881
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,559
that return on investment and like how

882
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:45,200
hard can we crush this thing with before

883
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,960
it starts having an issue

884
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:47,760
now

885
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,840
i've got a lot of experience in helping

886
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,919
organizations like i've kind of done

887
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:53,760
some tweaks and in general i kind of go

888
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:56,720
with about um you know 10 to 20 checks

889
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:59,440
per host i generally go with 10

890
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,760
to 20 hosts at a time

891
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,279
i scale it up from there depending on

892
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:05,039
infrastructure and everything else

893
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:06,320
and i've always had these assumptions

894
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,480
but i've never validated with science so

895
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:11,360
let's kind of trust science a little bit

896
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,039
the one recommendation for this is make

897
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:14,720
sure at least the scanning server has

898
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,720
some legs or beef under it to handle

899
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:17,519
this

900
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:18,640
because you don't want to crush your

901
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,320
scanning server

902
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:23,120
and do make sure you have free space but

903
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:25,279
here's what the data looked like so

904
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:26,799
again this was

905
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:28,799
five attempts per host

906
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:30,799
10

907
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:33,440
10 20 40 and 80. and what we're looking

908
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:35,679
at is basically the same thing right

909
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:37,519
like each client takes about eight

910
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:38,640
minutes because we give it about a

911
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:41,039
minute before and a minute after uh and

912
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:43,120
so from there on their average each one

913
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:45,600
takes about you know eight minutes the

914
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:46,960
largest amount of traffic that you're

915
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,559
gonna see on a network happens within

916
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:50,559
that first minute and then it basically

917
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:52,399
just follows up on various checks and

918
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:54,320
other things that are occurring and this

919
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:56,159
it had nothing to do with like 80 checks

920
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:58,000
like it didn't scale them out it just

921
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,600
said hey here we're just going to throw

922
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,840
all kinds of things at you now in a lab

923
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,840
environment this is not you know going

924
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:06,399
to be the same thing as a live

925
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:07,919
piece so maybe you have really old

926
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:10,240
machines maybe you have platter hard

927
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,000
drives and laptops and everything else

928
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,159
and that may have some you know kind of

929
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:17,120
user impacts but otherwise that's there

930
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:19,120
um eight minutes

931
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:22,080
uh the next one is um

932
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,919
you know there were brief points to

933
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:25,679
where it was spiking the network but

934
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:27,360
it's not like i never actually got to

935
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:30,000
100 for this so i'm not sure if this is

936
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,080
a bug a feature or some other type of

937
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:34,480
throttling thing in the lab um you know

938
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,960
we looked at all kinds of points

939
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,960
i did look at memory and the memory

940
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,880
usage between each of these points was

941
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:44,320
only about 200 meg in between 5 scans

942
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:47,120
per host and

943
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:50,480
and 80. so even memory usage is is

944
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,880
minuscule and so in many ways i don't

945
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,399
think this is going to have as much of

946
00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:56,399
an impact customized to your own

947
00:32:56,399 --> 00:32:58,159
organization but do run you know a

948
00:32:58,159 --> 00:32:59,840
little bit of science to validate our

949
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,600
own assumptions through it and we're

950
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:02,960
okay

951
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,960
at the end there's a couple of things

952
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:07,279
that i do recommend that you guys do or

953
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:09,840
change with this and that is the plug-in

954
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:11,600
output to ensure that you're

955
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,600
understanding exactly what it found and

956
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:16,000
where so sometimes it said hey i found

957
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,320
uh insecure credentials this will

958
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:20,159
actually tell you where it found those

959
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:21,760
insecure credentials that you can start

960
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,519
chewing through that information so so

961
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:25,440
it's not just a vulnerability it tells

962
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,360
you where it is

963
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,919
and then where is it exploitable and

964
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:31,440
that is definitely a thing for

965
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:34,080
executives

966
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:34,880
and

967
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:38,159
everybody i guess there's no difference

968
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:41,120
um so assets in context this is a fun

969
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,960
one i thought about i'll narrate this

970
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,480
one quickly i thought about maybe having

971
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,399
two people stand up and talk through it

972
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:48,000
but with mics and everything else online

973
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,039
it might be

974
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:52,440
way too cheesy

975
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:59,360
peter's happy to be here is the short

976
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:01,039
version for all of us this is his first

977
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:02,480
brand new role he's never done this

978
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:03,760
before

979
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,440
and he really wants to be successful the

980
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,799
problem is

981
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:09,040
he basically said hey here's your report

982
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:11,440
so hey john i got back a security report

983
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:13,040
that had a bunch of systems with a

984
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:16,000
critical vulnerability

985
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,480
our our admin john says okay well which

986
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:21,119
systems you got security comes back and

987
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:23,119
says hey there's a bunch of them and and

988
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:24,719
i only really got a bunch of ip

989
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:27,040
addresses for most of them um i'm not

990
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,560
sure really where they are can i send

991
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:31,440
you this report uh sure

992
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,119
and then he freaks out right like and

993
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:34,960
this is super normal like this happens

994
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,320
when you try this type of stuff within

995
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,599
an organization like this report's

996
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:38,879
massive i don't even know what half the

997
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:40,320
stuff is like

998
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,918
most of this stuff isn't even mine it's

999
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:44,079
over in operations or manufacturing or

1000
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:45,359
something else like that this is not my

1001
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:47,040
deal and then of course you get an

1002
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,320
escalation saying like yeah your

1003
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,000
security guy is throwing me you know all

1004
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,679
this extra work like he needs to do his

1005
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:53,119
own job

1006
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:54,399
and then the frustrating thing is it's

1007
00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:55,760
like where am i supposed to go like you

1008
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,440
give me no information documentation or

1009
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,920
details like it's my fault

1010
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,760
like and this is you know the common

1011
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:02,960
thing that you'll get within this

1012
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,000
problem

1013
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:04,960
so

1014
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,720
i'm going to follow up this topic a

1015
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,320
little bit we're going to go on a little

1016
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,720
bit of how you fix this problem uh so

1017
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,720
here's you know um

1018
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,839
a bob ross painting

1019
00:35:14,839 --> 00:35:18,640
um we don't have an asset inventory uh

1020
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,240
i've mentioned this before that i don't

1021
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:22,160
want this to be a complaint or a used

1022
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:24,000
tool for anybody else we have a lot of

1023
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,280
good data

1024
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,280
right and that's that's good for us like

1025
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:29,040
we can look at antivirus reports we can

1026
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,960
look at the domain we can look at all

1027
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,720
the other tools that we have we can look

1028
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:35,200
at last year's inventory and ultimately

1029
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:38,640
yes i agree it would be amazing if there

1030
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:41,760
was a managed and standardized asset

1031
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,440
inventory within an organization in fact

1032
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:46,079
even i.t wishes that the business wishes

1033
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:47,920
that everybody wants to have asset

1034
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:50,000
inventory but at a certain point we need

1035
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,520
to look at that and go like

1036
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:53,839
okay i'll roll up my sleeves so in my

1037
00:35:53,839 --> 00:35:55,839
challenge for you guys like

1038
00:35:55,839 --> 00:35:57,760
it sucks let's roll up her sleeves and

1039
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,599
we can use about three sources of data

1040
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:02,160
to come up with you know our standard

1041
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,560
and then honestly i i would love it if

1042
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:06,560
we got into some of the compliance and

1043
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:08,640
strategic things as well right so we're

1044
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,720
always going to get fqdn we're always

1045
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,480
going to get the host name we'll pretty

1046
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,240
much always get

1047
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:16,800
the os layer through the scans that's

1048
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,480
okay those are good things to start off

1049
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,720
with and where we want to level that is

1050
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,720
you know in that strategic piece is hey

1051
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,480
what is the overarching application that

1052
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,240
this server kind of aligns to maybe it's

1053
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,760
part of the i used to use apple's

1054
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,839
bananas and coconuts but after apples

1055
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:31,440
the company got so big i just decided

1056
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,520
i'll stay with bananas so after you get

1057
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:36,000
into the bananas application uh maybe

1058
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,680
it's tied to three servers a database

1059
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,119
and some other components like it would

1060
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:41,119
be nice to know all those things

1061
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:42,720
in general i think we can get there

1062
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,720
through all of this but in asset

1063
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:46,880
inventory understanding those ties it

1064
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,800
would be great if we can align that to

1065
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,320
the external network and figure out

1066
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:52,079
which of these devices are externally

1067
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:53,920
facing through a nat and that table so

1068
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,520
that way when someone says we want to

1069
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:59,520
focus just on externals we can do that

1070
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,400
so

1071
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,160
and then we get some compliance pieces

1072
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:03,200
like

1073
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:05,440
log visibility is a deal like how do we

1074
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,200
know that we're getting this information

1075
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,800
back to our sim and other components

1076
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,880
like having asset inventory is not just

1077
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,960
vulnerability management it is security

1078
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:15,200
governance

1079
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,560
so this is

1080
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,320
usually what i try and break it down

1081
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,760
into you're going to get your system

1082
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:20,720
types

1083
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,640
in this case i was doing it for a

1084
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,240
healthcare organization so that's why

1085
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:26,079
clinical is there you can substitute

1086
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:28,320
anything business operations

1087
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,000
good to go

1088
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
but we want to separate by the type of

1089
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,839
system that it is

1090
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:35,920
because often there's a different team

1091
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,160
that's managing that we then want to

1092
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:40,320
build in the different kind of zones of

1093
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:41,760
trust for it in terms of where it's

1094
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,160
being managed so this is where your dmz

1095
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:45,839
or internal application or testing

1096
00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:47,440
environments fall in

1097
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:49,200
and then we want to really push in for

1098
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,520
the shortest achievable timeline of what

1099
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:54,240
makes sense now i use the term sla here

1100
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:56,640
but ultimately you know unless you are a

1101
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,240
managed service provider that you have a

1102
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:00,480
defined service level agreement we can

1103
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,160
just call this the objective or the

1104
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,760
service level objective if you want to

1105
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,520
use the full term

1106
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,520
and i think this is this is kind of the

1107
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:10,240
piece of how quickly can we run as a

1108
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:12,799
standard

1109
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:15,359
the next one is

1110
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:17,280
you know we don't know how to quantify

1111
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,359
the risks of these environments right

1112
00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:21,200
like this one gets into like i'm not a

1113
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,640
risk management guy i don't know all

1114
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:24,400
this other stuff and so i found three

1115
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:25,839
that are amazing

1116
00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:28,000
and i really like them

1117
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,839
and and of course because farm animals

1118
00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:31,440
are amazing to write stories about we

1119
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:33,359
use this model

1120
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:35,359
and then we got into i did that just for

1121
00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:36,400
you because i know you're trying to take

1122
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,800
a picture

1123
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:41,520
my favorite one is the binary risk

1124
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,200
assessment model this one was amazing

1125
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,520
like honestly please go to this link and

1126
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:47,440
check it out it was so slick because

1127
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:49,920
it's literally yes no buttons

1128
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:52,240
so yes we have this problem no we don't

1129
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:54,320
have this problem and it was a really

1130
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,720
great way to kind of like evaluate the

1131
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:58,560
risk of the environment without getting

1132
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:01,119
into you know deep long excel tables

1133
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:02,560
with formulas and everything else that

1134
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:05,520
we may or may not understand i liked it

1135
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:08,079
so the problem is though is it doesn't

1136
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:09,839
handle the complex issues it doesn't

1137
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:11,839
handle the middle ground it doesn't look

1138
00:39:11,839 --> 00:39:14,640
at a description of of events and you

1139
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:17,280
cannot customize it but from uh hey i

1140
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,520
just want to check my thumb and and see

1141
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:21,520
how fast the wind is blowing it's pretty

1142
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:23,359
good right like we don't need this

1143
00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:26,000
massive excel

1144
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,359
there are some environments that it does

1145
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:28,960
make sense right like what happens when

1146
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,800
you need to have all that data and start

1147
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:33,599
trying to chew through it

1148
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:35,119
the

1149
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:38,240
pros for this one uh for the nist so the

1150
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:41,280
biggest one here is in this 830.

1151
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:43,680
many of us know the nist 853 which is

1152
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:45,359
the overarching framework for security

1153
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:47,839
controls the 30 very specifically is

1154
00:39:47,839 --> 00:39:49,839
about risk assessment and looking at

1155
00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:51,200
those things and that's where this

1156
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:53,599
framework comes into place

1157
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:55,599
there's a lot of people that know nist

1158
00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:57,200
and so what you're going to find is this

1159
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:59,119
is a very easily adoptable framework

1160
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:01,440
because everybody knows about it

1161
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,119
and so you can get some modifiers and

1162
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:04,400
everything else

1163
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,160
you do need to start using excel

1164
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:09,440
formulas you do need calculation sheets

1165
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,440
and i think it's sometimes challenging

1166
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:13,440
using a qualitative risk assessment

1167
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:14,960
model meaning

1168
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:18,079
high medium low or red yellow green

1169
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:19,599
it's hard to kind of choose through well

1170
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:21,440
i have three reds which one's more

1171
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:23,440
important i can only pick one right and

1172
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:25,119
so how do you then kind of separate

1173
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:26,800
those down

1174
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,880
and that's where the fair model comes in

1175
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:30,400
this one's fairly advanced and this

1176
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,800
starts to tap into quantitative risk

1177
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,560
assessment meaning you're going to get a

1178
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:37,200
risk that's like 7.8

1179
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:38,640
because you're going to start leveraging

1180
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:41,040
monte carlo

1181
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:43,040
analysis pieces to kind of say what is

1182
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:45,119
the range of averages that we have in

1183
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:46,560
these environments and and there's a

1184
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:49,280
whole talk to this specific piece

1185
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,520
that's amazing and i do not have time to

1186
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:53,520
go into it in fact there was a

1187
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:57,200
uh a b sides uh presentation a couple

1188
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:59,520
years ago and i'll try and put that into

1189
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:00,880
the comments to follow on because i

1190
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:04,960
think the guy just did a an amazing job

1191
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,640
but it's the ability to calculate

1192
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:08,560
secondary risks right so how do we get

1193
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:11,040
into brand damage how do we get into

1194
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:13,760
it's not just that we went down but

1195
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,200
there's also some impacts around

1196
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:16,480
customer and everything else like that

1197
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:18,000
and so it gives you more of a fuller

1198
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,200
perspective around those situations

1199
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:23,520
challenges is this one's going to take a

1200
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:26,319
lot more time right so you may be able

1201
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:28,000
to get through all of these

1202
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,160
but you don't necessarily have to and in

1203
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:31,680
many ways you might need to pick the one

1204
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:33,200
that works best for you which is where

1205
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:34,640
this one comes in

1206
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:36,720
this is the end of the road right like

1207
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:38,640
it isn't so much assessing one risk

1208
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:40,319
environment it's like how do we look at

1209
00:41:40,319 --> 00:41:42,079
all of them and figure out which are the

1210
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:43,520
priorities that we need to be chewing

1211
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:45,119
through and so

1212
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:46,720
this is that piece to say like hey i got

1213
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:48,480
three highs these are the ones that i

1214
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:50,160
should be fixing this month and have an

1215
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:52,480
ability to kind of figure that out so

1216
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:55,119
this piece here is is where we put in

1217
00:41:55,119 --> 00:41:57,920
the prioritization

1218
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:00,400
this is is live data so i apologize for

1219
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:02,400
the highlights it's been sanitized

1220
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,240
there's nothing sensitive in it relating

1221
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:06,720
to the customer that we were supporting

1222
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:08,720
but how do you then track all of these

1223
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:10,400
risks right and so we looked at it and

1224
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,680
said we're certainly going to be

1225
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:13,119
grouping

1226
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:15,839
by the vulnerability name and the device

1227
00:42:15,839 --> 00:42:17,119
type that we were playing with and how

1228
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:19,200
many systems that they had we then said

1229
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:20,560
okay we need to know when the tickets

1230
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:22,640
are closed that's super important and we

1231
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,240
need to know how quickly we're working

1232
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:27,040
that through from an escalation path

1233
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:28,240
we need to make sure that we're

1234
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:30,000
separating the systems in this case we

1235
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
have two specific vulnerabilities that

1236
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,359
are the same vulnerability but we're

1237
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:35,680
going to different groups so because the

1238
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:37,119
remediation steps would be different to

1239
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:39,680
patch on windows as it would be to patch

1240
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:43,040
on linux or unix

1241
00:42:43,119 --> 00:42:44,640
we also need to make sure that we're

1242
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:46,240
counting

1243
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:48,640
the remediation plans and then of course

1244
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:50,480
we need to keep risk in mind for that

1245
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:51,839
and so this is kind of what that looks

1246
00:42:51,839 --> 00:42:53,520
like so yes it's excel

1247
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:55,920
yes you can take that into a ticketing

1248
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:57,760
system but we'll get into that here in

1249
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:59,440
just a minute but this is kind of what

1250
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:00,960
that looks like

1251
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:01,680
so

1252
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:05,440
let's get back to our story with peter

1253
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:11,200
i wasn't ready no cheating

1254
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:14,400
so hey john i got a list of security

1255
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:16,000
issues that were identified on systems

1256
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,640
that you support um i checked it out and

1257
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:20,240
these are systems that you support based

1258
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:22,160
on last year's inventory and what active

1259
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:24,000
directory are saying uh these are

1260
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,440
vulnerabilities that haven't been passed

1261
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:27,359
in the last 60 days

1262
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:28,800
and i think there might be an issue with

1263
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:30,319
the patches that are being loaded into

1264
00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:32,240
the system or the tool

1265
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:33,839
i put together some remediation plans

1266
00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:35,680
that i think could work do you mind if

1267
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:37,680
you know we uh that

1268
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:39,280
do you have a couple minutes

1269
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:41,839
he's like yeah sure send me the report

1270
00:43:41,839 --> 00:43:43,200
thanks for sending me the taylor report

1271
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:45,040
on just my issues i agree with you on

1272
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:46,160
your plan and already have somebody

1273
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:47,760
working on updating the patching tool to

1274
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:51,040
include those issues no need to meet

1275
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:52,400
we don't care about that we're missing

1276
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:54,640
microsoft office we care that microsoft

1277
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:56,640
office is not included in the patching

1278
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:57,839
process

1279
00:43:57,839 --> 00:44:00,000
we need to fix long-term problems not be

1280
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,480
focused on individual kind of situations

1281
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:04,400
around that type of thing and the more

1282
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:05,680
that we can do that the more we can

1283
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:07,839
focus on larger level issues like the

1284
00:44:07,839 --> 00:44:10,079
next time log for j comes out

1285
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:12,960
or whatever is next

1286
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:14,079
i

1287
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:15,760
love this picture for so many reasons

1288
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:17,520
imagine being in the woods

1289
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:19,839
but being such a hardcore

1290
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:21,920
like just christmas fan that you're like

1291
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:23,920
i need to hook up my christmas lights to

1292
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:25,440
a water wheel because i need to make

1293
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:26,800
sure that i can get power to it like

1294
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:28,319
that's that's a different level of

1295
00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:30,800
integration there

1296
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:32,720
so what are some integration bad ideas

1297
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:33,599
because we've kind of talked through

1298
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:35,200
that like the first one is putting all

1299
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:36,880
the vulnerabilities into a report and

1300
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:38,880
just giving it to it like bad idea

1301
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:40,640
number one now i've done this right like

1302
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:42,640
you can say i want to take tenable and

1303
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:45,119
put it straight into servicenow or

1304
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:47,200
whatever your ticketing system is like

1305
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:48,720
i've thought that idea i'm like oh that

1306
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:50,319
would be kind of cool and it already has

1307
00:44:50,319 --> 00:44:52,240
those plugins and everything else super

1308
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:53,839
bad idea like all it does is create

1309
00:44:53,839 --> 00:44:54,960
problems

1310
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:56,640
the other one is telling all the it

1311
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:58,079
teams like hey we got this new tool we

1312
00:44:58,079 --> 00:44:59,280
want you to log into it and start

1313
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:00,800
managing all these other things like

1314
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:02,640
they need another tool to log into and

1315
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:05,040
manage work right bad idea number two so

1316
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:07,040
we already got the two bad ones there

1317
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:09,119
are some good pieces to start from right

1318
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:10,319
so

1319
00:45:10,319 --> 00:45:12,560
what we want to do is to identify three

1320
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:14,560
specific issues for an it team to

1321
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:16,400
address right so the security analyst is

1322
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:17,839
going to go into the scanner they're

1323
00:45:17,839 --> 00:45:19,440
going to pull down all the pieces and

1324
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:21,280
then they're going to put it into excel

1325
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:23,280
and then perform a bunch of analysis and

1326
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:25,520
enrich that data to identify hey these

1327
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:27,359
are the ones that make sense for us as a

1328
00:45:27,359 --> 00:45:29,839
categorical problem and i really

1329
00:45:29,839 --> 00:45:31,280
strongly recommend trying to look at

1330
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:33,520
things that are 60 days old and not have

1331
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:35,760
been released last month because that's

1332
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:37,200
where the real like you're going to be

1333
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:38,960
able to more clearly see that we're

1334
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:41,200
missing the process and that it's not

1335
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:43,119
just a simple patch that would be like

1336
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:44,880
oh yeah the system will just reboot next

1337
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:47,359
week

1338
00:45:47,359 --> 00:45:49,839
the other one is as we level that up and

1339
00:45:49,839 --> 00:45:51,920
say okay let's get out of excel which i

1340
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:53,040
agree with

1341
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:55,119
you know the one piece is if you can get

1342
00:45:55,119 --> 00:45:57,760
the budget for a grc tool you know this

1343
00:45:57,760 --> 00:45:58,720
is where you're going to want to take

1344
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:00,960
the scanner and put it into a grc tool

1345
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:02,720
to perform that you're going to get the

1346
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:06,000
same level of issue prioritization

1347
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,280
you're going to get the same level of

1348
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:09,440
trending but you don't have to manage

1349
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:10,960
through all the individual pieces of

1350
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:12,960
excel and i know like let's get out of

1351
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:15,520
excel i i hear you i love it sometimes

1352
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:18,319
there are financial barriers um but this

1353
00:46:18,319 --> 00:46:21,599
is kind of where we want those pieces

1354
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:22,880
um

1355
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:25,280
the next one on security orchestration

1356
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:28,640
platforms um this one's a super deep

1357
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:31,680
topic so a what is a sore

1358
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:33,440
this is probably one of been the biggest

1359
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:35,760
topic if if you want to make your cso

1360
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:37,760
both scared and excited at the same time

1361
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:39,920
start talking about this one

1362
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:42,160
and there is a lot of almost buzzword

1363
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:43,760
approaches to this

1364
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:44,880
um

1365
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:47,200
the biggest one to be more specific

1366
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:48,880
within security because there's not

1367
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:50,720
really a whole lot of automation that

1368
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:52,079
can happen within vulnerability

1369
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:53,920
management but there is a whole lot of

1370
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:55,599
orchestration and that's where we want

1371
00:46:55,599 --> 00:46:56,800
to be looking

1372
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:58,960
within this tool set

1373
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:00,480
did i have tools on site oh i did have

1374
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:02,079
tools

1375
00:47:02,079 --> 00:47:03,760
i've been having a lot of fun with

1376
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:05,599
cortex

1377
00:47:05,599 --> 00:47:07,280
you know as the tool it got bought out

1378
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:09,520
by palo alto that's been the one that

1379
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:11,520
reviews it has a whole lot of native

1380
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:13,359
playbooks and everything else many of

1381
00:47:13,359 --> 00:47:14,560
the other ones are already there and

1382
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:16,319
it's going to become like hey what is

1383
00:47:16,319 --> 00:47:18,720
your best tool that works for you that

1384
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:20,400
you've already bought into so if you're

1385
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:22,800
a heavy cisco shop then securex might be

1386
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:24,400
super great for you

1387
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:25,760
but this is one of those things of pick

1388
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:28,720
tools that make sense

1389
00:47:29,119 --> 00:47:30,880
so i sat and looked at it and said okay

1390
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:32,319
what are some of the indicators that we

1391
00:47:32,319 --> 00:47:34,880
need to make this like magical

1392
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:36,319
and this is where i came up with three

1393
00:47:36,319 --> 00:47:37,680
specific ones that you may want to get

1394
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:39,920
started with so the potential tax with

1395
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:41,119
systems

1396
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:42,640
with critical vulnerabilities and

1397
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:44,559
triggered in av

1398
00:47:44,559 --> 00:47:46,240
right so the indicator for us is to look

1399
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:48,720
at critical vulnerabilities anything

1400
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:51,440
that is a plus you know eight or so uh

1401
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:53,119
if you're using qualis that'd be a four

1402
00:47:53,119 --> 00:47:56,079
and five on a confirmed um

1403
00:47:56,079 --> 00:47:57,280
and then you want to be looking at

1404
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:58,800
mission critical systems so you'll need

1405
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:00,720
to kind of define those and then of

1406
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:02,079
course when you get an

1407
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:03,920
av alert that's the point that it's like

1408
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:05,520
hey i know i'm getting hit on this

1409
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:08,160
device it may not be from the same thing

1410
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:09,760
but i know this system has some issues

1411
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:11,440
that someone may be trying to look at it

1412
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:12,960
this shouldn't happen all the time and

1413
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:16,000
so ultimately you'll want to start the

1414
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,520
investigation or incident response

1415
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:19,839
process because you have an av alert and

1416
00:48:19,839 --> 00:48:21,119
it could be quarantined it could not be

1417
00:48:21,119 --> 00:48:22,319
quarantined but that's certainly

1418
00:48:22,319 --> 00:48:24,079
something that you're going to want to

1419
00:48:24,079 --> 00:48:26,800
put some more immediate action around

1420
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:27,920
the one

1421
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:30,400
next one is we have exploitable systems

1422
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:31,920
you know and we're kind of defining that

1423
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:33,040
is

1424
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:35,520
metasploit is available for this that

1425
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:38,000
has an external connection

1426
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,160
so we know that it has an external tag

1427
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:42,000
and we know that the vulnerability

1428
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:45,440
trigger there is true for metasploit

1429
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:47,680
in this case we don't exactly know that

1430
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:49,839
it's you know compromised certainly you

1431
00:48:49,839 --> 00:48:51,359
can make a decision between this is an

1432
00:48:51,359 --> 00:48:53,280
active investigation versus something we

1433
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:55,359
just may want to research

1434
00:48:55,359 --> 00:48:56,960
and so you'll create a ticket for

1435
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:58,800
initial triaging and work through it

1436
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:00,160
that way

1437
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:02,640
the last one is the front page of

1438
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:05,119
tracking vulnerabilities and so you will

1439
00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:06,800
always get some of these things like

1440
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:08,319
this is where

1441
00:49:08,319 --> 00:49:10,480
how often do we go back and validate

1442
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:11,760
that we're not seeing solar winds

1443
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:13,359
anymore like we did it once we went

1444
00:49:13,359 --> 00:49:15,280
through that whole investigation for

1445
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:17,520
like an entire month and after that

1446
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:19,440
month is over we're like

1447
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:20,800
totally fine

1448
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:22,240
but then what happens if we're playing

1449
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:23,280
with some other environment we've

1450
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:25,359
completely lost you know visibility to

1451
00:49:25,359 --> 00:49:28,000
that as an as a piece and so having a

1452
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,319
this is hit the front page type of issue

1453
00:49:30,319 --> 00:49:31,599
and we want to make sure that we never

1454
00:49:31,599 --> 00:49:33,200
forget about this problem to ensure that

1455
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:35,440
it comes back up so this vulnerability

1456
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:37,359
is disclosed within a threat report so

1457
00:49:37,359 --> 00:49:39,440
we're going to use this to hook into all

1458
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:41,359
of those threat feeds that we have and a

1459
00:49:41,359 --> 00:49:43,440
cve number and then say like hey this is

1460
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:45,359
that list and things that we want to

1461
00:49:45,359 --> 00:49:47,280
find you can certainly add more to the

1462
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:48,720
list

1463
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:51,040
and then when we run a scan the cbe

1464
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:53,280
matches against that list and says hey

1465
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:55,520
we found this thing again hey we found

1466
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:57,440
proxy logon again

1467
00:49:57,440 --> 00:49:59,680
it's not gone away and so in this case

1468
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:01,200
you would just straight submit a service

1469
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:03,760
request to the help desk and say like

1470
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:05,359
hey we need to fix this problem we

1471
00:50:05,359 --> 00:50:06,559
already know what the answer is we've

1472
00:50:06,559 --> 00:50:08,079
already gone through this but this

1473
00:50:08,079 --> 00:50:09,520
system came back and we need to make

1474
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:11,040
sure that we're kind of keeping that in

1475
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:13,839
line

1476
00:50:14,079 --> 00:50:17,440
the last one is questions i had two

1477
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:19,760
that were fun

1478
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:21,599
i liked the signs i didn't really know

1479
00:50:21,599 --> 00:50:23,760
what to do with it they were perfect

1480
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:26,559
do we have any questions

1481
00:50:26,559 --> 00:50:30,640
i'll stop rambling as very not helpful

1482
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:33,440
where can i get the slides i just uh i

1483
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:35,359
will put so

1484
00:50:35,359 --> 00:50:36,559
uh

1485
00:50:36,559 --> 00:50:38,240
how do i not flood my boxes i got to

1486
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:40,480
think about this in public it'll be on

1487
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:42,559
youtube it'll be it'll be on youtube for

1488
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:44,800
sure um i will send you the slides if

1489
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:47,200
you contact me through discord i think

1490
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:48,720
it's probably the easiest way to go with

1491
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:49,599
that

1492
00:50:49,599 --> 00:50:50,800
and i will make sure that they're in a

1493
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:52,559
pdf format

1494
00:50:52,559 --> 00:50:54,800
and so please reach out to me my user

1495
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:57,680
name uh that i used was pudge um i

1496
00:50:57,680 --> 00:50:58,960
thought it was funny it was mostly

1497
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:00,559
self-inflicting and everything else like

1498
00:51:00,559 --> 00:51:02,720
that that's where it came from um but if

1499
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:04,640
you want to capture me that way that's

1500
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:06,000
that's that one

1501
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,599
i'm not currently hiring but i do know a

1502
00:51:07,599 --> 00:51:10,319
bunch of organizations that are

1503
00:51:10,319 --> 00:51:12,160
so reach feel free to reach out to me if

1504
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:13,680
if you are looking for a job i'd love to

1505
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:15,920
help everybody find something great

1506
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:17,040
questions

1507
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:19,440
what's fun

1508
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:20,880
go ahead so

1509
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:23,440
you've

1510
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:28,559
when when do you like to do uh

1511
00:51:28,559 --> 00:51:30,640
network-based scans like we described

1512
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:33,200
today versus agent-based detection

1513
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:34,800
you know pros and cons of each or

1514
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:37,839
thoughts on that

1515
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:40,319
so the value of network-based scanning

1516
00:51:40,319 --> 00:51:42,160
versus agent-based scanning

1517
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:44,000
i look at it is if i can get into

1518
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
agent-based scanning pretty much

1519
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:49,359
as my primary starting point i want to

1520
00:51:49,359 --> 00:51:51,040
because there's so many situations with

1521
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:53,200
remote work from home to where agents

1522
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:54,640
are not where they're supposed to be and

1523
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:56,079
everything is a whole lot more mobile

1524
00:51:56,079 --> 00:51:58,480
within a network so i prefer agent-based

1525
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:00,640
scanning there is an additional cost

1526
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:03,040
typically into those solutions but i

1527
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:04,960
find you know the trade-off is is i

1528
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:06,800
don't i don't have question marks in the

1529
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:08,400
middle of the night around you know

1530
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:10,559
compliance in those situations however

1531
00:52:10,559 --> 00:52:12,559
not everything can install an agent so

1532
00:52:12,559 --> 00:52:14,000
the second path

1533
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,599
is to make sure that you are scanning

1534
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:18,000
with a network scanner

1535
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,920
and if you do play in the cloud you'll

1536
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:22,400
want to have a cloud connected scanner

1537
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:24,480
and then an on-prem scanner as well to

1538
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:25,520
ensure that you're getting the right

1539
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:27,359
level of visibility

1540
00:52:27,359 --> 00:52:30,160
so i i do say that both is the answer

1541
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:32,880
and it's not just the taco girl meme

1542
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:35,440
but you know agent bass is my preferred

1543
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:38,880
and backup is network

1544
00:52:40,559 --> 00:52:43,680
questions other things fun

1545
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:45,040
go ahead

1546
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:47,599
we gotta wait for the box

1547
00:52:47,599 --> 00:52:49,520
hey um hey

1548
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:52,240
with a lot of these new companies um

1549
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:55,119
and asset management um how do you track

1550
00:52:55,119 --> 00:52:56,640
and

1551
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:59,359
manage ownership of these assets itself

1552
00:52:59,359 --> 00:53:01,280
you know there's a lot of like uh cloud

1553
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:04,160
native uh companies that have

1554
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:06,240
you know hundreds of accounts and all

1555
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:07,760
the development

1556
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:09,839
teams have their own servers their own

1557
00:53:09,839 --> 00:53:11,040
ci cd

1558
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:13,680
um how do you you know is there like a

1559
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:16,079
good way to manage the owners to help

1560
00:53:16,079 --> 00:53:16,800
you

1561
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:20,160
fix the vulnerabilities

1562
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,200
i mean that's the million dollar

1563
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:25,040
question so i apologize for

1564
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:26,960
you know kind of taking a minute the

1565
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:29,040
thing that has seemed to work the most

1566
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:31,200
often is help desk tickets because

1567
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:33,359
there's normally a problem with hey i

1568
00:53:33,359 --> 00:53:36,160
need a system stood up i need this

1569
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:37,920
problem fell over this application

1570
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:39,280
environment has stopped working and so

1571
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:41,040
help tickets can sometimes help you to

1572
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:43,680
chew through those

1573
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:45,440
but in terms of like

1574
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:47,440
is there a great way to maintain that in

1575
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:48,960
the cloud

1576
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:50,240
i think that's a million dollar like

1577
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:52,079
that's a business level question like

1578
00:53:52,079 --> 00:53:53,760
start a company like start doing that

1579
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:55,599
because that is a real challenge to try

1580
00:53:55,599 --> 00:53:58,400
to get developers to kind of

1581
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:00,559
tie back to those projects and the

1582
00:54:00,559 --> 00:54:02,640
reason why i also say that is is because

1583
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:03,839
it's not like they're working on one

1584
00:54:03,839 --> 00:54:05,119
project you know what i mean like

1585
00:54:05,119 --> 00:54:07,359
developers tend to move around in an

1586
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:09,839
area that makes sense for them you know

1587
00:54:09,839 --> 00:54:11,520
and so i think that makes it

1588
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:13,520
difficult maybe try to identify who the

1589
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:16,079
business application use case is

1590
00:54:16,079 --> 00:54:17,440
right like the developers are there but

1591
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:18,800
they're the ones kind of building things

1592
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:20,800
together in an engineering way but it's

1593
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:23,760
in support of hr or manufacturing or you

1594
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:25,440
know business operation or some other

1595
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:27,040
function so maybe tying it back to the

1596
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:29,040
business you know consumer if we want to

1597
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:30,400
use it that way

1598
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:32,160
might be helpful

1599
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:35,640
i've seen that work

1600
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:43,760
so have you had much luck setting up

1601
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:46,720
scanning of pre-deployment inventions

1602
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:49,839
for example gold images or

1603
00:54:49,839 --> 00:54:51,359
networking

1604
00:54:51,359 --> 00:54:52,960
config files because that's something

1605
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:55,599
new i've been playing with uh tenable on

1606
00:54:55,599 --> 00:54:58,160
is deploying you know the show config

1607
00:54:58,160 --> 00:55:00,480
file on a network device and apparently

1608
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:02,000
tenable has a way of scanning that

1609
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,119
that's something new that i'm playing

1610
00:55:03,119 --> 00:55:04,400
around with right now and haven't had

1611
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:06,640
much luck so any information or insight

1612
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:08,480
in that area i'd love to hear it it's a

1613
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:10,559
longer conversation and would love to

1614
00:55:10,559 --> 00:55:12,160
kind of pin you back some of those

1615
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:14,079
details i may get lucky enough that

1616
00:55:14,079 --> 00:55:16,000
somebody from the new genesis team would

1617
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,400
post something into discord but i i've

1618
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:20,400
been here for the last hour and not on

1619
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:21,200
there

1620
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:22,000
so

1621
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,480
in general i would say that yes you want

1622
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:27,119
to be looking at configuration standards

1623
00:55:27,119 --> 00:55:29,839
but also configuration drift and this is

1624
00:55:29,839 --> 00:55:31,760
where once you set it as a gold image

1625
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:33,760
how do you go back on a quarterly basis

1626
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:36,319
typically or monthly and make sure or

1627
00:55:36,319 --> 00:55:38,240
have an evaluation so in many ways

1628
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:40,240
they'll align that back to the cis best

1629
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:42,079
practices or they have all those

1630
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:43,680
templates that you use and then you kind

1631
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:44,880
of run that

1632
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:46,319
and so

1633
00:55:46,319 --> 00:55:48,160
once you have those pieces you can kind

1634
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:50,559
of figure out the drift by saying like

1635
00:55:50,559 --> 00:55:52,240
every third week of the month if every

1636
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:54,160
second is patch and every third is

1637
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:56,240
vulnerability scanning we can then kind

1638
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:58,000
of offset some of our resources that may

1639
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,599
not be doing anything and so maybe on

1640
00:55:59,599 --> 00:56:02,400
the first in that context we would run

1641
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:05,200
you know configuration audits of seeing

1642
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:07,040
where we are from drift and so i

1643
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:09,760
generally schedule those that way from a

1644
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:13,359
looking at cis hardening aspect

1645
00:56:13,359 --> 00:56:15,200
changing and getting to a gold image is

1646
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:18,319
a whole project but the the drift aspect

1647
00:56:18,319 --> 00:56:20,160
is you know kind of running it that way
