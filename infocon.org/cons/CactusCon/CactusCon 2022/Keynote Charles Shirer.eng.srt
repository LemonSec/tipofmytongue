1
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:05,920
you

2
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,040
perfectly normal i didn't realize that

3
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,399
there was

4
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:54,160
nothing wrong with that i was on a

5
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,720
journey i just realized i just figured

6
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,760
like hey

7
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:01,200
maybe i was not cut out to do this

8
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,519
portion of it in computers and that's

9
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:05,040
how i really felt

10
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,959
you know and then

11
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:08,399
i'm i'm running the people that feel

12
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:09,920
that way all the time

13
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,560
but i'm here to tell you that

14
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,399
that's okay

15
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:16,399
you're still on your journey

16
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:19,040
which i'm still on the journey right

17
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:19,839
so

18
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:21,680
we go back to it

19
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,079
hardware hacking didn't work out for me

20
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:26,480
wireless hacking didn't work out for me

21
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,560
now here's arm assembly and i'm just

22
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,160
like kind of like all over the place

23
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,959
just still trying to figure it out

24
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:34,240
so

25
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,959
i move on

26
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,399
web app hacking

27
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:42,240
now

28
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,079
web apps i'm like oh this is this is

29
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:45,680
interesting this is something that i can

30
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:48,079
give it to i built a web page before um

31
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:50,000
i know basic html

32
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,639
um i've understood just the basics of

33
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:54,959
like javascript i said you know what let

34
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:55,680
me

35
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,920
let me just give this a try right let me

36
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:58,320
um

37
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,600
[Music]

38
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,200
let me go to some security conferences

39
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,920
because at that time i wasn't heavy into

40
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,519
i don't even think discord had started

41
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:08,000
yet it was just more so slack if it was

42
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,399
it was slack or um i even got an irc i

43
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:12,480
was still on the irc channels um heavy

44
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,079
back then as well too

45
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:17,200
with web app hacking so i'm like wow um

46
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,279
let me see what this is all about and i

47
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:21,519
just started asking some questions

48
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:22,959
just saying hey

49
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:25,519
um i want to learn

50
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:27,600
how to hack web apps which you know

51
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,680
that's a lot of times you might get some

52
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,279
good feedback might get some bad

53
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:33,519
feedback right um

54
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,040
again

55
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,959
i was super nervous about all of this

56
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:38,800
and i'm just like wow

57
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,639
let me let me just keep going with this

58
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:42,560
thing and i

59
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,839
stuck it out

60
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:46,480
i said okay i learned the basis of html

61
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,480
all over again i went through like

62
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,760
various tutorials watch youtube videos

63
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,079
wrote custom websites just just for

64
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:56,079
myself i didn't want to share it to the

65
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:58,240
world because i didn't think it was good

66
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,360
enough

67
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,880
i didn't think that i had found my

68
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,760
passion yet and i didn't share it so now

69
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,279
i'm like okay

70
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:07,200
you know what what am i doing here what

71
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,839
it what am i doing here okay so

72
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:11,680
i keep going though

73
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,600
for something i couldn't i couldn't put

74
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,240
this down i couldn't let this go

75
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,600
this was something i'm just saying you

76
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,959
know what

77
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:20,720
i like this

78
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:23,120
and then long and behold i found my

79
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:26,399
first cross-site scripting bug

80
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:27,600
and

81
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,600
i kind of like felt felt good about that

82
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,200
because it's like man maybe this is my

83
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,120
passion maybe this is something that i

84
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,560
really like and i really want to get

85
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,680
into

86
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,399
so i kept going and i kept going

87
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:39,760
and

88
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,920
long and behold i came to a crossover

89
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,000
one day and i just said you know

90
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,519
sometimes you get by yourself and you

91
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:47,440
start thinking about many things that

92
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,680
you've come across on your journey

93
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,199
and especially when you listen to music

94
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:52,399
that's when you really start thinking

95
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:54,639
it's like the quieter you are the louder

96
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:56,560
things start happening in your mind

97
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,839
so i was just like you know what

98
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,160
wireless didn't really work out too well

99
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,240
it was great while it lasted but i i

100
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,240
couldn't hold on to that passion for it

101
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,399
um again hardware

102
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:10,320
i didn't hold on to that passion for it

103
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,079
it was just it was just too much um arm

104
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:14,639
assembly i'm like okay um

105
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:16,480
the best i got was hello world and a

106
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,279
couple of other basic programs and i

107
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:21,120
didn't feel like i was able to kind of

108
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,360
accomplish enough in that aspect

109
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,760
and now here's webb

110
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:26,560
and

111
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,320
i have the passion

112
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,920
and i'm like i don't want to let it go

113
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,600
i'm holding on to it for dear life

114
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,839
because here's the thing

115
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:35,839
i'm like look

116
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:37,839
if this don't work what what am i doing

117
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:39,760
here that was my mindset at that at that

118
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,199
time i was like okay if this is not

119
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:43,279
working then what am i really doing here

120
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:45,519
is this it all together

121
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:46,639
but no

122
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:48,480
each day i woke up

123
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,240
it was something new it was something

124
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,320
new and exciting in the web space that

125
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,639
i've never seen before and it came

126
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:57,519
became more like an addiction to the web

127
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:59,040
like there was always something new to

128
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,639
explore i felt like there was always

129
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:02,320
something and still to this day it still

130
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,560
is but it was always something new that

131
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,480
i wanted to explore there were things

132
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,240
that i wanted to look at and i'm like

133
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,639
okay this is interesting so let me keep

134
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:14,079
going which i wound up doing

135
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:16,320
started looking at programming languages

136
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,240
right so i said okay cool i got the

137
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,880
grasp of html i got the grasp of

138
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:23,199
javascript in general and then there was

139
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:25,040
different levels of javascript there was

140
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,839
angular there was react so i'm like okay

141
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:30,720
what's the difference between react and

142
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,440
angular you know and just going into

143
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,759
that that format and again like i talked

144
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:37,680
about earlier within the cactus

145
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,279
methodology

146
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:40,880
creative thinking

147
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,040
so as i'm going through this and trying

148
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,880
to find my passion

149
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,240
and as we all know when you have a

150
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,240
passion for something

151
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,759
you get more creative because it's

152
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,440
something that you really enjoy doing

153
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,279
you want to find different ways to make

154
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:55,199
it do something cool i know i do

155
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:57,839
personally so i was like okay cool i

156
00:15:57,839 --> 00:15:58,959
learned this particular programming

157
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:00,320
language let me see the differences

158
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,639
between this one so i kind of went into

159
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:04,480
uh programming language frenzy at the

160
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,560
moment you know it's like okay

161
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,839
this is cool i like this over here

162
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:12,399
let me try a little bit about this oh i

163
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:14,240
heard about this this um programming

164
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,800
language called haskell in um discord

165
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,240
let me let me let me hop around a little

166
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,759
bit and just play around with this stuff

167
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:20,880
right

168
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:24,000
and then i ran into golang

169
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,440
and i was like oh

170
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,600
this is interesting

171
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,839
but the thing i wanted to know is

172
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:32,000
did it work with the web and i started

173
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,600
doing research with that and then of

174
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,600
course people were doing cool things on

175
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,959
the web with

176
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:40,079
golang right and i'm just like wow

177
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:41,839
then

178
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:43,839
from there

179
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:45,920
and this is the language that i i rock

180
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,759
with to this day and i love it because

181
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:50,880
it's it's fresh as new as raw and i kind

182
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,360
of look at it as the plato language

183
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,519
rust programming language right

184
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:57,040
and most people when i when i say russ

185
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:00,079
they're like well

186
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:02,320
charles isn't it is it rust like a

187
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,240
system levels programming language

188
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,599
correct it is

189
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:08,319
but they do have crates that allow you

190
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:11,839
to play with web apis as well too

191
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:13,679
so you can you it does have some

192
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:15,760
functionality on the web

193
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:19,280
not as well as like a python or a php

194
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,359
or um

195
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:23,520
for that matter ruby right

196
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,559
but

197
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:26,799
it's baby steps that's why i call it the

198
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:28,720
the plato programming language because

199
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,480
you can kind of try to mold it into

200
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,760
something it's a new project you can

201
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,520
just mold it into what you want it to

202
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,080
become maybe one day i'll write my own

203
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,360
crate

204
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,799
i'm getting there

205
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:40,880
but i'm just not there yet and that's

206
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,080
okay

207
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,480
because again this is something that i

208
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,120
feel i'm on that i'm on that journey the

209
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,200
passion hasn't died yet i'm still

210
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,200
rolling with it i still got my creative

211
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,480
thinking

212
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,320
ultimately with a smile

213
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,480
so i'm still going with this thing here

214
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,799
so i'm like okay you know what

215
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:00,559
web is where it's at um you know what

216
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:02,240
i'm gonna stay on this path the web this

217
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,240
is what i'm gonna focus on

218
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,080
and i'm just gonna keep doing endless

219
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,600
research and keep learning endless

220
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,440
things from other folks that's been in

221
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,280
it a lot longer than me

222
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,360
however and i'm just like wow this is

223
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,760
this is cool stuff um the code that you

224
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,840
see at the bottom there um i'm actually

225
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,160
working on like a basic encoder like

226
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,000
just to kind of encode my like web

227
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,440
payloads so when i'm attacking web

228
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,840
applications i'm actually just kind of

229
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,679
doing like an all-in-one encoder to

230
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:28,640
where

231
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,960
um i'm actually doing like url encoding

232
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,640
basically for encoding or hex encoding

233
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,039
so that's been pretty exciting so far so

234
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:37,679
good right

235
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:41,440
next up i'm like okay

236
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:45,600
what else is there about the web

237
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,039
and mind you i'm still staying in the

238
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:48,480
web space

239
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,799
and i said oh so what do they have on on

240
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:53,120
browsers like browser security and

241
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:56,320
hacking in general and apis i'm like oh

242
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,559
and then i ran across this project

243
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:00,320
called beef the browser exploitation

244
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,840
framework project and i'm just like oh

245
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,760
this is pretty interesting

246
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,160
and then from there i'm just like okay

247
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,240
here we go the passion is still going so

248
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,000
i'm like okay cool i'm learning more

249
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,160
about the web application side i'm

250
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,320
learning more about the server side web

251
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,160
apps and then here's the browser i'm

252
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:19,360
like oh here we go another another

253
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:22,080
another like i'll say another path

254
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,080
within the web that's carved out right

255
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,679
so i'm like wow

256
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:27,360
so again

257
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,919
tried out the the beef exploitation

258
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:31,840
project right and

259
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,360
i actually started talking with other

260
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,200
folks who were actually working with

261
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,200
this project and doing like browser

262
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,679
hacking level stuff

263
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:41,200
of course a lot longer than i have so i

264
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,280
started reaching out just to say hey

265
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,880
what information what what should i be

266
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,000
looking at when i'm looking at the

267
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,080
browser what um

268
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,840
you know is can you can you go can you

269
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,520

271
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:53,760
just want you to give me some guidance

272
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,000
i'm like i'm on this thing and i can't

273
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,120
put it down

274
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,400
and i've got some great answers and

275
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,240

280
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,000
it's still burning

281
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,240
i still love webb and i'm just like okay

282
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,400
i can get with this this is it this this

283
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,159
is what i've been looking for this is

284
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:18,320
what i've been holding on to

285
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:21,840
and i say this to say the following

286
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:24,240
and this goes for if you're a threat

287
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,480
hunter if you're a threat hunter and you

288
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,400
and you and that passion is still

289
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,039
burning please i tell you hold on to it

290
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:33,039
because again this is all part of your

291
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:34,480
journey this is the story that you're

292
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,080
writing and you're and when you're when

293
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,520
you're going through this and you really

294
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,679
enjoy it you you become not only you

295
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:42,159
become better at it but again you start

296
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:44,480
exercising those creative thinking

297
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,000
skills you start doing

298
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,679
more creative things because you're

299
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:49,280
passionate about it

300
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,280
you know the cactus methodology for

301
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,480
today right

302
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,320
so

303
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,080
with the with browser hacking i was like

304
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,080
oh this is pretty interesting i started

305
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,720
getting into that started looking at

306
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,880
why i started looking at the the old

307
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,880
wasp like framework right and just

308
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,799
started looking at that and the

309
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:09,440
methodology started going all over port

310
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,600
swigger reading their articles paying

311
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,679
attention if somebody tweeted something

312
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:15,840
out related to hacking webs whether it's

313
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:18,559
cookies tokens anything with the web or

314
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:20,640
in general and i was like oh this is

315
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,480
this is interesting stuff

316
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:26,159
so i kept going and still

317
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,559
which we're going to talk about here

318
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:31,440
it bleeds into

319
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,200
web 3.0

320
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,320
right

321
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,840
so

322
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:38,400
i'm here to say live

323
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,520
that

324
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,600
my passion is

325
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,520
the web

326
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:44,960
period

327
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,960
anything related to the web whether it's

328
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,039
apps browsers

329
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:50,640
and we're going to talk about crypto

330
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:53,039
security here

331
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:55,600
um cryptocurrency

332
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,360
security

333
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,960
and i'll tell you why because that kind

334
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,039
of bleeds into what i'm talking about

335
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:03,039
when it comes to like web applications

336
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:05,120
and hacking on the web and everything

337
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,080
else

338
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,559
um at first i said all right

339
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:10,480
i know this just came up

340
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:13,280
but this is something totally different

341
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,799
i said let me see what it's all about

342
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:16,559
but i'm not giving up my passion here

343
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:18,400
this this is my baby right here i found

344
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,679
my passion

345
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:21,919
this is the this is everything there's

346
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:24,640
still so much to do in this space from

347
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,880
learning the security of apis hacking

348
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,679
apis and where the web is going in that

349
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:32,159
direction as far as like with cloud apis

350
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:34,480
in general and i'm just like okay i

351
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,400
don't care what happens

352
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,400
in the cryptocurrency space i'm not

353
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,120
giving up on the web at all i found my

354
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,799
passion this is where i'm staying right

355
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:45,039
now and i'm here with it

356
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:49,120
so i did a little bit of research

357
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:52,000
and found out that they use like they

358
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
use like d apps like in the in the

359
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,120
crypto space they use d apps um

360
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,159
and

361
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:00,240
you need like the the meta mask i was

362
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,159
looking at the metamask wallet which is

363
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:05,440
a browser extension which relates to

364
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:08,159
browser hacking which opens up a new can

365
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:11,039
of worms a new toy that i want to look

366

still doing creative things in the web

380
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,720
space

381
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:43,919
and now

382
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:46,640
looking at cryptocurrency

383
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:49,360
and web 3.0

384
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:52,400
to add into the space to add into

385
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,240
what i'm already doing when it comes to

386
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,559
web

387
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:00,240
i say this to to everyone here today

388
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,880
if you're sitting in the audience

389
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,720
and you you haven't found your passion

390
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:05,679
yet

391
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:07,919
that's okay

392
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:10,240
i chose to talk about this today because

393
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:13,600
i wanted someone out there to see

394
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,000
that they're not the only one that

395
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,559
hasn't found their passion yet and they

396
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:20,080
do have a chance because i'm living

397
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,520
proof

398
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:22,720
to find

399
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,240
your passion and something that you're

400
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,240
passionate about

401
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,600
so

402
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:30,080
take this with a grain of salt

403
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:32,640
definitely don't give up

404
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,720
definitely keep pushing in the right

405
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,159
direction

406
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:37,919
and if you're feeling if you're feeling

407
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:40,240
like you've you've lost your fire

408
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,520

always keep that cactus methodology

439
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,600
in the back of your head

440
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:50,080
you're continuously

441
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,720
constantly thinking creative thoughts

442
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,480

00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,760
have no control over that but

445
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,840
um ultimately with a smile just kind of

446
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,600
helps a little bit

447
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:04,480
