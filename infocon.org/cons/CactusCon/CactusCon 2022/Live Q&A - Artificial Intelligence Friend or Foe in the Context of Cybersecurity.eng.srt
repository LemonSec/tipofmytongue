1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,480
or a big data engineer role unless you

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:04,319
have prior software development

3
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:06,319
experience now understand that data

4
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:09,440
engineering and data science are

5
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:11,759
although related but fairly separate

6
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:13,679
domains in terms of the skills that you

7
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:17,039
require and data engineering is more on

8
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:20,000
uh software on devops on deployment

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,160
monitoring etc not so much on data

10
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,840
analysis and visualization so you should

11
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,840
not be applying for data engineer rules

12
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,439
and you'll realize this if you read job

13
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:30,400
descriptions carefully you should also

14
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,000
not be applying for machine learning

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,399
engineer roles just immediately unless

16
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:36,399
again if you unless you have external

17
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:38,559
hey there your development experience so

18
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:40,960
that's oh now i can't hear you

19
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,559
if you have software development

20
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:44,239
experience then you can try and approach

21
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:46,160
a machine learning engineer role as well

22
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,399
but if not i would keep to a data

23
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:51,120
analyst or a junior data scientist

24
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,520
you will see roles like eight researcher

25
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,920
or ai practitioner researcher deep

26
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,840
learning researcher okay i would avoid

27
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:58,640
because

28
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,320
unless you have done ideally appeal

29
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,360
or you have a master's degree all right

30
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,960
machine learning if you want a phd or a

31
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,240
master's degree

32
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,479
yep

33
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,640
ideally a published paper but if not at

34
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,479
least some a couple of research projects

35
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:16,080
where you've tried to push the state of

36
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,119
the art by exploring new techniques or

37
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:21,280
uh maybe all right i think we are good

38
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,400
to go recently on the live q a applying

39
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,439
for

40
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:26,960
am in a different room than the person

41
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,880
who is running this so i'm just i'm

42
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,040
going to hope that that's true

43
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,320
thanks so much for your presentation

44
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,758
today you really appreciate it

45
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,640
we have

46
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,520
one

47
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,680
question that has popped up already in

48
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,200
the q a

49
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,079
so

50
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:46,798
let's take a look

51
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:50,159
are there best practices for segmenting

52
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:52,479
and protecting home networks to avoid or

53
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:55,840
mitigate iot vulnerabilities

54
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,840
that's a great question actually um so

55
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,799
something i was working on

56
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:03,200
very relevant

57
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,640
so i pulled out one of my checkpoint

58
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,040
gateways and decided all right i'm going

59
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,000
to repurpose this to segment my network

60
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,599
a little bit better you know i haven't

61
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:13,200
done a couple of things oh my gosh at

62
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,599
this point

63
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,360
and just because i'm too lazy to press

64
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,480
the button

65
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,959
on the wall to

66
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,400
i need to segment these as best i can

67
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,599
so i'm going to program the way i want

68
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:30,840
to set it up is a dedicated

69
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:34,840
wireless language

70
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,400
i know not everyone has

71
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,920
listening in their home

72
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,360
but there's some awesome you know open

73
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,920
source tools out there as well then as i

74
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:00,200
mentioned you need open source firewalls

75
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:17,959
keep those segmented away from these

76
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,599
which is really interesting you know

77
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:31,519
when we talk about ai the the validity

78
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:32,480
of your

79
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,640
of what comes out of your ai depends on

80
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,640
the data that you feed it you mentioned

81
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,080
you mentioned data a little bit and

82
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,440
having uh

83
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,440
the right amount of it how do you make

84
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,360
sure that even though you have a lot of

85
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,440
data that it is the right kind of data

86
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,360
for your training set from database oh

87
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,280
man

88
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,959
the question everyone's trying to answer

89
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:53,040
you know um

90
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,200
i think a lot of it

91
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,319
probably saw on one of the slides

92
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,560
so

93
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:03,849
[Music]

94
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:15,480
for checkpoints

95
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,840
with um we know that this is you know

96
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,840
this is solid data because it's coming

97
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:32,800
from our

98
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,680
security solutions

99
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,400
and of course it does take i think it's

100
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,880
important to have

101
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,800
uh

102
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,600
machine learning algorithm or model or

103
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,360
artificial intelligence that results

104
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,840
from yeah

105
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,960
the entire time

106
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,400
and and not even just worthless but

107
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,000
sometimes dangerous if it's trained on

108
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,680
the wrong types of activities and it

109
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,800
can't

110
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,639
discern the things you want

111
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:33,199
machine learning

112
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,120
so you probably don't given given the

113
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,560
amount of data that you have and the

114
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,160
fact that it's validated you probably

115
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,759
don't have to get into simulated data

116
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:41,440
very much is my guess

117
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,280
that you can i would assume not now i

118
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,039
i'm definitely going to say i'm not our

119
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:46,880
machine learning scientist or our data

120
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,800
scientist and such so some of that

121
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,720
information uh you know i'm not pervy

122
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,440
too i'd love to be but uh some of it's

123
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,600
kind of you know tightly controlled but

124
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,560
i

125
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,639
i believe they do simulate quite a bit

126
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:00,240
you know we have honey pots all over the

127
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,600
world that we're collecting data from

128
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,759
too um and we're able to take you know

129
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:05,520
those samples from those honey pots you

130
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,440
know the whether it's files attempted to

131
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,800
upload to a you know a completely um

132
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,440
fake web server we're able to grab those

133
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,120
we also work with a lot of our industry

134
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,880
partners even our competitors we share a

135
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,039
lot of intelligence so we can take you

136
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:20,800
know different data sets and different

137
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,800
you know either malignant or benign

138
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,520
files and then test our um

139
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,280
test our intelligence or our models

140
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,039
against it

141
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:30,800
excellent yeah

142
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,680
um

143
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,440
so i'm wondering you know we we talk

144
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,680
about the benefits of ai a lot

145
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,360
do you think there are areas where

146
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,840
human expertise will

147
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,638
will stay

148
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:47,360
ahead of the of the machine curve i

149
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,919
guess is one way to say it

150
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:51,680
where are humans where do you think

151
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,440
humans are going to stay better than

152
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,199
machines if there are any areas in this

153
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:56,960
particular domain

154
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,360
yeah so i would liken this to you know

155
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,520
if you go back 10 15 20 years people are

156
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,039
saying robots are going to replace us

157
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:05,360
all you know for the workforce um it

158
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,880
still hasn't happened i still don't

159
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,160
think it's going to happen you know

160
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,560
there's times when human intervention or

161
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,720
our expertise our creativity

162
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,120
i don't think you can replicate that

163
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,039
via an ai

164
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:18,880
you know if you think of the the most

165
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,479
powerful attacks that we've seen thus

166
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:22,560
far they're not artificial intelligence

167
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,639
driven they might have been tested using

168
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:26,240
machine learning in some way or they

169
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,919
came up with some cooler ideas with it

170
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:30,479
but it still requires human ingenuity

171
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:32,000
um i think that's always going to be

172
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
necessary i think the the computers can

173
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,400
be the you know the um the horsepower

174
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,319
the the you know be able to

175
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:39,360
they can handle that amount of

176
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,720
throughput and make decisions very

177
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,120
quickly um but completely eliminating

178
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,199
humans from that factor or from that

179
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:47,039
that process i think we're always going

180
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:48,319
to be needed to

181
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:49,280
um

182
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,800
you know dive a little bit deeper you

183
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,400
know make those correlations and such

184
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,479
but i think ai

185
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:56,160
i think the biggest benefit that we're

186
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,840
seeing from it is it's reducing the

187
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,879
noise you know there's a common commonly

188
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:02,960
we say uh you know like alert fatigue

189
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,360
among analysts and i think the the

190
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,800
biggest benefit that comes from

191
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,080
artificial intelligence and machine

192
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,599
learning is the ability to reduce that

193
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:11,280
noise so they're only seeing the things

194
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,440
that are truly you know important for

195
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,520
them uh to be able to dive deeper into

196
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,360
and use their you know their human brain

197
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,160
uh to to render a decision

198
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,039
right

199
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:23,039
yeah we talk a lot about this as

200
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,560
tipping and queuing is kind of the

201
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,400
military phrase of

202
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:31,120
can you provide a better set of you know

203
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,679
more signal to the noise so that a human

204
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,360
can take that and make some kind of an

205
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,120
operational decision with it because

206
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,599
while ai is great at understanding the

207
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:41,279
past landscape through the data that's

208
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:43,279
trained on it may not be able to apply

209
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:45,760
that to an updated context where it

210
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,240
doesn't have the full picture exactly i

211
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,600
think it'll be interesting to see like

212
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,600
the evolution of artificial intelligence

213
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,440
over the years you know over the next

214
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,920
because we're at the very very cusp of

215
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,080
what i think ai can truly do i mean if

216
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:58,800
you

217
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,480
liken it to you know some of the cars

218
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,720
that are using it or the devices that

219
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,160
are listening in my house right now you

220
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,920
know sometimes i tell him to do one

221
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,920
thing and she'll tell me you know yes

222
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,320
the weather's great today it's uh 62

223
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,160
degrees outside and i'm like i asked you

224
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:15,440
to turn off the light but all right

225
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,360
but i think over time you know it's

226
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,760
going to become much more powerful

227
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,760
right and that actually leads into my

228
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,920
next question was where do you think the

229
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,399
next uh the next steps of this are going

230
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,080
to be particularly where when it comes

231
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,760
to ransomware

232
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,080
either on the the defensive or offensive

233
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,360
side

234
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,360
you know that's interesting um yeah i

235
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,959
mean obviously i highlighted in the the

236
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:38,880
presentation uh which i think was the

237
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,000
most interesting part and i'll

238
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,839
definitely you know make sure that uh a

239
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:43,200
high quality version goes out for

240
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,480
everyone so you can see what was

241
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,120
happening inside of vs code with copilot

242
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,360
but yeah we apologize for that i think

243
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,440
we had an upload error on our side no

244
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,040
problem hey it's moved out my skin so it

245
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,599
was nice no

246
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,839
but

247
00:09:57,839 --> 00:09:59,440
oh i lost my train of thought there let

248
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,760
me pull it back um

249
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,040
remind me one more time where are we

250
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,320
going oh uh

251
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,760
where you see the next the next

252
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,519
interesting evolutionary steps in using

253
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:09,839
ai and ransomware whether it's uh you

254
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:10,640
know

255
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,800
using it for defense against ransomware

256
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,480
or maybe where adversaries would be

257
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,160
using it offensively

258
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,680
well i think if

259
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,680
so i'm not a rust programmer by any

260
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,920
means like i i know a bit of typescript

261
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,040
and that's kind of like where i've

262
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,880
stayed you know html i can do that all

263
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:27,600
day um but i'm really not a rust

264
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,440
programmer by by any stretch of the

265
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,279
imagination but by just creating that

266
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:33,120
comment and telling it like hey here's a

267
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,000
general function i want you to perform

268
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,160
you know it spit it out and it works um

269
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,000
i actually was able to test it later on

270
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,680
and see like okay can this function

271
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,399
encrypt a directory um on a windows

272
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:47,040
machine and it did work so

273
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,880
if that's me with very little knowledge

274
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,640
of the the language and i don't have a

275
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,880
you know computer programming background

276
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,320
someone that does have that kind of

277
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,839
knowledge what can they do with it you

278
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:57,279
know how

279
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:59,519
will it create something brand new for

280
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:02,480
them i'm not sure but it could speed up

281
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,320
their time to you know to actually

282
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,720
deploy uh ransomware in the first place

283
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,320
i think on the other side of that you

284
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,800
know think about defense um that's the

285
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,640
part that i'm really interested in is

286
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,880
i'm hoping that uh you know over time

287
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,200
like right now our anti-ransomware

288
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,040
checkpoint this is not a sales pitch but

289
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:22,079
it's true you know it's it's 99.7

290
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:25,760
like three percent effective or um

291
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,160
uh with like as far as the catch rate so

292
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,839
if it has the ability to be there like

293
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:31,040
we need to bump it up a little bit

294
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,800
further and we're going to continually

295
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,640
you know improve as we improve our

296
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,360
machine learning mod uh

297
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,240
models and uh feed it more quality data

298
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,000
i think over time that that will improve

299
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,600
but i don't know i think there's a lot

300
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,200
of cool like very interesting

301
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,800
applications that could come out of this

302
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,560
but um i think it's important that we

303
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,480
recognize that if we have the tools you

304
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,200
know the the mal actors do too

305
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,680
it's yep that that game of leap frog

306
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,360
that we've been doing for decades and

307
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,959
we'll keep doing in security in the

308
00:11:58,959 --> 00:11:59,920
future

309
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,760
hey it's job security for everyone on

310
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,560
here right so

311
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,880
not advocating for it i'm just saying

312
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:10,839
it's job security for us all

313
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:20,959
so

314
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:21,839
um

315
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:23,440
aaron thank you again for a really

316
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,000
interesting talk and a conversation and

317
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,440
we appreciate you being part of cactus

318
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,480
con this year

319
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,399
thank you hopefully uh maybe i'll even

320
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:32,720
be able to attend in person next year i

321
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:37,120
i would love that it would be the dream

322
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,279
well we're

323
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:40,639
got all our fingers crossed for that

324
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:42,800
next year as well great absolutely well

325
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,560
thanks so much aaron it's a wonderful

326
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,160
event you guys take care

327
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:49,880
thanks you too bye-bye

328
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:09,920
you
