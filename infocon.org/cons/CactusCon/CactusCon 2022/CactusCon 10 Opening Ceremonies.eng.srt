1
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:51,280
all right it looks as though i've been

2
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,840
getting the hand here so i think that

3
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,480
means it's uh time to start

4
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,719
and get get this conference going so

5
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:01,039
first off uh everybody

6
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:03,039
thank you for coming and welcome to

7
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:06,640
cactus con 10. so congratulations thanks

8
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:07,760
for being here

9
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:11,439
um this is uh obviously our 10th 10th

10
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:12,960
event of this so over a decade we

11
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,560
started this event

12
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,799
as just a way to kind of reach back out

13
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:18,479
to the community

14
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:22,000
we wanted something that

15
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,759
brought some of the best talented people

16
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:25,759
together in arizona to share what they

17
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:27,200
had been learning about the cyber

18
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,280
security industry and then help grow

19
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,360
that here in arizona

20
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,880
for the folks who don't know me my name

21
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,680
is andrew i am very clearly not ryan if

22
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:36,960
you know ryan

23
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,119
who unfortunately had a family incident

24
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:41,439
that required him to

25
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:43,520
not be here for this event so

26
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,560
kind of thoughts and prayers with him

27
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,479
i am one of the co-founders of cactus

28
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,960
con we created this event

29
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,280
literally after an owasp event where we

30
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,200
were drinking and had

31
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,560
no idea what we're getting ourselves

32
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,439
into

33
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:59,119
and decided that

34
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,439
arizona deserved a cool conference like

35
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:03,200
the stuff that we'd been going from from

36
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,880
b-sides and some of the things in the

37
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,040
earlier defcon days

38
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,878
um we were originally

39
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:11,360
besides phoenix we kept that name for

40
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,360
exactly one year and then we switched to

41
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,040
cactus con after that we've been cactus

42
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,879
con ever since for about the last nine

43
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:18,480
years now it's a little different

44
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,319
because if we switch some of the start

45
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:22,400
dates but this is our 10th event so

46
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,000
thank you very much for being here

47
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,840
as you can tell

48
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,400
this is this is our first sort of hybrid

49
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,680
event

50
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,760
it's a crazy time for everybody i'm

51
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,319
super aware that this is this is not

52
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:37,840
normal and i hope it's not the new

53
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,280
normal so

54
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,879
we were we were hoping things would be a

55
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:42,400
little different coming into the year

56
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,040
but then with omicron kind of hitting uh

57
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,720
we had to take some measures to figure

58
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,040
out how to put together a conference

59
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,440
that we felt represented that same

60
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,680
quality that we wanted to share the same

61
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,120
sort of approaches that we've had for

62
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,720
the last nine years

63
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,879
but to do it in a way that was safe you

64
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:01,200
know for everybody and so

65
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,440
having it as a hybrid event is is the

66
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,640
compromise

67
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,879
um and we're taking we're taking that

68
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:09,599
pretty pretty seriously across uh across

69
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:11,200
the board here

70
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,720
if you're online and you're checking

71
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,640
this out awesome we're excited to have

72
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,560
you it looks like from when i was just

73
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,280
online last there's about 300-ish people

74
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,840
kind of active online plus another 200

75
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,640
people

76
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,480
kind of in cahoots and so

77
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,480
what we're expecting this year is about

78
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,480
a halfway split actually between the

79
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,720
online presence and the the in-person

80
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,560
presence for folks coming

81
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,840
to do that

82
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,799
um

83
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:37,200
with the cactus con being a hybrid you

84
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,720
know for the folks who are here we had

85
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,720
to make some kind of concessions this

86
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,080
year if you will

87
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,640
some things that we were not able to do

88
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,040
our hardware badges

89
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,040
that was more of a chip shortage problem

90
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,280
in a supply chain issue we actually had

91
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,760
designs early which is exciting

92
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,360
but then all of the parts were going to

93
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,480
take over a year to get and so that that

94
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,640
kind of fell to the wayside so

95
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,319
some of us have this if you're really

96
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:04,000
super into badges and you want to see it

97
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,680
but this is actually the badge for next

98
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,000
year um it's pretty exciting that we're

99
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,439
already a year ahead on that and so

100
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:12,080
thank you to to eric and the team skyler

101
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,799
who helped put that together but we it

102
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:16,880
was more of a supply chain problem than

103
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,320
anything else

104
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,000
the second thing we weren't really able

105
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,199
to do this year was

106
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:25,600
have a cactus con kids event

107
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,360
just with the nature of kids and the

108
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,440
touching of all the things and then i

109
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,199
mean they're like a walking petri dish

110
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:32,800
most of the time so

111
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,400
we just felt that it was probably in

112
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,120
everybody's best interest to to not have

113
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:41,040
it this year for the purposes of safety

114
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,360
the last thing is of course vaccination

115
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,280
so you're all here you've been you've

116
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,919
been validated for that um

117
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:50,240
masks are kind of equal with it i hope

118
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,759
that we don't have to explain to people

119
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:53,600
how to wear masks

120
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,840
the only people that don't wear them

121
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,360
just so we're all on the same page as

122
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,960
the person speaking because otherwise

123
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,320
you really wouldn't be able to hear me

124
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,160
and we're kind of distanced enough

125
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,240
uh that that's okay um if you're

126
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,800
actively eating or drinking obviously it

127
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,720
would be very difficult to eat through

128
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,919
your mask

129
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:11,520
and then and then if they bother you and

130
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,280
you want to take a break like please

131
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,199
feel free to go outside and do so like

132
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:17,280
outside of the premise that's super cool

133
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,960
i can't tell you what to do outside of

134
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,400
the event so

135
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,000
that's where it is we are going to keep

136
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,680
an eye on it we are monitoring it so

137
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,680
please uh for the sake of our staff and

138
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,919
our volunteers just kind of be safe and

139
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:29,520
smart at this point i think everybody

140
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,160
knows what that looks like so

141
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,440
um

142
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,039
with that uh

143
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:37,600
you know my last bit is is just be kind

144
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,600
to each other again this is you know

145
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,080
crazy time so let's uh let's all work

146
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,520
kind of through that together and let's

147
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,600
make this let's make this good

148
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,039
um i want to obviously thank our

149
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:48,160
sponsors

150
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,520
this event is uh you know founded on the

151
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,600
idea of three pillars um the original

152
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,759
b-sides pillars which was vendor

153
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:56,960
neutrality

154
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,199
uh free event for everybody who wants to

155
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:01,680
attend and uh the highest quality talks

156
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,520
that we could provide and so we take

157
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,759
that really serious um we have a lot of

158
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:07,840
sponsors who really helped us out here

159
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,120
this year

160
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,000
some new event partners with booz allen

161
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,199
with new genesis and with sands and then

162
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:17,680
early warning has joined us again to

163
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,440
kind of take part early warning has been

164
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,880
a big part of what we're doing resell

165
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,560
has been a part of what we're doing for

166
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,639
almost the last nine years now in fact

167
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:26,319
they're one of the groups that helped us

168
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,800
create partnerships so these these

169
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,080
groups and the partners we take that

170
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,479
pretty serious these folks are

171
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:34,560
not just giving us sort of money if you

172

several of these sponsors have come back

186
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,160
year over year and i think that's

187
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,919

188
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:06,319
their faith in the conference and the

189
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:08,240
faith faith in you

190
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,720

191
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,840
village

192
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:12,639
and

193
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,319
when you have a conference like this and

194
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:15,599
people sponsor

195
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:18,080
one of the reasons they do so is is

196
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,599
obviously so everybody here knows them

197
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:22,240
but also to make connections uh within

198
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,080
the community you know some of the folks

199
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,160
here may be looking to get into cyber

200
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,759
security for the first time this might

201
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:29,919
be an industry that you're not

202
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:31,680
super familiar with but

203
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,039
having a career village gives you a

204
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:34,400
chance to sort of take a look at your

205
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,479
resume talk a little bit about the steps

206
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:37,840
that it takes depending on where you

207
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,080
want to go and get some feedback you

208
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,840
know and and learn about the people who

209
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,400
are hiring here in arizona so

210
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,720
please please do take some time to kind

211
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,639
of check that out this year

212
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:50,720
and going from that

213
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,560
in terms of talks in terms of how we've

214
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,879
got that broken up again it's a virtual

215
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,319
event so

216
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:59,520
track one and two are going to be uh

217
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,759
streamed outbound so we actually have

218
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:03,680
all the speakers here and for the folks

219
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,039
who are virtual you'll be able to see

220
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:07,599
those uh online and we did have some

221
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:08,720
speakers

222
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,479
changed to being virtual with the

223
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:12,080
pandemic and that makes obviously great

224
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,000
sense um and so there there's like a

225
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,479
hodgepodge of like some talks where in

226
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:18,000
track one you'll be here watching it on

227
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,080
a screen but for the most part the

228
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,520
speakers are here and we're streaming

229
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,000
that back out virtually um track three

230
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,759
works the opposite so if you want to see

231
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:27,919
a particular talk that's virtual only

232
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:29,840
we're actually streaming it into the

233
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,360
conference so you can kind of go in

234
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,679
there and you can check that out

235
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:34,958
for several of the talks we're going to

236
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:37,039
have a q a afterwards so if you have

237
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:39,519
questions you know please uh we

238
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,440
encourage audience participation and i

239
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,799
know those people who are presenting

240
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:43,599
love

241
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:44,800
love questions that's why they're here

242
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,720
to kind of share you know what they know

243
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,560
and then and then help help you all with

244
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,519
that so

245
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:50,720
um

246
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,120
i think that kind of manages uh the

247
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,360
talks and things of that sort

248
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,680
before we switch to the digital piece

249
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,440
there's any questions about that the

250
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,920
layout is is basically the same as the

251
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,680
last few years

252
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,000
we have a capture of the flag going on

253
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,240
in sort of our little annex building

254
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,240
there's one kind of across across the

255
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,680
parking lot if you've not been over

256
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,640
there

257
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,959
if you're here to see the dc 480 talks i

258
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:17,200
believe those are also in the same room

259
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,399
and uh they are are not recorded you

260
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:22,320
can't see them virtually you can not see

261
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,120
them

262
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,200
again ever unless you go to that talk

263
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,000
for that time and go see it um otherwise

264
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,080
you're you're out of luck so

265
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,839
um those are those are like more

266
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:34,000
sensitive kind of private talks if you

267
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,839
want to check those out we are running

268
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:38,000
them only today right it's today yep so

269
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,160
only only today if you're checking that

270
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:40,959
out

271
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:41,839
um

272
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:43,440
we have capture the flag i believe it's

273
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,519
both virtual and in person

274
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:47,040
barrett is here in the other room

275
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,480
running that it's in super awesome

276
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,680
capture the flag he ran the defcon red

277
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,959
teaming uh ctf last year and is very

278
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:56,480
active in that community so if you're

279
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,320
interested in that i'm i'm assuming

280
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,519
you're probably already over there

281
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:01,200
trying to get ready

282
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,519
but if if not i think it starts at 10

283
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:05,920
o'clock if my memory is correct is it

284
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:06,959
right

285
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:09,040
yeah we'll go with shrug that sounds

286
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,560
good

287
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,959
so um

288
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:14,320
those are those are the events we have a

289
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,160
bunch of new villages this year as well

290
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:19,120
so while we don't have heatsink here for

291
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,640
obvious reasons we have a lockpick

292
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,279
village and then we have

293
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:24,800
a ham radio village so if you're

294
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,200
interested in radio stuff that is also

295
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,560
here for the first time and we're

296
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,160
excited for that so you get to kind of

297
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,240
learn a little bit more about that space

298
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,839
if that's a piece of technology that

299
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:36,079
you're interested in that's that's going

300
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:37,279
on so

301
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:38,160
um

302
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,600
and then last but not least i will just

303
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,680
say we have a series of community

304
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,959
sponsors uh so every year we have we

305
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:46,640
have corporate sponsors

306
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,399
both at partnership level and sponsor

307
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:50,959
level but then but then we optionally if

308
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:53,279
you are interested in it give people the

309
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:54,720
chance to donate to keep this thing

310
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,959
going um this year we raised a little

311
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:58,800
bit over five thousand dollars just from

312
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,959
the community to kind of help keep the

313
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:03,040
the conference moving forward

314
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,600
all the money where nonprofit comes in

315
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,920
is spent on this event or in preparation

316
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,560
of next year's event nobody's on salary

317
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,880
nobody gets paid there's no there's no

318
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,440
nefarious dealings of funds in fact if

319
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,120
you're here at the closing ceremony we

320
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,519
will review and just kind of look at how

321
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:21,839
how that worked out and where the money

322
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:23,920
went and how we kind of have that going

323
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,079
so

324
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,560
if speaking of closing events we do

325
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,079
actually have some in-person items that

326
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:33,040
we want to raffle uh i believe an oscp

327
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,120
certification training from sans is one

328
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,399
of them

329
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:39,040
if you want to take part and earn some

330
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,640
of those in-person things you actually

331
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,480
have to be at the closing ceremony

332
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,079

334

356
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,040
remote people who are virtual to ask

357
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,680
questions in the q a discord channel uh

358
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,200
and then we have a volunteer in here who

359
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,320
will bring those questions up to the

360
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,480
podium so that it feels like a true

361
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,839
conference where people regardless if

interact with the speaker and do things

364
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:46,000

403
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,880
attendees there are two workshops that

404
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,720
are virtual only and we have a couple

405
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,639

407
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:08,240
virtual workshops will only be in

408
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,399
discord and will not be streamed in

409
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:12,160
i will say because of the limitations of

410
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,160
discord there is a cap on the number of

411
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,079
people who can attend these workshops in

412
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:18,399
the discord we will open those channels

413
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,320

414
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,839
workshops start uh we'll make an

415
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:23,440

418
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,399
and you can't get in i'm sorry uh that's

419
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:31,760
just the nature of discord and the way

420
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:32,959
we're doing the conference this year if

421
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:34,880

great team of volunteers both virtually

and in person

446
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:15,519
are there any questions from the room

447
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:17,120
about how we're doing any of the virtual

448
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,800
stuff this year

449
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,040
yes

450
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,440
yep the question was

451
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,480
since we're streaming on youtube will

452
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,519

453
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:29,600
conference and all of the videos will

454
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,720
stay up they're going to go live and

455
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:31,759
they're going to stay up there they're

456
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:33,759

457
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:34,959
reminding me one other thing i wanted to

458
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:37,680
say the links for each talk will be

459
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,240
announced in the announcements room in

460
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,600
discord you'll have the link that'll

461
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,199
take you right to the live stream and

462
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:45,199
after the event that link will still

463
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:47,120
